Numerous studies note there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism in children.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) has filed a lawsuit against the makers of Tylenol, an acetaminophen-based medication that the Trump administration has baselessly claimed is responsible for a rise in autism rates in the U.S. in recent years.

Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate next year, issued a press release alongside the lawsuit claiming that his litigation is in line with President Donald Trump's “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) initiative, which many critics have blasted for ignoring research and having a generally anti-science approach.

Paxton's lawsuit targets Johnson & Johnson, the company that used to own Tylenol, and Kenvue, the company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson in 2023 and currently owns the brand. The attorney general claims that the companies “betrayed America by profiting off of pain and pushing pills regardless of the risks.”

“These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,” Paxton said in a press release. 

Notably, the main evidence Paxton cites in his presser is the Trump administration's questionable statements about Tylenol in September. One analysis of the lawsuit noted that it echoes claims from plaintiffs in a previous federal lawsuit that was dismissed last year due to witnesses' assertions being deemed unreliable. 

Kenvue responded to Paxton's lawsuit by saying it is “deeply concerned by the perpetuation of misinformation on the safety of acetaminophen and the potential impact that could have on the health of American women and children,” adding that Paxton's action is “baseless.”

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has supported Trump's actions to relabel Tylenol and other products containing acetaminophen, has contradicted the president's claims that the drug is dangerous, noting that “a causal relationship” between acetaminophen and post-birth autism rates “has not been established.”

Although Paxton's lawsuit cites studies that suggest an association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism may exist, these studies do not conclude any causal links and call for more investigations into the matter. 

Approximately 1 in 31 children in the U.S. has autism, a stark rise from the rate seen in previous decades. Medical experts have said that higher rates are likely due to more effective screening processes and an expanded definition of autism.

Multiple studies suggest the connection between acetaminophen and autism is not a causal one. A recent analysis examining 46 separate studies, for example, advised against broad limitations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy, calling for a “balanced approach” for pregnant people to treat pain and fevers, and noting that leaving those symptoms untreated can lead to additional — and sometimes dangerous — complications. That analysis found an association in some studies but no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and post-birth autism and attention disorders. And a study released in Sweden this summer, examining 2.5 million children born between 1995 and 2019, found no correlation between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism in children.

Writing for Truthout earlier this month, public health researcher Lizzie Chadbourne excoriated the Trump administration for spreading misinformation regarding acetaminophen and autism in general. 

The comments from Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. offer “a microcosm through which to understand the Trump administration's larger public health agenda — a project fundamentally shaped by a patriarchal view of health and pregnancy, disregard for individuals' bodily autonomy, the pathologization of neurodiversity, traditional gender roles, the moralization of illness and disability, and distrust of science and medicine,” she wrote.

Chadbourne also described the administration's conclusions on acetaminophen as “sloppy” and based on “unsupported claims,” concluding:

Focusing on addressing structural factors, strengthening public assistance, and addressing environmental health and climate change would improve the health of everyone, especially autistic people. But these solutions don't align with the agenda of the Trump administration to sow distrust in institutions and cut social services.

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

USDA could continue funding food stamps during the shutdown by using an available contingency fund, Democrats said.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website features a new header message that informs users of the current shutdown and blames Democrats, immigrants and transgender people for prolonging the stalemate on funding the federal government — specifically the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), otherwise known as food stamps.

Several other government websites, which are managed by the executive branch, feature similar messages blaming Democrats. The USDA's site, however, is unique in that it includes disparaging language and misinformation regarding immigrants and trans people in its blame game tactics.

The message frames congressional Democrats as having “voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program.” However, Democratic lawmakers have encouraged the Trump administration to continue funding the program, which feeds millions of people with lower incomes, including children and those with disabilities, through emergency contingency funds, which the White House is refusing to do.

“Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” the USDA site reads.

USDA further states that Democrats are holding out “for healthcare for illegal aliens” — a misleading claim that Republicans have continuously pushed since the start of the shutdown that is false, given that undocumented immigrants are legally barred from enrolling in federally funded health programs — and “gender mutilation procedures” for transgender people, a derogatory way of describing some gender-affirming care procedures that some trans people (though certainly not all) may undergo.

The continued impasse will come at the detriment of “mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable” being unable to access SNAP benefits, the site's introductory message concludes.

Multiple government websites have included similar messaging seeking to fault Democrats, despite Republicans refusing to negotiate on any matter relating to reopening the government. Democrats are refusing to support a continuing resolution to fund the government with hopes that they can negotiate the restoration of at least some of the health care funding that was cut by President Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act earlier this year. 

Political experts have noted that the messages on these sites are likely in violation of the Hatch Act, a federal law that bars certain federal employees and government agencies from partisan activity. Several Hatch Act complaints have been filed against the administration for its use of such messaging — however, due to the shutdown itself, the workers within the Office of Special Counsel's Hatch Act unit have been furloughed, meaning that the complaints cannot be investigated at this time.

Democrats have also condemned the Trump administration for threatening to cut SNAP benefits during the shutdown, a move that could be avoided if USDA dips into $5 billion of contingency funds available for the program. A recent memo from USDA says it will not use those funds, claiming they are strictly for emergency situations such as natural disasters.

“Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people,” reads a letter sent to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins by all 214 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. 

Critics are also blasting the Trump administration's decision to use transphobic messaging on its websites. 

“It's a cynical weaponization of federal platforms — turning what should be a lifeline into propaganda aimed at stoking resentment against marginalized groups,” transgender journalist Erin Reed wrote in a recent report on the matter. 

Reed added:

It's one thing to scapegoat transgender people while out of power; it's another to keep doing so when your party controls every branch of government, and voters are watching their groceries — and their patience — run out.

In a statement sent directly to Truthout, Dylan Thomas Cotter, a transgender activist and author, decried the messaging as being “absolutely wild” and a “meritless accusation to make against an entire community.”

“It is my hope that the general public has begun to see through the nonsense and assess the facts as it relates to my beautiful community. … This administration and all that champion of it should be ashamed,” Cotter said.

Tyler Avalos allegedly posted a video with crosshairs over Bondi's face and a $45,000 reward for her death, FBI says

A man from Minnesota with a history of past convictions has been arrested and faces federal charges for allegedly using social media to threaten the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, by suggesting he would pay $45,000 for her death.

According to an FBI affidavit viewed by the Guardian, Tyler Maxon Avalos posted a TikTok video featuring a photo of Bondi with a “sniper scope red dot” on her forehead, with text reading: “WANTED: Pam Bondi. REWARD: 45,000. DEAD OR ALIVE (PREFERABLY DEAD).”

The caption on the post also reportedly read: “*cough cough* when they don't serve us then what?”.

The FBI said that it was alerted to the video around 9 October and traced the account to Avalos, a resident of St Paul, Minnesota.

The affidavit alleges that Avalos's TikTok username included a “symbol for anarchy” and that his TikTok page linked to an “anarchist FAQ book”.

The FBI also said Avalos had “a multi-state conviction history”, including a stalking conviction in Minnesota in 2022, a domestic battery conviction in Florida from 2016, and a domestic assault conviction in Minnesota that same year.

Court records show that the current charges in this case were filed on 16 October and Avalos made his initial court appearance the following day.

He was granted release from custody under several conditions, including GPS monitoring, a curfew, no travel outside Minnesota, no possession of a firearm or alcohol consumption, continued mental health treatment, and restrictions on his internet access.

The justice department said it had no comment on the case beyond the filing, and the US attorney's office for Minnesota did not respond to a request for comment.

Daniel Gerdts, the attorney representing Avalos, said in a statement that his client “is not guilty of any crime”.

“He has not yet been indicted, moreover, and our hope is that the grand jury rejects the frivolous charge,” he said.

Last week a man who was pardoned by Donald Trump for his conviction in the US Capitol attack was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries.

US says one person survived latest strikes, having killed 51 people in attacks on at least 13 vessels in recent weeks

US politics live – latest updates

The US military killed 14 people and left one survivor in more strikes on drug-trafficking boats in the eastern Pacific, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, said on Monday, as the Trump administration continued to expand its campaign beyond the Caribbean.

The latest strikes mean the US has now attacked at least 13 vessels and brought the officially acknowledged death toll to 51 people since the campaign began at the start of September.

Hegseth did not provide geographic details beyond saying that the strikes took place in the eastern Pacific, in international waters. Last week, the administration started targeting boats on the western side of the Americas after initially focusing on boats off the coast of Venezuela.

The four boats were hit on Sunday in three different strikes, Hegseth said in a social media post announcing the matter. His said the boats were “known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics”. He also acknowledged there was a survivor.

In perhaps an effort to avoid the legally thorny questions that could come with detaining that person, Hegseth said the US enlisted Mexico to take on search and rescue responsibilities – which Mexico accepted.

Hegseth sought to justify the attacks by comparing the US strikes against alleged drug traffickers to conducting strikes on al-Qaida targets during the global war on terror.

“The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. Now, we're defending our own. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. We will track them, we will network them, and then, we will hunt and kill them,” Hegseth said.

But the justification for the strikes has been widely disputed by legal experts. For one, when the US killed al-Qaida members, Congress had authorized the use of force. In targeting drug cartel members, the administration has relied on Trump's article II powers to defend the US against an imminent threat.

The latest boat strikes come as the US appears destined to start hitting land-based targets in the coming weeks, after the Pentagon sent its most advanced aircraft carrier and its strike group to the Caribbean — a major escalation in the Trump administration's stated war against drug cartels.

The move is expected bring the USS Gerald Ford, with its dozens of fighter jets, and its accompanying destroyers, to the coast of Venezuela by roughly the end of the week, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Sending the carrier strike group to the Caribbean is the clearest sign to date that the administration intends to dramatically expand the scope of its lethal military campaign from hitting small boats alleged to be carrying drugs bound for the US to targets on land.

The supercarrier has dozens of F-18 Super Hornet jets that increase the offensive firepower and ability for the US to hit air-defense systems in Venezuela. That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said.

Donald Trump also confirmed to reporters at the White House on 23 October that the next stage of the campaign was to hit targets on the ground. “The land is going to be next,” the president said. “The land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It's going to be much more dangerous. You'll be seeing that soon.”

Trump did not discuss which targets in which countries the US intended to strike. But he directed Hegseth, who was seated beside him at the White House event about curbing the flow of illegal drugs into the US, to notify Congress about the administration's plans.

Asked whether he would declare war against the cartels, Trump suggested he would continue with individual strikes. “I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” he said. “We're going to kill them, you know they're going to be, like, dead.”

Arrest of criminal justice council's Linsey LaMontagne comes as 277 people have died on Nevada roads in 2025

The director of a committee in Nevada tasked with solving criminal justice issues including aspects of DUI arrests now faces a charge of driving under the influence herself.

Linsey LaMontagne, the director of the Clark County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (CJCC), which covers the area encompassing Las Vegas, was arrested by a Nevada state police highway patrol trooper last April, the investigations team at the local TV news station KLAS revealed on Monday.

The CJCC describes itself as a body of police, judges and other community leaders that wants to provide “a voice for those [affected] by the criminal justice system, to include at-risk communities, families, and victims”.

However, KLAS reported that LaMontagne was arrested after another driver called police after spotting a swerving car swerving, including driving off the road approximately five times.

Documents obtained by 8 News Now said the trooper stopped LaMontagne, and she told him she was a county employee and “had two [shots] of Tito's vodka while downtown” at a casino.

LaMontagne was then arrested and told the trooper he had “ruined her life”.

LaMontagne later pleaded not guilty to DUI and reckless driving charges.

“The county is aware of the criminal charges against this employee; however, there is an adjudication process that needs to be completed prior to the county taking any adverse employment action, should that occur,” a county spokesperson told KLAS.

LaMontagne's arrest came as 277 people had died on Nevada roads in 2025 through September, mainly from impairment and speeding, according to information attributed to the state's traffic safety office.

Russia outnumbers Ukrainian troops eight-to-one in their offensive to capture the semi-surrounded city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 27. 

"(Russian troops) have devoted such forces to the Pokrovsk (sector) that Ukraine cannot devote to one direction (of the front) — one to eight people," Zelensky told journalists in a briefing, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported. 

"Imagine how many Russian forces are there. But at the same time, they have not achieved the planned result."

After capturing Avdiivka, a long-time Ukrainian stronghold located over 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk, in February 2024, Russian troops have gradually advanced toward Pokrovsk, once a key Ukrainian logistics hub tucked away in a relatively safe part of Donetsk Oblast. 

Russian troops have surrounded Pokrovsk from three sides, leaving about a 15-kilometer (about nine miles) gap for the Ukrainian military to bring in troops and supplies, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. 

All the bridges into Pokrovsk were blown up by the Russian military and the evacuation of the wounded is nearly an impossible task, Senior Leitenant Natalia Stoiko, the head of medical services in the 5th Heavy Mechanized Brigade deployed in the Pokrovsk sector, said at the "A Person in the Army" conference held in Kyiv in October. 

Stoiko said that the Ukrainian military lacks "everything," from engineering equipment to engineers themselves who could build temporary wooden bridges to allow evacuations. 

Western military experts who previously spoke to the Kyiv Independent said it would be crucial for Ukraine to withdraw timely when it stops tactically making sense for its troops to hold onto the city despite the crippled logistic routes. 

Despite lacking manpower, the Ukrainian military has repeatedly held onto cities that Russia was about to occupy, resulting in a chaotic last-minute withdrawal where the wounded were often left behind. 

Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source analytical organization Black Bird Group, said that his group believes that Ukraine should have withdrawn from Pokrovsk by around mid-Summer, especially after Russian forces approached towns such as Rodynske just north of the city. 

"The more time passes the more difficult will it will be for the Ukrainians to pull out," Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent. 

Paroinen assessed that it could be "weeks" till Russia occupies most of Pokrovsk, but the timeframe is difficult to predict because it depends on how long the Ukrainian military command would insist on holding onto it, and whether there would be Ukrainian counterattacks. 

"But in practical terms like the situation is that the Russians are really now pushing into Pokrovsk in force," Paroinen said, stressing that they are now starting to gain a like a substantial hold over the city. 

The weather factors likely have helped Russia to ramp up its advance in the Pokrovsk sector, according to the expert. He elaborated that the long heavy fogs days with suitable wind conditions that help provide coverage from drones have likely allowed Russian forces to use mechanized assaults and to push "more aggressively" into Pokrovsk with infantry. 

But Russia's eventual capture of Pokrovsk would not significantly impact the situation in other sectors of the front, since the Ukrainian military has had to stop using the city as a key logistic hub in late 2024 due to Russian troops' proximity to the city, according to Paroinen. Russia would, however, gain an important crossroad city that connects Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the west to the Ukrainian strongholds in the northern parts of Donetsk Oblast. 

The Ukrainian military admitted on Oct. 26 that Russia has accumulated about 200 servicemen in Pokrovsk, infiltrating small infantry groups, reporting shooting and drone battles in the city.

About 30 kilometers (19 miles) north of Pokrovsk, Ukraine has been launching counterattacks to take back the swathes of territories Russia penetrated through in an August breach near the town of Dobropillia. 

The Ukrainian military said on Oct. 26 that it liberated the villages of Kucheriv Yar and Sukhetske over the past 10 days. 

Zelensky said at the same briefing with journalists on Oct. 27 that Ukrainian troops have captured 2,200 Russian soldiers over the six months in 2025 in the east, including in the Pokrovsk and Dobropillia sectors. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify his claim.

She was also featured in the Media Development Foundation's “25 under 25: Young and Bold” 2023 list of emerging media makers in Ukraine. 



The incident occurred on Oct. 17 near Camp Reedo, which plays an important role in the rotation of U.S. forces stationed in Estonia.

Instead of being released, Loginova is being kept overnight at the Police Department No. 76 in St. Petersburg after a new case was opened against her for holding an "unauthorized" public event, according to independent Russian outlet Mediazona.



German newspaper Die Welt's chief reporter Ibrahim Naber and his team came under a Russian Lancet drone attack while working in eastern Ukraine on Oct. 13, injuring him and two other crew members. 

"Imagine how many Russian forces are there. But at the same time, they have not achieved the planned result," Zelensky told reporters on Oct. 27.

The arrest comes a week after law enforcement searched Volodymyr Kudrytskyi's home, a raid he believed had been orchestrated by his opponents to "send him a message." 



Attaching drone footage of the claimed attacks, HUR said in a Telegram post that its "Ghost" special forces unit "systematically" targeted Russian air defense systems.

Russian forces have used drones to hunt and displace civilians from their homes near the front line in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 27, citing a new UN inquiry presented to the General Assembly. 

Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil producers, announced Oct. 27 that it plans to sell its foreign assets after new U.S. sanctions targeted the company and its subsidiaries.



The pair allegedly gathered intelligence on Polish military personnel and infrastructure, including transport hubs used to supply Ukraine with foreign military aid. 

Seventeen children and teenagers were rescued from temporarily occupied territories as part of the president's Bring Kids Back UA initiative, Andriy Yermak said in a Telegram post on Oct. 7.

Russian missile attacks on Kyiv over the weekend destroyed the warehouse of one of Ukraine's largest pharmaceutical distributors and a production facility of a popular coffee chain, reportedly causing at least $100 million in damage and losses.

After two and a half months of intense fighting, the red rabbit-ear-looking shape on the battlefield map of Donetsk Oblast is gone for good.

With the liberation of two more villages, Sukhetske and Kucheriv Yar, announced by the Ukrainian military over the weekend, the operation to clear the major Russian breach of Ukrainian lines near the city of Dobropillia is all but over.

Compared to the dramatic alarm of mid-August, when hundreds of Russian troops pierced through a porous and chaotic defense and advanced over 15 kilometers beyond Ukrainian lines, Kyiv can now let out a final sigh of relief as the situation in the sector has been decisively stabilized.

But, despite efforts by President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian military leadership to portray it as one, this operation was not a successful counter-offensive, but rather a costly and high-stakes, rapid-reaction operation of the type often described in Ukraine as "fire-fighting."

Meanwhile, though they weren't able to dig in and advance further this time, the circumstances and conditions on the front line that allowed Russian forces to push so far, so quickly — despite the drone-saturated battlefield — raise major concerns for the viability of Ukraine's defensive fight going forward.

Now that the worst has been averted and the front line has leveled out, the deeper lessons about the so-called Dobropillia breakthrough can begin to be learned.

At this point, it's important to set the scene of the operation in the context of Russia's 2025 spring and summer campaign.

Having pushed Ukrainian troops out of Russia's Kursk Oblast for good, Moscow returned in spring 2025 to its immediate strategic aim in the full-scale war against Ukraine: to overrun the remainder of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast.

Two major Ukrainian cities stood in Russia's way, as they continue to do so now.

In the southwest of the region stands the fortress of Pokrovsk, which Russian forces had failed to outflank over the winter.

Further east lies Kostiantynivka, the southernmost city of the so-called "Kramatorsk agglomeration," a chain of four cities from Kostiantynivka through Druzhkivka, Kramatorsk, and Sloviansk, that remains the spine of Ukraine's defense of the region.

Over spring and summer, having failed in frontal assaults on both cities, Moscow concentrated forces to drive a great wedge right between the two, looking to outflank and compromise the defenses of both.

While the rest of the front line remained mostly static, here, sheer numbers, backed by the redeployment from Kursk Oblast of Russia's top drone units, particularly the notorious Rubicon, put immense pressure on the Ukrainian defense, which began giving ground.

By June, Russian forces had decisively crossed the highway between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and were increasingly tightening their grip on logistics routes into both Ukrainian cities.

But still, as the Ukrainian leadership is often mocked for saying, the situation was difficult, but under control.

Then came August and Dobropillia.

Over 2025, the ever-increasing domination of drones on both sides of the battlefield has meant that, despite Ukraine's chronic manpower shortage, particularly in the infantry, Russian forces have failed in almost all attempts to mass either vehicles or even infantry in large numbers for a breakthrough.

Albeit slowly, the Russian army has adapted to these changes, instead favoring infiltration tactics, sending infantry forward in groups of two or three, or sometimes alone, to seep between Ukrainian positions while relying mainly on stealth and concealment.

These new tactics have caused problems for Ukraine's defense all across the front line this year.

In Dobropillia, the art of infiltration was taken to the next level.

Perhaps the most important factor in Russia's initial success was its choice of where to make such a daring move.

With numerous ravines and tree lines running from north to south, the area immediately east of Dobropillia provided natural corridors of concealment where advancing Russian infantrymen could move up the battlefield through thick summer foliage, largely undetectable to Ukraine's dense network of reconnaissance drones.

Unlike most standard Russian small-group attacks, where the assault groups try to bypass Ukraine's kill zone of drones and overrun Ukrainian infantry lines, these Russian soldiers instead looked to bypass enemy positions and push deeper and deeper at every opportunity.

As commanders fighting in the area explained to me, Russian troops also showed a more deliberate, more sophisticated use of drones — both for resupplying their assault groups and for providing immediate tactical reconnaissance in the form of drone pilots attached to pairs of infantrymen.

This, of course, was all backed by overwhelming, debilitating Russian firepower, particularly the use of longer-range strike drones and fiber-optic FPVs to strangle Ukrainian logistics, as well as heavy glide bombs launched in their hundreds at Ukrainian positions in the area in the lead-up to the attack.

On top of that, Russia identified a weak point in the Ukrainian defense, where two usually competent but exhausted brigades of the National Guard struggled to coordinate combat operations among a disjointed mix of other assigned units.

These tactics, together with where they were directed at, are what allowed Russian forces not only to push several kilometers beyond the Ukrainian first line of defense, but to advance so much deeper.

Once the first Russian infiltration groups broke through, Ukraine's defenses were quickly thrown into disarray.

Not only were the infiltrating Russian infantrymen difficult to spot in the first place, but once spotted — often deep in a unit's rear — the situation was often not reported truthfully by commanders, neither higher up, nor to neighboring units, as commanders told me.

This problem of false reporting — one of the cornerstones of Ukraine's broader struggle with a Soviet-style working culture at all levels of command — came to a head on Aug. 11.

Relied upon by observers both inside Ukraine and abroad, the DeepState mapping project, led by a small Ukrainian team in close contact with commanders across the front line, saw that what they were hearing from the Dobropillia sector was vastly different from how events were being portrayed through official channels.

Feeling that the reality on the ground was not understood by Ukraine's own leadership — let alone by the public — DeepState moved quickly to draw what, while not a perfect representation of territory controlled, accurately showed the seriousness of the situation.

Two red prongs — those same infamous north-facing "rabbit ears" — appeared on the map, all the way up to the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz and the main road between Dobropillia and Kramatorsk, which had been used daily by Ukrainian logistics as little as a month earlier.

As is often the case, the Ukrainian military leadership, represented by the spokesperson of the Dnipro grouping of forces, downplayed the situation on live television, telling Ukrainians not to believe unofficial maps and claiming that the Dobropillia breakthrough was nothing more than isolated sabotage group activity.

In reality, though, the situation was dire.

If Russia were able to dig in to the area it had overrun, let alone further develop the salient, not only would Pokrovsk and Konstantynivka be outflanked, but Russian forces could approach the Kramatorsk agglomeration itself — not from the east, but from the "rear" in the west.

In turn, together with the new drone control of logistics routes that would come if such gains were consolidated, this could have meant a rapid decline in Ukraine's prospects of holding on to any of Donetsk Oblast.

With the breach occurring just as U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a showy and fruitless attempt to talk peace, a collapsing front line in Donetsk Oblast would have been the strongest possible card Moscow could take to any future negotiations.

For Kyiv, having fully realized the depth and scope of the Russian operation, this was a scenario that simply could not be allowed to happen, and the military leadership acted accordingly.

Elite Ukrainian units of all shapes and sizes — from the powerful 93rd Mechanized Brigade, boosted by a strong prisoner component, to brigades of the Air Assault Forces, Special Forces, and newly organized assault regiments — Kyiv threw almost everything it had available, and the kitchen sink, at the problem.

Commanding the response was the 1st Corps of Ukraine's National Guard, led by arguably the country's most respected military leader, Azov commander Denys Prokopenko.

Within the first few days of the response, tanks of the 93rd Brigade — jumping on a rare opportunity to deploy with less fear of enemy drone strikes — cleared the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz, while Air Assault units and the assault regiments ate away at the flanks of the salient.

By August 16, the General Staff reported 910 Russian soldiers killed in action in the area, while photos of those who had surrendered to Ukrainian forces emerged on social media.

In a couple of settlements, including Kucheriv Yar, Russian soldiers held out for months longer, but by then they had long been cut off from the Russian rear, without any hope of relief.

As the chapter of the Dobropillia breakthrough now looks to be finally brought to a close, the lessons are bittersweet for Ukraine.

On one hand, despite the manpower shortage and an almost complete lack of strategic reserves in the fourth year of Russia's full-scale war, Kyiv is clearly still able to throw serious weight around to respond to the most urgent crises on the front line.

But with no immediate end in sight to hostilities, and with Russian infiltration and drone tactics only improving, the story of Dobropillia is an advanced warning sign of the consequences of Ukraine's land forces being as overstretched as they are.

Since August, while Dobropillia has stabilized, Russian gains have picked up speed in almost every other key sector of the front line — from once-liberated Kupiansk and Lyman in the north to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in the south, and of course in Pokrovsk itself, where over the past week hundreds of Russian troops have broken into the city limits.

It remains to be seen if, when, and where the next Dobropillia-style breach could happen.

One small consolation for Ukraine is the arrival of winter, as the cold and the falling leaves should make pulling the same thing off difficult, perhaps impossible, for at least the next few months.

But come spring and summer 2026, Russia will almost certainly try to repeat and one-up its initial success in Dobropillia — and by then, will likely have more tactical tricks up its sleeve.

For Ukraine, the task is clear: to make sure that such a crisis does not become a larger collapse next time — they will have to be ready.

MOSCOW, October 28. /TASS/. Moscow is ready to discuss European security issues with the EU; Russia offers new opportunities for cooperation with ASEAN nations; and Russia-North Korea cooperation remains at a high pace. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Moscow is ready to welcome European officials to discuss security issues, a Foreign Ministry official told Izvestia. However, the West needs to change its confrontational approach. Meanwhile, some Western countries appear to share Russia's position. In particular, Hungary's foreign minister is expected to take part in the Minsk International Conference on Eurasian Security. Russia and Belarus plan to engage as many countries as possible in the development of a future Eurasian Charter of Diversity and Multipolarity in the 21st century.

Russia is ready to work together with Europe to build a system of Eurasian security, the Foreign Ministry's Ambassador-at-Large Alexander Trofimov told the newspaper. According to him, some European countries have shown an interest in the initiative.

One of them is Hungary. The Hungarian government supports the idea while the majority of Western countries think very differently, Hungarian political scientist Gabor Stier pointed out to Izvestia. He emphasized that it's impossible to ensure stability around Ukraine without building Eurasian security. Brussels believes that it is strengthening its security by confronting Moscow, yet in reality, Europe can stay safe only through dialogue with Russia.

Moscow and Minsk seek to encourage as many countries as possible to become part of the project. Earlier, Russia sent an invitation to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to join the future Eurasian Charter. Work is also underway to coordinate positions with China.

"We believe that the situation will inevitably change. It's not enough to say that a multipolar world is about to emerge. The task is to define certain propositions in the future world order. The Minsk meeting will undoubtedly be very important in this regard. The most crucial developments will take place behind the scenes, but the goal is to show alternative versions of the world order," said Nikolay Mezhevich, Valdai Discussion Club expert and head of the Center for Belarusian Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Europe.

 

Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states is one of Russia's foreign policy priorities, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told Izvestia. He is part of Russia's delegation to the organization's summit in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. Moscow can offer the countries of the region cooperation in the energy and food sectors. Meanwhile, the West may try to undermine any initiative, an informed source says.

The United States' tariff policy turned out to be one of the main issues on the agenda of the summit, set to last until October 28. The countries of the region seek to make agreements with Washington. Vietnam, in particular, has promised to reduce China's participation in its exports to the US, political scientist Viktor Pirozhenko pointed out. On the other hand, in his words, Chinese manufacturers know how to circumvent US restrictions. Still, Vietnam and other nations are interested in attracting capital not only from China and the US but also from Russia, the expert added. That said, the current international situation is opening new opportunities for Moscow.

Southeast Asia is becoming one of the most promising regions for Moscow and the Eurasian Economic Union following the collapse of trade ties with Europe. This is not accidental because the region, which has a population of over 650 million, is a major market for Russian goods.

The region is an important buyer of fertilizers and agricultural goods because Southeast Asian countries face certain food security issues. The Eurasian Economic Union and Russia can be key suppliers here, strengthening both food and energy security of these nations, Alexander Korolyov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, emphasized.

Russia is gradually abandoning the US dollar, turning to the Chinese yuan in trade not only with China but also with other Southeast Asian nations, Rudenko told Izvestia. What makes the yuan strong is China's expanding trade with many countries, said Nikolay Marchenko, director of the non-profit organization "Eurasian Youth Projects.” “China's rising investment activity in various parts of the world is another reason. Moreover, while Washington's position is radically changing, China's policy is stable and pragmatic, which is particularly important amid the current global turbulence,” the expert concluded.

 

The foreign ministers of Russia and North Korea, Sergey Lavrov and Choe Son Hui, have held talks in Moscow. North Korea's top diplomat was also received by President Vladimir Putin, who asked her to pass his greetings to her country's leader Kim Jong Un, Vedomosti reports.

Choe last visited Moscow in November 2024. After that, she held talks with Lavrov in the summer of 2025, when he made a trip to North Korea. The Russian foreign minister also met with Kim then, describing bilateral relations as an "unbreakable brotherhood," and saying that Moscow would take Pyongyang's interests into account when expanding relations with North Korea's neighbors.

In the summer of 2024, when Putin made a visit to Pyongyang, the two countries signed a treaty on comprehensive strategic partnership, which includes a clause on military assistance. Apart from ties in the field of defense and security, which culminated in Korean People's Army troops participating in the liberation of Russia's Kursk Region, the two countries are also increasing cultural, educational and economic relations, along with cooperation in agriculture and the energy sector.

When it comes to bilateral relations, Russia and North Korea don't factor in the events taking place in third countries, Ilya Dyachkov, associate professor with the Department of Oriental Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, believes. "We have our own agenda and work plans; we are developing bilateral ties in various areas, which have grown a lot in recent years," he pointed out.

In particular, the expert noted that apart from a delegation of the United Russia party, led by its leader Dmitry Medvedev, members of the A Just Russia party and the Communist Party of Russia had also visited North Korea in October to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the country's ruling Workers' Party. This comes as no surprise because allied relations between Russia and North Korea have reached a level where direct military assistance is provided, Dyachkov stressed.

 

Ukrainian Ambassador to Washington Olga Stefanishina has called on the US administration to link sanctions on Moscow with military assistance to Kiev. Recently, she also welcomed the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's approval of three anti-Russian bills, which particularly make it possible to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the US president will apparently focus on new sanctions against Russia's financial sector for now, while Congress will save the above-mentioned bills for later, said experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

"It seems US President Donald Trump intends to keep the negotiation process with Russia under his own control. He also expects to make his own decisions in order to increase pressure on Moscow. Still, the congressional bills will probably be saved for later as a sort of sanctions whip demonstrating that the US has the necessary initiatives planned, the next one worse than the last," Viktoria Zhuravlyova, head of the Center for North American Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Institute of World Economy and International Relations, pointed out.

Besides, according to her, there is much talk about expanding restrictions on Russia's financial sector, so such sanctions are likely to be introduced. Donald Trump has clearly entered a new stage where he is beginning to apply sanctions instruments, while until recently, he confined himself to verbal statements against Moscow.

As for the congressional bills, primarily the initiative to add Russia to the list of state sponsors of terrorism, Congress has been discussing it in one form or another since 2014.

"However, it's like possessing a nuclear bomb. Both we and the US have those yet we don't use them. Washington is also unlikely to use it until it decides that nothing matters anymore: after us, the deluge. Still, I hope this time will never come," the expert concluded.

 

The Russian ruble is currently at the peak of its vital energy. Just a few years ago, analysts included it in the top three worst developing currencies due to a sharp weakening, but this year, it has been recognized as the world's most successful currency with a prolonged period of strengthening, Nezavisiamya Gazeta writes.

According to the Russian Central Bank, the ruble has risen by about 20% against the US dollar since the beginning of the year. Economists attribute the current strengthening of the Russian currency to financial flows from exporters and geopolitical expectations.

Financial analyst Pavel Ryabov explains that the factors supporting the ruble include a change in the payment structure, a decline in demand for foreign currencies due to various risks and restrictions, difficulties with imports from unfriendly countries, and the strict monetary policy of the Central Bank.

However, there are also strong factors playing against the ruble. According to the expert, foreign capital flows to Russia have been blocked almost completely, major exporters have reduced foreign currency sales and inflation is increasing. Ryabov notes that the long-term balance is against the ruble, particularly in a situation where exports are unstable and the budget deficit is high.

"The current level of key rates is significantly lower than in the first half of 2025, which will likely contribute to the gradual weakening of the ruble. In the current baseline scenario, we expect the dollar exchange rate to reach 85-90 rubles by the end of the year," Natalya Vashchelyuk, senior analyst at the Pervaya asset management company, told Rossiyskaya Gazeta. Marina Nikishova, chief economist at Zenit Bank, expects that declining currency sales by the Central Bank will increase pressure on the ruble in 2026, along with a drop in export revenues stemming from a potential fall in oil prices.

            A plane crash killed 11 people, mostly foreign tourists, in Kenya's coastal region of Kwale early Tuesday while en route to the Maasai Mara National Reserve.
    


            The airline, Mombasa Air Safari, said in a statement eight Hungarian and two German passengers were onboard, and that the Kenyan pilot was also killed. The plane crashed in a hilly and forested area about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Diani airstrip, authorities said.
    


            The airline did not confirm what time the aircraft departed Diani airstrip, saying the pilot failed to communicate upon departure and the airport control tower tried to reach him for 30 minutes before the plane was located.
    


            Investigating agencies were looking into the cause of the crash that happened at 05:30 a.m. local time, Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told The Associated Press. There was heavy rain in coastal Kenya at the time.
    


            The aircraft burst into flames, leaving charred wreckage at the scene, officials said. Witnesses told the AP that they heard a loud bang, and upon arriving at the scene, they found unrecognizable human remains.
    


            The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority had earlier said that 12 people were onboard the Cessna Caravan-type aircraft.
    


            The Maasai Mara National Reserve is located west of the coastline and is a two-hour direct flight from Diani, a popular coastal town known for its sandy beaches. The reserve attracts a large number of tourists as it features the annual wildebeest migration from the Serengeti in Tanzania.
    


            The Kenyan coastline's white sand beaches along the Indian Ocean attract tourists from all over the world.
    


            According to the most recent safety oversight audit for Kenya posted on the International Civil Aviation Organization website, from 2018, the country fell below the global average in accident investigation.

Freddie Freeman cracked a solo shot in the 18th inning to help the Los Angeles Dodgers outlast the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 in a gruelling Game 3 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium.

In a marathon game that stretched nearly seven hours and also featured two Shohei Ohtani homers and an injury departure by George Springer, the Dodgers pulled ahead 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.

The Dodgers spilled onto the field as I Love L.A. roared over the speakers, long after many Jays fans back in Toronto probably fell asleep.

It tied Game 3 in 2018 – also at Dodger Stadium – for the longest in Fall Classic history.

“The Dodgers didn't win the World Series today; they won a game,” said Jays manager John Schneider. “These guys are going to be ready to go tomorrow.”

 

The Canadian Press

Meanwhile the Jays clubhouse was sombre afterward. 

“We grinded, battled our tails off, tired as hell,” said Toronto's Ernie Clement afterward. “They outlasted and made the big play...I expect us to come out firing tomorrow.”

Monday was a Dodgers party, as this World Series finally arrived in L.A., and inside one of baseball's oldest, most storied buildings. 

Country music star Brad Paisley played The Star Spangled Banner on his electric guitar. The stadium was spotted with celebrities from Jason Bateman to Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe and Magic Johnson.

George Springer removed from Game 3 of World Series with injury

When the game began, the Dodger faithful booed Springer mercilessly every time Toronto's leadoff man came to bat. He exited Monday's game after suffering an apparent back or side injury while swinging the bat, and they booed him then too.

“It's some right side discomfort. He already went for a MRI. We'll see how it comes back and see how he walks up tomorrow. But it sucks,” said Schneider. “He's obviously a huge part of our lineup … we'll see how he is tomorrow.”

Their own leadoff man though – Ohtani – got booming cheers as he repeatedly strolled to bat with the swinging horns of his familiar walkup song blaring, Michael Bublé's cover version of Feeling Good. He'd get on base a jaw-dropping nine times on the night. 

Ohtani and Teoscar Hernandez both slugged homers off Scherzer for an early Los Angeles lead. 

The Jays pulled ahead in a big fourth inning. Alejandro Kirk hit a three-run shot, and then Andrés Giménez poked a sacrifice fly to score Addison Barger.

Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow left in the fifth inning after allowing five hits, three walks and four runs – two earned – while punching out five batters.

With his start Monday, Max Scherzer appeared for a fourth team in the World Series. The 41-year-old lasted 4 1/3 innings, allowing five hits and three runs while fanning three and walking one. 

The Dodgers tied the game with two runs off RBIs in the fifth, a double from Ohtani and a single by Freeman.

The Jays roared ahead again in the seventh, as Bichette singled on a ground ball to score Guerrero.

Ohtani's second homer – his eighth of these playoffs – tied the game in the seventh inning. He became the first ever player with three multi-homer games in a single post-season. 

The curious romance of baseball on the radio endures against all odds

The Jays intentionally walked him the next four times he came to the plate.

The game went to extras. Having called in four pinch runners, the Jays had limited choices left to do that job, and some valuable bats – like Barger – were now gone from the lineup. Nathan Lukes doubled in the 10th and Davis Schneider was sent home, but he was called out in a close encounter at the plate.

The Jays loaded the bases in the 11th. The Dodgers called in veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, and he kept them from scoring.

The Dodgers loaded the bases in the 13th – via back-to-back intentional walks, and the Jays held them.

The game lasted so long, it had a second seventh-inning stretch in the 14th. The Jays used nine pitchers, including four scoreless innings by Eric Lauer in relief. Even the Game 4 starter, Shane Bieber, was starting to warm up.

The Jays didn't get men in scoring position again until the 18th inning. But they couldn't get one over the plate.	

As Freeman cracked the shot into centre field, the fans chanted his name as the Dodgers spilled out of the dugout to join him. The Jays disappeared into their dugout.

After all of that, Ohtani will start on the mound in Tuesday's Game 4. 

“He's spent. He was on base eight, nine times tonight, running the bases. He's elated,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts. “He's taking the mound tomorrow. He'll be ready.”

Russian forces have used drones to hunt and displace civilians from their homes near the front line in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 27, citing a new UN inquiry presented to the General Assembly. 

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine found that the coordinated drone assaults, carried out over more than a year, amount to the crime against humanity of forcible population transfer. 

Investigators said Russian troops intentionally targeted civilians and civilian structures across a 300-kilometer area spanning the Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, and Mykolaiv regions, forcing people to flee. 

The report drew on 226 interviews with victims, witnesses, aid workers, and local officials, as well as verified videos showing civilians being “hunted” by drones. 

UN investigators said the attacks also struck first responders, including ambulances and firefighters, despite clear humanitarian markings. 

Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians and refuses to cooperate with the UN commission, which has previously accused Russia of war crimes such as the deportation of Ukrainian children.

The incident occurred on Oct. 17 near Camp Reedo, which plays an important role in the rotation of U.S. forces stationed in Estonia.

Instead of being released, Loginova is being kept overnight at the Police Department No. 76 in St. Petersburg after a new case was opened against her for holding an "unauthorized" public event, according to independent Russian outlet Mediazona.



German newspaper Die Welt's chief reporter Ibrahim Naber and his team came under a Russian Lancet drone attack while working in eastern Ukraine on Oct. 13, injuring him and two other crew members. 

"Imagine how many Russian forces are there. But at the same time, they have not achieved the planned result," Zelensky told reporters on Oct. 27.

The arrest comes a week after law enforcement searched Volodymyr Kudrytskyi's home, a raid he believed had been orchestrated by his opponents to "send him a message." 



Attaching drone footage of the claimed attacks, HUR said in a Telegram post that its "Ghost" special forces unit "systematically" targeted Russian air defense systems.

Toronto Blue Jays' George Springer leaves the game with an injury during the seventh inning in Game 3 of the World Series.Brynn Anderson/The Associated Press

George Springer's status for Game 4 of the World Series is uncertain after he left Monday's game with an injury. 

Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider said Springer was sent for an MRI after he was removed from the game in the top of the seventh inning in Game 3 in obvious discomfort. 

“We'll see how it comes back and see how he wakes up tomorrow,” Schneider said following the Blue Jays 18-inning loss to the Dodgers. “But it sucks. He's obviously a huge part of our lineup. Glad I got him out when I did and hopefully it didn't make anything worse, but we'll see how he is tomorrow.”

Springer was pulled from the game after he appeared to injure his back following through on a swing.

With the scored tied at 4, Springer was leading off the top of the seventh inning when he took a cut at the first pitch he saw from Dodgers reliever Justin Wrobleski and fouled it off.

Blue Jays come out on wrong end of marathon World Series Game 3 loss

As he followed through, Springer winced and immediately walked toward the dugout as he called for a trainer. He was removed from the game and replaced by Ty France. 

Losing Springer would be a huge setback for the Blue Jays. He's their leadoff man and one their most dependable day-to-day players. Springer had an injury scare once already in these playoffs. In the ALCS against the Seattle Mariners, he took a pitch off the right knee and collapsed to the ground in pain. He came out of that game, but didn't miss any additional time, though Schneider has said Springer is playing banged up. 

Against Seattle, Mariners fans cheered as Springer was helped off the field. Against L.A., Dodgers fans did the same each time he came to the plate, and continued to do so as he walked toward the dugout nursing an injury. 

Fans have a dislike for Springer because he played on the 2017 Houston Astros team, which was found to have cheated by stealing signs from opposing teams. They beat the Dodgers in the final that year. Springer was named the World Series MVP.

Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica Tuesday afternoon as a catastrophic Category 5 storm with an estimated maximum sustained winds of 185 mph. It is one of the strongest Atlantic hurricanes in history and the strongest to lash the Caribbean island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago.

The storm landed in southwestern Jamaica near New Hope and is expected to exit around St. Ann parish in the north, forecasters said. The storm is expected to slice diagonally across the island, then head for Cuba.

Landslides, fallen trees and numerous power outages were reported ahead of Melissa's landfall, with officials in Jamaica cautioning that the cleanup and damage assessment would be slow.

“There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said Monday. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.”

What to know:








The U.S. State Department is telling citizens in the path of Hurricane Melissa to “depart ASAP if still possible.” It says they should prepare to shelter in place if they can't. 

Experts say Hurricane Melissa's 185 mph winds and 892 millibars of central pressure on landfall tied two different records for the strongest Atlantic storm upon hitting land.

The pressure measurement — the key one meteorologists use — ties with 1935's Labor Day hurricane in Florida. And the wind speed ties with that 1935 hurricane and 2019's Hurricane Dorian. That's according to hurricane scientists Philip Klotzbach of Colorado State University and Brian McNoldy of the University of Miami.

“It's been a remarkable just a beast of a storm,” Klotzbach tells The Associated Press.

Colin Bogle is a Mercy Corps adviser based near Kingston. He says most families are sheltering in place even though the government has ordered evacuations in flood-prone communities. He is sheltering with his grandmother in Portmore, where everything went dark earlier in the morning after a loud explosion.

“The noise is relentless,” he says. “People are anxious and just trying to hold on until the storm passes.”

United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric has told reporters that authorities in Cuba “plan to evacuate about half a million people to safer ground.” Melissa is expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday or early Wednesday. 

The U.N. says it is preparing humanitarian aid for Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti.

The National Hurricane Center says Melissa made landfall in southwestern Jamaica near New Hope and was moving north-northeast at 9 mph (15 kph). 

The hurricane was centered about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southeast of Negril, Jamaica, and about 145 miles (235 kilometers) southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba.

That's according to Jamaica's Meteorological Service and other experts.

Melissa is the strongest Atlantic hurricane to make landfall since Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Abaco Island in the Bahamas in 2019 with 185 mph winds. That's according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher.















Authorities in the eastern Cuban province of Holguín prepared to evacuate more than 200,000 people on Tuesday, in addition to a similar number moved to safety from the town of Banes.

Reports on social media and state television showed blue-and-white buses ferrying evacuees to shelter. Families clutched babies and belongings, and elderly people steadied themselves with canes as they disembarked.

“This phenomenon is very dangerous,” Deputy Prime Minister Eduardo Martínez said in a statement from Banes, where he was located in what appeared to be a shelter. “It is unprecedented,” he said of Hurricane Melissa.

“It's going to be a very dangerous scenario,” said Michael Brennan, director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami, warning that there would be “total building failures.”

Brennan said Jamaica's highest mountains could see wind gusts of up to 200 mph (321 kph). 

“It's just a catastrophic situation playing out here for Jamaica,” he said.

Brennan noted that Melissa would make landfall in eastern Cuba overnight Tuesday or early Wednesday.

“Jamaica, this is not the time to be brave,” said Desmond McKenzie, deputy chairman of Jamaica's Disaster Risk Management Council.

McKenzie said the government was prepared for potential rescues immediately after the storm.

“We have boats, helicopters, you name it,” he said.

They included a new reggae jam that referenced Melissa.

“Hold on, Jamaica!” the singer crooned as he gave a shout out to all those in the Caribbean affected by the storm, “our family in Cuba, our sisters in Haiti.”

In between songs, people called in and reported conditions in their neighborhoods, with one woman in western Jamaica saying it sounded like someone was knocking heavily on her door.

The U.N.'s International Organization for Migration said Tuesday it will dispatch solar lamps, blankets, indoor tents, generators and other items from its logistics hub in Barbados as soon as the storm crosses Jamaica.

“Many people are likely to be displaced from their homes and in urgent need of shelter and relief,” said Natasha Greaves, Interim Head of Office for IOM Jamaica.

Meanwhile, the nonprofit Direct Relief said it has two packages with enough medications to treat 3,000 people in one month staged in Panama and ready to deploy.

It also will send a shipment of 100 field medic packs from its warehouse in California as soon as the island's main airport reopens.

More than 130 shelters were open across the island, but by late Monday, fewer than 1,000 people had heeded evacuation orders.

One exception was the small community of Old Harbor, just west of Kingston. Some 200 people crowded in its shelter by late Monday.

“It's definitely more than last time,” said Jason Fuller, a firefighter and shelter volunteer, referring to the number of people that sought shelter from Hurricane Beryl last year.

The warming of the world's oceans caused by climate change helped double Hurricane Melissa's wind speed in less than 24 hours over the weekend, climate scientists said Monday.

Melissa is currently a Category 5 storm, the highest category. Melissa is forecast to make landfall in Jamaica on Tuesday before crossing Cuba and the Bahamas through Wednesday.

Scientists said this is the fourth storm in the Atlantic this year to undergo rapid intensification of its wind speed and power.

“That part of the Atlantic is extremely warm right now — around 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit), which is 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal,” said Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, in the United Kingdom. “And it's not just the surface. The deeper layers of the ocean are also unusually warm, providing a vast reservoir of energy for the storm.”

Deoras, who has tracked the impact of climate change on weather phenomena for decades, said scientists are seeing storms intensify quickly.

Anything in the backyard that isn't tied down, such as furniture and barbecue grills, should be secured or brought inside so it doesn't become a projectile that can come through a window, said Shawn Schulze, regional CEO for the American Red Cross Texas Gulf Coast Region.

If possible, board up windows and place important documents such as passports and birth certificates in a waterproof case or even a Ziploc bag, Schulze said. That will prevent damage and make documents easier to locate in a quick evacuation.

Some preparation needs to happen well before a storm is imminent. That includes trimming or removing dead or weakened tree limbs and shrubs that hang over homes to lessen potential damage from high winds, said Mistie Hinote, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Insurance.

Brian Mason, director of Houston's Office of Emergency Management, recommends that homeowners get their roofs inspected before each hurricane season and know how to turn off their utilities in case of damage.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned Monday that Hurricane Melissa could cause catastrophic flash flooding and numerous landslides in parts of Jamaica, Cuba and Hispaniola.

Earthquakes, heavy rain and changes to the soil, such as construction or agricultural practices, can trigger landslides.

Melissa's relatively slow movement, path over mountainous terrain and “tremendous” rainfall amounts up to 40 inches (102 centimeters) in certain localities are ingredients that are contributing to a “worrisome” landslide risk, said Brian Tang, a professor of atmospheric science at University at Albany.

“It's not like an urban area where it just kind of drains slowly. It really runs very quickly down the hillsides,” said Tang. The heavy rainfall can cause erosion, exacerbate a slope's weakness and result in a landslide.

According to Jamaica's Office of Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management, landslides are the most common natural hazard in the island nation. Hispaniola, which Haiti and the Dominican Republic share, and Cuba are also susceptible to landslides due to mountainous terrain and their locations in a seismically active zone.

Melissa was also expected to make landfall in eastern Cuba late Tuesday as a powerful hurricane.

A hurricane warning was in effect for Granma, Santiago de Cuba, Guantánamo and Holguin provinces, while a tropical storm warning was in effect for Las Tunas. Up to 20 inches (51 centimeters) of rain were forecast for parts of Cuba, along with a significant storm surge along the coast.

Cuban officials said Monday that they were evacuating more than 600,000 people from the region, including Santiago, the island's second-largest city.

Melissa has also drenched the southern regions of Haiti and the Dominican Republic, with a tropical storm warning still in effect for Haiti.

The hurricane was forecast to turn northeast after Cuba and strike the southeast Bahamas by Wednesday evening.

A hurricane warning was in effect for the southeastern and central Bahamas, and a tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.

On Tuesday morning, Melissa was centered about 55 miles (90 kilometers) south-southeast of Negril, Jamaica, and about 265 miles (430 kilometers) southwest of Guantánamo, Cuba. The system had maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 kph) and was moving north-northeast at 7 mph (11 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Colin Bogle, a Mercy Corps advisor based near Kingston, said most families are sheltering in place despite the government ordering evacuations in flood-prone communities.

Necephor Mghendi, the international Red Cross' regional head of delegation for the English- and Dutch-speaking Caribbean, said that an estimated 1.5 million people in the storm's path will be affected, but many others as well.

U.N. agencies and dozens of nonprofits had food, medicine and other essential supplies prepositioned as they awaited a distribution rush after the storm.

Matthew Samuda, Jamaica's water and environment minister, said he had more than 50 generators available to deploy after the storm, but warned people to set aside clean water and use it sparingly.

Hurricane Melissa was set to pummel Jamaica on Tuesday as a catastrophic Category 5 storm, the strongest to lash the island since recordkeeping began 174 years ago.

Hours before the storm, the Jamaican government said it had done all it could to prepare as it warned of catastrophic damage. The streets in the capital, Kingston, remained largely empty except for the lone stray dog crossing puddles and a handful of people walking briskly under tree branches waving in a stiff wind.

“There is no infrastructure in the region that can withstand a Category 5,” Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. “The question now is the speed of recovery. That's the challenge.”

The storm is expected to make landfall on Tuesday and slice diagonally across the island. Shortly after, it is expected to hit Cuba.

'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the media's continued 'obsession' over construction at the White House as President Donald Trump remodels the East Wing to accommodate the planned ballroom.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is facing criticism for claiming that the Trump administration's top priority is the $250 million construction of a new ballroom to replace the East Wing of the White House, as the government shutdown nears its first month.

On Monday, Walz announced a plan to provide $4 million in emergency funding to support food shelves while blaming President Donald Trump and Republicans for the ongoing shutdown. 

He cited comments made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

"They are choosing not to fund these programs … and when the White House press secretary said the top priority is the ballroom, we could not disagree more," Walz said.

However, Leavitt's remarks came when a reporter asked whether Trump was considering other renovations or major projects at the White House aside from the ballroom and Rose Garden patio.

"Not to my knowledge, no, but he's a builder at heart — clearly — and so his heart and his mind are always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds," Leavitt said. "But at this moment in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president's main priority."

The Republican National Committee said Walz was "shamelessly continuing Democrats' lie about Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt."

On Tuesday, Leavitt posted on X: "Stop lying, Tampon Tim."

Fox News Digital has reached out to Walz's office for comment.

Other Democrats have also accused Trump of prioritizing the ballroom rather than issues important to voters. 

"The Trump administration just declared that erecting a ballroom is the President's main priority," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., wrote on X in response to Leavitt's remarks. "Meanwhile. The cost of living is way too high and the Republican healthcare crisis threatens millions of Americans."

PolitiFact, a fact-checking website that rates the accuracy of claims by elected officials, noted that his statement was false.

The construction of a new formal ballroom has become a political lightning rod, despite the cost being financed jointly by Trump and private donors, not taxpayers.

The new ballroom will accommodate approximately 650 seated guests and will stay true to the White House's classical design, Leavitt said in July.

The ballroom project is totally unprecedented.

The White House's East Wing is gone. With its demise, President Donald Trump continues to rewrite history, including the traditions of how a US president can take a bulldozer to the “people's house.”

For Trump, the East Wing had to be demolished to make way for a 90,000-square foot ballroom to host foreign dignitaries and 999 guests. It's a massive $350 million project he said will be paid for by private donors.

The viral images of the demolition awakened intense emotions ranging from horror to celebration, and stirred questions of what this new White House means for everyday Americans.

“[There are] those that do see it representing prosperity; that certainly can be aspirational,” said Debbie Millman, designer and educator at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. “But that's not the status of most Americans.”

We spoke with Millman about Trump's legacy of destroying historical artifacts and enraging the public. It's a legacy that began with his father Fred Trump, and shares a throughline with the architectural visions of monarchs and dictators.

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What is your gut reaction to what you see happening at the White House right now?

Oh, my gut reaction is one of heartbreak. It's really sad to see what's happening, to see the demolition, to see this historic wing of the White House demolished. He's essentially done this on his own without any input or counsel from preservationists or historians. He's not gotten any, at all, to do something like this.

If you go to the White House website, they very craftily put up a historical list of other renovations that have occurred. But those were always done with the permission of historians, preservationists, architects that were quite open about what was being done, with blueprints and so forth. And so it's a little bit of a game of hide and seek here, where there seems to be an openness to what's being done. But it's really smoke and mirrors. There are no floor plans that have been shared. There's a couple of nondescript drawings that have been shared, but [they] don't in any way feature what's happening on the inside of the building more than just a footprint.

President Trump is not known for his restraint. Right? He likes things big, he likes them gold. He likes things that some people might call tacky or gaudy. 

If you look at what Americans are saying about this remodel, some people see those visual choices as representative of prosperity, as representative of success. Like one man's tacky is another man's “Hey, that's gorgeous.” Is there an argument here that the “people's house” should reflect the guy that the people elected, because that reflects us as well?

The answer to that is very much about what you believe to be true about representation. Those that do see it representing prosperity — that certainly can be aspirational, but that's not the status of most Americans. This is the “people's house.” It's not one person's house. And what Mr. Trump is doing is creating a castle or a palace.

President Trump has long treated architecture as his tool of identity, as has his father in 1966. [Fred Trump] tore down a 19th-century amusement park in Coney Island and promised that he would preserve some of the historical elements, but they didn't. Instead they threw a party at the demo site. Believe it or not, there were bikini-clad, hard-hat wearing models, and Fred Trump handed out bricks for people to throw at the glass front of the historic pavilion there, to dismantle and destroy it, as opposed to preserve it for historical purposes.

And then [Donald] Trump followed suit in 1980; he demolished the Bonwit Teller building on Fifth Avenue to be able to make way for Trump Tower, and he promised the limestone art deco reliefs to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but he destroyed them. And when asked about that later, he shrugged his shoulders and provided a sense of disdain for them as opposed to respect. This is not something that he hasn't done before. And it shows a lack of respect for history. It shows a lack of respect for preserving artifacts that have value and meaning to create something that is benefiting only really himself.

I don't know much about the history of the White House, but I have to assume that President Trump isn't the first president to kind of tinker with the place. I mean, these are generally men with big egos who see themselves as big leaders. What's been done in the past, and is what Trump is doing that much different?

Well, the new ballroom is estimated at 90,000 square feet. It is not the first intervention in the White House by a long shot. Thomas Jefferson expanded the grounds. He created gardens that reflected his ideals. Franklin Roosevelt relocated the Oval Office to the southeast corner of the West Wing, but at the time, the existing office was rather dark, rather cramped, and so he brought a lot of light and accessibility to the office. Harry Truman oversaw the reconstruction of the interior,

But a lot of that was because of what seemed to be imminent collapse of parts of the building that were so unsafe that there was really no other recourse but to do that. Of course, Jacqueline Kennedy — her restoration project in general emphasized historical continuity. She also obviously created the Rose Garden. She did a lot to the grounds, all of which had been demolished. [Editor's note: In July, Trump paved over the Rose Garden to create a tiled patio.]

So this is not the first destruction of pieces of the White House that Trump wants to remake as a zone for primarily celebratory or party reasons, as opposed to [for] reasons that reflect more safety or preservation or augmentation for the people, as opposed to [for] billionaire donors.

All right, so other presidents have changed the White House, but you're saying this sort of belies comparison. If there's no real comparison in the US, are there comparisons elsewhere, other world leaders who have done this sort of thing?

Oh my gosh, yes. Louis XIV's decision for the design of Versailles transformed what was a royal residence into a stage on which his reign would be essentially performed. And Benito Mussolini's marble piazzas sought to tie fascism to Rome's magnificence. And in the process, entire neighborhoods were demolished to create the boulevards of the Imperiali.

In Versailles and fascist Rome, architecture was created to extend the power of a leader by rewriting the meaning of the nation's most visible symbols. And essentially, that is what Trump is doing here. It's not a practical addition; it's a metaphor for the Trump brand overtaking the institution.

Now, there's no question that there will be value to a ballroom. The current ballroom holds, I think, about 250 people. When the White House has hosted bigger parties, they've had to erect tents on the grounds. And that was not always a feasible or comfortable situation. If it was raining, people had to walk on plastic. But that doesn't mean we need to have the over-the-top showpiece that does not reflect the soul of this country. The soul of this country is not gilded flourishes; it's just not.

You are an expert in your field. And President Trump has done this thing in America that's very interesting: He's cast a lot of doubt on experts in favor of regular people, ordinary folk. And I think what he might say is, “I was democratically elected by the ordinary folk. I have those regular people on my side, and if I choose to remake the White House in my image or the image of something else, that's what ordinary Americans voted for.” 

Madam Expert, what do you think about that argument?

Well, this is not a reflection of or for the people. The ballroom will rescript the White House as an extension of the Trump brand. And the fact that this has been funded by and hosted for billionaires in exchange for recognition of their own brands as part of this really refutes that statement.

In my opinion, one of the great tenets of a brand is: Can you remove the logo and still identify what it is? Do these iconic assets speak to you beyond the name of the brand? And the current building will be reshaped in the image of President Trump. It will be defined by over-the-top opulence — truly exaggerated and cumbersome scale. And it's a preference. It shows a preference for size over substance, and size over subtlety, and size over dignity. It will challenge the integrity of the existing architecture of the White House in ways we can't even envision yet. And I think it's converting what is considered to be, and has always been considered to be and described as, “the house of the people” into a stage for Trump's personal aggrandizement.

A veteran U.S. law enforcement agent secretly tried to recruit Nicolas Maduro's personal pilot to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into U.S. custody to face drug trafficking charges.

MIAMI (AP) — The federal agent had a daring pitch for Nicolás Maduro's chief pilot: All he had to do was surreptitiously divert the Venezuelan president's plane to a place where U.S. authorities could nab the strongman. 

In exchange, the agent told the pilot in a clandestine meeting, the aviator would be made a very rich man. 

The conversation was tense, and the pilot left noncommittal, though he provided the agent, Edwin Lopez, with his cell number — a sign he might be interested in helping the U.S. government.

Over the next 16 months, even after retiring from his government job in July, Lopez kept at it, chatting with the pilot over an encrypted messaging app. 

The untold, intrigue-filled saga of how Lopez tried to flip the pilot has all the elements of a Cold War spy thriller — luxury private jets, a secret meeting at an airport hangar, high-stakes diplomacy and the delicate wooing of a key Maduro lieutenant. There was even a final machination aimed at rattling the Venezuelan president about the pilot's true loyalties.

More broadly, the scheme reveals the extent — and often slapdash fashion — to which the U.S. has for years sought to topple Maduro, who it blames for destroying the oil-rich nation's democracy while providing a lifeline to drug traffickers, terrorist groups and communist-run Cuba.

Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has taken an even harder line. This summer, the president has deployed thousands of troops, attack helicopters and warships to the Caribbean to attack fishing boats suspected of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela. In 13 strikes, including a few in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. military has killed at least 57 people. 

This month, Trump authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions inside Venezuela, and the U.S. government has also doubled the bounty for Maduro's capture on federal narco-trafficking charges, a move that Lopez sought to leverage in a text message to the pilot. 




“I'm still waiting for your answer,” Lopez wrote the pilot on Aug. 7, attaching a link to a Justice Department press release announcing the reward had risen to $50 million. 

Details of the ultimately unsuccessful plan were drawn from interviews with three current and former U.S. officials, as well as one of Maduro's opponents. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were either not authorized to discuss the effort or feared retribution for disclosing it. The Associated Press also reviewed — and authenticated — text exchanges between Lopez and the pilot.

Attempts to locate the pilot, Venezuelan Gen. Bitner Villegas, were not successful. 

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the State Department did not comment. The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for comment. 

The plot was hatched when a tipster showed up at the U.S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic on April 24, 2024, when Joe Biden was president. The informant purported to have information about Maduro's planes, according to three of the officials familiar with the matter. 

Lopez, 50, was then an attaché at the embassy and agent for Homeland Security Investigations, a part of the Department of Homeland Security. 

A wiry former U.S. Army Ranger from Puerto Rico, Lopez was leading the agency's investigations into transnational criminal networks with a presence in the Caribbean, after a storied career taking down drug gangs, money launderers and fraudsters. His work dismantling an illicit money-changing operation in Miami even earned him a public rebuke in 2010 from Hugo Chávez, Maduro's predecessor. The embassy assignment was to be his last before retirement. 

The embassy was closed, although Lopez was still at his desk. He was handed a 3x5 index card with the tipster's name and phone number. When he called, the tipster claimed that two planes used by Maduro were in the Dominican Republic undergoing costly repairs.

Lopez was intrigued: He knew that any maintenance was most likely a criminal violation under U.S. law because it would've involved the purchase of American parts, prohibited by sanctions on Venezuela. The planes were also subject to seizure – for violating those same sanctions.

Locating the aircraft was easy – they were housed in La Isabela executive airport in Santo Domingo. Tracing them to Maduro would take federal investigators months. As they built that case, they learned that the Venezuelan president had dispatched five pilots to the island to retrieve the multimillion-dollar jets – a Dassault Falcon 2000EX and Dassault Falcon 900EX. 

Lopez had an epiphany, according to the current and former officials familiar with the operation: What if he could persuade the pilot to fly Maduro to a place where the U.S. could arrest him? 

Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on federal narco-terrorism charges accusing him of flooding the U.S. with cocaine. 

The DHS agent secured permission from his superiors and Dominican authorities to question the pilots, overcoming the officials' concerns about creating a diplomatic rift with Venezuela. 

At the airport hangar, a short distance from the jet, Lopez and fellow agents asked each pilot to join them individually in a small conference room. There was no agenda, the agents said. They just wanted to talk.

The agents pretended not to know that the pilots spent their time jetting around Maduro and other top officials. They spoke to each airman for about an hour, saving their biggest target for last: Villegas, who the agents had determined was Maduro's regular pilot. 

Villegas was a member of the elite presidential honor guard and colonel in the Venezuelan air force. A former Venezuelan official who regularly traveled with the president described him as friendly, reserved and trusted by Maduro. The planes he flew were used to shuttle Maduro across the globe –- often to U.S. adversaries like Iran, Cuba and Russia. In a December 2023 video posted online by Maduro, Villegas can be seen holding up a radio in the cockpit as the president trades patriotic slogans with the pilot of a Russian Sukhoi fighter jet.

Lopez called Villegas into the room, and they bantered for a while about celebrities the pilot had shuttled around, his military service and the types of jets he was licensed to fly, according to two of the people familiar with the operation. After about 15 minutes, the pilot began to grow tense, and his legs started to shake. 

The agent drilled in more sharply: Had the pilot ever flown Chávez or Maduro? Villegas at first tried to dodge the questions, but eventually admitted he had been a pilot for both leaders. Villegas showed the agents photos on his phone of him and the two presidents on various trips. He also provided details about Venezuelan military installations he had visited. Unbeknownst to Villegas, one of Lopez's colleagues recorded the conversation on a cell phone. 

As the conversation wrapped up, the two people said, Lopez made his pitch: In exchange for secretly ferrying Maduro into America's hands, the pilot would become very rich and beloved by millions of his compatriots. The rendezvous could be of the pilot's choosing: the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 

Villegas didn't tip his hand. Yet, before departing, he gave Lopez his cell number. 

Villegas and the other pilots returned to Venezuela without the aircraft, which they were told lacked the proper clearances. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. government was assembling a federal forfeiture case to seize the jets. It seized one, registered in the European microstate of San Marino to a shell company from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, in September 2024. 

It seized the other in February during the first overseas trip by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as the top U.S. diplomat. 

At a press conference at the airport in the Dominican Republic, Lopez briefed the secretary in front of the press. Lopez told Rubio that the plane contained a “ treasure trove of intelligence,” including the names of Venezuelan air force officers and detailed information about its movements. Lopez affixed a seizure warrant to the jet.

Maduro's government reacted angrily, releasing a statement that accused Rubio of “brazen theft.” 

As he assembled the forfeiture in concert with other federal agencies, Lopez focused on coaxing Villegas to join his plot. 

The task would not be easy. Maduro had made it exceedingly costly for anyone who turns against him. Since taking office in 2013, he has brutally repressed protests, leading to scores of arrests, while jailing even once-powerful allies suspected of disloyalty. 

Even so, Lopez plugged away. The pair texted on WhatsApp and Telegram about a dozen times. But the conversations seemed to go nowhere. 

In July, Lopez retired. But he couldn't let Villegas go. He sought guidance from the tight-knit community of exiled opposition leaders he got to know as a lawman. One described the former agent as obsessed with bringing Maduro to justice. 

“He felt he had an unfinished mission to complete,” said an exiled member of Maduro's opposition who spoke on the condition of anonymity over concerns about his safety. That commitment, he added, makes Lopez “more valuable to us than many of Maduro's biggest opponents inside Venezuela.”

After the August text about the $50 million reward, Lopez sent another saying there was “still time left to be Venezuela's hero and be on the right side of history.” But he did not hear back.

On Sept. 18, Lopez was watching the news of Trump's buildup in the Caribbean when he saw a post on X by an anonymous plane spotter who had closely tracked the comings and goings of Maduro's jetliners over the years, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. The user, @Arr3ch0, a play on Venezuelan slang for “furious,” posted a screenshot of a flight tracking map that showed a presidential Airbus making an odd loop after taking off from Caracas. 

“Where are you heading?” wrote Lopez, using a new number.

“Who is this?” responded Villegas, either not recognizing the number or feigning ignorance.

When Lopez pressed about what they discussed in the Dominican Republic, Villegas grew combative, calling Lopez a “coward.”

“We Venezuelans are cut from a different cloth,” Villegas wrote. “The last thing we are is traitors.” 

Lopez sent him a photo of them talking to each other on a red leather couch at the airplane hangar the previous year.

“Are you crazy?” Villegas replied. 

“A little…,” wrote Lopez.

Two hours later, Lopez tried one last time, mentioning Villegas' three children by name and a better future he said awaited them in the U.S. 

“The window for a decision is closing,” Lopez wrote, shortly before Villegas blocked his number. “Soon it will be too late.”

Realizing that Villegas wasn't going to join the plan, Lopez and others in the anti-Maduro movement decided to try to unnerve the Venezuelan leader, according to three of the people familiar with the operation. 

The day after the testy WhatsApp exchange between Lopez and Villegas, Marshall Billingslea – a close ally of Venezuela's opposition – took action. A former national security official in Republican administrations, Billingslea had for weeks been trolling Maduro. Now he brought Villegas into his cyberbullying.

“Feliz cumpleanos ‘General' Bitner!” he wrote in a mocking birthday wish on X the day Villegas turned 48.

Billingslea included side-by-side photographs that would be sure to raise eyebrows. One was the same one that Lopez had shared with Villegas the day before over WhatsApp, except the agent had been cropped out of it. The other was an official air force photo with a gold star denoting his new rank affixed to the shoulder epaulet.

The X post was published at 3:01 p.m. — a minute before another sanctioned Airbus that Maduro has been known to fly took off from Caracas' airport. Twenty minutes later, the plane unexpectedly returned to the airport. 

The birthday wish, seen by almost 3 million people, sent shockwaves across Venezuelan social media, as Maduro's opponents speculated the pilot had been ordered to return to face interrogation. Others wondered if he would be jailed. Nobody saw or heard from Villegas for days. Then, on Sept. 24, the pilot resurfaced, in an air force flight suit, on a widely followed TV show hosted by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. 

Cabello laughed off any suggestion that Venezuela's military could be bought. As he praised Villegas' loyalty, calling him an “unfailing, kick-ass patriot, ” the pilot stood by silently, raising a clenched fist in a display of his loyalty.

Microsoft founder Bill Gates appears to have pivoted on climate change, according to a memo he released on Tuesday. 

As one of the most influential people in the world, Gates is known as one of the leading figures on the Left who has warned for years about climate change, arguing it is necessary for the planet to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and create a zero-emissions economy to avert global disaster. 

However, Gates took a step back this week in a lengthy note posted to his website. 

“Climate change is a serious problem, but it will not be the end of civilization,” he wrote, after years of warning of the need for “miracles” to avoid planetary catastrophe. 

In his latest take on the climate debate, Gates suggested that “doomsday” activists have failed to take a holistic assessment of global warming. In their mission to avert human catastrophe, they have missed the root of the problem by advocating policies that have only further burdened impoverished countries and communities, instead of giving people the tools they need to escape poverty and thus evade the worst consequences of climate change, he argued. 

For example, Gates wrote, “If a pregnant woman is already malnourished and then has her food supply cut off because of a flood, she's even more likely to give birth prematurely, and her baby is more likely to start life underweight. But if she's well-nourished to begin with, she and her baby have a much better chance of staying healthy.”

“I'm not saying we should ignore temperature-related deaths because diseases are a bigger problem, “ he continued. 

“What I am saying is that we should deal with disease and extreme weather in proportion to the suffering they cause, and that we should go after the underlying conditions that leave people vulnerable to them. While we need to limit the number of extremely hot and cold days, we also need to make sure that fewer people live in poverty and poor health so that extreme weather isn't such a threat to them,” he said. 

His evaluation is in line with Energy Secretary Chris Wright's, who has said that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. However, he says climate change as an issue should not be prioritized over poverty and human health.

“Climate change is a real and global challenge that we should and can address,” Wright wrote in 2024. “However, representing it as the most urgent threat to humanity today displaces concerns about more pressing threats of malnutrition, access to clean water, air pollution, endemic diseases, and human rights, among others.”

Gates also warned against fixating on zero-emissions goals after previously arguing that it is imperative the world go from 51 billion tons of emissions to zero within the next 30 years to avoid catastrophe in his 2021 book How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. In the book, he warned that if the goal is not reached, “We won't be able to farm or go outside during the summer.”

“Wildfires, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S. — the droughts — will reduce productivity in the area dramatically,” Gates said during a Fox News interview about the book, going on to say that “the instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year.”

However, this week, Gates reframed the debate, warning against “focusing too much on near-term emissions goals.” 

“Although climate change will have serious consequences—particularly for people in the poorest countries—it will not lead to humanity's demise. People will be able to live and thrive in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. Emissions projections have gone down, and with the right policies and investments, innovation will allow us to drive emissions down much further,” he wrote. 

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it's diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” he added. 

Gates further urged world leaders set to next month's global climate summit in Brazil, known as COP30, to focus not so much on lowering emissions to address temperature changes and climate change, as working on “improving lives.”

“Although climate change will hurt poor people more than anyone else, for the vast majority of them, it will not be the only or even the biggest threat to their lives and welfare. The biggest problems are poverty and disease, just as they always have been,” he said. 

“Climate change is not the biggest threat to the lives and livelihoods of people in poor countries, and it won't be in the future.… Lower emissions will eventually lead to fewer devastating losses, but today's farmers don't have time to wait for the climate to stabilize. They need to raise their incomes and feed their families now,” he added. 

Gates' evolution of thought on the climate debate comes after his long history of seeking to lower temperatures, including by founding Breakthrough Energy with the goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. He has conducted similar efforts to combat climate change through his charitable organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 

In a 2021 blog post, the Microsoft founder said climate change could be worse than the COVID-19 pandemic that was ripping across the world at the time. 

“As awful as this pandemic is, climate change could be worse,” he wrote. “A global crisis has shocked the world. It is causing a tragic number of deaths, making people afraid to leave home, and leading to economic hardship not seen in many generations. Its effects are rippling across the world.… Obviously, I am talking about COVID-19. But in just a few decades, the same description will fit another global crisis: climate change.”

That post appears to have been deleted from Gates's website, alongside other posts such as a 2021 note on building a zero-emissions economy to avert a climate disaster. 

The month after he made the blog note, Gates rebutted criticism that he had “blown up” the climate crisis during an interview with the Washington Post. 

“I knew, as I traveled to Africa and saw that there were no lights at night and no power lines, that electrification is a necessary step in terms of economic growth, and so we had to somehow figure out a cheap way to get electricity into at least African cities. And I was hearing that there's this constraint when you build electric factories: You're not supposed to just use coal. Because, particularly in equatorial regions, towards late this century, the effect on subsistence farmers was going to be horrific. That is, there will be millions of deaths caused by climate [change] — and for exactly the people who caused it the least,” Gates said.

“And when I would meet with smart people who aren't full-time on climate, they would ask, ‘Come on, what about this climate thing? Isn't there some [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] guy who says the clouds will stop it? Aren't there still possibilities that it's all overblown?' And I'm saying no, and trying to succinctly explain why and what we have to change,” he added. 

This week, Gates pivoted, arguing that existential questions shouldn't center around the climate, but about creating opportunity for human flourishing that allows people to escape the immediate and looming consequences of climate change.

“Make a strategic pivot,” he urged ahead of the COP30 summit. “Prioritize the things that have the greatest impact on human welfare. It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life, no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into.” 

The change comes over a month after Gates's most recent visit to the White House, where he joined other major tech leaders for a dinner at the newly renovated Rose Garden. He discussed his vaccine-related work and sat next to first lady Melania Trump.

The Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted the Toronto Blue Jays with a 6-5, 18-inning win in Game 3 of the World Series on Monday night, producing a lengthy list of records topped by Shohei Ohtani as they took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven matchup. Ohtani was the Dodgers' designated hitter a day before he is to pitch in Game 4 and had one of the most memorable games at the plate in World Series history.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — The World Series Late Show was so good the Dodgers produced a sequel: The Late, Late Sho.

Seven years and one day after outlasting the Boston Red Sox over 18 innings in Game 3, Los Angeles did it again, beating the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 Monday night on Freddie Freeman's 18th-inning home run off Brendon Little to take a two games to one lead in the best-of-seven matchup.

Dodgers rookie reliever Justin Wrobleski, having gotten five outs in the sixth and seventh innings, was astonished at what he saw.

“I look up at the scoreboard and the innings that I pitch are no longer on the scoreboard,” he said. “That's probably the craziest thing.”

Shohei Ohtani, used to a dual life as a batter and pitcher, had what amounted to a double game at the plate. He homered twice and doubled twice in the first four-extra-base-hit Series game since Frank Isbell in 1906. 

He then walked five times, four of them intentionally — three times with no one on base. He tied the record of reaching base nine times. He even stayed in the game after being stricken by a leg cramp while he was caught stealing in the ninth inning.

“And he's got to pitch in like, I don't know, 12 hours, 13 hours,” Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw marveled.




A night to remember saw 609 pitches thrown over 6 hours, 39 minutes. Forty-four players appeared, including 19 pitchers. The Dodgers outhit the Blue Jays 16-15 in a game that included a 10-inning double shutout — no runs were scored from innings eight through 17. Los Angeles went 2 for 14 with runners in scoring position and stranded 18 runners, and Toronto was 2 for 12 RISP with 19 left on base.

“It takes everybody to win a World Series,” said the Dodgers' Max Muncy, who hit the winning 18th-inning homer against Nathan Eovaldi in 2018 — the only LA win in that Series.

In an array of defensive gems, right fielder Addison Barger cut down Freeman at the plate with a 98.5 mph missile, Toronto first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. threw out Teoscar Hernández at third with an 87.6 mph rocket, Dodgers second baseman Tommy Edman gunned down Isiah Kiner-Falefa from short right field and Hernández relayed to Edman to throw out Davis Schneider at the plate.

“Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy game,” Toronto starter Max Scherzer said.

Sandy Koufax, a three-time World Series champion two months shy of his 90th birthday, stayed until the end.

A three-time Cy Young Award winner who plans to retire after the Series, Kershaw came out of the bullpen with the bases loaded in the 12th inning to Fun's “We Are Young,” in what the 37-year-old left-hander thought was his first extra-innings outing at any level. Nathan Lukes fouled off Kershaw's second full-count pitch, a 91.9 mph offering that was his fastest since July 31, 2024, then grounded to second.

“I throw gas now,” Kershaw said, laughing.

Kershaw had “51” written on his cap like other Dodgers relievers in a tribute to Alex Vesia, who is missing the Series because of what the team said was a “deeply personal family matter.”

“I was warming up for like four innings,” Kershaw said. “That's bullpen life. I'm learning.”

Los Angeles set a Series record by using 10 pitchers. Rookie Will Klein got the win with 72 pitches over four scoreless innings, both double his previous big league highs. He stranded runners at second and third in the top of the 18th by striking out Tyler Heineman.

“There were times when you're starting to feel down and you feel your legs aren't there or your arm's not there, and you just got to be like, well, who else is going to come save me?” Klein said. “So I had to dig deep, do it myself.”

Game 1 starter Blake Snell had thrown a bullpen and was unavailable. Yoshinobu Yamamoto approached manager Dave Roberts and pitching coach Mark Prior volunteering to relieve, two days after throwing 105 pitches to win Game 2 in his second consecutive complete game. Yamamoto was warming up while Klein pitched the 18th.

“He was in the next inning,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “He would have gone as long as we needed. He would have been the last guy.”

Second baseman Miguel Rojas, who made four mop-up pitching appearances during the season, entered the game as a pinch hitter in the 13th and realized a few innings later he might be called on to pitch on 115 days' rest and become the first position player to take the mound in a World Series.

Rojas threw 120 big league pitches over the past three seasons and mentally readied his arsenal, which ranged from 36.6 mph to 69.8 mph during this year's outings.

“I was the only one who had done it before and feel like I had the best chance to kind of get outs if I needed to be out there for the boys,” he said. “I was thinking about actually pitching, trying to throw at least one fastball and one breaking ball.”

As each extra inning unfolded and platters of pineapple and watermelon were being passed in the dugout, Wrobleski kept leaving the bench for the clubhouse and joined Michael Conforto, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates, a trio of inactive teammates, in trying to will a victory.

“Maybe wardrobe change, maybe something to try and get us some runs,” Wrobleski said. 

“Well, I went sweatshirt and then I went no sweatshirt and then I went two different pairs or three different pairs of shoes. The third pair of shoes finally worked,” he said, proudly pointing out white Skechers.

Kershaw's kids have their own locker next to his in the Dodgers clubhouse, but as he spoke to reporters there was no sign of the four, who range in age from 3 to 10. Asked whether they saw the end of the game, he said: “At least two of them did.”

            In the final days of New York City's mayoral race, Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani has faced pushback over a story he told about his aunt being afraid to wear her hijab while riding the subway after the September 11, 2001, attacks.
    


            National Republicans including Vice President JD Vance mocked Mamdani's story, which the nominee told during a Friday speech criticizing his rival Andrew Cuomo for appearing to laugh along with a radio host who suggested Mamdani would cheer another 9/11.
    


            Accounts on X flagged a LinkedIn profile belonging to Mamdani's father's sister in which she is not wearing a head covering.
    


            Mamdani told reporters Monday that he was speaking about “Zehra fuhi, my father's cousin, who passed away a few years ago.” (Fuhi is a term in Urdu and Hindi that means paternal aunt. Mamdani was born in Uganda to parents of Indian origin.)
    


            That led to a New York Post headline referring to Mamdani's “aunt” in quotation marks – and sharp questioning during a Tuesday morning radio interview.
    


            “My question is, how can you, Zohran Mamdani, convince New Yorkers to go and vote for you when you just said you lied?” said Carlos Molina, one of the hosts on Latino radio station La Mega 97.9's “El Vacilón de la Mañana.”
    


            “It's not a lie,” Mamdani responded. “My father's cousin is my aunt. That is how I referred to her all my life.”
    


            The argument over what constitutes a family member underscored both the sensitivity of the 9/11 attacks in New York City 24 years on as well as how Mamdani has leaned into discussing his Muslim faith and upbringing during the campaign. The 34-year-old is vying to become the city's first South Asian and Muslim mayor.
    


            Mamdani has accused right-wing media and his opponents of trying to discredit his story instead of focusing on Cuomo's attacks on his faith and the suggestions that Mamdani would be soft on terrorism or crime.
    


            “It just shows the idea of a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and feeling uncomfortable after 9/11 is so foreign to the right wing in this city and this country that the only answer to them is that it must be a lie,” Mamdani said.
    


            Still, the hosts Tuesday morning weren't ready to back down.
    


            “The reason I am being so hard on you is because you're going to be the mayor of the biggest city in the United States and we need to know that our politicians that we are electing (are) truthful,” Molina said.
    


            Mamdani responded by saying he understood New Yorkers who read the New York Post, one of the city's daily newspapers that has long been critical of him, would be confused. He then ended the interaction by teasing Molina for pressing him about the type of mayor he would be even though the host doesn't live in New York and was not sitting in the studio to question him in person. Molina lives in Florida.
    


            “I don't even take this as you coming at me hard – these are the questions you should be asking, I understand if you're opening up the New York Post and this is what you read, many New Yorkers will say well how am I supposed to feel about it, so you're giving the opportunity to tell the truth and correct the record,” Mamdani said.
    


            “I'm trying to be a mayor so honest that you come back to New York City, my brother,” Mamdani said to laughs.

NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — A plane crash killed 11 people, mostly foreign tourists, in Kenya's coastal region of Kwale early Tuesday while they were en route to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in heavy rain.

The airline, Mombasa Air Safari, said in a statement that eight Hungarian and two German passengers were on board, and the Kenyan pilot was also killed. The plane crashed in a hilly, forested area about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the Diani airstrip, authorities said.




The airline did not confirm what time the aircraft departed Diani, saying the pilot failed to communicate upon departure and that the airport control tower tried to reach him for 30 minutes before the plane was located.

Investigating agencies were looking into the cause of the crash, Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told The Associated Press. Authorities initially said the crash happened at 5:30 a.m. but the transport minister in a statement gave the time as 8:35 a.m.

The aircraft burst into flames, leaving charred wreckage, officials said.

Witnesses told the AP they heard a loud bang and found unrecognizable human remains at the scene.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on social media that the foreign ministry had been in contact with Kenyan authorities.

“What a tragedy!” Orbán wrote. “Our sincere condolences to families of the Hungarians who died in the plane crash in Kenya.”




Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said on social media that the Hungarian victims were two families and an acquaintance, with two children among the dead. He said the Hungarian consul in Kenya was on the way to the scene.

The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority earlier said 12 people were on the Cessna Caravan-type aircraft. It did not give a reason for revising the number to 11.

The Mombasa Air Safari airline operates 13-passenger Cessnas to many tourist destinations.

The Maasai Mara National Reserve, in western Kenya, is a two-hour direct flight from Diani, a popular town on the Indian Ocean. One of Kenya's most visited areas, the reserve features an annual wildebeest migration from the Serengeti in Tanzania.

A Mombasa Air Safari plane crashed in the Maasai Mara in 2012, with four people killed.

According to the most recent safety oversight audit for Kenya posted on the International Civil Aviation Organization site, from 2018, Kenya's performance in the area of accident investigation fell below the global average.

MIAMI (AP) — A longtime U.S. law enforcement agent secretly tried to recruit Nicolas Maduro's pilot to join a plot to capture the Venezuelan leader and deliver him into U.S. custody to face drug trafficking charges. Details of the plot are emerging as the Trump administration exerts increasing pressure on Maduro. Trump has deployed a U.S. naval strike force to the Caribbean and doubled the bounty for Maduro's arrest to $50 million. 

The untold saga of how the agent tried to flip the pilot has all the elements of a Cold War spy thriller — luxury private jets, a secret meeting at an airport hangar, high-stakes diplomacy and the delicate wooing of a key Maduro lieutenant. There was even a final act of intrigue aimed at rattling the Venezuelan president about the pilot's true loyalties.

Here are some key takeaways from AP's story, which is based on interviews with three current and retired U.S. officials, as well as one of Maduro's opponents. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were either not authorized to discuss the effort or feared retribution for disclosing it. The Associated Press also reviewed — and authenticated — text exchanges between Lopez and the pilot. 




Homeland Security Investigations agent Edwin Lopez was serving as an attaché in the Dominican Republic when he learned that two private jets frequently used to transport Maduro had landed in the Caribbean nation for costly repairs. The planes were used to shuttle Maduro across the globe – often to countries hostile to the U.S. like Iran, Cuba and Russia. 

A delegation of Venezuelan Air Force personnel arrived to pick up the planes, so Lopez secured permission to talk to the airmen, according to the current and former officials.

In May 2024, at an executive airport in Santo Domingo, Lopez made his pitch to Maduro's pilot: In exchange for diverting the president's flight to a place where he could be nabbed by U.S. authorities, the aviator would become a very rich man and earn the adoration of millions of Venezuelans. The rendezvous could be of the pilot's choosing: the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico or the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, two of the people familiar with the plan said.

The pilot, Bitner Villegas, a member of the elite presidential honor guard, was noncommittal, though he gave Lopez his phone number. The two stayed in touch over an encrypted messaging app. Lopez, after retiring earlier this year, reached out again, according to three of the people. 

“I'm still waiting for your answer,” Lopez wrote the pilot on Aug. 7, attaching a link to a press release issued by the Justice Department announcing the reward for Maduro's arrest had risen to $50 million. Maduro had been indicted in 2020 on federal narco-terrorism charges accusing him of helping flood the U.S. with cocaine.

Lopez added a few days later: “There's still time left to be Venezuela's hero and be on the right side of history.”

The operation reveals the extent — and often slapdash fashion — to which the U.S. has for years sought to topple Maduro, who it blames for destroying the oil-rich nation's democracy while providing a haven for drug traffickers, terrorist groups and communist-run Cuba. 

Those efforts have gained momentum since President Donald Trump retook office. This summer, the president deployed thousands of troops, attack helicopters and warships to the Caribbean to attack fishing boats suspected of smuggling cocaine out of Venezuela.. In 13 strikes, including a few in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the U.S. military has killed at least 57 people. 

This month, Trump also authorized the CIA to conduct covert actions inside Venezuela. Earlier, he doubled to $50 million a reward for Maduro's capture to face narcoterrorism charges contained in a 2020 federal indictment accusing the Venezuelan strongman of leading a cartel of military officials accused of flooding the U.S. with cocaine.

When Villegas rebuffed Lopez's efforts, allies of Venezuela's opposition launched an online campaign to sow suspicion in Caracas about the pilot's loyalty. 

Marshall Billingslea – a former national security official in several Republican administrations — had for weeks been trolling Maduro. On the day Villegas turned 48, he posted on social media a mocking birthday message that included side-by-side photographs that would be sure to raise eyebrows. One was of Villegas on a red leather couch at the airplane hangar in the Dominican Republic where he spoke the previous year to Lopez, who was cropped out of the picture. The other was an official air force photo with a gold star denoting his new rank of general.

Billingslea's post was published at 3:01 p.m. — a minute before another sanctioned Airbus that Maduro has been known to fly took off from Caracas' airport. Twenty minutes later, the plane unexpectedly returned to the airport. 

The birthday wish, seen by almost 3 million people, sent shockwaves across Venezuelan social media, as Maduro's opponents speculated the pilot had been ordered to return to face interrogation. Others wondered if he would be jailed. Nobody saw or heard from Villegas for days. Then, on Sept. 24, the pilot resurfaced, in an air force flight suit, on a widely followed TV show hosted by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. 

Cabello laughed off any suggestion that Venezuela's military could be bought off. As he joked about Villegas' loyalty, calling him an “unfailing, kick-ass patriot, ” the pilot stood by silently, raising a clenched fist in a display of his loyalty.

EXCLUSIVE — Trumpworld allies are preparing to launch a targeted campaign against a Biden-era labor rule in hopes of boosting Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections.

The Washington Examiner reviewed a memo produced by veteran Trump campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio outlining a September survey of “1,000 voters nationally on the topic of labor unions, workers and unionization.”

Fabrizio found broad bipartisan support for union workers, collective bargaining, and expanded worker protections, even though union leadership registered mixed support: 29% favorable compared to 31% unfavorable. However, the poll registered overwhelming (+85) support among respondents for “requiring a secret ballot for union elections,” including 70% “strongly in support of this and high backing across party lines.”

Back in 2023, former President Joe Biden's National Labor Relations Board issued a rule granting unions significant leverage over employers while organizing, specifically undermining the importance of so-called secret ballot elections in the process. 

Only 22% of respondents in Fabrizio's poll supported the NLRB's 2023 rule “that allowed unions not to use secret ballots,” with 64% opposed. Fabrizio wrote that Republican Congressional candidates “would benefit significantly from supporting overturning this unpopular rule.”

“The initial generic ballot is a statistical dead heat, 44% Democrat – 43% Republican (D+1), but if the Republican candidate supported overturning the NLRB rule so workers could once again rely on secret ballots when voting to unionize, the Republican pulls into a 47% – 36% (R+11) lead, a 12-point shift,” the memo reads. “Among Swing voters, the Republican goes from 1-point ahead to 17-points.”

Fabrizio surveyed 1,000 registered voters nationally via cellphone, landlines, and SMS-to-Web between September 12 and 15, 2025. Respondents were regionally and demographically weighted with a margin of error of 3.1%.

Coalition to Protect American Workers, a conservative activist group launched by veteran Republican operative Marc Short after departing his post as former Vice President Mike Pence's chief of staff in 2021, commissioned the Fabrizio Ward poll. CPAW recently added Gene Hamilton as a senior adviser. Hamilton is also president of America First Legal, which he co-founded alongside President Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller following the president's first term in office.

“Americans back American workers—but they're done with union politics,” Hamilton told the Washington Examiner in a statement. “Restoring secret ballots, holding votes on time, and keeping dues focused on paychecks, not politics, is common sense and long overdue.”

People familiar told the Washington Examiner that CPAW will soon begin running a six-figure ad campaign, specifically targeting policymakers in digital and cable television formats, touting Trump's labor policies ahead of the midterm elections.

“There are good unions and bad unions. Good unions stand up for workers, for fairness, transparency, and better pay, but bad unions like the CWA and SEIU spend money from your paycheck on politics,” a narrator states in CPAW's ad. “They funnel the dues straight from your paycheck and put it into woke Democrat causes, like all of it. They know it's wrong. That's why they don't want your employer to tell you where your money really goes, but President Trump is putting a stop to it. Good unions fight for workers. Bad unions fight for woke Democrats.”

Still, the NLRB does not currently have a quorum, hampering the board's ability to propose new rules or roll back existing code. Trump announced two nominations to the board in July, but the Senate had only advanced one out of committee by the start of October when the government shut down.

In 2016, Trump was able to pull away a sizable number of union members in Rust Belt swing states — the so-called Obama-Trump voters — and placed an even greater emphasis on courting labor during his 2024 campaign against Biden, and later, former Vice President Kamala Harris. Though he did not secure as many union endorsements as the Biden-then-Harris ticket, Trump did convince the International Brotherhood of Teamsters not to make an endorsement, marking the first general election cycle in which the Teamsters did not endorse a Democratic presidential candidate since 1996.

Trump entered office promising that his tariff and economic policies would usher in an American manufacturing boom. However, the economy has actually bled nearly 50,000 manufacturing jobs since the president announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs in April.

“The president is committed to his policies because his policies are working,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Washington Examiner in September when asked about the job losses. “There have been a lot of people fearmongering about inflation in this room, but it just has not come to fruition on a monthly basis. CPI inflation has now come in at or below the market's expectation for six consecutive months.”

            The US military conducted strikes against four more boats in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday, killing 14 people on board the vessels, with one survivor, according to Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
    


            It marked the first time multiple strikes were conducted on the same day as part of the Trump administration's accelerating campaign against boats allegedly involved in drug trafficking. According to Hegseth, Mexican authorities have assumed responsibility for coordinating the search and rescue of the survivor.
    


            There were three strikes in the Pacific on Monday — with one hitting two boats at once — and bringing the number of known strikes carried out by the US military on alleged drug-smuggling vessels to 13 since the start of September. To date, those operations have destroyed 14 boats and killed 57 people — with three survivors.
    


            Last week, the US military conducted its first round of strikes in the eastern Pacific Ocean, which appeared to mark an expansion of the campaign as previous strikes had targeted boats in the Caribbean Sea.
    


            Earlier this month, a US strike against a vessel in the Caribbean also did not kill everyone on board. In that case, the US Navy initially detained two survivors, but the Trump administration quickly repatriated the two men back to their home countries of Ecuador and Colombia.
    


            The situation set up a dilemma because it was unclear what legal authority the US military would be able to cite to detain the survivors indefinitely.
    


            The president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, said during her daily news conference Tuesday that her government was informed about the Monday strike and about the potential survivor this morning. She added that the events occurred in international waters.
    


            Sheinbaum said she instructed the foreign minister, Juan Ramón de la Fuente, to meet with the US ambassador to Mexico, Ron Johnson, “and we will give them the information with the Navy secretariat about this survivor, if it is the case that there was indeed a survivor.”
    


            The Trump administration has produced a classified legal opinion seeking to justify lethal strikes against a secret and expansive list of cartels and suspected drug traffickers, CNN has reported.
    


            The opinion is significant, legal experts previously told CNN, because it treats drug traffickers as enemy combatants who can be summarily killed without any kind of judicial review.
    


            Hegseth said the boats targeted by the three latest strikes Monday were “being operated by a Designated Terrorist Organizations trafficking narcotics in the Eastern Pacific.”
    


            “The four vessels were known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth added.
    


            “Eight male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessels during the first strike. Four male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the second strike. Three male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the third strike, ” Hegseth wrote on X. “All strikes were in international waters with no U.S. forces harmed.”

Speaking to troops aboard the USS George Washington during a visit to Japan Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump hinted that the U.S. could send "more than the National Guard" into crime-plagued cities. 

New York City police have a man in custody in connection with a public transit slashing — and he's accused of two dozen more crimes, many of them violent — as President Donald Trump signals plans to step up his federal crackdown on blue-city crime.

Around 6:30 a.m. Saturday, a 37-year-old man suffered a cut on the left side of his face while sitting on a Q train car in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood, according to the NYPD.

On Tuesday morning, police announced the arrest of 27-year-old Brooklyn resident Odyssey Head on more than two dozen charges, including three of attempted murder.

The NYPD did not immediately release further details explaining the full list of allegations beyond Saturday's Q train assault.

Other charges include multiple counts of burglary, assault, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon. He faces trespassing and criminal mischief charges — and one count of arson.

FOX 5 New York reported that police were looking into a potential connection between the Q train slashing and two more that took place over the weekend, citing law enforcement sources.

Trump, speaking to American troops stationed in Japan Tuesday during a visit to the U.S. ally, said that he is considering stepping up his federal response to blue-city crime.

So far, his plans have involved sending the National Guard into problematic areas.

"We have cities that have trouble. We can't have cities that are troubled, and we're sending in our National Guard," Trump told an assembly of U.S. sailors and Japanese allies. 

"And if we need more than the National Guard, we'll send more than the National Guard, because we're going to have safe cities. We're not going to have people killed in our cities."

He condemned Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for failing to curb gun violence in Chicago, blasted South American drug traffickers and credited his aggressive policies for a drop in crime in Washington, D.C., where he first deployed the National Guard to assist local police earlier this year.

"Whether people like that or not, that's what we're doing," Trump said.

            As a federal appeals court mulls whether to reconsider its decision allowing President Donald Trump to federalize and send the Oregon National Guard to Portland, his administration on Monday made what local leaders fighting a deployment are casting as a remarkable admission:
    


            Part of its testimony justifying the need for troops was wrong.
    


            “We deeply regret these errors,” wrote Justice Department attorney Andrew M. Bernie in a letter to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals filed in the court record.
    


            The admission comes as the Trump administration faces a series of legal challenges in its efforts to deploy guard troops in Portland, Los Angeles and Chicago, Democratic-led cities where it has intensified immigration enforcement and crowd control tactics by federal agents.
    


            In Oregon, “115 (Federal Protective Service) officers have had to deploy to Portland” due to monthslong protests outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there, an official with that agency – which provides security to government-owned properties – said earlier this month in an affidavit in support of a troop deployment. 



            “The continued deployment of FPS officers in response to the immigration protests stretches an already thin force beyond what is safe and effective,” Regional Deputy Director Robert Cantu said in the affidavit. 



            Those 115 officers amounted to “nearly a quarter of the agency's entire FPS capacity,” Trump administration attorneys originally said.
    


            However, this “statement was incorrect,” Bernie acknowledged in the Monday letter, noting only about half that number were agents sent out to provide security.
    


            The admission calls into question a key part of the president's justification for deploying the guard: “FPS, which is the regular security force charged with protecting the (ICE) Building, is stretched to the point of collapse,” the Trump administration argued in its original court filing.
    


            A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision this month, stayed a restraining order by US District Court Judge Karin Immergut, who said it appeared Trump overstepped his authority with the guard call-up.
    


            Late last week, the appeals court temporarily suspended the panel's own decision while it decides whether to rehear the case “en banc,” with 11 judges considering it instead of three. That decision could come today.
    


            The conservative majority on the appeals panel in the Portland case criticized Immergut, a Trump appointee, for failing to take the administration's claims about Portland security needs – specifically, the numbers Cantu cited – at his word.
    


            “Our colleague in dissent and the district court cannot summarily dismiss Director Cantu's sworn and undisputed statements,” the majority wrote.
    


            Now, the Trump administration says many of the 115 agents cited by Cantu were effectively double counted, with some deployed more than once. The actual number of FPS agents sent to Portland was 86, and only 65 were “inspectors” whose primary job is providing security, Bernie's letter says.
    


            In her dissent, US Appeals Court Judge Susan Graber said she was unimpressed with Cantu's affidavit, considering it vague.
    


            “We do not know why the government chose not to file a declaration describing the relevant details,” the Clinton appointee wrote. “But it cannot submit an ambiguous assertion and then ask us to interpret that assertion in its favor.”
    


            Still, despite the erroneous filing, even the smaller number of agents shows “the surge of FPS personnel in response to violence and unrest is unsustainable” and Trump has justification to send in the National Guard, Bernie says in the Monday letter.
    


            “Although defendants regret any unintended ambiguity about the number of deployed FPS officers at any given time, there is no basis for concluding that any such ambiguity was the basis for the majority's decision,” the attorney wrote.
    


            The appeals court stay this month did not rely solely on the number of agents. “The statute … does not limit the facts and circumstances that the President may consider” in deciding whether ordinary agents cannot enforce federal law without military help, judges wrote.
    


            The Department of Justice only discovered the mistake after it was raised by attorneys for plaintiffs Oregon and Portland, Bernie's Monday letter says.
    


            The plaintiffs in their own letter to the court noted the numbers in Trump administration filings conflicted with each other, ultimately showing a maximum of 31 FPS officers in the field at any one time.
    


            “This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation's history and traditions,” Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield wrote.
    


            For now, a separate restraining order from Immergut prevents National Guard troops from any state from being deployed in Portland. Following a hearing last week on the federal request to end that restraining order, the judge has not yet made a decision.

DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin weighs in on members of the Democratic Party who are pushing for I.C.E. tracking apps and more on 'The Big Weekend Show.'

FIRST ON FOX: Republican Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana is calling on U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel to close "critical gaps" in crime reporting that he says obscures a "serious and growing problem with immigrant crime" in America, according to a letter that was obtained by Fox News Digital.

Banks suggested that a lack of immigration status reporting by local and state authorities has resulted in the amount of crime committed by illegal aliens being drastically underreported, according to the letter that was sent to Bondi and Patel on Tuesday.

As such, he urged the FBI and DOJ to encourage local and state law enforcement to collect arrestees' immigration status, national origin and ethnicity by reforming the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), in which most agencies participate.

Currently, the NIBRS only includes ethnicity as an optional element, and it does not require law enforcement to collect an arrestee's immigration status or national origin. 

Banks also pointed out that though the DOJ collects some aggregate statistics about the citizenship of state prison populations, it does not distinguish between noncitizens with legal status and illegal aliens. He said it also generally leaves out offenders in local jails, who make up approximately one-third of the inmate population.

Closing these gaps in reporting, Banks said, would be in line with President Donald Trump's April executive order, "Strengthening and Unleashing America's Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens," which directed the DOJ and appropriate federal agencies to "increase the investment in and collection, distribution, and uniformity of crime data across jurisdictions."

He pointed out that while the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Sentencing Commission track the national origin of federal offenders, local and state authorities, who respond and track the vast majority of crime happening across the country, largely do not track that information.

"The overwhelming majority of crime happens at the state and local level. Most violent crimes, most property crimes, and many drug offenses fall under local jurisdiction," he went on, adding that "the responsibility for reporting the citizenship status of offenders falls largely on states and localities—but they generally do not track this data," he wrote.

Banks wrote that "even though many individuals entering the country have a violent past, critical gaps in crime data reporting keep the American people from understanding when and how often these individuals and other aliens commit crimes once they are here."

He pointed to a 2018 study by the Center of Immigration Studies that found that between 2011 and 2016, 21% of those convicted of non-immigration crimes were noncitizens, which is 2.5 times their share of the population. Drawing from data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the study found that of those convicted of federal crimes between 2011 and 2016, 44.2% were not U.S. citizens, and 21.4% of immigration crimes were excluded. According to the study, noncitizens at the time were only 8.4% of the adult population, with about 4% being illegal immigrants and about 4% being legal immigrants.

The study further found that despite being only 8.4% of the population at the time, immigrants accounted for 42.4% of kidnapping convictions, 31.5% of drug convictions and 22.9% of money laundering convictions.

"The United States has a serious and growing problem with immigrant crime. Of course, every person who enters the United States illegally commits a crime. But those who cross our borders are increasingly likely to threaten the lives and safety of American citizens," wrote Banks.

"Any crime committed by an illegal alien is one crime too many, but the American people and their elected representatives deserve to know how many of these crimes are happening, and to set immigration policy accordingly."

            Elon Musk's polarizing political actions since acquiring Twitter, later rebranded X, in 2022 dramatically hurt the automaker's U.S. sales, underscoring how deeply its fortunes are intertwined with the billionaire's persona.
    


            The findings quantify for the first time how the political actions of the world's wealthiest person – including his role in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration – may have cost Tesla billions in lost vehicle sales while benefiting rival electric carmakers.
    


            Tesla's U.S. sales would have been between 67% and 83% higher, or about 1 million to 1.26 million additional vehicles, from October 2022 to April 2025, had it not been for what researchers call the “Musk partisan effect,” according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research by Yale University economists.
    


            Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
    


            As Democratic-leaning buyers shifted away from Tesla, that effect also boosted the sales of competitors' electric and hybrid vehicles by roughly 17% to 22%, the study found.
    


Elon Musk said he needs $1 trillion to stop ‘corporate terrorists' from wresting control of Tesla



            The Yale University researchers linked the drop to Musk's increasingly partisan behavior, including his roughly $300 million in donations to Republican candidates as well as leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump.
    


            Musk's political stance has alienated environmentally-minded Democratic buyers – historically Tesla's strongest base – according to surveys cited in the report.
    


            Sentiment toward Tesla improved somewhat as Musk pivoted the company towards robotaxis, self-driving technology and robots in human form.
    


            Tesla board Chair Robyn Denholm said in an interview with CNBC on Monday that the outside perception of Musk spending time in the U.S. government had diminished.
    


            The NBER paper said Musk's actions also hampered California's progress toward its zero-emissions vehicle goals, concluding that the state would likely have met its 2026 targets “had it not been for the Musk partisan effect.”
    


            Registrations of Tesla cars in the state fell 9.4% in the third quarter, with its market share falling to 46.2% in the three-month period.

The Kansas City Chiefs beat the Las Vegas Raiders 31-0, and are now 4-1 since The Tackle That Turned The Tide. Nick Wright, Chris Broussard, and Kevin Wildes ask if the Chiefs are officially back. Plus, they discuss the Philadelphia Eagles beating...

The Washington Commanders' early turnover against the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday night was enough for NFL legend Peyton Manning to shriek during the game's "ManningCast."

Manning and every other NFL fan watching the game saw Marcus Mariota's pass to Deebo Samuel go off his intended target's facemask and into the hands of Chiefs defensive end Mike Danna for an opening-drive interception.

"Oh no, you're kidding me. Cannot happen!" Manning said as he put his head into his hands. "Another wide receiver screen. I like it. Get it out of your hand, hit Deebo. It went off his hands to his facemask, right to the defender. Gosh!

"He took his eye off of it.… Sick."

The Commanders kept the game close in the first half. The two teams were tied at seven apiece going into halftime. But the Chiefs broke the game open in the second half while the Commanders' offense failed to get anything together. Kansas City won the game 28-7.

"It was a tale of two halves," Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin said. "We kind of left some things on the field in the first half that we feel we could have executed. The defense did a great job of getting us the ball back twice. We've got to capitalize on that. The second half, they executed a lot better than us."

Mariota was 21-of-30 with 213 yards, a touchdown pass to McLaurin and two interceptions. He was also sacked twice.

"We came out well," Mariota said, "but when we're not converting our drives against this type of team, it's tough, because they'll get going. I thought our defense did a good job of holding them up, making plays, creating turnovers."

Republican Jennifer-Ruth Green, who's aiming to flip a longtime Democrat-held congressional seat in Indiana red, tells Fox News Digital "control of the House might just come down" to her race.

EXCLUSIVE: U.S. Air Force Academy graduate and Iraq War veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green says she's "ready to finish the mission" as she launches a second Republican congressional bid in northwest Indiana for a seat long held by Democrats.

"The stakes couldn't be higher," Green said in a campaign launch video shared first with Fox News Digital on Tuesday, as she jumped into the U.S. House race in Indiana's 1st Congressional District, which is represented by three-term Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan.

Green, who came within five points of defeating Mrvan in the 2022 midterm elections, says her rematch in Indiana could be crucial in deciding if the GOP keeps control of its fragile House majority next year.

"When we fire Frank Mrvan and take back northwest Indiana for the first time since 1928, Republicans will keep the House and stop radical Democrats from impeaching President Trump," Green emphasized in her video.

And in an interview with Fox News Digital, she added, "I firmly believe that the control of the House might just come down to Indiana's 1st Congressional District, and I want to be on the team to make sure we can have a credible agenda to support President Trump."

Green launched her campaign the day after Republican Gov. Mike Braun called state lawmakers back for a special legislative session to redraw the GOP-dominated state's congressional districts.

It's part of a broad Republican effort orchestrated by President Donald Trump and his political team to pad the GOP House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats. Democrats need a pickup of just three seats to win back control of the House.

FIVE KEY RACES TO WATCH IN THE 2025 ELECTIONS

Trump is aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House, when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections. Democrats, fighting back, aim to blunt the GOP effort by pushing redistricting in blue-leaning states.

Republicans currently control seven of Indiana's nine congressional districts, and any new map passed by the state's GOP super majority in the legislature would likely shift the 1st Congressional District from blue-leaning to a red-leaning seat.

"We believe Indiana's First District… will become much more Republican," a memo from the Green campaign states.

And Green, in her Fox News Digital interview, argued, "I am in support of redistricting. I really believe that it's time for us to fight fire with fire, and we've seen how Democrats around the country have taken this opportunity … in their states to gerrymander."

Green, following in the footsteps of her father and grandfather, joined the Air Force. A 2005 Air Force Academy graduate, she began her military career in aviation before transitioning to serve as a special agent with the Air Force Office of Special Investigations and deploying to Baghdad during the Iraq War.

She's currently a lieutenant colonel in the Indiana Air National Guard and "as Indiana's first secretary of public safety, I supported our first responders and helped the Trump administration remove dangerous illegal immigrants from our streets."

She also founded a faith-based nonprofit to "help at-risk youth through aerospace training."

Green, who outraised Mrvan in her 2022 campaign, is the only major Republican candidate to jump into the 2026 race. Pointing to her fundraising prowess, her campaign memo touts that Green "is the only candidate Republicans can put forward in this race to raise the money needed to win a hard-fought battle for this seat."

"When we fire Frank Mrvan and take back northwest Indiana for the first time since 1928, Republicans will keep the House," Green said in her campaign video.

And she pledged, if elected to Congress, to "stand shoulder to shoulder with our president to rebuild American manufacturing for middle class jobs, fight for bigger paychecks and lower prices, support our farmers and rural communities, secure the border and deport violent, illegal immigrants, back the blue, and defend the right to life and the Second Amendment."

Green, in her Fox News Digital interview, praised Trump, saying, "I believe that he's doing a great job. He is taking care of our country, leading it in the right direction."

Asked if she would like the president's help on the campaign trail, she said, "I look forward to bringing him out to northwest Indiana if he would come."

Decades of protection helped these sea creatures recover. So why are some scientists worried?

Scientists who study wildlife are often the bearers of bad news — this species or that is headed for extinction for the usual reasons, like deforestation or climate change. Just last week, for example, I wrote about new science showing that two valuable coral species in Florida were mostly killed off by global warming.

But earlier this month, researchers announced something overwhelmingly positive: Green sea turtles, the iconic marine species made famous by Finding Nemo that were once at risk of extinction, have bounced back. Dramatically.

According to researchers at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the leading authority on endangered species, the global population of green sea turtles — one of the seven sea turtle species found worldwide — is up 28 percent since the 1970s. IUCN reclassified the sea turtles from “endangered” to “least concern,” a category reserved for species that are not threatened with extinction and plentiful in the wild.

Scientists measure sea turtle populations by counting their nests on beaches. And in some regions, such as Florida, the number of them has surged in recent years. In the 1980s, for example, researchers detected only around 40 nests each year in and around Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge, a protected area along Florida's east coast. Now, they're consistently counting more than 20,000 of them, said Kate Mansfield, a professor at the University of Central Florida who runs the monitoring program. “The green turtles have just gone absolutely, wonderfully, exponentially higher,” Mansfield told me. “I'm cautiously optimistic.”

What's so remarkable about the recovery is that it shows conservation efforts can actually work, said Nicolas Pilcher, a sea turtle expert. These animals didn't recover by sheer chance, said Pilcher, who formerly co-chaired the group at IUCN that determines the status of marine turtles. Their population boom followed decades of projects to minimize threats, including by restricting certain kinds of fishing gear and turning nesting beaches into protected parks. “We can do this, we can save a species,” said Pilcher, who also runs a nonprofit in Malaysia called the Marine Research Foundation.

But there are a few glaring caveats with what is otherwise great news. For one, the recovery of green turtles is not even across the planet. At the largest nesting beach in the Western Hemisphere, located in Costa Rica, the number of green sea turtle nests is plummeting, indicating that these animals still face serious threats. Plus, sea turtles live long lives, in some cases reaching 70 or more years old. That means scientists need to see these trends sustained for years to come to truly show that greens have recovered, Mansfield said.

Until recently — and still today, in many places — the biggest threat to green sea turtles was the consumption of turtle meat. These iconic marine reptiles were actually a popular food in the US through the early 20th century, according to food writer and historian Becky Diamond.

“Since just one turtle could feed quite a crowd (some weighed over three hundred pounds), turtle soup was frequently the featured dish on inn menus and at large feasts or festivals,” Diamond wrote in 2018. “Demand for turtle was so high that hosts would advertise these upcoming events in the city's newspapers and sometimes even sell tickets in advance.”

But even as consumption of sea turtles waned in some countries — in part because the animals became rare and thus harder to find — other human actions continued to erode their population. Sea turtles would get caught in fishing nets, for example, and eventually drown. The construction of hotels, fancy homes, and other buildings along coastlines, meanwhile, destroyed nesting grounds and polluted them with artificial light. (Nighttime lights tend to disorient sea turtles and their hatchlings, making it harder for them to navigate and avoid danger.)

By the late 1900s, these threats had nearly wiped out green sea turtles, earning them federal protection in the US under the Endangered Species Act in 1978. A few years later, IUCN listed them as endangered globally.

Since then, however, the US government and a number of large conservation organizations — which tend to be especially focused on big, charismatic species — jumped into high gear to save green sea turtles. And their efforts apparently paid off.

There were three main conservation approaches that worked, experts told me, starting with simply protecting the beaches where green sea turtles nest. Florida's Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge is a good example. The federal government established the refuge in 1991, which limited human development along the coast and the light pollution that comes with it. That means sea turtles can use beaches in the refuge without much disturbance. Many other nesting beaches in the North Atlantic are similarly protected, Mansfield says.

Another effective approach has focused on the commercial fishing industry, especially in the US. Thousands of sea turtles are accidentally caught each year by trawls and other fishing nets that target seafood, such as shrimp. And while sea turtles can hold their breath for several hours, they still might drown if they can't escape. To solve this problem, scientists and fishermen developed modifications for trawl nets — known as turtle excluder devices — that give large marine animals a way out. At the same time, regulations in the US required that fishermen use circle hooks instead of J hooks for line fishing in some regions. Circle hooks are harder for turtles to fit in their mouths and swallow.

The third approach sought to limit turtle poaching for meat, still common in parts of Asia, Central America, and Africa. Often, the people who harvest turtles are simply trying to make a living. And so, what's worked to lower hunting in these communities, Pilcher says, is when organizations provide them with an alternative source of income. In Fiji, for example, people who once collected sea turtle eggs to eat or sell are now enlisted by a conservation NGO to protect them. “They go from being the people who are eating the turtles to the people who are conserving the turtles,” Pilcher said.

Not everyone was thrilled with the announcement that green sea turtles are no longer endangered. “I don't like it,” said Roldán Valverde, a sea turtle researcher at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

The takeaway that these species have recovered overshadows a much bleaker picture in one of his key research areas: Tortuguero, a national park along the northern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Tortuguero is the world's second-largest nesting beach for green sea turtles and the largest in the Western Hemisphere, he said, where researchers used to consistently count more than 100,000 nests each year. Since 2010, the turtle population has quickly declined, dipping below 50,000 nests in recent years.

The decline is linked to the harvest of sea turtles and their eggs elsewhere in Central America, especially in nearby Nicaragua, said Valverde, who is also the scientific director at a nonprofit called the Sea Turtle Conservancy. People have hunted green sea turtles in Nicaragua for generations, he said, but in the past, their fishing gear was more rustic: boats without motors, for example, and harpoons instead of nets. That meant they caught fewer animals. Now, equipped with more advanced gear, they're able to collect a larger number of sea turtles. And while harvesting turtles is illegal in most cases, officials don't adequately enforce the law. “The impact is significant and now beginning to show in Tortuguero,” Valverde said.

This is to say: Not all green turtles are doing well.

Neither are other kinds of sea turtles, for that matter. The six other species — from leatherback to hawksbill — are vulnerable to extinction or critically endangered. That raises an important question: Why haven't they recovered, too?

“That's something that keeps me up at night,” Mansfield told me, adding that the answer isn't clear.

Pilcher suspects it's partly luck. Many of the beaches that green sea turtles nest on happen to be in countries with stronger governance and more funding for conservation, like the US and Australia. Those places tend to afford more effective protection to wildlife.

“You go somewhere like Australia — places where the legal infrastructure is strong, robust, enforced — and those populations are massive and they have a massive impact on the overall survival of the species,” Pilcher said.

Certain sea turtle species, like the leatherback, also spend more time wandering out at sea, Pilcher said, which could leave them more exposed to fishing.

Regardless, this shows that the same threats that once nearly wiped out green sea turtles are still present today. And there are newer, complex threats, too, like plastic pollution. Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in the ocean each year — bags, bottles, food wrappers, etc. — which turtles sometime mistake for food or eat accidentally. Consuming plastic can kill them.

“Instead of chomping down on a squid or a crab, they're chomping down on a chunk of plastic,” Pilcher said. “We're finding many turtles that have dozens of pieces of plastic in them. That's probably going to emerge as a major challenge in the coming years.”

Conservation successes are tenuous. Animals can be relieved of one threat only to be driven towards extinction by another. By the early 20th century, for example, the North Atlantic right whale was nearly extinct from hunting. Yet now, long after people stopped killing them for their baleen and blubber, new threats, such as ship strikes and ropes from crab and lobster fishing, are jeopardizing their existence — a reminder that the job of protecting species is never really finished.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Eighteen innings in Game 3 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium again.

And this Hollywood rerun had a similar ending.

Freddie Freeman homered leading off the bottom of the 18th, Shohei Ohtani went deep twice during another record-setting performance and the Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted the Toronto Blue Jays 6-5 in an instant classic Monday night.

The defending champion Dodgers took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven matchup and still have a chance to win the title at home — something they haven't done since 1963.

“That could go down as one of the greatest games of all time,” manager Dave Roberts said.

Freeman drove left-hander Brendon Little's full-count sinker 406 feet to straightaway center field, finally ending a baseball marathon that lasted 6 hours, 39 minutes, and matched the longest by innings in postseason history.

“Oh gosh, just pure excitement,” he said. “That's as good as it gets.”

The only other World Series contest to go 18 innings was Game 3 at Dodger Stadium seven years ago. Freeman's current teammate, Max Muncy, won that one for Los Angeles with an 18th-inning homer against the Boston Red Sox in a game that took 7 hours, 20 minutes. 

It was Freeman's second World Series walk-off homer in two years. The star first baseman hit the first game-ending grand slam in Series history to win Game 1 in 10 innings last season against the New York Yankees.




“This one took a little longer,” Freeman said. “But this game was incredible. Our bullpen was absolutely incredible.” 

Will Klein, the last reliever left for the Dodgers, got the biggest win of his career. He allowed one hit over four shutout innings and threw 72 pitches — twice as many as his previous high in the majors.

“We weren't losing that game,” Klein said, “and so I had to keep going back out there.”

Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who threw 105 pitches Saturday at Toronto in his second consecutive complete game, was warming up in the bullpen as Klein worked out of trouble in the top of the 18th. 

“I don't know how I kept going, but I just knew every inning that I went out there, it was going to be another zero. If I had to keep going out, there were going to be more zeros,” Klein said. “I was sitting at home in Arizona last month, you know? This is crazy.”

A total of 19 pitchers — 10 for the Dodgers — combined to throw 609 pitches in a game that ended at 11:50 p.m. on the West Coast. Three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw came out of the LA bullpen to escape a bases-loaded jam in the 12th, pitching in extra innings for the first time in his illustrious career. 

“The Dodgers didn't win a World Series today,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider cautioned. “They won a game.”

As the hours crept by, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. munched on an apple at the dugout railing. A staffer brought a fruit tray onto the bench and the Toronto slugger helped himself to another piece.

“We tried. We did everything we could. They did the same thing,” Guerrero said through a translator. “But in the end, they came away with the victory.”

Most fans in the crowd of 52,654 who stuck around were on their feet throughout, including 89-year-old Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax, and only sat down between innings.

Will Smith flied out to the left-center fence leading off the bottom of the 14th. Long drives by Freeman and teammate Teoscar Hernández also died on the warning track in extra innings, with the temperature dropping in Chavez Ravine as the night grew late.

Ohtani's second solo homer tied it 5-all in the seventh. The two-way superstar, scheduled to start Game 4 on the mound Tuesday, also doubled twice and became the second player with four extra-base hits in a World Series game. Frank Isbell had four doubles for the Chicago White Sox in Game 5 against the Chicago Cubs in 1906.

After getting four hits in the first seven innings, Ohtani drew five consecutive walks — four intentional. That made him the first major leaguer in 83 years to reach base safely nine times in a game. Nobody else has done it even seven times in a postseason game.

“What matters the most is we won,” Ohtani said through a translator. “What matters the most is we flip the page and play the next game. ... I want to go to sleep as soon as possible so I can get ready.”

Dodgers rookie Roki Sasaki induced consecutive groundouts with two runners aboard to end the eighth. He stranded two runners in the ninth, too, after second baseman Tommy Edman made a terrific defensive play for the second out of the inning.

Edman also threw out a runner at home plate to end the 10th on a perfect relay from Hernández in right field, as pinch-runner Davis Schneider tried to score from first on a double by Nathan Lukes.

“Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy game,” Blue Jays starter Max Scherzer said.

With two outs in the Toronto seventh, Guerrero singled off reliever Blake Treinen and scored from first on Bo Bichette's sharp single down the right-field line for a 5-4 lead. 

The ball appeared to deflect off a television sound man along the low retaining wall in foul territory before caroming into shallow right field. Hernández's throw home was wide, and Guerrero narrowly beat Smith's tag by slapping the plate with his hand for a 5-4 lead.

Scherzer went 4 1/3 innings and became the first pitcher to appear in the World Series with four teams. His first Fall Classic came in 2012 with Detroit.

“We came out on the wrong side of this and it stings and it burns,” Scherzer said. “You want to win that game, but so proud of everybody's effort.”

Home runs by Hernández in the second and Ohtani in the third staked the Dodgers to a 2-0 lead.

Toronto rallied with four runs — two unearned because of Edman's error — to take a 4-2 lead in the fourth.

Alejandro Kirk hit a three-run homer off Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow and dashed excitedly through the Blue Jays dugout holding their home run jacket. Andrés Giménez added a sacrifice fly before Glasnow completed a 29-pitch inning.

Los Angeles tied it at 4 in the fifth.

Kiké Hernández singled leading off against Scherzer and scored on Ohtani's double to left-center off reliever Mason Fluharty. Ohtani came around on Freeman's single down the right-field line.

Toronto RHP Shane Bieber makes his first World Series start and fourth of this postseason in Game 4 on Tuesday. 

Ohtani hit three homers and struck out 10 batters over six-plus scoreless innings in Game 4 of the National League Championship Series against Milwaukee.

MSNBC host and podcaster Nicolle Wallace claimed "I don't think any Democrat" has directly compared German dictator Adolf Hitler and President Donald Trump.

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace said on Monday she doesn't believe any Democrat has compared President Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler.

As ICE continues to detain undocumented immigrants in major U.S. cities, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has openly likened their actions to those of Nazi enforcers during World War II. Pritzker, who is Jewish, emphasized that he does not make such comparisons lightly.

In an interview on Wallace's "The Best People," podcast, he mentioned his involvement in helping a Holocaust survivor establish a Holocaust museum. He explained that while he does not believe such a horrific event could recur in America, those who endured it can recognize echoes of authoritarianism emerging under Trump's leadership.

Wallace added that equating Trump to Hitler is "not a partisan analysis," recalling how current Vice President JD Vance once questioned whether Trump could be "America's Hitler." She praised Pritzker for articulating a thoughtful argument about the troubling historical similarities between Trump's America and Nazi Germany.

"You put sort of the intellectual architecture behind the parallels that involve all of us, and you've talked about — the first thing you said was ‘people being asked for their papers,' American citizens being asked to show up with papers, street vendors being asked to produce passports, rounding people up, and good people looking the other way, thinking ‘that's not about me.' You know, I'm a citizen. But who do they go after next?" she asked. "Talk a little bit about why that's so uncomfortable for so many people."

Pritzker pushed back somewhat, drawing a distinct line between drawing historical parallels in policy and comparing Trump to Hitler directly. "I'm not suggesting, I haven't suggested Donald Trump is Hitler," Pritzker said. 

"I don't think any democrat has," Wallace said. "And I actually think it's a smear that they project back onto critics. But JD Vance called Donald Trump ‘cultural heroin.' He called him ‘America's Hitler.' I mean, the attacks on Donald Trump as a fascist came from three generals who worked for him."

However, the record shows that many prominent Democrats, and Wallace herself, have drawn parallels between Trump and Hitler.

After Trump drew cheers from a crowd as he embraced the word "nationalist" during a 2018 event, she replied, "I watch enough History Channel to know that they cheered at Hitler, too."

Prominent Democratic politicians, for years, have been comparing Trump to Hitler.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton compared Trump to Hitler during an appearance on "The View" in November 2023 when she warned, "Hitler was duly elected. All of a sudden somebody with those tendencies, dictatorial, authoritarian tendencies, would be like ‘OK we're gonna shut this down, we're gonna throw these people in jail.' And they didn't usually telegraph that. Trump is telling us what he intends to do."

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, has called Trump "Temu Hitler" as a means of saying he is a cheap, low-quality imitation and a "wannabe Hitler." In the latter case, she doubled down on doing so even as the national conversation erupted over whether such comparisons spark violence, prompted by the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. 

Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., has been comparing Trump to Hitler for years, including his first term, when he said, "I can only equate one period of time with what we experience now, and that was what was going on in Germany around 1934, right after the 1932 elections when Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor."

While he went on to relent and said that Italian dictator Benito Mussolini might be a better comparison, he has continually compared Trump's presidency to Hitler, such as when he spoke to Fox News host Neil Cavuto.

"Are you envisioning another Hitler? Is that what you're saying?" Cavuto asked.

"That's exactly what I'm saying. I said the 1930s in Germany!" Clyburn retorted.

"Yes you did," said Cavuto.

Former Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke compared Trump to Hitler in 2019, essentially arguing that Trump's rhetoric about Mexicans is like something out of Nazi Germany. In 2023, he argued that for Trump, much like Hitler, simply being elected does not make a person any less of a dictator.

"I can only imagine the history books written 100 years from now looking at the people of 2025," O'Rourke said on California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast. "It's the way, you know, you and I when we were in school, we're looking at the people in Germany in 1933. That guy's named chancellor in January of that year. In 53 days, he has destroyed German democracy."

Liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore has drawn Hitler parallels as well, such as in his documentary Fahrenheit 11/9, where in one scene he plays audio of Trump speaking over Hitler rally footage.

"Hitler and Trump are not the same thing," Moore later commented. "But you are making a foolish mistake if you do not at least take a look at history and the patterns of history and how the manipulation of fear, the manipulation of the public works," Moore said. "I'm not a sky-is-falling person. I don't believe in conspiracy theories. But I am conscious enough to see what's going on. And anyone who's still thinking ‘it's not that bad,' ‘it's not going to get that bad,' it's time to wake up."

Former President Joe Biden spoke of "dark days" in the U.S., but also struck an optimistic tone regarding the future.

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., is demanding the Department of Justice (DOJ) conduct a "comprehensive" investigation into former President Joe Biden's autopen use.

The committee's GOP majority released a 100-page report on Tuesday morning detailing findings from its monthslong probe into Biden's White House, specifically whether his inner circle covered up signs of mental decline in the ex-president, and if that alleged cover-up extended to executive actions signed via autopen without Biden's full awareness.

"Faced with the cognitive decline of President Joe Biden, White House aides — at the direction of the inner circle — hid the truth about the former president's condition and fitness for office," the report said.

The report also detailed a "haphazard documentation process" for pardons made by Biden, which the committee argued left room for doubt over whether the former president made those decisions himself.

"In the absence of sufficient contemporaneous documentation indicating that cognitively deteriorating President Biden himself made a given executive decision, such decisions do not carry the force of law and should be considered void," the GOP report said.

"The Department of Justice should immediately conduct a review of all executive actions taken by President Biden between January 20, 2021, and January 19, 2025. Given the patterns and findings detailed herein, this review should focus particularly on all acts of clemency. However, it should also include all other types of executive actions."

In addition to concerns about who signed off on Biden's executive actions, Comer spent part of the report raising concerns about Hunter Biden's role in the pardon process.

Fox News Digital previously reported that ex-Biden chief of staff Jeff Zients told investigators that Hunter Biden was in the room for some pardon discussions — specifically the controversial preemptive pardons the ex-president gave to his relatives.

"It was towards the end," said a portion of Zients' transcript included in the report. "What comes to mind is the family discussions. But I don't know — that doesn't mean that was it. It was the pardons towards the end, very end of the administration. And I think it was a few meetings, not many meetings."

Comer's report said, "Zients testified that President Biden included his son, Hunter Biden, in the decision-making process for and meetings about pardons."

"This apparently included the meeting to discuss the pardons of five Biden family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci, General Mark Milley, and the members of Congress who served on the Select Subcommittee to Investigate the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol, and their staff," the report said.

A Biden spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Tuesday that the investigation was "baseless."

The Oversight Committee called a total of 14 witnesses across three months, mainly consisting of top Biden administration aides — including some who had known him for decades.

Despite nearly 47 hours of interviews and sworn depositions, however, Comer suggested he believed aides covered for Biden even in the committee room.

"Throughout the Committee's investigation, senior Biden White House aides presented a perspective of President Biden's cognitive health completely disconnected from that of the American public," the report said.

"Not one of the Committee's 14 witnesses was willing to admit that they ever had a concern about President Biden being in cognitive decline. In fact, numerous witnesses could not recall having a single conversation about President Biden's cognitive health with anyone inside or outside of the White House."

Comer spent a significant amount of time in the report criticizing former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor. O'Connor's sworn deposition was among the shortest sit-downs of the investigation, with the doctor having invoked the Fifth Amendment for all questions save for his name.

In a letter obtained by Fox News Digital alongside the report, Comer called for the D.C. Health Board of Medicine to investigate O'Connor — and potentially bar him from practicing medicine.

The GOP report called O'Connor's alleged decision to not conduct a cognitive exam with Biden during his four-year term "reckless" and accused him of making "grossly misleading medical assessments."

"His refusal to answer questions about the execution of his duties as physician to the president — combined with testimony indicating that Dr. O'Connor may have succumbed to political pressure from the inner circle, influencing his medical decisions and aiding in the cover-up — legitimizes the public's concerns that Dr. O'Connor was not forthright in carrying out his ultimate duties to the country," the report said.

"The Committee recommends that the District of Columbia Board of Medicine review the actions taken by Dr. O'Connor while serving as the White House physician to President Biden for any potential wrongdoing in the medical care of the former president –– including whether Dr. O'Connor produced false or misleading medical reports to the American people."

O'Connor's lawyers previously told Fox News Digital that he invoked the Fifth Amendment over concerns that the scope of the committee's probe could run afoul of doctor-patient confidentiality standards.

Biden's allies have repeatedly denounced Comer's probe as political and having no basis in reality. 

A Biden spokesperson pushed back hard on the report, telling Fox News Digital, "This investigation into baseless claims has confirmed what has been clear from the start: President Biden made the decisions of his presidency. There was no conspiracy, no cover-up, and no wrongdoing. Congressional Republicans should stop focusing on political retribution and instead work to end the government shutdown."

Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Digital, "Despite this sham investigation, every White House official testified President Biden fully executed his duties as President of the United States."

"The testimonies also make it clear the former President authorized every executive order, pardon, and use of the autopen. Oversight Democrats are committed to working towards a better future for the American people. Now it's time for Republicans to actually come back to work and reopen our government," Garcia said.

Multiple people who spoke with the committee have argued that concerns about Biden's mental acuity were made worse by the media and Republican pundits, particularly after his disastrous June 2024 debate against current President Donald Trump.

In an interview with The New York Times in July, Biden affirmed he "made every decision" on his own.

The House Oversight Committee released a sweeping report on Tuesday finding that senior aides to former President Joe Biden exercised presidential powers without his knowledge or consent, aiding in his signing of executive actions, directing policy, and managing his public appearances as his cognitive decline worsened.

The 90-page report, “The Biden Autopen Presidency: Decline, Delusion, and Deception in the White House,” accuses Biden's inner circle of running the government in his stead and concealing his medical deterioration through stage-managed appearances and manipulated decision processes. Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) said the findings raise “constitutional and criminal concerns” about the validity of executive actions taken between 2021 and the end of his term in office.

“Executive actions performed by Biden White House staff and signed by autopen are null and void,” Comer said in a statement. “Biden's aides misled the American people and hijacked the powers of the presidency.”

The committee says aides routinely used the presidential autopen, a mechanical signature device, to execute official actions without proof of Biden's approval. However, the problem became clear to the committee after it discovered that 32 of 51 clemency warrants were signed using digital copies of his signature, without any contemporaneous documentation linking Biden to the decisions, thereby leaving no evidence to show the president willingly agreed to sign those warrants.

A Jan. 19 episode detailed in the report describes a “game of telephone” in which chief of staff Jeff Zients authorized the autopen for a final batch of pardons, including for his son Hunter Biden and four other family members, as well as Anthony Fauci and Gen. Mark Milley, based only on secondhand accounts of a meeting he never attended. An aide emailed approval from Zients's account, initialed “JZ,” without confirming with Biden directly, according to the report.

The report further cites testimony that then-Staff Secretary Neera Tanden saw the president only “every six to eight weeks,” leaving little oversight of official signatures. Investigators concluded there was no proper chain of custody for decision memos and that even residence staff had access to presidential materials.

The report's authors say these lapses “compromised the constitutional chain of command” and call into question whether dozens of executive orders, pardons, and agency directives issued in Biden's name remain legally valid.

The report singles out former White House physician Kevin O'Connor, Biden's longtime doctor, noting that he had “business dealings with and financial connections to President Biden's family.” Investigators said those ties, combined with political incentives to keep Biden viable for reelection, created “a motive to conceal the president's decline while running the government in his stead.”

According to testimony cited in the report, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Anita Dunn opposed a cognitive exam despite public calls for one. Donilon allegedly stood to make up to $8 million in consulting bonuses tied to Biden's 2024 campaign, the report alleges, while Dunn told the committee the president's top advisers reached a consensus to avoid any medical testing that could damage his reelection prospects.

Former chief of staff Jeff Zients corroborated that consensus and later requested a full cognitive workup, but only after Biden's faltering debate performance against then-candidate Donald Trump in June 2024. O'Connor, Dunn, and Donilon each refused to answer certain questions under oath; O'Connor, Annie Tomasini, and Anthony Bernal all invoked the Fifth Amendment.

The report also echoes what became a common refrain against the former president: concern about his public appearance, which is highlighted as one of the reasons why concerns about Biden's cognitive decline became such a mainstream fascination. The report repeatedly describes a “meticulously stage-managed” presidency.

“These steps ranged from addressing President Biden's makeup, clothing, schedule, the number of steps President Biden could walk or climb, the amount of time President Biden needed to read and to spend with his family,” the report states. It also cites media reports that Hollywood producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg were enlisted to coach Biden on voice delivery and body language for the 2024 State of the Union and debate appearances.

Former communications aides described a system of pre-scripted press cards, controlled reporter questions, and constant teleprompter use, even at small events, to maintain an image of command. Meanwhile, donors privately expressed alarm at Biden's visible frailty, with one telling Zients the president's reliance on a teleprompter at a private fundraiser was concerning.

Comer has referred O'Connor, Tomasini, and Bernal to the Justice Department for further review and asked the D.C. Board of Medicine to examine O'Connor's conduct. He also urged a full DOJ audit of all executive actions taken during Biden's tenure to determine their legality.

Legal experts who spoke to the Washington Examiner said it could be an uphill battle to undo actions taken during Biden's first term, aside from reversing executive orders, many of which Trump did during his first week back in the Oval Office. Additionally, the president's ability to pardon and commute sentences for individuals has routinely been held as a sacred tradition, and no subsequent president has ever undone pardons or commutations by their predecessors.

Notably, the report did not directly address whether the DOJ should revise its guidance on handling executive actions through the autopen. A 2005 DOJ memo found that presidents can use the autopen for official documents, though it was previously rarely used by presidents until former President Barack Obama used it to sign legislation in 2011 while he was abroad on a trip.

Democrats on the panel released their own report that sought to dismiss the Republican-led report as partisan conjecture, saying the evidence does not show Biden's staff acted without authority. Biden himself has rejected claims that he was unaware of his administration's decisions, claiming earlier this year that he was deeply involved in the pardon process.

BIDEN'S CHIEF OF STAFF GAVE MOST DAMNING TESTIMONY YET IN AUTOPEN PROBE

“I made the decisions during my presidency — the pardons, the orders, the proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,” Biden said at the time.

The DOJ has not indicated whether it will act on the committee's referrals.

Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs as part of a broader effort to become leaner in an era shaped by AI.Employees in the US, Canada, and Europe have been receiving notifications about the cuts, according to internal Slack posts viewed by Business Insider.

A notification to affected workers, sent by Amazon's HR chief, Beth Galetti, and posted to Amazon's internal Slack, suggested that laid-off employees would receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days, plus a severance offer.

Galetti announced the cuts in a blog post on Tuesday, stating that despite the company's performance, it is reducing jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world.

According to internal Slack messages seen by Business Insider, some of the Amazon employees affected by the cuts work in advertising, recruitment, payments, devices, Fire TV, and customer behavior analytics.Amazon's mass job cuts extend to its audiobook and podcast division, Audible. CEO Bob Carrigan told employees in an email Tuesday, which was seen by Business Insider, that affected workers have been notified and additional organizational changes would follow "to add focus and speed" to the business's most critical growth areas. Carrigan said that Audible is "laser-focused on making sure we are organized and resourced for continued strength in the years ahead."

Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI."

Some employees in Germany received a security alert on their work devices indicating that their access to company systems had been placed in "reduced functionality mode," according to an internal Slack message reviewed by Business Insider.

The message explained that this status typically appears when an employee's role is being closed or transferred. The company notified the local works council of the job cuts in Germany, according to a memo shared internally by Nils Gräf, Amazon's director for Germany, which was seen by Business Insider.

Amazon has a total of 1.55 million employees globally. The cuts would represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees.

Amazon declined to comment, referring Business Insider to Galetti's earlier blog post.

Amazon laid off employees within its devices division as part of a plan to cut 14,000 corporate roles, according to internal messages viewed by Business Insider.

Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI."

The devices division is behind the research and development of Amazon's consumer electronics products, including the Kindle, Fire, and Echo devices. It is unclear how many devices employees were impacted by the layoffs. 

Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment. 

"Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products," Roy wrote in a memo posted by an employee to Amazon's internal Slack. "In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes."

Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti announced the broader cuts on Tuesday, saying the company is becoming leaner because AI is allowing companies to innovate faster than ever before. 

"Team,

I'm writing to provide an update following Beth's update on A to Z from earlier today regarding organizational changes. As with other teams across Amazon, we've taken a hard look at our level of investment for various programs, which is resulting in some roles being eliminated within the OS & Services org. These decisions were difficult, but were made thoughtfully to position our organization for future success.

Notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization have now been completed for the U.S. and Canada. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees.

Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products. In support of this mission, I encourage you all to:

Changes like this can be hard for our entire team. Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available 24/7 for free and confidential support if you or your family members need it.

Thank you for your commitment to our customers as we navigate this transition.

A group of more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to maintain funding of so-called SNAP benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown.

The suit was filed four days after the Trump administration said it would not use emergency funding to maintain benefits during the shutdown from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that SNAP benefits will cease Saturday, the lawsuit noted.

"Because of USDA's actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program's inception."

"Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act," the states said in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.

"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide," said New York State Attorney General Letitia James in a statement on the suit.

"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running," James said. "There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families."

CNBC has requested comment from the USDA on the lawsuit.

The department's website greets visitors with a large message about the discontinuation of the SNAP benefits.

"Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program," the page says.

"Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01," the department said.

"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats," the site said. "They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance."

There is no current end in sight for the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.

On Tuesday, a Republican-backed House bill that would fund the government temporarily failed to win approval in the Senate for the 13th time.

Nearly all Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the Republican bill because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.

The enhanced tax credits currently used by about 20 million Americans to reduce the cost of health plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces are due to expire at the end of the year.

Microsoft's GitHub unit on Tuesday announced Agent HQ, a new "mission control" interface that will allow software developers to manage coding agents from multiple vendors on a single platform. 

An artificial intelligence agent is a tool that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user. Several companies, including GitHub, have built and released popular agents that are specifically designed for programming. 

Developers have a range of new capabilities at their fingertips because of these agents, but it can require a lot of effort to keep track of them all individually, said GitHub COO Kyle Daigle.

Developers will now be able to manage agents from GitHub, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI and Cognition in one place with Agent HQ.  

"We want to bring a little bit of order to the chaos of innovation," Daigle told CNBC in an interview. "With so many different agents, there's so many different ways of kicking off these asynchronous tasks, and so our big opportunity here is to bring this all together."  

Agent HQ users will be able to access a command center where they can assign, steer and monitor the work of multiple agents.

That means they'll be able to see what their agents are working on and course correct in real time if they get off track.

The third-party agents will begin rolling out to GitHub Copilot subscribers in the coming months, but Copilot Pro+ users will be able to access OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders this week, the company said.

GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, and it allows users to store, share and collaborate on code. Its platform now supports more than 180 million developers, and the company said it is growing at its fastest rate ever. 

"This is an era of abundance for AI and we just want to make sure that that abundance doesn't turn to chaos," Daigle said. "We can allow you to have a great experience using all of these tools via a very open GitHub platform."

WATCH: AI is the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetime

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio on Tuesday warned that a bubble could be forming around megacap technology in the U.S. amid the artificial intelligence boom, but said that it may not end until the Federal Reserve reverses its current easy policies.

"There's a lot of bubble stuff going on," Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from the Future Investment Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. "But bubbles don't pop, really, until they are popped by tightness of monetary policy and so on."

Added Dalio, "We're going to be more likely to ease rates than to tighten rates."

The hedge fund titan said he uses a personal "bubble indicator" that's relatively high right now. Dalio joins a growing chorus of well-known market participants that have cautioned about the potential for a bubble tied to AI spending in recent months.

The Fed is set to cut rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and many investors expect the central bank it will do so again at its final meeting of the year in December.

The billionaire investor also pointed out that outside of AI-linked names, the market as a whole has done "relatively poorly" and there's a "concentrated environment." He noted that 80% of gains are concentrated within Big Tech. The three major indexes on Monday rallied to all-time closing highs, led higher by technology stocks with more good AI news expected from a series of Big Tech earnings this week.

Dalio said there's a "two-part economy," with the easing of interest rates because of weakening in some places while a bubble develops elsewhere.

He said monetary policy cannot aid both ends of this spectrum given the divergence, making it more likely that the bubble will continue. Dalio said the outcome could be similar to what was seen in 1998 to 1999 or in 1927 and 1928.

"Whether or not it's a bubble and when that bubble is going to burst, maybe we don't know exactly," Dalio said. "But what we can say is there's a lot of risk."

Nokia announced on Tuesday that Nvidia is taking a $1 billion stake in the networking company, the latest partnership for the artificial intelligence chipmaker.

Nokia shares soared 26% higher following the news.

Nokia will issue over 166 million new shares and will use the proceeds to fund its plans for AI and other general corporate purposes.

The two companies also struck a strategic partnership to work together to develop next-generation 6G cellular technology. Nokia said that it would adapt its 5G and 6G software to run on Nvidia's chips, and will collaborate on networking technology for AI.

Nokia said Nvidia would consider incorporating its technology into its future AI infrastructure plans.

Nokia, a Finnish company, is best known for its early cell phones, but in recent years, it has primarily been a supplier of 5G cellular equipment to telecom providers.

The announcement comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang prepares to address an audience of policymakers and government leaders in Washington DC to keynote the company's developer conference.

Nokia and Nvidia are expected to discuss some of their collaborations and plans at the conference.

Nvidia has taken several equity stakes in strategic partners in recent months as the company has found itself at the center of the AI world.

In September, it committed a $5 billion investment to one-time rival Intel, and said it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. It also committed $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve and a $667 million investment in to U.K. cloud provider Nscale.

OpenAI on Tuesday announced it has completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.

The artificial intelligence startup said its nonprofit is now called the OpenAI Foundation, and it holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm. OpenAI said its for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.

Under the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will hold a 26% stake in the for-profit, with 47% held by current and former employees and investors.

Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company as early as 2019, said it supports OpenAI's recapitalization and now holds an investment in the PBC that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.

The company said it held a 32.5% stake in the for-profit on an as-converted basis, excluding OpenAI's recent funding rounds.

Microsoft shares are up 3% Tuesday.

"The more OpenAI succeeds as a company, the more the non-profit's equity stake will be worth, which the non-profit will use to fund its philanthropic work," OpenAI said in a blog post.

OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion.

In 2024, the company announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. But after facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said in May that its nonprofit would retain control.

OpenAI Foundation will make an initial $25 billion commitment to work to accelerate health breakthroughs and technical solutions to AI resilience, OpenAI said Tuesday.

As part of the announcement, Microsoft said OpenAI has agreed to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, though Microsoft will no longer have a first right of refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider.

The companies also outlined several additional changes to their partnership.

When OpenAI says it has reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a term for an AI system that rivals or exceeds human intelligence, that claim will have to be verified by an independent expert panel, Microsoft said. The revenue share agreement between the two companies will remain until that panel verifies AGI.

Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties.

OpenAI remains Microsoft's frontier model partner. Microsoft said its IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032, and include models post-AGI. OpenAI's consumer hardware is excluded from Microsoft's IP rights.

"As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business," Microsoft said in a statement.

Microsoft is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 results after market close on Wednesday.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Securitize, the "real world assets" platform that powers BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, will go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, CEO Carlos Domingo told CNBC in an exclusive interview.

The fintech firm will merge with Cantor Equity Partners II, Inc., a blank-check company sponsored by an affiliate of Cantor Fitzgerald that trades under the CEPT ticker. The deal values Securitize's business at $1.25 billion in pre-money equity.

"Tokenization is what everybody's talking about … but there's nobody publicly traded that does it," Domingo told CNBC. "We will do well in the public market because people want to index themselves to tokenization the same way that people are buying Circle because they want to index themselves to stablecoins."

Tokenization refers to the registration of ownership rights to real-world assets such as stocks, bonds or gold on a blockchain. The process enables more transparent and around-the-clock trading versus traditional methods, according to its proponents — among whom are Robinhood Markets CEO Vlad Tenev and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

Following the merger, the combined entity Securitize Corp.'s stock will trade on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol SECZ. Shares could begin trading on the exchange as soon as January, according to Domingo. 

The company will book $465 million in gross proceeds from the deal. That includes $225 million from private investors including Borderless Capital and Hanwha Investment, and $240 million in the SPAC's trust account, assuming no redemptions. 

The deal comes as tokenized RWAs boom. The combined market value of tokenized U.S. Treasurys has climbed to roughly $8.6 billion as of writing time, up more than 200% over the past year, according to data provider RWA.xyz.

The RWA tokenization market as a whole has ballooned 135% over the past year and is now worth $35 billion, the data shows. Citi analysts see massive growth for the tokenized RWA market, saying it could grow to almost $4 trillion by 2030.

That positions Securitize — which Domingo says has been profitable in recent quarters — to jump into the fray of firms aiming to capitalize on growing demand for digital assets. Earlier this year, Circle debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, raising about $1.1 billion in its blockbuster IPO. Cryptocurrency exchanges Gemini and Bullish also went public earlier in 2025.

Tapping public markets will create winners and losers as the digital asset space continues to grow and mature, Domingo added.

"The crypto industry needs to consolidate," he said. "If you're publicly traded and you have access to stock capital markets as well as cash, you can be on the side that is consolidating and not be consolidated by somebody else."

Founded in 2017, Securitize has facilitated several large financial firms' first forays into tokenized funds. 

In March 2024, BlackRock launched its USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain in partnership with Securitize, enabling qualified investors to digitally hold U.S. Treasurys and earn yield. The firm has also tokenized more than $4 billion in assets through partnerships with Apollo, Hamilton Lane, KKR and VanEck on their tokenized funds. 

Securitize is the largest tokenization platform, dominating 20% of the RWA tokenization market, per RWA.xyz.

The company plans to also digitize its own equity, a move designed to demonstrate how the public company process and trading can move on-chain, Domingo told CNBC. The executive sees a future in which everything is brought on-chain.

"There's $400 trillion out there of assets that could potentially be tokenized," Domingo said. "It's an upgrade … within the next five to 10 years, you will see everything will be on-chain, because it's just a better ledger."

Global trade is not broken, despite the disruption, pressure and shock of trade tariffs introduced by the U.S. this year, the head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) told CNBC Tuesday.

"Many people have the impression that, because of the unilateral actions of the U.S., that global trade is broken. Yes [they've] been a great disruption — the greatest disruption of global trade in 80 years — but we are pleased to see the resilience of the system," WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.

"The system is battered, it's bruised, but it's still standing," she told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.

Okonjo-Iweala's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump, the architect of multiple U.S. tariffs on foreign imports to the States, continues a tour of Asia in which he has signed trade deals and truces, so far.

But the big prize for Trump will be whether he and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are due to meet Thursday, can come to a deal to reduce duties and counter-tariffs on a range of each other's goods. Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to "come away with" a trade deal, raising market hopes.

"We do wish that the meeting goes very well," Okonjo-Iweala said, noting that any de-escalation in trade tensions would be welcome.

"Any threat of disconnect and conflict between China and the U.S. in trade is not good for either country or for the world. Any threat of fragmentation or division between the two, into two global trading camps, will lead to losses in global welfare, and the poorer countries will be harder hit," she said.

Earlier in October, the WTO hiked its forecast for global trade growth in 2025, but warned the outlook for 2026 had deteriorated.

Despite predicting that trade volume growth would stand at 2.4% this year, up sharply from a previous estimate of 0.9% in the trade body's August report, the WTO slashed its previous expectation of 1.8% trade volume growth next year to a lackluster 0.5%.

It cited a cooling global economy and the impact of higher tariffs as a reason for the revision.

Trade tariffs have become a dominant feature, and headwind, for global commerce since U.S. President Donald Trump shocked friends and foes alike with his widescale tariffs regime in April.

Countries scrambled to reach trade deals with the White House but even allies, such as the U.K., have seen a baseline 10% tariff remain on goods exported to the U.S.

Global trade volumes rose sharply in the first half of 2025 — up 4.9% year on year — with several factors contributing to the robust expansion.

These included the front-loading of imports into the U.S. in anticipation of higher trade tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions with disinflation, supportive fiscal policies and tight labor markets boosting real incomes and spending in major economies, the WTO said.

Strong growth in emerging markets and increased demand for artificial intelligence-related goods — including semiconductors, servers and telecommunications equipment — also fueled global trade growth, it added, with AI-related spending driving nearly half of the overall trade expansion in the first half of the year, rising 20% year on year in value terms.

Global competition when it comes to developing AI-related products has heated up.

The WTO noted that the U.S. accounted for roughly one-fifth of global AI-related trade growth in the first half of 2025. The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who wrote a book in 2021 titled, "How to Avoid a Climate Disaster," now says leaders need to shift their approach to climate change.

In a letter published Tuesday ahead of next week's COP30 U.N. climate summit, Gates argued that too many resources are focused on emissions and the environment, and that more money should go toward "improving lives" and curbing disease and poverty.

"Climate is super important but has to be considered in terms of overall human welfare," Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive interview. "I didn't pick that position because everybody agrees with it – it's I think intellectually the right answer."

In the letter, Gates called out the "doomsday view" of climate change and said leaders need to make a "strategic pivot" to focus on issues that have the "greatest impact on human welfare."

"It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into," he wrote.

Breakthrough Energy, Gates' climate-focused investment fund, reportedly cut dozens of staffers earlier this year. The New York Times reported in March that the "change shows how Mr. Gates is retooling his empire for the Trump era."

This year's climate summit in Brazil comes nearly a decade after world leaders adopted the Paris climate agreement aimed at limiting temperature warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.

Gates called that original goal unrealistic.

Over the last decade, the U.S. government has stepped in and out of the commitment depending on who's in the White House.

The U.S. initially entered the agreement under President Barack Obama, before President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact when he took office for the first time in 2017. After President Joe Biden rejoined, Trump issued an executive order to again withdraw during his second term.

Gates said in 2017 that he was "deeply concerned" but "hopeful" that the U.S. would continue supporting innovation after Trump left the agreement.

Gates told Sorkin that pulling back on climate initiatives is a "huge disappointment," but credited companies like Microsoft for investing in alternative energy technologies. Continued support of these innovations will bring down costs, he said.

Over the last decade, several major technology companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have set 2030 targets to reach net-zero emissions or go carbon negative.

In February, Microsoft sustainability chief Melanie Nakagawa admitted that the "moon has gotten further away" from previous goals as the company doubles down on artificial intelligence.

"However, the force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster, and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence (AI)," she wrote.

The massive energy demand needed to meet growing data center power requirements has sparked concerns among many climate activists.

In terms of AI and concerns that a bubble has formed, Gates said many investments will be "dead ends."

Still, he added, "If you want to be a tech company you don't get to say no let's check out of this race."

Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, marking one of the biggest rounds of layoffs in the company's history.

Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, announced the cuts in a blog post and said the reductions are a continuation of CEO Andy Jassy's drive to operate the company "like the world's largest startup."Galetti said that despite the company performing well, it is cutting jobs as a result of AI rapidly changing the world.

"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote.

She added that Amazon needs to be leaner and have fewer layers of management in order to move faster, noting that it is reorganizing resources to invest in its biggest bets while continuing to hire in other areas.

Amazon has a total of 1.55 million employees globally. The cuts would represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees.

The latest move is part of Jassy's effort to create a leaner and more disciplined company. In recent years, Amazon cut management layers, slashed bureaucracy, tightened costs, overhauled performance and pay systems, and ordered most corporate employees back to the office five days a week.

The changes really started after the pandemic, when Amazon's growth slowed. The company moved to rein in costs by axing unprofitable projects and cutting a bloated workforce.

Jassy said in June that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink Amazon's workforce. Earlier this year, the company froze the hiring budget in its massive retail division, and in July, its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, also faced layoffs.

Big Tech firms have cut thousands of jobs this year, even as their businesses continue to perform well, as they double down on investments in AI. Microsoft announced plans to eliminate around 15,000 positions this year, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees in a June memo that the company must remain focused on its three core priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven layoffs, informing staff in its risk organization last week that their roles are being replaced by automation technology.

Elon Musk launched an early version of an AI-powered encyclopedia called 'Grokipedia' on Monday, with its website temporarily crashing before coming back online hours later. 

The new AI service, named after xAI's large language model Grok, has been promoted by Musk as an improved and less biased version of the popular free and web-based Wikipedia. 

The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced last month that he was working on a Wikipedia rival after a suggestion from David Sacks, a fellow tech mogul who is serving as US President Donald Trump's administration's AI and crypto czar.

Musk, who has endorsed Germany's far-right extremist party AfD, has previously lambasted Wikipedia as "woke" and criticized it for citing news outlets such as The New York Times and NPR as sources in many of its articles.

In a post on X , Musk said that the launch was only "Grokipedia version 0.1," but that a later "version 1.0 will be 10X better." However, he argued that the current version was better than Wikipedia. 

Reports and copies of the site on the web archive, The Way Back Machine, indicate the site was down for a few hours. 

The Grokipedia.com page features a search bar on a dark background and says it has logged 885,279 articles, which appear to be in a style reminiscent of Wikipedia.

For comparison, the Wikipedia website said it had over 7 million articles on its English Wikipedia as of Tuesday. Wikipedia's articles are also written and edited by a community of volunteer writers and editors, while Grokipedia appears to be solely generated by AI. 

Grokipedia represents the latest application of xAI's chatbots into Musk's projects after Grok was integrated into the X social media platform. 

Musk has also advertised Grok as an "anti-woke" and unbiased alternative to competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

However, as noted by many media outlets and X users, both the Grok chatbot and Grokipedia itself commonly cite Wikipedia as a source when queried by users. 

In a statement shared with CNBC, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson said the company was "still in the process of understanding how Grokipedia works," but added that alternative versions of Wikipedia have appeared before and haven't interfered with its work or mission.

When asked about accusations of bias, the spokesperson said that Wikipedia is written to inform billions of readers without promoting a particular point of view, adding that "unlike newer projects, Wikipedia's strengths are clear: it has transparent policies, rigorous volunteer oversight, and a strong culture of continuous improvement."

"Wikipedia's knowledge is — and always will be — human. Through open collaboration and consensus, people from all backgrounds build a neutral, living record of human understanding — one that reflects our diversity and collective curiosity. This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist," it added.

Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales reportedly told the Washington Post last week that he didn't have high expectations for Grokipedia as AI language models weren't sophisticated enough and "there will be a lot of errors."

On the other hand, Larry Sanger — a Wikipedia co-founder who resigned as editor and chief in 2002 and has long criticized its current editorial leadership — has previously shown enthusiasm about a new to Wikipedia. 

However, following the launch of Grokipedia - Sanger posted a long thread pointing out what he called inaccuracies on the AI ​​encyclopedia for himself.

In this article

Amazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company's multiyear effort to rein in costs.

In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in "our biggest bets" including generative artificial intelligence.

"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. "We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses."

The layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. The cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, according to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the matter.

Employees in Amazon's video games, grocery, human resources, sustainability and communications, ads and devices units were informed of cuts early Tuesday morning, although the layoffs are expected to touch nearly every area of the company.

Amazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.

It has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.

The company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in "key strategic areas."

Amazon's job cuts come as companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing the size of their workforces.

Several companies have indicated they can hire fewer employees and still grow their revenues, partly as a result of relying more on AI, which they believe will translate to greater efficiencies and productivity.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company's workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it "will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs."

Meta last week laid off about 600 staffers in its AI unit in an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. Microsoft has cut more than 15,000 staffers this year as CEO Satya Nadella told staffers they must "reimagine our mission for a new era" of AI. Google made cuts to a number of units earlier this year and taken steps to reduce bureaucracy by eliminating 35% of managers overseeing small teams.

Jassy, who took the helm at Amazon from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years. Amazon laid off 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and job reductions have continued since then, though at a smaller scale.

Amazon is slimming down its workforce after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.

The company has since moved to shutter some of its unprofitable initiatives, while committing to invest about $118 billion this year in AI development and cloud infrastructure. Amazon faces growing pressure to show its cloud and AI businesses aren't lagging behind rivals.

At the same time, Jassy been trying to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the "world's largest startup" as it looks to stay competitive. Last September, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, he set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon by the first quarter of this year.

Earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to hire 250,000 workers for full-time, part-time and temporary roles in its fulfillment and transportation units to meet demand for the holiday shopping season.

Amazon is slated to report its third-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Claudio Fuentes, 31, who is the cofounder and COO of CompAI, which develops AI software for corporate compliance. Fuentes recently posted on X that his startup will no longer hire people who can't work in-person five days a week at its New York office. This story has been edited for length and clarity.

I've been in tech for the last 10 years. I spent the last four in Silicon Valley and relocated to New York in February. We started CompAI in January and launched a product in April. We've had a pretty explosive growth curve.

We initially started remote. My cofounder is based in the UK and is planning on relocating to New York. We have a sales guy in France, and we have someone running customer success in Illinois. Our goal has always been: How do we actually get people in the same office? You just work faster.

I'm getting absolutely roasted by most of the remote tech worker community for my post in favor of the office. It shouldn't be controversial that a company decides to hire locally, but somehow it is.

In the four years I spent in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a lot of companies that I saw grow from nothing to Series A, Series B, Series C — absolutely crush it. These are companies like Cursor and Bland. The culture in San Francisco is hire your best friends, get them in the same room, and let's build great software.

Before moving to the Bay Area, I spent six years in New York. In 2016, I was working for WeWork. So, you can imagine, peak Adam Neumann — hyper growth. I look back very fondly on what he was able to create around culture.

The economics and business strategy aside, if you think about the workplace and employee loyalty and productivity that they were able to extract from their workforce, it was bigger than life. To whatever degree I can try to replicate an environment like that in the companies that I build, I absolutely will do so.

When COVID hit, I moved from New York to Miami because I grew up there. I spent a year remote in Miami and one year remote in the Bay Area before I went the full entrepreneurship route. I look back at those years as some of the most depressing of my life.

It's really convenient to be able to make your own hours and be home. But, over time, the lack of human connection really begins to get to you. If you spend two years locked in a room, barely seeing sunlight, there's something not natural about that experience.

At the end of the day, we're not just building a workplace, we're building a life that's centered around our work. People used to actually meet their spouse at work. For many reasons, I think it makes sense for us to be in the office.

For our existing workers, some will relocate. With others, we'll try to make it work, but we are definitely prioritizing that every hire from here on is in New York.

Aside from all the extracurricular activities we do as a team that build trust and rapport, which then help productivity, one instance stands out. It was about 8:30 in the morning, and one of our guys showed up early to the office, walked up to my cofounder, and said, "What if we implement an AI agent for our customer support? Is there something you can hack together?"

About 20 minutes later, he had already spun up an automation in our Slack that auto-replies to customers when they ask a question by searching our knowledge base. That has cut down our customer-support requests by 95%.

That came through this very casual conversation, where the alternative is typically, "Oh, let's hop on a call because it's kind of hard to explain." It's not something you send in a single message. It's like, let me riff with you on this in an unstructured way.

In a remote world, there are also things that don't get said because of that friction that exists. Therefore, you prioritize the ideas that are more well-formed, as opposed to riffing.

That's what innovation is: It's ill-formed ideas that, through this organic communication, become fully formed and then flourish.

I completely get it if your job is working out of a cubicle, and it's just depressing and you hate your life. Go remote. Workers get more value out of that.We're trying to build the opposite. We're trying to make the statement that having everyone together is important right now. The in-person candidates that we do find tend to be the more committed ones. We probably will lose on some people who are maybe more qualified. I'm OK with that trade-off, because I think the net benefit is going to be worth it.

In this article

PayPal has signed a deal with OpenAI to have its digital wallet embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items found through the leading consumer AI tool, the company told CNBC exclusively.

Shares of the company jumped as much as 13% on the news.

The agreement, sealed over the weekend, means that starting next year, both sides of PayPal's ecosystem can plug into ChatGPT: PayPal users can purchase items through the AI platform, and its merchants can sell on it, with their inventory listed there, according to PayPal CEO Alex Chriss.

"We've got hundreds of millions of loyal PayPal wallet holders who now will be able to click the 'Buy with PayPal button' on ChatGPT and have a safe and secure checkout experience," Chriss said in an interview.

The move makes PayPal an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The thinking is that its 700 million-plus weekly users can lean on artificial intelligence to help them find items, similar to a human personal shopper. Last month, OpenAI said its users could buy from Shopify and Etsy merchants, and two weeks ago it announced an e-commerce deal with Walmart.

"It's a whole new paradigm for shopping," Chriss said. "It's hard to imagine that agentic commerce isn't going to be a big part of the future."

PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the coming era of agentic AI shopping, announcing recent deals with Google and artificial intelligence firm Perplexity. The fintech firm, which also released third-quarter results Tuesday, issued a release on its OpenAI deal after CNBC's report.

The company will also manage merchant routing, payment validation and other behind-the-scenes aspects of payment processing for PayPal sellers on ChatGPT, so individual merchants don't have to sign up with OpenAI, the firm said.

Chriss touted the fact that both consumers and merchants have been verified by the fintech firm, reducing the risk of fraud for either group. Users can pull funds from linked bank accounts or credit cards, or stored balances, to pay for purchases, and they'll get protections, package tracking and dispute resolution.

"It's not just that a transaction can happen," Chriss said. "It's that this is a trusted set of merchants, the largest merchant network in the world from PayPal, that are verified, with the largest set of verified consumers in a consumer wallet."

PayPal also said it is expanding the use of OpenAI's enterprise AI products for its employees to speed up product cycles.

At the launch last month of its Instant Checkout feature, OpenAI announced it was partnering with Stripe, which is giving users the ability to tap stored card and bank accounts to pay Etsy merchants.

Stripe calls its product, Link, a wallet and says it has 200 million users, but the service cannot yet store funds and has no consumer mobile app, so many fintech experts don't yet consider it a full wallet.

Elon Musk appears to have launched Grokipedia, an alternative to Wikipedia, on Monday.

This comes shortly after the billionaire said on X last month that his team at xAI was building something that would be a "massive improvement over Wikipedia."

"Frankly, it is a necessary step towards the xAI goal of understanding the Universe," he said in the September X post. 

Grokipedia.com went live on Monday afternoon, but some users said they experienced errors with the site, according to the Washington Post.

Business Insider was able to access Grokipedia.com shortly before 7:30 p.m. ET and view an entry for Musk.

The page features a search bar on a dark background, and a font style reminiscent of Wikipedia and ChatGPT.

The website's landing page says Grokipedia is in "version v0.1" and has logged 885,279 articles. 

For comparison, Wikipedia said on its website that as of Tuesday, it had 7,081,705 articles in the English Wikipedia.

Representatives for Musk, X, xAI, and Wikipedia did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The project marks Musk's latest attempt to challenge mainstream platforms he deems politically biased. Once an admirer of Wikipedia, Musk has accused it of harboring liberal viewpoints over the past few years and urged followers in January to "defund Wikipedia until balance is restored."

In 2019, he criticized his own Wikipedia page on X, which was then Twitter, saying it was a "war zone with a zillion edits."

"Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. It's insane!" Musk wrote in a December 2019 post. "Btw, can someone please delete 'investor'. I do basically zero investing."

In December 2022, he posted on X that Wikipedia had a "non-trivial left-wing bias."

Musk and Wikipedia's cofounder, Jimmy Wales, also have a long-running online feud.

In May 2023, Wales criticized Musk for restricting some content on Twitter in Turkey before the country's presidential election.

And in November 2023, after Musk rebranded Twitter to X, Wales said X was overrun with "trolls and lunatics."

Responding to Wales' comment saying Wikipedia was not for sale, Musk wrote in October 2023 that he would give the platform $1 billion  if it changed its name to "Dickipedia."

Wales told the Washington Post in an interview last week that he didn't have high expectations for Grokipedia because AI language models aren't sophisticated enough and "there will be a lot of errors."

At press time, Grokipedia's entry on Musk says that the former presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, took up a prominent role in DOGE after Musk's departure. That is incorrect. Ramaswamy left the group in January, months before Musk stepped down in May. 

Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Musk's xAI, has drawn criticism in the past for a series of high-profile mistakes. In one instance, the bot promoted a baseless conspiracy theory about "white genocide" in South Africa after being asked unrelated questions. Musk and X have addressed these errors and promised fixes.

In a June X post, Musk said he would use Grok to "rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors."

Two Massachusetts women recently lost a combined $6,700 to a "missed jury duty" phone scam that utilized Bitcoin ATMs, Norfolk County Sheriff Patrick McDermott said.

According to the sheriff, there's been an increase in calls from scammers who claim to work for local law enforcement and demand money from residents who have supposedly missed jury duty. They threaten to arrest those who don't agree to pay.

"The Norfolk County Sheriff's Office never makes calls like this, and neither do local police departments," McDermott said in a statement Wednesday. "Just hang up on anyone who is demanding money and acting like they are from our office, or another law enforcement agency, threatening you with arrest or detainment for things like 'missed jury duty' or an 'outstanding warrant.'"

Both of the victims came to the sheriff's office after sending money to the scammers. One was a woman from Sharon who paid $5,250 via a Bitcoin kiosk.

"She told our officer she was there to clear up an issue about missing jury duty after transferring the money as demanded," the sheriff said. 

The woman said she saw a sign on the Bitcoin machine warning about scams, but the person on the phone told her should would be detained for 10-12 days if she didn't pay.

Just 90 minutes later, the sheriff said a woman from Dedham came into the office to report that she paid a $1,450 "bond" through a Roslindale Bitcoin kiosk. The scammer reportedly sent her a "fraudulent court document to back up his claims," the sheriff said, and threatened that she'd be arrested and detained for 72 hours unless she paid immediately.  

The city of Gloucester recently banned Bitcoin ATMs, saying they're concerned the machines could be used by scammers to prey on elderly victims. And in Waltham this summer, a police officer stopped an elderly man from sending $12,000 to scammers via a Bitcoin machine. 

In August, the Federal Trade Commission warned that scammers pretending to be police are calling up Americans and directing them to fake websites to pay a fine for missing jury duty. 

"It might ask you to pay up to $10,000 in fines on the site, or send you to a "government kiosk" (no such thing) to pay by cryptocurrency," the FTC said. "But every bit of this is a scam."

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Consensys-backed Ethereum treasury firm SharpLink (ticker SBET) will deploy $200 million worth of its ETH stockpile into onchain strategies to generate yield. This includes institutional-grade staking and restaking provided by ether.fi and EigenCloud.

The funds will be deployed specifically on Linea, the Layer 2 network bootstrapped by Consensys. SharpLink's qualified custodian, Anchorage Digital, will oversee the deployment.

"As a public entity operating at the forefront of Digital Asset Treasury ("DAT") innovation, SharpLink is leveraging Linea's institutional-grade infrastructure to make its ETH even more productive by unlocking scalable, secure, and composable ways to optimize onchain yield," the firm wrote.

Ether.fi will act as SharpLink's primary staking solution while EigenCloud, a pioneer in the emerging restaking sector that allows secured assets to backstop multiple protocols, will enable the firm to participate in sectors like "verifiable AI, insured DeFi, and trustless infrastructure."

"As this economy grows, so do yield opportunities for the institutional capital securing these apps, agents and services," Eigen Labs founder Sreeram Kannan said. "What excites me about this deployment is not just what it delivers today, but what it enables tomorrow. We've created infrastructure for a new class of applications that couldn't be built without this combination of platforms."

SharpLink is a frontrunner among ETH treasuries with approximately 860,000 tokens, according to The Block's data. The Minnesota-based firm also stacks LINEA tokens and plans to tokenize its SBET shares on Ethereum.

Police in Indiana have recovered 1,000 Bitcoin mining machines stolen from a hijacked shipment of cargo in a semi-trailer in Grant County earlier this month—and, in an unusual twist, also stopped the theft of $75,000 worth of frozen turkeys during the same investigation.

The mining devices, worth around $700,000, belonged to Your Choice Best Ever, a crypto mining firm with operations in the state. The company reported the theft on Oct. 2. It did not respond to requests for comment from Decrypt on whether it also had any connection to the purloined poultry.

In a Facebook post Monday, the Grant County Sheriff's Office said detectives tracked the stolen shipment to the Chicago area, and coordinated the recovery of the mining rigs last week. No arrests have yet been made, but the investigation involves “international criminal participants.”

Locals found humor in the bizarre pairing of Bitcoin miners and frozen turkeys. Comments on social media ranged from puns about police “gobbling up the charges” to jokes about using the ice-cold turkeys to cool overheating servers.

Mining operations expanded into areas like the Midwest following a 2021 ban on mining in China. At its height, China dominated the Bitcoin mining industry, accounting for more than three-quarters of global activity—but the ban dispersed miners across the world, leading to new hubs in the U.S. and beyond. According to an article published earlier this year in Nature, the U.S. now accounts for 38% of global Bitcoin mining.

“Globally, the mining hotspots today are Texas, parts of the U.S. Midwest, the Nordic region, the Caucasus, and increasingly Latin America,” Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platform, told Decrypt. “Anywhere with cheap, stable, and often renewable power.”

The company which owns the stolen machines, Your Choice Best Ever, is typical of the trend of China-based miners moving abroad. It once operated blockchain mining facilities in Sichuan, Xinjiang, and Yunnan in China before the mining ban. Founded in 2014, the company's website, which seemingly hasn't been updated in years, claims it now has mining sites in Indiana and Mississippi.

Yet the rapid rise of mining operations has stirred debate in communities where they are located. Opponents cite high energy consumption and noise pollution as major concerns, while supporters argue that mining brings jobs, investment, and tax revenue.

“Some concerns are absolutely valid,” Stadelmann previously told Decrypt. “The industry hasn't always communicated well about its energy mix or community impact."

He argued the key is to stop operating in isolation and start showing tangible local benefits like jobs, tax revenue, and support for renewable build-outs. "The answer isn't denial, it's transparency and innovation," he said.

Oops, something went wrong

SharpLink Gaming, one of the largest publicly traded holders of Ethereum, announced Tuesday that it plans to deploy $200 million in ETH from its treasury onto the Linea layer-2 network.

The deployment will occur over multiple years using risk-managed strategies, the firm said in a statement, and will take place in collaboration with Linea creator Consensys. (Disclaimer: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

The initiative enables SharpLink to generate enhanced yields on its ETH holdings through multiple sources: Native Ethereum staking rewards, restaking rewards from securing EigenCloud Autonomous Verifiable Services, and incentives from Linea and partner Ether.fi.

SharpLink said that all operations will maintain institutional-grade security through its ETH custodian, Anchorage Digital Bank.

“As one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor and discipline,” said SharpLink Co-CEO Joseph Chalom, in a statement. “This deployment enables us to access the best of Ethereum's staking, restaking and DeFi yield, while maintaining the institutional safeguards our stockholders expect.”

“This is a foundational step in our broader strategy to responsibly generate enhanced staking yield and optimize treasury performance in a way that maximizes stockholder value,” he added, “and marks the beginning of a much larger effort.”

Beyond immediate yields, the partnership aims to pioneer institutional capital markets infrastructure on Ethereum, including on-chain capital raises, programmable liquidity tools, and tokenized equity strategies.

Chalom previously told Decrypt that the firm was weighing how best to tap into Linea for yield ahead of last month's launch of the LINEA token. SharpLink is a member of the Linea Consortium, a collective of firms and projects helping to distribute token rewards and drive adoption of the layer-2 scaling network.

“When you hold billions of dollars of ETH and you're looking at a portfolio of staking, there is going to be an ability to deploy that through staking opportunities on Linea,” Chalom told Decrypt in early September.

SharpLink Makes First Ethereum Buy in Over a Month as ETH Holdings Top $3.5 Billion

SharpLink is currently the second-largest publicly traded holder of Ethereum with nearly 860,000 ETH, or about $3.56 billion worth. The firm's share price is slightly up on the day, with SBET recently trading hands at $14.34.

Ethereum is on the rebound, rising 8% over the last seven days to a recent price of $4,169 after diving below the $3,700 mark earlier this month. Users on Myriad—a prediction market created by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—remain bullish on ETH's next step, giving a nearly 79% chance of ETH rising to a price of $4,500 sooner than it can plunge to $3,100.

Crypto analysts are calling Mine 2 Earn the next explosive meta after new mining crypto Pepenode slammed $1.96 million in its presale, inching closer to the $2 million milestone.

PepeNode continues to gain strong traction among early investors who see it as the next big concept in crypto. The project reimagines the traditionally capital-intensive and highly competitive mining process as a strategic game, allowing users to earn passive yield by optimizing their virtual mining setups.

Unlike play-to-earn (P2E) titles that defined an entire era, such as Axie Infinity, which required constant grinding to earn rewards, PepeNode does away with that model. Instead, players simply make strategic decisions in combining the right nodes and upgrading their virtual mining rooms to maximize their earnings.

Early supporters now have the chance to secure their stake in what could become the next major trend in crypto, with PEPENODE tokens currently priced at $0.0011227.

However, in just two days, the price will increase as the project advances to its next funding stage, marking another step forward in its rapidly growing presale.

P2E games were among the biggest trends in crypto during the pandemic era, when everyone was stuck at home and seeking new ways to earn while traditional work was on hold.

For many, especially in countries like the Philippines, games like Axie Infinity have even become a source of livelihood, allowing players to convert their in-game tokens into fiat income through the daily grind.

However, most of these ecosystems were built solely around earning and liquidating rewards, rather than sustaining long-term value. As a result, token prices often deflated, interest faded, and only those who genuinely loved the games remained active.

To most observers, it may seem that the P2E movement has already faded after its glory days, but in reality, it has matured into an established sector within the broader cryptocurrency gaming space. According to Chainplay, the P2E market still commands a capitalization of $6.2 billion, and in just the past 24 hours, trading volumes across P2E tokens surpassed $630 million.

The real challenge lies in tokenomics – designing reward systems that keep players engaged and token prices stable or appreciating over the long term.

This is where PepeNode brings something entirely new. It doesn't shy away from the idea of earning crypto – that's central to mining itself – but instead of making it a cash-out race, it turns mining into a game of strategy rather than a race to spend power.

The more optimized your virtual mining setup, the more crypto you can earn, just like real mining, but without the capital drain. And this is where PepeNode's tokenomics could give the P2E model, which once defined an era, a much-needed reboot, turning it into something sustainable, competitive, and fun again.

PepeNode is introducing a new kind of game that circumvents the tokenomics pitfalls that plagued early P2E models.

To understand how it works, it's essential to first examine what PepeNode actually does. As mentioned, the project is developing a virtual mining game that allows users to mine PEPENODE tokens without the need for costly hardware or complex setups.

With PepeNode, it's not about constant grinding or repetitive gameplay, as earnings depend on how well each player optimizes their virtual mining setup. The game revolves around strategic decisions, such as selecting the right nodes and building an efficient virtual server room.

Each node carries unique characteristics, and combining the right ones boosts a player's potential to earn more crypto. Upgrading facilities, like expanding the virtual mining room, can further increase yield.



Now here's where PepeNode addresses the tokenomics problem that previous P2E projects struggled with.

For every upgrade or node purchase, 70% of the tokens used are permanently burned. As the game gains traction, this creates a deflationary model, reducing circulating supply and potentially increasing the token's long-term value.

Additionally, tokens are recycled back into the system rather than being cashed out. They are the very tokens required for further upgrades and expansions, encouraging continued participation instead of mass sell-offs.

Once a player's virtual mining setup reaches top-tier performance, it can even begin generating top meme coins such as Pepe (PEPE), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and others as rewards.

As such, these mechanics position PepeNode as the next evolutionary phase of both mining and gaming.

They say good things come to those who wait, but PepeNode holders don't have to.

Even before the official launch, presale buyers can put their PEPENODE tokens to work, earning while the project gears up for its debut.

The team wants no part in the all-too-common presale trap – projects that raise millions only to go quiet for months, bleeding momentum until the Token Generation Event (TGE) arrives and the market responds with the usual post-hype sell-off.

PepeNode changes all of that. Early adopters can already generate yield, compounding their holdings long before the game goes live, giving them a solid stash of tokens to power up their virtual mining facilities once the ecosystem launches.

This early utility is facilitated through PepeNode's staking protocol, which offers participants a dynamic 653% APY, converting waiting time into earning time.



So far, more than 1.2 billion PEPENODE tokens, or approximately 68% of all presale allocations, have been staked, demonstrating the confidence early supporters have in the project's long-term potential.

Want to be part of what PepeNode is building and secure your PEPENODE tokens now while at presale? 

Visit the official site to purchase today using ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20), or credit/debit cards. 

Buyers can connect using their favorite wallet, such as Best Wallet, widely regarded as the best crypto and Bitcoin wallet in the industry. PepeNode is now listed on Best Wallet's lauded project screening tool, Upcoming Tokens, so you can buy, track, and claim once the project is live.

To start earning PEPENODE tokens passively, you can stake with the project's native staking protocol, as mentioned.

The token's smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, providing early adopters with peace of mind regarding the security of its code.

The long-awaited approval of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) may not bring the massive inflows investors expect without participation from asset management giant BlackRock, according to market data.

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF received $28.1 billion in investments in 2025, as the only fund with positive year-to-date (YTD) inflows, pushing total spot Bitcoin ETF inflows to a cumulative $26.9 billion. 

Without BlackRock's fund, the spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a cumulative net outflow of $1.27 billion year-to-date, according to K33's head of research, Vetle Lunde.

The inflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs were the primary driver of Bitcoin (BTC) price momentum in 2025, Standard Chartered's global head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told Cointelegraph recently. 

BlackRock is the world's largest asset management firm, with $13.5 trillion in assets under management as of the third quarter of 2025.

BlackRock's absence may burst the bubble at altcoin ETF party

Based on the dynamic seen in Bitcoin ETF investments, BlackRock's absence from the altcoin ETF wave may limit the total inflows and their potential upside impact on the underlying cryptocurrencies, according to Lunde.

“No BlackRock, no party,” Lunde wrote on X. “BlackRock is absent from the imminent altcoin ETF wave. Opportunity for competitors to secure strong flows, but on net, likely limiting for overall flows.”

Despite the lack of involvement from the world's largest asset manager, some analysts remain optimistic about the next generation of ETFs.

Notably, the first Solana SOLUSD staking ETF may attract as much as $6 billion of capital within the first year, Bitget exchange's chief analyst, Ryan Lee, told Cointelegraph.

Multinational investment bank JPMorgan also predicted that a Solana ETF would attract $3 billion to $6 billion and an XRP ETF would garner $4 billion to $8 billion in new investments, based on the adoption rate of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.

Bitcoin ETFs had a 6% adoption rate and Ether ETFs about 3% during their first six months, meaning Bitcoin ETFs attracted roughly 6% of BTC's total market capitalization in that period.

After a 20% market correction and a total crypto market cap of $3.9T, top cryptocurrencies are trading at deep discounts. While panic dominates headlines, seasoned investors see opportunity: quality projects “on sale.” 

Here's the list of the best altcoins for this season: 



Digitap's live presale has positioned it as one of the best crypto presales in 2025. The project offers a true “omni-bank” solution, combining fiat banking, crypto payments, and global transfers under one roof. Users can manage multiple currencies, swap between crypto and fiat, and access a live $TAP Visa Card—bringing real-world usability to digital assets.

The platform's tokenomics are designed for sustainability: 50% of platform profits are used to buy back and burn $TAP, reducing supply as adoption scales. With more than $1 million raised in early rounds, Digitap's blend of fintech integration and blockchain transparency makes it one of the best cheap cryptos to buy now.

Chainlink remains the leading decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to access off-chain data securely. As adoption accelerates across DeFi, gaming, and AI integrations, LINK's role as “data middleware” is becoming essential infrastructure.

With over 98% of LINK held by long-term holders and exchange balances declining, analysts anticipate upside toward the $40–$45 range. It's a steady pick among the top 10 altcoins 2025, showing strength in both fundamentals and community trust.



Polkadot continues to lead in blockchain interoperability, allowing seamless communication between networks. Recent on-chain data shows $172 million in DOT purchased over the past 24 hours, indicating renewed investor interest.

As DeFi and Web3 ecosystems evolve, DOT's parachain structure could prove critical to cross-chain development. Having fallen more than 85% from its 2021 highs, Polkadot offers value for investors searching for alt coins to watch ahead of the next market cycle.



Formerly MATIC, Polygon (POL) continues to dominate Ethereum Layer-2 scaling, processing millions of transactions at minimal fees. Recently, Santander's Openbank launched regulated crypto trading in Germany using Polygon infrastructure, reaffirming its enterprise relevance.

Polygon's low-cost transactions and strong partnerships make it a staple in lists of the best altcoins to invest in for 2025. The project's consistent delivery and cross-chain compatibility give it resilience through market downturns.



XRP has weathered regulatory storms to emerge as a compliant, scalable settlement network for cross-border payments. The first U.S. spot XRP ETF surpassed $100 million in AUM within its first month, signaling strong institutional demand.

As tokenization of real-world assets gains traction, XRP remains one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025 for exposure to fintech and payments infrastructure.

Digitap's Phase 2 $TAP presale is live, crossing the $1 million funding milestone as investors rally behind what many are calling the best crypto presale of the year. The project's vision is ambitious: to build the future of money, a single app where users can hold, send, spend, and grow both cash and crypto seamlessly.

Digitap combines bank-grade security with blockchain-level efficiency, positioning itself at the intersection of traditional finance and decentralized innovation. The app's upcoming Visa card, global payment tools, and multi-currency wallets target a market comprising over 560 million crypto users, 1.4 billion unbanked individuals, and the $250 trillion cross-border payments sector, as expected by 2027.



As adoption of mobile-first finance accelerates, Digitap is tapping into what's next — a unified ecosystem where cash and crypto coexist without borders. Its mission is clear: bridge global finance, expand inclusion, and build the $TAP economy, a utility-driven network that powers real-world transactions, from freelancers to SMEs.

The world's money is going borderless, and with Digitap's presale now past the halfway mark of Round 2, $TAP is rapidly establishing itself as the token powering that future.

With the crypto market down roughly 20%, investors have a window to accumulate quality projects before sentiment turns bullish. Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and XRP represent strong infrastructure and payment plays. 

However, $TAP adds a powerful utility-driven edge, bridging traditional finance and DeFi, together with scheduled 600% growth during the presale.

Reliance Jio has added yet another feather to its cap by becoming one of the first major telecom operators in India to accept payments via the Digital Rupee, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This quiet yet significant integration marks a milestone in India's journey toward a cashless, digitally empowered economy.

When Reliance Jio users head to the payment checkout page for bill settlement or recharge, they now see (Digital Rupee) listed as one of the payment options alongside conventional choices like credit/debit cards, wallets, net banking, and UPI-linked methods. This addition means that millions of Jio subscribers can now directly use the RBI-issued digital currency for everyday telecom transactions.

The move is not just about adding one more payment channel. It signals the beginning of mainstream CBDC adoption in India, where a large private sector player like Jio has created a direct on-ramp for customers to use Digital Rupee seamlessly.

The Digital Rupee is India's official Central Bank Digital Currency launched by the RBI in December 2022 under pilot programs. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, the Digital Rupee is fully regulated and backed by the central bank, carrying the same legitimacy and trust as physical cash. It is designed to be used for retail and wholesale payments, offering faster settlement, reduced dependency on intermediaries, and greater efficiency for the financial system.

With multiple pilot programs already underway in retail and wholesale markets, the RBI has been working with select banks and partners to test real-world use cases. However, its presence in consumer-facing transactions has remained limited so far. Jio's acceptance of Digital Rupee now changes that narrative by making it accessible to everyday users at scale.

Reliance Jio has over 500 million subscribers, making it the largest telecom operator in India by user base. By enabling Digital Rupee payments across such a wide customer base, Jio effectively brings CBDC into the daily financial lives of a huge segment of Indians.

This is important for several reasons:

Mass Awareness: Telecom payments are frequent and recurring, ensuring that users encounter the Digital Rupee option regularly. This builds familiarity and adoption.

Trust Factor: Jio's reputation as a trusted brand lowers consumer hesitation toward using a relatively new form of currency.

Scalability: With India's mobile-first economy, introducing CBDC through telecom payments can help the RBI test, track, and scale its rollout efficiently.

Ecosystem Readiness: As other industries watch Jio's adoption, it may encourage e-commerce, retail, OTT, and fintech platforms to follow suit.

In short, Jio's early integration could set the benchmark for CBDC use cases across sectors.

Globally, countries from China to Nigeria are experimenting with Central Bank Digital Currencies to modernise payment infrastructure and reduce reliance on cash. India's Digital Rupee effort is particularly significant given the country's size, digital penetration, and the scale of its payment ecosystem dominated by UPI.

While UPI remains the backbone of digital payments in India, the Digital Rupee is envisioned as a complementary alternative that offers greater security, instant settlement, and reduced costs for banks and merchants. With Jio's integration, customers now get a taste of what a CBDC-driven transaction looks like in real life.

For Reliance Jio, adopting Digital Rupee fits neatly into its broader digital-first strategy. The company has consistently positioned itself as a technology leader from pioneering affordable 4G, to driving 5G rollouts, to integrating cutting-edge payment options. The Digital Rupee acceptance further reinforces this positioning.

For the RBI and the Indian government, this is a crucial step in validating the real-world usability of CBDC. If Jio's rollout sees traction, it could accelerate Digital Rupee adoption across utilities, retail chains, and even government services.

As India continues to explore the future of money, Reliance Jio's latest move is not just about telecom payments. It's about putting CBDC directly into the hands and smartphones of millions of Indians, making the Digital Rupee not a concept of tomorrow, but a currency of today.

With large-scale investors clearly regaining confidence in spot ETFs, Ethereum looks to be setting up for a significant institution-driven move. According to data available, Bitcoin spot ETFs saw net inflows of $149 million on Oct. 27, which was the third day in a row that they saw positive capital movement. More significantly, there were zero net outflows from any of the nine active Ethereum spot ETFs, resulting in $134 million in total inflows. This is an uncommon and potent sign of ongoing institutional appetite.

ETH ETFs surge

This surge of inflows comes after the crypto ETF market stagnated in early October, indicating that high-cap assets are currently being favored by capital rotation. This institutional support for Ethereum may serve as the impetus needed to move prices above the crucial $4,200 resistance level, paving the way for a move toward $5,000, which analysts and fund managers are increasingly pointing to as the next sensible price target.SosoValue">

Technically speaking, Ethereum is still in a precarious consolidation stage. For the majority of Q4, the price has been acting as resistance, hovering just below the 200-day moving average. If inflows keep up their current rate, a breakout above this level would probably turn momentum-based buying into a buying spree. Since the market is neither overbought nor oversold, there is room for expansion, as indicated by the RSI close to 51.ETHUSDT Chart by TradingView">

In addition to providing liquidity, institutional flows also reflect a change in sentiment. Professional investors are increasingly viewing digital assets as viable long-term exposure in the face of conventional market uncertainty, as evidenced by the steady inflows into both BTC and ETH ETFs. In other words, Ethereum's journey to $5,000 depends on this institutional momentum, with substantial financial resources as well as on retail participation.

It is not a question of whether, but when, ETH will test the $5,000 mark again if the current inflow trend continues for another week. This is because ETH has the potential to decisively break its resistance ceiling.

Solana has emerged as the top-performing blockchain by app revenue, generating 4USDT.67 million within the past 24 hours, surpassing Ethereum's $3.82 million. The data reflects an impressive uptick in on-chain activity, as Solana continues to dominate DeFi protocols, NFT markets, and meme coin trading.

Trailing behind are Hyperliquid L1 with $3.42 million, Edgex with $1.68 million, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with $1.56 million, and Base with $1.45 million. The ranking highlights how Solana's high-speed, low-fee architecture is yielding tangible network revenue, reinforcing its position as one of the most actively used blockchains in the current market cycle.

Rising On-Chain Activity Fuels SOL's Price Momentum

The increase in network revenue appears to be boosting Solana's market sentiment, with the SOL price trading near $200 after recent gains. Analysts suggest that the network's robust revenue and usage metrics are supporting a bullish outlook, as high user activity typically drives demand for SOL tokens used in transactions and staking.

According to market observers, Solana's consistent on-chain performance reflects sustainable ecosystem growth, not just speculative hype. The network's combination of scalability, throughput, and developer engagement has attracted a surge of liquidity into its DeFi and NFT sectors, while trading activity around Solana-based meme coins continues to add to overall fee revenue.

Can SOL Price Break Above $200 Resistance?

Solana SOLUSDT is showing renewed strength as the price rebounds toward the key $200 level, reclaiming lost momentum after a recent market correction. The bullish recovery comes alongside rising network activity and strong app revenue, reinforcing investor confidence. Traders are watching closely as SOL attempts to sustain above its short-term resistance, which could confirm a potential breakout. Meanwhile, consistent buying volume and improved sentiment suggest growing optimism that Solana may extend its upward trajectory in the coming sessions.

The SOL/USDT chart shows a strong rebound from the ascending trendline support near $184, with price now testing the $199–$203 resistance zone. Bollinger Bands indicate expanding volatility, while the price trades near the midline, hinting at a potential breakout. The 50-day SMA acts as dynamic resistance, and a close above it could accelerate gains toward $220. Volume remains moderate, and the CMF hovering around neutral suggests cautious accumulation—confirming momentum building but not yet a full bullish confirmation.

Conclusion 

Solana's technical setup and rising network fundamentals paint a cautiously bullish outlook for the days ahead. A sustained close above $200 could trigger fresh buying momentum, potentially pushing the SOL price toward $220. However, failure to hold above the support at $184 may invite short-term profit-taking. With on-chain revenue surging and investor sentiment improving, Solana remains one of the most-watched altcoins in the crypto market today, signaling growing strength as it continues to challenge major resistance levels.

FAQs

Solana shows strong potential with its high network revenue and growing user activity. However, all crypto investments are volatile and require careful personal research.

Solana's price rise is supported by its top-ranked blockchain app revenue, increased DeFi and NFT usage, and positive market sentiment from its high-speed, low-fee network.

Analysts suggest a sustained break above the $200 resistance level could open a path for Solana's price to rally toward the $220 mark in the near term.

CLEVELAND, Ohio - 
    The U.S. government is taking the final legal step to take ownership of $325,060 worth of cryptocurrency that was stolen in a scam that cost an elderly man and his sister from Bristolville over $1.6 million.

The federal prosecutor's office has asked a court for a Final Order of Forfeiture, which will officially give the government control of the stolen funds.

The money targeted in the legal action targets what's known as Tether (USDT). Tether is a type of digital currency designed to keep a steady value, usually matching the U.S. dollar one-to-one. This stability makes it act like a digital dollar.

These digital funds were traced to an address on the public digital ledger, or decentralized record book, that keeps track of where all the cryptocurrency goes. Federal officials argue the funds must be seized because they are the profits of wire fraud and were used in money laundering.

The victims are identified in court documents by their initials: J.K., the elderly man from Trumbull County, and his sister, L.D.

The fraud started in November 2024 with a text message to J.K. The scammer convinced him to move their conversation to Telegram, an encrypted messaging app.

Using the username "Shaw Goddess," the scammer cultivated J.K.'s trust and persuaded him to invest in a fake cryptocurrency platform. J.K. ultimately wired over $1 million of his savings. He also convinced his sister, L.D., to invest an additional $600,000 in the same scheme.

The siblings discovered the scam when they tried to pull out their supposed earnings. When L.D. was told she had to pay a 10% tax upfront to get her money, J.K. became suspicious and realized they had been victims of a massive fraud.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation tracked the transactions on the public digital ledger to find part of the money. They successfully traced about 198,950 USDT of J.K.'s lost funds to the cryptocurrency address in question.

The government argues the total balance of 325,060 USDT should all be seized because J.K.'s stolen money was mixed, or commingled, with other illegal funds, which counts as money laundering.

The 325,060 USDT was frozen late last year by the company that issues Tether and was later formally seized by law enforcement. Since the unknown owner of the digital currency address failed to challenge the seizure in court, the forfeiture is set to become final.

The Bristolville victims, J.K. and L.D., will not be able to directly object to the forfeiture, but they have a clear path to get their money back through the U.S. Department of Justice's remission process. The program is designed to return forfeited money to victims on a proportionate basis. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office plan to help the siblings with the necessary paperwork to recover their lost funds.

Oops, something went wrong

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has decided to focus development of the e-HKD on wholesale applications because the central bank digital currency (CBDC) has stronger potential value in large transactions than in daily retail use.

The city's de facto central bank announced the decision on Tuesday after a second phase of e-HKD trials that tested its usability and efficiency in both retail and wholesale scenarios over the past year. A CBDC is a digital version of a fiat currency built using blockchain technology.

The e-HKD "is not the only single instrument that can be used [in retail cases]," said Howard Lee Tat-chi, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, at a media briefing. Merchants and individuals could use programmable deposits and perhaps stablecoins for transactions, he said, adding that a specific role for the e-HKD was "not very apparent".

However, the digital currency was "free of credit risks and hence desirable to be used by financial institutions in large-valued transactions," he said.

Financial institutions had used the e-HKD for wholesale interbank cross-border settlement and securities transactions, Lee said. The authority said it hoped to attract more large financial institutions and companies to join future e-HKD pilot projects.

The HKMA did not give a concrete timeline on when the e-HKD would be applied at the wholesale level. The roll-out would depend on "the movement of advanced technology" and the different use cases that develop, as well as "the attitude of users towards central bank digital money", Lee said.

"We are encouraged to see that the e-HKD has gradually been used in more wholesale applications by financial institutions," said Eddie Yue, chief executive of the HKMA, in a statement. "We will continue to ensure Hong Kong is well prepared for the potential future extension of the e-HKD in retail scenarios."

The HKMA looked forward to continuing its close partnership with the industry on its "CBDC and tokenisation journey", he added.

The second phase of trials, which compared e-HKD with other payment methods and tokenised deposits, found that both e-HKD and tokenised deposits could deliver similar benefits by enabling cost-efficient, programmable and resilient transactions in retail cases, the HKMA said.

The e-HKD and tokenised deposits were perceived similarly by the public, given the high level of trust in Hong Kong's stable banking system, thanks to its robust supervisory regime and strong consumer protections, Lee said.

Before moving to real applications of e-HKD in retail cases, the HKMA is preparing and testing common token standards. This preparatory work was expected to be complete by the first half of next year, but a specific timetable for implementation would depend on market demand, international developments and technology evolution, the HKMA said.

Under the second-phase trials, 11 companies conducted studies on the settlement of tokenised assets, programmability and offline payments. Participants included Bank of Communications (Hong Kong), China Mobile, BlackRock, DBS, ICBC (Asia), HSBC and Hang Seng Bank.

During the initial phase of the e-HKD pilot programme, which wrapped up in October 2023, the HKMA explored applications in cross-border payment settlement via the mBridge project with the People's Bank of China, the central banks of Thailand and the United Arab Emirates, and the BIS Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre.

Quick Facts:

Yesterday, leading credit rating agency S&P Global revealed its ‘B-' rating for Strategy, the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company.

While the rating still falls under the agency's ‘speculative grade' investment, it establishes Strategy's status as a legitimate investment, although slightly riskier than those with higher ratings.

By extension, it also puts Bitcoin ($BTC) under the radar of investors who wish to dabble in the cryptocurrency either as a direct or indirect holder of the asset.

And for the more risk-on retail investors, this also boosts attention on some of the best altcoins, particularly Bitcoin-related ones like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER). See the full context below.

S&P released its ‘B-' credit rating for Strategy on October 27, citing its ‘high Bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low US dollar liquidity,' as weaknesses.

However, the agency added that it's confident that the Michael Saylor-led treasury company will continue to manage its debt well and finance payments of its debt and stock dividends.

In other words, the outlook for Strategy is stable despite some risks on the horizon.

As such, the news has huge potential to pump $BTC. This institutional spotlight doesn't just benefit Strategy and Bitcoin, though, but could spill over to the broader crypto market.

Bitcoin-related projects in particular, including those looking to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem, could attract more players looking for wider crypto exposure.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one such example — an emerging altcoin project building a network specifically for upscaling Bitcoin. Having recently surpassed $25M in presale, this crypto is proof of bubbling enthusiasm among retail investors.

While crypto-related investments are deemed high-risk compared to more stable ones like bonds, they continue to attract investors because of their high yield potential. And no crypto has grabbed the headlines more than Bitcoin.

But as the world's most valuable crypto, Bitcoin is not without its drawbacks. For one, it can only handle seven transactions per second (TPS), resulting in high transaction costs. In contrast, Solana can theoretically handle up to 65K TPS.

$BTC's use is also limited to being a store of value. This means that you can't, for example, use your $BTC freely across programmable smart contracts and DeFi platforms — the type of utility that the best altcoins usually provide.

It will also enable Solana-style smart contracts for various use cases, from lending platforms to meme coin launchpads.



💡See our page on ‘What is Bitcoin Hyper?' to learn more about the project.

The new ecosystem will also feature a canonical bridge, which will enable you to send your $BTC from the main Bitcoin blockchain to the L2 and use it for things like staking, trading, and interacting with dApps.

See Bitcoin Hyper's page for further information.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the native token fueling this emerging ecosystem.

When the L2 launches, you'll be able to use $HYPER to pay for transaction fees, get perks like governance rights, and access exclusive early dApp rollouts.

But for now, $HYPER is still on presale, raising the funds for its L2 mission. The token costs $0.013185, and still comes with dynamic staking rewards of up to 47% p.a.

To date, this crypto fundraiser has received over $25M from early adopters. The project has even recorded massive whale buys of up to $379.9K, making it one of this year's best crypto presales if we're talking community trust and bullish momentum.

But time is running out, as the token's listing is targeted for Q4 2025/Q1 2026. A presale price increase is also due in less than two days.

Ferrari has just unveiled the world's first digital hypercar – a car that lives solely as an NFT, a digital file permanently embedded in the blockchain. However, the automaker insists that the F76 gives us a true taste of what to expect from future real-world models. It commemorates 76 years since Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon won the 24 Hours of Le Mans with their 1949 166 MM Barchetta.



The F76 has two narrow cockpits side by side, separated by a somewhat deep tunnel right in the middle. Air enters from the front, splits around the occupants, and escapes via the back between the two tail fins. Ferrari refers to this design as a “wing,” and it is a fairly ingenious bit of magic. The tunnel floor descends so low that it creates a suction effect, pulling the car down towards the earth just through wind. Then, another “wing” connects the two tail fins, allowing wind to rush in and feed into a diffuser that has been painstakingly sculpted out to resemble a canyon. Classic Ferrari-style, four circular taillights sit right in the center of that bridge, glowing against a matte red background.

The front end appears to be really angry, as Ferrari is known to do on some of their vehicles. A thin band hovers above the splitter, with no evident means of support. Down below, the body folds in on itself, generating ramps that go into the tunnel and side ducts. The retractable headlights are scarcely visible beneath this band; when needed, they flip up in pairs. Then there are these vertical slashes etched into the sides, similar to those found on the new F80 hypercar, but they are deeper and expose the underlying structure, similar to staring at exposed bone.


Ferrari built this special F76 just for a bunch of its Hyperclub members – a private group that's pretty keen on following the 499P Le Mans racing effort. These buyers get to choose from a few different liveries, wheels and interior trim options – but only at set times. Once they make their selection, the digital file gets locked down as a unique NFT. No two of them are the same, and trust us, none of them will ever be given the key to life in the real world.


When you sit in the F76, the driver gets the controls – and the passenger gets the same controls, all linked up through software. Every single steering input, every pedal press – it's all mirrored in real time between the two seats. Ferrari believes this is the ideal approach for both occupants to feel the same forces at the same moment, despite the fact that there are no forces to speak of. The dashboards in the images are quite plain, with no fancy screens or gauges to be found – just waiting for a game engine that may never be built.


Generative software shaped every surface. Algorithms grew the structure outward from a skeleton of requirements: minimum drag, maximum downforce, cooling for invisible engines. The result carries patents Ferrari plans to file. Metal versions of those ideas could appear on road cars within a decade. The result is a car that's got a whole bunch of patents waiting to be filed – and who knows, maybe one day we'll see some of these ideas turn up on road cars.


Ferrari has dabbled in digital art before, but never a complete vehicle like the F76 before. This time around, they're really crossing that line from just a fancy poster to a full-on product. Owners can keep it locked away safely in a digital wallet alongside their cryptocurrency, sell it to someone else on the secondary market or just park it in a virtual garage. The company's not saying how many of these things are out there, or what they cost either. Membership to the Hyperclub is by invitation only – and it looks like getting invited is a bit of a tricky business.

Asia seems to have definitely shifted into second gear in terms of crypto adoption. One by one, states are rising, brushing aside clichés about their supposed technological lag. Today, it is a small Central Asian country, often discreet but strategically positioned, that marks its presence on the global digital map. Kyrgyzstan, with its majestic mountains and digital ambitions, has just taken a giant step into the world of crypto assets. And this is not just a publicity stunt.

In 2023, Kyrgyzstan had already surprised by supporting crypto mining despite a persistent energy crisis. KGST, a stablecoin backed by the Kyrgyz som, was officially launched on the BNB Chain, aiming to boost the local economy and lay the foundations of a sovereign digital ecosystem. This initiative is part of a broader strategy integrating a CBDC – the “digital som” – which will be tested in three phases, notably for social, state payments, and then offline mode.

Following this, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, confirmed on X: “The National Stablecoin launched, on @BNBChain. The CBDC is ready for rollout. Yes, both. CBDC will be used for gov related payments, etc”

This project is accompanied by a clear political will. President Sadyr Japarov, during the second National Council on Digital Assets, set an ambitious roadmap, ranging from blockchain infrastructure to legislation. The digital som, already registered in the country's digital asset register, could receive full legal status by 2026. The crypto shift is underway.

Another major Kyrgyz innovation is based on the creation of a national crypto reserve, including BNB, but also potentially other tokens in the future. The objective: to diversify the country's financial resources while participating in the global digital economy. This reserve could well become a strategic pillar, complementing traditional monetary policies.

But that's not all. The government has signed a partnership with Binance Academy to integrate blockchain into 10 local universities. The president also ordered the Ministry of Education to prepare a national digital literacy plan. The Binance app is now translated into Kyrgyz, and a meetup of 1,000 people took place in Bishkek, proof of local enthusiasm.

On X, the president expressed his commitment:

We successfully held the second meeting of the National Council for the Development of Virtual Assets and Blockchain Technologies. Following the meeting, key tasks for the near future were defined.

Asia definitely does not miss any digital train. While the West hesitates, Kyrgyzstan confirms that the Central Asian nations have begun to embrace bitcoin and build alternative monetary systems. A deliberate shift, where each stablecoin becomes a stone in the pond of the dollar king.

 US Representative Ro Khanna is looking to introduce a bill to restrict all elected officials from trading stocks and crypto, citing conflicts of interest. 

A US lawmaker is seeking to ban US President Donald Trump, his family, and members of Congress from trading crypto or stocks.

US Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat representative from California's 17th Congressional District and vice-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, used an appearance on MSNBC to raise concerns around Trump's apparent conflict of interest with crypto via his son's crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI), alleging the recent pardoning of Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao was “blatant corruption.”

“You've got a foreign billionaire who was basically engaged in money-laundering,” Khanna said of CZ, adding, “then he petitions for a pardon from Donald Trump after basically funneling money to terrorists.” 

However, CZ recently fired back at similar accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, claiming she “can't get her facts right.” 

CZ pleaded guilty to a single felony count of violating the US Bank Secrecy Act after failing to maintain an effective Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program at Binance. 

Khanna alleged that the Binance co-founder was being let off the hook due to Binance's financial backing of WLFI — echoing recent sentiments from US Representative Maxine Waters.   

Trump has faced criticism for his ties to WLFI on multiple occasions; however, his son Eric Trump has consistently denied that his father has any connection to the project. In an interview in September, Eric stressed that his father “is running a nation. He's not involved in our businesses in any way, shape or form."

Khanna did not go into specific details of his legislative proposal, but did not mince his words, concluding by calling for a ban on “any elected official from having cryptocurrency and accepting foreign money.” 

According to government records, Khanna's latest bill has not yet been officially introduced.

The issue of whether government officials should be allowed to make investments in areas such as the stock market has been highly contested for some time.

The debate currently rages on in the US via the bipartisan congressional stock trading bill, which is expected to be voted on soon.   

To provide context on how muddied the waters are, while Khanna has called out Trump's ties to crypto, he also has some vested interests of his own in the stock market, highlighting some potential hypocrisy.  

According to data from Quiver Quant, Khanna himself has notched up $80.3 million worth of stock trade volume in 2025. 

Since becoming a California representative in 2017, Khanna has made over 35,000 trades that account for more than $580 million in total volume, with his top three traded sectors being financials, information technology and healthcare.

 S&P Global Ratings said Strategy's high Bitcoin concentration and low US dollar liquidity, among other factors, are weaknesses for the firm. 

S&P Global Ratings has given Michael Saylor's Strategy a “B-” credit rating, placing it in the speculative, non-investment-grade territory — often referred to as a “junk bond” — although it said the Bitcoin treasury company's outlook remains stable.

“We view Strategy's high bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low US dollar liquidity as weaknesses,” the credit rating platform said in a review of Strategy on Monday.

Strategy has accumulated its 640,808 BTC treasury mainly via equity and debt financing. The stable outlook assumes the company will prudently manage convertible debt maturities and maintain preferred stock dividends, potentially through additional debt issuance, it said.

S&P Global highlighted that Strategy faces an “inherent currency mismatch,” with all debt due in US dollars while much of its dollar reserves are allocated to fund its software business, which operates at approximately breakeven in earnings and cash flow.

The credit rating is significant as it marks the first time a Bitcoin‑treasury-focused company has received an S&P Global assessment — establishing a benchmark for TradFi to evaluate the credit risk of companies that center their business models around Bitcoin and crypto.

Strategy received the same score as decentralized stablecoin issuer Sky Protocol, previously MakerDAO, in August. 

S&P Global pointed to Sky Protocol's high depositor concentration, centralized governance and weak capitalization to justify the B-minus rating.

Strategy's B-minus rating will need to bump up six levels — to BBB-minus —  in order to escape the “junk bond” zone.

The latest rating comes as Strategy was one of the Nasdaq's best-performing stocks in 2024, rallying 430%. MSTR has, however, retraced 13% so far in 2025, according to Google Finance data.

That includes a 2.27% rise on Monday, indicating that S&P Global's rating didn't hurt the company's share price.

While S&P Global said an upgrade in the next 12 months is unlikely, it noted that it could raise the ratings if Strategy improves its US dollar liquidity, eases convertible debt, and continues to demonstrate strong access to capital markets, including when Bitcoin retraces.

However, S&P Global said there's a risk that Strategy's convertible debt may be due at a time of a “severe Bitcoin stress,” forcing them to liquidate some of its Bitcoin at “depressed prices.”

Strategy's score could also fall lower if its access to capital markets weakens, crunching its ability to raise funds and continue its Bitcoin strategy.

UFOs Are Just One Explanation for Mysterious Patterns in Old Telescope Data

New peer-reviewed research reporting strange lights in the pre-space-age sky is sparking curiosity and controversy

By Jonathan O'Callaghan edited by Lee Billings

For generations, UFO enthusiasts have longed for claims of aliens visiting Earth to be seriously investigated by scientists. Now they are getting their wish. This month prominent peer-reviewed journals have published two papers that link apparent flashes of light seen by a telescope 70 years ago to potential artificial objects in space. But there are many simpler explanations, providing an opportunity for UFO enthusiasts to see how extraordinary claims are tested—and often undone—by ordinary science.

“I think there are many in the UFO community who really want to know what's going on,” says Adam Frank, an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester, who has written frequently about the prospects of alien life. “I think it is worthwhile for us to have these open, transparent investigations. This is a great way to show people how science works.”

Beatriz Villarroel, an astronomer and theoretical physicist at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Sweden, is the driving force behind both papers. The first was published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports on October 20, after a six-month peer review process, and the second was published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific on October 17, after a shorter review process. Both concern data gathered at the Palomar Observatory in California from 1949 to 1958 for a project called the Palomar Sky Survey, which was one of the first detailed astronomical surveys of the sky.

About 2,000 photographic plates were used as part of the survey. Each was a glass sheet coated in an emulsion, or a layer of chemicals, that reacted to incoming light, mostly from stars across the sky. This was the main method of recording astronomical images before the advent of digital cameras. Each photographic plate was the size of a vinyl record cover and was physically lifted into and removed from the telescope that conducted the survey, the 1.2-meter Palomar Schmidt telescope, later renamed the Samuel Oschin Telescope. The plates were digitized in the 1990s and 2000s.

Villarroel and her team used the digitized scans to study the night sky as it was before the 1957 launch of the first artificial satellite, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, to eliminate the possibility of seeing space-based interference from human activity. They used image processing software to look for transients—short-lived celestial events, such as stars flaring in brightness or fading from view, that are often associated with extreme astrophysics. Under the auspices of Villarroel's Vanishing & Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project, they identified more than 107,000 transients.

In principle, besides fluctuating stars transients can be associated with other things, too, such as extreme space weather events impinging on the upper atmosphere, sunlight glinting off reflective objects near Earth, as well as flaws in the telescope or the imaging process. Among the events that the researchers identified, they noted several examples where multiple transients appeared aligned in a straight line across a single photographic plate, a configuration that Villarroel argues is unlikely to occur by any known natural phenomenon. (Other experts, such as Princeton University astrophysicist Robert Lupton, say that finding several such patterns in thousands of star-spangled plates could easily be mere coincidence.)

In the Scientific Reports paper, Villarroel and Stephen Bruehl, a Vanderbilt University Medical Center anesthesiologist with an interest in UFOs, found that many of the transients occurred on or near dates of nuclear testing, with multiple nuclear test sites known to be near the Palomar Observatory at the time. They wrote that transients appeared to be 45 percent more likely on dates within 24 hours of a nuclear test. “On days when there was no nuclear test, you saw transients on 11 percent of those days,” says Bruehl, the paper's lead author. “On the day after a nuclear test, you saw transients on almost 19 percent of those days.” From the 2,718 days of observations made by the Palomar Sky Survey, Villarroel's team identified transients occurring on 310 days, with the most being 4,528 transients in one day.

In their paper, Bruehl and Villarroel linked these transients to global reports of UFO sightings and found a small association, with transients being identified on the same day as a UFO, or UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomenon), sighting. They claimed an 8.5 percent increase in the number of transients identified on days with UAP reports and suggested this might mean the two were linked, referencing “a well-known strand of UAP lore suggesting that nuclear weapons may attract UAP” to observe the events.

A candidate transient is highlighted (blue circles) in this figure from an associated paper by Beatriz Villarroel and colleagues. Derived from digital scans of photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey and color-inverted to emphasize detail, these images show what the authors say could be flashes of light from artificial objects in outer space, years before humans sent spacecraft into Earth orbit.

“Aligned, Multiple-Transient Events in the First Palomar Sky Survey,” by Beatriz Villarroel et al., in Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Vol. 137; October 2025 (CC BY 4.0)

The link to nuclear weapons can be simpler, says Michael Wiescher, a nuclear astrophysicist at the University of Notre Dame in France. “Nuclear tests obviously have an impact on the atmosphere,” he says. For example, the first telecommunications satellite, NASA's Telstar 1, was knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse from the American high-altitude nuclear test Starfish Prime in November 1962. Nuclear tests can also leave “a lot of junk in the outer atmosphere,” Wiescher says, such as bits of metal and radioactive dust, that could appear briefly as starlike bursts of radiance to a telescope.

In their Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific paper, Villarroel and her team suggested that the number of transients dropped by about 30 percent in regions of the overhead sky that would have fallen within Earth's umbral shadow, directly in line with the sun. This pattern could be explained if the transients were caused by sunlight-reflecting objects that were orbiting Earth, they wrote. “It looks like we are dealing with something that looks pretty artificial in a time when there shouldn't be anything there,” Villarroel says.

Each photographic plate took a 50-minute exposure of the sky, leading Villarroel to suggest that these putative objects were stationary in space, possibly in geostationary orbit some 22,000 miles (35,000 kilometers) above Earth. Bright objects in lower orbits—or other less sensational possibilities such as meteors—would have left a streak instead of a starlike dot of light, she says.

Frank says that the two papers are a chance for scientists to have something tangible to scrutinize regarding UFOs. Often, he says, evidence has been little more than “fuzzy blob photos” or hearsay. “What's interesting about these two papers is: they played by the rules by which science can evaluate evidence,” he adds, referencing Carl Sagan's famous adage that “extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

Whether there is “extraordinary evidence” here is up for some debate. The papers were not accepted by arXiv.org, an online preprint server where nonpaywalled scientific papers are often uploaded, with the website noting to Villarroel that the Scientific Reports paper in particular “does not contain sufficient or substantive scholarly research.”

There are also a host of simpler explanations for Villaroel's transients—which have drawn previous scrutiny from skeptical astronomers—that don't require the extraordinary claim of UFOs. Sean Kirkpatrick, who was head of the Pentagon's UFO-investigating All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) from July 2022 to December 2023, says he thinks the link to nuclear testing and Earth's shadow is key. “Taken together, that tells me that these transients have both a solar and nuclear overlap,” he says. “The first thing that comes to mind is solar flare radiation or ionized particle radiation from nuclear testing,” split-second bursts of light in the upper atmosphere that would manifest as a point source rather than a streak. Another possible explanation is high-altitude balloons, which were used to do nuclear monitoring. “You're going to have a lot of those around nuclear testing, and so if people see them, a lot of people are going to report them,” he says.

Kirkpatrick says Villarroel and her team could use today's geostationary satellites to see if they could reproduce the transients seen by Palomar, building a replica photographic plate and determining if it produces similar transients from known orbiting objects. “What they have not done is prove this technique works on today's geostationary objects,” he says. If it does, that could open the avenue to other non-UAP explanations to explore, such as pieces of sunlight-catching ice or rock lingering in trapped orbits far above Earth. “There are things that get captured up there and just kind of float around,” Kirkpatrick says.

There are astronomical explanations, too, Lupton says, because “things go bang and vary all over the place.” He points to the example of gamma-ray bursts, extremely bright cosmic explosions that were discovered serendipitously by nuclear-monitoring satellites in the 1960s. “We were trying to see if the Russians were [secretly] blowing up nuclear weapons, and it turned out to be stars destroying themselves on the other side of the universe,” he says. The Vera C. Rubin Telescope in Chile is expected to find millions of transients from supernovae—exploding stars—alone, among many other types of transients, when it begins a 10-year survey of the sky later this year.

The most prosaic explanation is that Villarroel's transients are simply artifacts in the photographic plates such as speckles of dust, blobs in the emulsion or even radioactive particles. Nigel Hambly, an astronomer at the University of Edinburgh, who has previously analyzed Villarroel's work and who has extensive experience with photographic plates from Palomar and other observatories, says one way to check would be to study the original plates themselves rather than using digital copies. “I've been caught out many times by apparently real things turning up in my data,” he says, especially when working with plates that weren't stored in pristine conditions. “When you actually physically examine the plates under a microscope, you begin to get a feeling for what's real and what's spurious,” he says. “There's no shame in being wrong.”

Eliot Gillum, director of optical SETI (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) at the SETI Institute in California, says that whatever the transients really are, it will be interesting to apply the scientific process to them. “It's wonderful to take a set of phenomena we don't understand and study them,” he says. He adds that Villarroel and her team could test their same methodology on other photographic plate archives to see if the transients show up elsewhere. “There are plenty of other sets of digitized plates,” Gillum says. “It's quite possible that there are multiple causes here. It would be great to figure them out.” He says that another possibility could be meteors that flew straight down into the telescope's view rather than across it; that would make the objects appear as dots of light instead of streaks.

Villarroel says that she welcomes alternative ideas for what these transients might be. “Even if this turns out to be some new physical phenomenon, that's super exciting,” she says. “That would mean we have discovered something new that nobody knew existed.” If that does turn out to be the case, there are plenty of other searches for extraterrestrials—such as NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory—that can whet the appetite of those longing for signs of life elsewhere in the cosmos.

“It's one of the most important scientific questions that we have,” Frank says. “The great thing is: we now finally have the capacity to start answering this.”

In this 4.4-million-year-old skeleton, scientists may have found the missing step between climbing and walking.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

As humans, it's important to remember that some of our oldest primate ancestors were apelike creatures. Besides our much larger brains and visibly obvious differences, such as facial features, one thing we evolved to be much more adept at than chimps and gorillas (which we diverged from millions of years ago) is walking on two feet. But just when did human predecessors first descend from the trees and walk upright?

A 4.4-million-year-old female skeleton named Ardi may answer that question. Predating even the iconic Lucy by a million years, she belongs to the species Ardipithecus ramidus, and is revealing more about our origins and how we became bipedal. 

Unearthed in the Ethiopian desert back in 1994, Ardi is the oldest known partial hominin skeleton, though her species has been known since 1925 under the name Australopithecus ramidus. Biological anthropologist Thomas Prang of Washington University in St. Louis and his research team discovered that Ardi was able to walk upright but still retained a grasping foot and other apelike features.

“Our observations of the human and ape fossil record are inconsistent with recently proposed models of human origins, which envision the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees as a generalized arboreal ape,” he said in a study recently published in Communications Biology. “Instead, our results strongly imply that humans evolved from an African ape-like ancestor.”

Homo sapiens belong to the Homo-Pan clade, a group that evolved from a common ancestor and includes chimpanzees, bonobos and both extant and extinct hominin species. This is part of a larger clade that gorillas also belong to. It has been argued that Ar. ramidus was more humanlike than apelike, and had already evolved out of climbing trees vertically and dropping to all fours and walking on its knuckles in order to get around on land. 

What Prang found was that Ardi is a mashup of primitive and modern features. She has a big toe designed for grasping branches, but other features of her feet, cranial base and pelvis suggest that her species was adapting to bipedalism. There is one bone that especially stands out: Ardi's talus, a bone in the ankle which is also the second largest bone in the back of the foot. It transfers body weight between the lower leg and foot and helps African apes climb. The talus enables dorsiflexion, or the backwards flexing of the foot, and inversion, the sideways turning of the foot. Both put the animal's center of mass in a position closer to support, so apes are at much less risk of suffering lethal backward falls. 

In ape species that primarily climb trees and primarily use dorsiflexion for vertical climbing, the forefoot is shorter than those of bipeds and quadrupeds, so Prang's team turned its focus to the front of Ardi's foot and also figured out her approximate body mass using the widths of the talar trochlea, or the upper joint surface of the talus. There have been previous arguments that the morphology of the talar trochlea may not be the greatest indicator of how apes and early humans moved. Gorillas, chimps, bonobos and gibbons have short forefeet for their body masses, while orangutans and larger monkeys have the longest forefeet. The human forefoot is longer than those of chimps and gorillas and shorter than those monkeys, but there is still some overlap with bonobos. 

African apes and monkeys with longer feet should have a wider talar trochlea, just as humans also have a wide talar trochlea for their forefoot length and body mass. In Ardi, the talar trochlea is wide relative to her estimated body mass, while the width of this bone in the back is similar to that of chimps and humans. There are aspects of Ardi's talus that appear in extant chimps, gorillas and monkeys. In apes and monkeys, these features indicate plantigrade quadrupedalism, or the ability to walk on all fours with the soles of the feet. While Ardi displays some of these qualities, her feet had evolved further. It showed improved mechanisms for propulsion that would become necessary for us to walk on two feet. 

“The [Ardi] talus is not entirely African ape-like because it displays hominin-like modifications [in some features],” the researchers said. “Collectively, these results are inconsistent with human and chimpanzee evolution from a generalized arboreal ancestor that lacked adaptations for terrestrial quadrupedalism, vertical climbing, and suspension.”

From the trees to four feet on the ground to two feet, hominins differentiated themselves from apes and monkeys as they developed feet suited less to grasping and more to holding up their weight on the ground. This might just be how we finally stood up.

Physicists Propose a Simpler, Hotter Origin for the Cosmos

Theorists have found that a “warm” version of cosmic inflation is consistent with known physics, linking it to the hunt for dark matter

By Stephanie Pappas edited by Lee Billings

Flavio Coelho/Getty Images

For a fraction of a second after the big bang occurred 13.8 billion years ago, most physicists believe, the newborn universe dramatically ballooned in size, jumping from being smaller than a proton to being bigger than a softball. Such an exponential expansion may seem minor, but it is equivalent to a grape in the palm of your hand swelling to become tens of thousands of times larger than the observable universe. Known as cosmic inflation, this strange, fleeting period is usually considered to have been an expansion of near nothingness because, at the time, most of the universe's elementary particles had yet to blink into existence. In other words, the standard view of cosmic inflation suggests the universe didn't really begin as a hot, dense fireball but rather as a cold void that only later reheated into a plasmatic soup of particles by some poorly understood process.

But a new theoretical study published in the journal Physical Review Letters suggests that inflation may have been warm from the start. In fact, the researchers find, a warm period of inflation that began to populate the universe with matter could have naturally arisen from interactions within physics' Standard Model, the theory that describes the fundamental forces and elementary particles in the universe.

“What we have shown with this paper is that actually being warm during inflation is extremely generic and extremely simple,” says its lead author Kim Berghaus, a postdoctoral scholar in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology. The solution to the problem of cold inflation requires only one unconfirmed type of particle, she says. “It takes us to this footing of ‘This may have actually occurred in nature, and we can go look for it,'” Berghaus adds.

Inflation itself is a big mystery. Most physicists think it happened in the first 0.00000000000000000000000000000001 second (10–32 second) of cosmic time, by which point the universe had expanded by a factor of as much as 1050. The reason anyone takes this mind-boggling idea seriously is that it would explain what the big bang alone can't—namely, why the universe appears so extremely uniform at very large scales. Studies of the big bang's afterglow—an all-sky whisper of radiation called the cosmic microwave background, or CMB—show it to be basically the same everywhere. The most straightforward way to account for this preternatural smoothness is a period of inflation that provides time for the baby universe to reach a uniform temperature.

Meanwhile inflation would also have magnified tiny random fluctuations in the early universe, creating density variations in the primordial plasma. These acted as seeds for cosmic structures; as their gravity glommed together more matter, denser regions would eventually grow to become star-filled galaxies and galaxy clusters.

As of yet, there is no direct observational evidence for inflation, so sorting out its details is a task for theorists. Initially, physicists envisioned inflation as a cold process that involved energy fields that permeated all of space. It was powered by a field with high potential energy, called the inflaton field, which behaved a bit like a ball rolling down a hill and transforming its potential energy into kinetic energy as it descends. In the beginning, this “hill” was gentle, almost flat, and as the inflaton “ball” rolled down, the exponentially expanding universe rapidly became less dense. The “hill” eventually bottomed out when the expanding universe was diluted to nearly a vacuum. At this point, the rolling inflaton “ball” could essentially carom around the resulting “valley,” unleashing its kinetic energy to create many elementary particles and reheat the universe. Only then did the “newborn universe as fireball” scenario proceed.

But precisely how this reheating step would have occurred wasn't well-understood, says Vahid Kamali, a visiting professor at McGill University and an associate professor at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, who studies early-universe cosmology and wasn't involved in the new research. Physicists wondered if this step was needed or if there was a way for the whole inflationary process to stay warm.

Arjun Berera, a theoretical physicist at the University of Edinburgh, who was also not involved in the new study, was the first to propose warm inflation in 1995. Cold inflation was in some ways too simple, Berera says. “When systems interact, we expect there to be friction and particle production,” he says. “And inflation, in the standard picture, didn't have that.”

Berera's first model was initially dismissed. Critics argued that warm inflation would have effectively burned itself out, prematurely churning out interacting particles that would have sapped its potential energy. In the hill analogy, the inflaton “ball” would have suddenly plunged down a too-steep slope, bringing the whole process to an abrupt end.

“The challenge has always been how to find the model that produces the particles but doesn't make such a steep hill,” Berera says.

Berera and his colleagues published a paper in 2016 that found such a model using interactions and fields similar to those known in the Standard Model. Berghaus and her co-authors Marco Drewes of the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium and Sebastian Zell of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich take this a step further in their new paper, firmly situating warm inflation in the Standard Model itself. Their calculations show that a feeble interaction between the inflaton field and elementary particles called gluons would be sufficient to warm up inflation. Gluons carry the strong nuclear force, which glues together fundamental particles called quarks to make protons and neutrons.

“What they have done is to make this connection that you can have warm inflation with Standard Model interactions,” says Rudnei Ramos, a theoretical physicist at Rio de Janeiro State University in Brazil, who co-authored the 2016 paper but was not involved in the new study.

These Standard Model interactions would have heated the inflating universe, sidestepping the complication of needing a subsequent reheating phase. In cold inflation, the initial fluctuations are all inconceivably small and quantum, Berera says, and must later transition to larger, so-called classical interactions during the reheating. The trouble is that no one really understands how that process unfolds. But in warm inflation, “it's not a big issue,” he says, “because they're already classical.”

The new model has one key caveat: the particle that creates the inflaton field is not yet known to exist. It would be a very light, chargeless particle called an axion, Berghaus says. Physicists have been on the quest for axions for decades because some possible variants of these particles might constitute most or all of the universe's dark matter. There are hints that axions might exist, including a faint background glow in space that was detected by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2022. If they do exist, trillions of them should be afloat in every cubic centimeter of the solar system. Projects such as the Axion Dark Matter Experiment, a collaboration of the University of Washington, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other institutions, are currently hunting these particles by using intense magnetic fields to convert them to detectable microwave photons.

The new model's reliance on axions suggests that there are two avenues for eventual experimental validation—one via future surveys of the CMB to test some of the model's predictions and the other via ongoing laboratory-based searches for these elusive particles.

While the prospect of testability makes this new model very exciting, Kamali says, there is still much more to be done to reconcile it with other theories in cosmology. One example, he says, is that the size of the inflaton field in the new model doesn't match predictions from string theory. Even so, the allure of thoroughly explaining cosmic inflation within the Standard Model's well-known tenets is likely to prove irresistible for eager theorists and experimentalists alike.

“In our work, there is an opportunity for a discovery that can probe the connection between particle physics and the big bang,” Berghaus says. “Because our proposed theory connects intimately with the Standard Model, it is testable.”

Plant cell walls, such as in these root cells, not only act as physical containers but also contribute to important signalling processes. Credit: Biophoto Associates/SPL

When Robert Hooke gazed through his microscope at a slice of cork and coined the term ‘cell' in 1665, he was really looking at just the walls of the dead cells. The squishy contents typically found within would become objects of ongoing study. But for many plant scientists, the walls themselves faded into the background. They were considered passive containers for the exciting biology inside.

“For a long time, the cell wall was really thought to be dead,” says Alice Cheung, a plant molecular biologist and biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. It wasn't until the late twentieth century, Cheung says, that scientists began to reveal the cell wall for the vibrant, ever-changing structure it is. Even then, its complex mix of sugar molecules linked into long, branching polysaccharides kept away all but the most intrepid biochemists.

But now, with the help of modern molecular methods to analyse the wall's make-up and assembly, researchers are starting to uncover more. They're finding that the cell wall is an active, even chatty participant in cellular growth, reproduction and responses to infection. It's constantly receiving and sending signals about its shape and composition. By eavesdropping on those signals, and tweaking or adding to them, scientists are exploring innovative ways to improve agriculture with cell-wall science: protecting crops from disease and engineering new plants or sturdy hybrids.

“The plant cell wall is one of the most sophisticated systems in terms of communication,” says Li-Jia Qu, a plant biologist at Peking University in Beijing. His long-term goal is to use what's been learnt about those messages to interbreed distantly related plants, creating exciting crops that could expand agriculture into new lands.

The wall is the plant's interface with its environment, including salt and other stressors or disease agents such as moulds, so it must notice damage and adapt accordingly.

The cell walls of a growing plant are constructed mainly from polysaccharides, including stiff cables of cellulose and jellified strands of pectin. The latter are highly complex molecules, branched in diverse ways and decorated with various extras such as methyl groups. “It's like a giant bowl of many types of pasta, all mixed together,” says Charles Anderson, a plant cell biologist at Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) in State College.

And although the wall protects the contents within, some pathogens use enzymes to drill through it and infect the cells. This creates polysaccharide fragments that signal to the cell that something has breached the wall. When the cell senses these pieces, along with fragments of the infecting pathogen's cell wall, it activates genes in the plant's immune pathways. In response, the plant can produce an extra polysaccharide, called callose, which reinforces the cell wall. It also manufactures defensive molecules such as antimicrobial peptides and reactive oxygen species.

Such signals are already being co-opted by farmers. By spraying molecules derived from the cell walls of algae or fungi over their fields, they can prime the plants for pathogens that might arrive later. By doing this, they activate the immune response “and let the natural mechanism of the plant fight the infection”, says Antonio Molina, a plant biologist at the Technical University of Madrid. The method could help growers to avoid harsh fungicides, he says.

Molina has co-founded two companies that make use of this technique, making extracts from fungi or plants as crop protectives.

The current inoculants are fairly crude mixtures derived from plants or pathogens, says Cyril Zipfel, a plant immunologist at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. He's working to understand the signalling that underlies the immune pathway, which should enable scientists to create more specific, or even synthetic, treatments.

There are trade-offs, however, Molina says. For one, the effects last for only three or four weeks. Reapplication for slow-growing crops could get costly, but Molina thinks that farmers might be able to focus the use of inoculants to times when risk of infection is high, such as after it rains, to prevent mildew.

Another challenge is that whenever plants devote resources to boosting their defences, this takes materials and energy away from growth, so farmers must apply the treatments judiciously.

Plant growth itself demonstrates how the idea of a cell wall as a static shell is insufficient. Yes, the cell does need the wall as a physical container; otherwise, it would burst from the enormous water pressure inside it. But for plant cells to grow, the cell walls must expand first, says Sebastian Wolf, a plant molecular biologist at the University of Tübingen in Germany.

This is where pectin comes in. Pectin is a complicated molecule constructed from at least a dozen sugars, connected by more than 20 types of linkage, says Wolf. “It's actually so complex that we don't know what it looks like,” he adds. Pectin is also dynamic, undergoing frequent modifications. Depending on those modifications, it can be rigid, supporting a sturdy plant, or softer when the plant needs to grow. That's why pectin is often used to make marmalade: the initially soft pectin molecules cross-link and soak up water, taking on a stiffer, gelatinous consistency.

In the growing plant, there's one key modification that makes pectin soft or rigid: methyl groups attached to its component sugars. When the wall needs more materials for growth or reinforcement, the cell inside manufactures a methyl-decorated form that is thought to be fairly soluble, so it can be secreted into the surrounding wall. Once the pectin is incorporated into the wall, it starts to firm up. This happens when enzymes remove the methyls, uncovering negatively charged atoms in the sugar molecules underneath. Calcium ions in the wall bind to two sugars at a time and cross-link the pectin into a stiffer material that can absorb water.

As a graduate student at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in the early 2000s, Wolf was interested in the effects of methyl groups on pectin, so he made a mutant of the cress Arabidopsis thaliana, a favourite of plant geneticists, that was unable to take off the methyl groups. He expected this to soften the cell walls, but the plants came out weirder than anticipated, with long, wavy roots1. They reminded him of mutants with defects in cellular signalling involving cellulose, leading him to wonder whether pectin, too, had a role not just in cell-wall structure, but also in cellular conversations.

Continuing this research at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment in Versailles, Wolf discovered a cell-wall signal that contributes to plant growth controls1,2. The input that Wolf found starts when cell-surface receptors notice an overabundance of methyl-decorated pectin. What seems to happen in response is that they tell the cell to adjust its production pipelines, making more of the methyl--removing enzyme so that the wall can firm up the pectin.

Cell-wall signalling can even help growing cells to adopt fancy forms, including the puzzle-piece shapes seen in what are known as pavement cells — interlocking surface cells that give strength and structure to plant leaves (see ‘Cell walls fitting together'). When Anderson and his colleagues studied the signals sent by the cell wall as pavement cells developed in A. thaliana, they found evidence for another conversation initiated by methyl-free pectin and a receptor, called FERONIA, that senses this form of pectin3. But cellulose matters here, too. Both cell-wall components are needed to strengthen the indented portions of the puzzle piece, known as the ‘necks'. Without that fortification, the rest of the cell bulges into that space. If FERONIA isn't present, the indentations don't go as deep as they normally would.



Here's how they think the indentation process happens in a healthy leaf cell: methyl-free pectin in the cell wall is a sign that there's enough pectin to support a neck. This pectin sticks to a receptor complex on the cell surface that includes FERONIA. In response, the cell starts manufacturing cellulose in the same place. Together, the cellulose and pectin strengthen the wall so that it can support the indentation.

Wolf is continuing to investigate the role of the cell wall in shaping cells, and reported in a preprint earlier this year that plant stem cells must control the methyl status of wall pectin to maintain their stemness and form new plant parts4. He thinks that there is potential to use these signalling pathways to influence the way in which plants are shaped. “You can fundamentally change how plants grow and how they look,” he speculates. For example, when plants make less cellulose, they grow into “stubby” forms. But, he cautions, researchers need to learn more about the underlying growth pathways first.

The FERONIA receptor in those puzzle-piece cells has turned out to be a key player in cell-wall signalling. FERONIA is found all over plants, and interacts with a range of partners to influence not just leaf-cell shape, but also a variety of other systems, from root growth to environmental-stress responses. Given that FERONIA binds to pectin to maintain the wall's integrity, without it, the wall becomes weak and porous. Remarkably, mutants lacking FERONIA survive, although they're pretty unhealthy, Qu says: they sprout wrinkled, curly leaves, and straggle along the ground because they lack the vasculature to hold them upright. They are “very small, tiny”, says Qu. They can make seeds, he adds, “but very few”.

The disastrous flood of May 2023 in Emilia-Romagna, Italy, displaced thousands of residents and had severe impacts on the economy, with extensive damage to infrastructure—roads, buildings, bridges—and losses in agriculture and livestock. The flood was caused by two consecutive precipitation events, during which no hourly rainfall extremes were recorded, but for which accumulated rainfall over several days produced nonetheless extreme flooding, with a return period of over 500 years. The persistent, long-lasting precipitation was fueled by an uninterrupted vertically integrated water flux from the Adriatic Sea over the Po Valley, driven by a cyclonic circulation over Italy that remained stationary for several days. A “cul-de-sac” effect, due to mountains that blocked moisture fluxes from the Adriatic Sea, amplified rainfall and was a root cause of the disaster. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of this case study in the context of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, focusing on the role of the stationary cyclonic structure over Italy, a feature that also characterized a similar event over the same area in 2024. Furthermore, by examining the frequency of stationary cyclones in the Mediterranean region over recent decades, we are able to suggest that the persistent, dangerous configuration observed during the 2023 and 2024 events should be of concern to other Mediterranean areas that share similar conditions. A preliminary analysis also suggests that this class of events may become more frequent in a changing climate with important implications for the early warning systems.

One of the most common causes of floods is extreme precipitation. Several studies have argued that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of heavy rainfall events, which could in turn lead to more frequent and intense flooding. In fact, heavy precipitation events are generally expected to increase more than mean precipitation under a warmer climate, which is consistent with the higher capacity of warmer air to hold moisture1,2,3. This is also reflected in a larger portion of the Earth projected to experience increases in heavy precipitation under global warming, compared to mean precipitation2. However, flood risk is influenced by multiple factors, including soil moisture, land use, and runoff sensitivity to sea level, making it difficult to link changes in extreme precipitation to flood occurrence4.

The identification of moisture sources has been the focus of numerous studies5,6,7,8,9, contributing to a deeper understanding of the functioning of the hydrological cycle in different regions of the planet and providing insights into the role of synoptic-scale systems, such as atmospheric rivers and low-level jets. In this work we focus on a class of events in which the transport of moisture plays a crucial role in shaping precipitation patterns and, therefore, extreme flooding events. We do so by examining the case of the 2023 Emilia-Romagna flood in Italy. In that instance there was no hourly extreme rainfall, but prolonged and continuous rainfall over several days. It caused one of Italy's most devastating floods in recent history, leading to over 36,000 displacements, 15 fatalities, and estimated damages of EUR 8.8 billion to infrastructure, water bodies, and ecosystems10.

In recent years, concern about extreme precipitation events and their role in extreme flooding has grown across Europe, and particularly in the Mediterranean region. As oceans and landmasses warm, the relationship between evaporation, moisture transport, and precipitation is expected to evolve11. Enhanced moisture convergence, combined with the greater moisture-holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere, can support heavy rainfall3. That, in turn can be further enhanced by horizontal moisture fluxes, which tend to scale with the Clausius–Clapeyron relationship1,12. In our case study we identify a set of conditions, involving both moisture advection by stationary cyclones and local orography, that appear to increase the severity of flooding. A preliminary analysis of such conditions across the Mediterranean region suggests the existence of a class of locations vulnerable to this type of event. We believe that a better understanding of the drivers behind these events can lead to improved prediction and preparedness13.

The flood of May 2023 was characterized by significant rainfall. Some locations experienced return periods exceeding 500 years14. Yet, the flood was not strictly by a short-lived heavy rainfall event. It therefore cannot be directly attributed solely to the larger moisture-holding capacity of an increasingly warmer atmosphere. Interestingly, and despite the low probabilities involved in such an event, a very similar flooding extreme happened again in the same area just a year later, in September 2024. This second flooding event was slightly less intense, but it exhibited comparable driving circulation patterns. We use historical data to investigate the primary meteorological mechanisms underlying such events and to assess potential links to climate change.

The 2023 flood event was characterized by two prolonged precipitation episodes: the first on 1–3 May, and the second on 15–17 May. Notably, another event—less intense but still exceeding 30 mm/day—occurred on 10 May. Panel a) of Fig. 1 shows a time series of precipitation over a 60 × 60 km domain centered on Forlì—one of the most affected towns in Emilia-Romagna. The red line is based on the ERA5 reanalysis. The blue line is based on ARPAE—ARchivio Climatologico per l'Italia centro-Settentrionale, a high-resolution observational dataset (see Methods section). Despite the well-known limitations of ERA5 in representing local precipitation patterns in certain terrain conditions, the present case study was accurately captured by ERA5 in terms of both timing and magnitude when compared to the higher-resolution ARPAE dataset. Vertically integrated water vapor content is shown in magenta, while the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor convergence is in black. Both are derived from ERA5. The water vapor content (magenta solid line panel a, Fig. 1) exceeds the regional daily median (central magenta dashed line panel a, Fig. 1), yet precipitation is primarily associated with the vertically integrated horizontal water vapor convergence (black line, panel a, Fig. 1). Indeed, horizontal moisture convergence over the region, illustrated in the hourly time series centered on the events in Fig. 1, panels b and c), preceded the onset of precipitation by several hours.

Time series of quantities averaged in a box of 60 × 60 km centered over Forlì town. Panel (a) shows daily time series during the 2023 year for ERA5 vertically integrated moisture convergence (black), ARPAE precipitation (blue, 5 km resolution), ERA5 precipitation (red, 25 km resolution), ERA5 precipitable water (magenta). Dashed lines represent minimum, mean and maximum climatological values. Panels (b) and (c) show hourly time series of vertically integrated moisture convergence (black) and ERA5 precipitation (red) during the first and the second phases of the flood event of May 2023.

Both precipitation events in May were associated with a cyclonic circulation, centered between central Italy and Corsica, which remained stationary for an extended period due to blocking subtropical anticyclones. To illustrate the temporal evolution of key meteorological fields we focus on the event of 1–3 May, but that of 15–17 May was similar14. The cyclone drew moist air from the Adriatic Sea and began impacting eastern Emilia-Romagna on 1 May, as evidenced by the vertically integrated water vapor convergence (Fig. 2, upper left panel). As seen in the timeseries analysis, the spatial patterns of water vapor convergence (left panels) over Emilia-Romagna also precede those of precipitation (right panels). The magnitude of this convergence was driven by sustained southeastward horizontal water vapor transport, visualized by black arrows in Fig. 2 (left panels), advecting moisture into the region.

Time evolution (from May 01, 12:00 to May 03, 00:00 of the vertically integrated moisture convergence flux (color patterns in left panels) together with vertically integrated water transport direction (black arrows in left panels) and precipitation (right panels) also from ERA5. The yellow square indicates Forlì location. Units are [mm/h].

Crucially, this process was enhanced by the orographic barrier of the Apennines14. In fact the Po Valley and its adjacent areas represent a semi-closed geographical basin that is open only to south-easterly winds, specifically those generated by stationary cyclones centered in the Gulf of Genoa or, more generally, on the lee (southern) side of the Alps. This particular configuration is also the reason why the term cul-de-sac was introduced. Indeed, no hourly precipitation extremes were recorded during the 36-hour event, while persistent moist air advection was maintained by the quasi-stationary cyclone over central Italy. Rainfall was moderate to intense—ranging between 3 and 20 mm/h—but not extreme, and Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) was relatively low (not shown), indicating only weak instability and limited convective potential. However, the presence of an orographic barrier promoted moist air uplift and intensified rainfall via adiabatic cooling. This was sufficient to support sustained precipitation over the region14.

In summary, we can conclude that the extraordinary accumulation of rainfall associated to the Emilia-Romagna flood can be attributed to the combination of two main conditions: cyclone persistence which leads to sustained vertically integrated moisture flux and orographic features that enhance moisture convergence.

Based on the synoptic analysis and moisture transport mechanisms described above, it is clear that the events that occurred in May 2023 and May 2024 (not shown) share these key features: the stationary position of a cyclone near central Italy and an associated, prolonged vertically integrated moisture flux toward regions with enhancing orographic features conducive to flow convergence. These conditions, found in Emilia-Romagna, have led to extreme rainfall totals, even in the absence of deep convection or hourly precipitation extremes. The next logical question is to ask whether such conditions are becoming more frequent due to a changing climate and where else in the Mediterranean might we find them.

To explore this, we examined long-term changes in Mediterranean cyclone density persistence by analyzing cyclone track data provided by Flaounas et al.15, a data set in which the importance of cyclone tracking methods for representing cyclone genesis and trajectories is evaluated. The results by Flaounas et al.15, confirm that cyclones predominantly occur over maritime areas, particularly near the Gulf of Genoa, the Italian Peninsula, and the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. Genoa cyclones, after having persisted near their genesis area, tend to slowly move eastward and southeastward toward Greece and the Balkans, where they typically undergo gradual filling. Other regions with high cyclone density include northwestern Africa, areas near the Atlas Mountains, the Turkish coasts, and the eastern side of the Black Sea. We introduce here an objective metric—the Cyclone Density Persistence (CDP) index—to assess which areas of the Mediterranean are most prone to stationary cyclones:

where ACD is annual cyclone density and CP is cyclone persistence. ACD is measured in [number of cyclones] and CP in [days/cyclone], then CDP is measured in [days]. This index was computed over 3°×3° grid cells and averaged over the 1979–2020 period (see Methods). Figure 3a reveals that the Italian Peninsula, along with the Tyrrhenian and Ionian Seas, exhibits the highest levels of cyclone activity (highlighted with blue rectangles). Lower activity is observed in the southern Mediterranean. Furthermore, an analysis of the temporal evolution of the CDP index (Fig. 3b) reveals higher values of the index in the 2000–2020 period relative to 1979–1999, especially over the Tyrrhenian, Ionian, and Balearic Seas (blue rectangles).

Cyclone Density Persistence index (CDP, as defined in the Main text and in Data and Methods) resulting from extra-tropical storm tracks over the Mediterranean basin. Tracks by Flaounas et al.15. Panel (a) (top) shows the 1979–2020 annual climatology of CDP index values on a 3ox3o grid boxes over the Mediterranean basin. Panel (b) (bottom) shows the difference between CDP mean values for the 2000–2020 period and CDP values for the 1979–1999 period. Positive value: increase, negative values: decrease. Units are [days]. White stars indicate statistically significant differences (see methods).

This spatial pattern suggests that there are some regions partially enclosed by orographic features that are likely to become more prone to experiencing prolonged water vapor advection associated with stationary or slow-moving cyclones. Such terrain is likely to confine moisture advection associated with the cyclone's circulation, enhancing convergence that can persist over multiple days. Emilia-Romagna emerges as a hotspot for this mechanism, alongside other coastal areas of Albania as shown in Fig. 4, where the composite of vertically integrated moisture convergence flux—associated to persistent (more than two days) cyclones over central Italy—is shown in terms of differences between 2000 and 2020 and 1979–1999 (Fig. 4, panel a) together with the orographic features (Fig. 4, panel b). These regions are particularly vulnerable to moisture convergence associated with slow-moving Mediterranean cyclones over central Italy and slow-moving cyclones over this domain are increasing in the last decades (blue patterns in Fig. 3, panel b) and red stars compared to black stars in Fig. 4). Similar conditions can be expected for Occitanie and Provence (France), Valencia and Catalonia (Spain) when considering cyclones hovering over the western Mediterranean basin (Fig. 3). The analysis of CDP and of its change over time suggests that the observed warming of the Mediterranean may be increasing the likelihood of prolonged precipitation events and the risk of flooding wherever orography and moisture convergence interact to produce flood-risk conditions.

Focus on areas prone to stationary cyclones over central Italy. Black box indicates the domain used to select stationary cyclones (black stars during 1979–1999, red stars during 2000–2020) lasting more than two days, to create time composites of associated vertically integrated moisture convergence flux difference between the two periods (panel a). Panel b) shows the orography19 of the region. Orange arrows point towards areas more prone to water convergence due to the vertically integrated water fluxes, induced by stationary cyclones, and confined by the cul-de-sac orographic features. White stars indicate statistically significant differences (see methods).

This is a preliminary study, and more work is needed to characterize other critical conditions, such as soil conditions or the state of hydraulic infrastructure, which can contribute to the formation of extreme flooding events. However, even at this early stage, the analysis highlights the potential for cyclone density persistence metrics such as the CDP index to serve as predictive tools in the development of Early Warning Systems for flooding, particularly for areas enclosed by orographic features that are likely to be associated with smaller catchments that can easily be overwhelmed by persistent precipitation. Indicators such as these could improve our ability to detect vulnerability and the effectiveness of forecasts across time scales—from short—and medium-range to seasonal outlooks—to help communities manage the risks of extreme events.

Further work is required to assess whether the observed increase in cyclone density persistence over the past four decades persists under various future warming scenarios, and how such changes might affect flood risk across the Mediterranean.

Rainfall data for the year 2023 are sourced from two datasets at daily resolution:

ARPAE (ARchivio Climatologico per l'Italia centro-Settentrionale): A high-resolution observational dataset with a horizontal resolution of 5 km, available from 1961 to the present16.

ERA5 Reanalysis: Provided by the ECMWF with a horizontal resolution of 25 km17, through the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S18.

To conduct a detailed analysis of the May 2023 flood events, we utilized hourly ERA5 reanalysis data for 2023. The following variables were extracted:

Total precipitation.

Vertically integrated horizontal water convergence.

Vertically integrated water vapor content.

Vertically integrated zonal and meridional water vapor transport.

Daily ERA5 data for the period 1994–2024 were also used to compute climatological averages of vertically integrated water content and horizontal water convergence (represented by dashed lines in Fig. 1).

To analyze historical changes in cyclone frequency and stationarity across the Mediterranean basin, we employed cyclone track data from Flaounas et al.15.

From these tracks, we computed:

Annual Cyclone Density (ACD): The total number of unique cyclone occurrences per year within each 3° × 3° grid cell (each cyclone is counted only once per cell).

Cyclone Persistence (CP): The cumulative number of days cyclones remained within a given grid cell across the year.

Cyclone Density Persistence (CDP): Defined as the product of ACD and CP, this index quantifies both the frequency and duration of cyclone activity. CDP is expressed in units of [days].

The statistical significance of the differences shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is verified at the 85% level with a bootstrap method.

Controlling stem cell differentiation is a longstanding goal in biomedical research. Here we explore how cell fate is influenced by RNA condensates, specifically P-bodies, which modulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. We profiled the transcriptomes of biomolecular condensates in diverse developmental contexts spanning multiple vertebrate species. Our analyses revealed conserved, cell type-specific sequestration of untranslated RNAs encoding cell fate regulators. P-body RNA contents do not reflect active gene expression in each cell type but are enriched for translationally repressed transcripts characteristic of the preceding developmental stage. Mechanistically, P-body contents are controlled by microRNAs and can be profoundly reshaped by perturbing AGO2 or polyadenylation site usage. Applying these insights to stem cell differentiation, we show that manipulating P-body assembly or microRNA activity can direct naive mouse and human pluripotent stem cells toward totipotency or primed human embryonic cells toward the germ cell lineage. Our findings link cell fate decisions to RNA condensates across vertebrates and provide a means of controlling cell identity.

Post-transcriptional mechanisms are critical for establishing and maintaining cell identity1,2. For instance, RNA splicing, decay and alternative polyadenylation are pivotal regulatory mechanisms during development, reprogramming and tissue homeostasis3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. There is a growing appreciation that RNA regulation is associated with transcript compartmentalization in biomolecular condensates11,12,13,14,15,16. These condensates include P-bodies, evolutionarily conserved cytoplasmic structures containing RNA and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)11,17,18,19,20,21,22. RNAs can be directed into P-bodies by proteins involved in translation repression, microRNA (miRNA)-mediated pathways and messenger RNA (mRNA) decay processes17,20,23,24,25,26. While P-bodies were initially characterized as hotspots for mRNA decay20,21, recent observations suggest that they also regulate translation by sequestering mRNA away from translational machinery27,28,29,30,31,32,33. In some contexts, P-body transcripts reenter the ribosome pool upon P-body dissolution17,20,23,24,25,26,34, suggesting that P-bodies provide a nuanced, dynamic mechanism to fine-tune gene expression.

Emerging evidence suggests a role for P-bodies in regulating cell fate by sequestering mRNA encoding chromatin remodelers and transcription factors28,35,36. P-body dysfunction is implicated in Parkinson's disease37 and cancer38,39,40,41, suggesting that disrupted RNA sequestration may destabilize cell identity and contribute to pathologies. Still, a precise role for RNA sequestration in P-bodies during differentiation and development remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we purified intact P-bodies and quantified constituent coding and noncoding RNA across multiple cell types and species. Our findings revealed RNA sequestration in P-bodies as a conserved regulatory mechanism often leading to the storage of specific transcripts that reflect preceding developmental stages. We demonstrate that the ribosome occupancy and corresponding protein levels of mRNAs enriched in P-bodies, including fate-instructive transcripts, increased following acute dissolution of P-bodies. Mechanistically, miRNAs regulate mRNA sequestration in a context-dependent manner. Finally, we show that perturbing RNA sequestration activates a totipotency transcriptional program in naive human pluripotent cells and facilitates the conversion of primed human embryonic stem (ES) cells into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs). Our findings define a fundamental, conserved role for P-bodies in cell fate specification and suggest strategies for exploiting RNA condensates to direct cell identity.

To profile P-body contents, we adapted a fluorescence-activated sorting method29,42 using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LSM14A expression construct in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1a). LSM14A is an established protein component of P-bodies29, and GFP-LSM14A puncta colocalized with the P-body marker EDC4 (ref. 43) (Fig. 1b). After cell lysis, intact GFP-LSM14A particles were detectable by microscopy and were readily isolated using fluorescence-activated particle sorting (FAPS) (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). By contrast, particles were undetectable in cells expressing a cytoplasmic GFP control (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1a). To corroborate these data, we depleted DDX6 in GFP-LSM14A HEK293T cells to disrupt P-bodies19,21,28,32. Both short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated suppression of DDX6 and CRISPR knockout (KO) resulted in the complete loss of GFP+ particles (Fig. 1d,e and Extended Data Fig. 1b,c). To confirm the presence of RNA in GFP-LSM14A particles, we stained lysates from GFP-LSM14A-expressing cells with SYTOX Blue, an RNA-binding fluorescent dye. We observed RNA in GFP+ particles but not in GFP− particles (Extended Data Fig. 1d). These findings confirm the robust labeling and isolation of P-bodies using GFP-LSM14A.

We characterized RNA from purified P-bodies and corresponding cytosolic fractions using Smart-seq44 (hereafter P-body-seq). We detected 3,994 mRNAs enriched in P-bodies of HEK293T cells relative to the cytosol (Fig. 1f). Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that P-body-enriched mRNAs encoded regulators of RNA processing, transcription, chromatin organization and cell cycle (Fig. 1g), while cytosolic mRNAs were involved in housekeeping functions such as metabolic processes and structural components (Fig. 1h). To ensure that our analyses were not biased by polyA-directed library preparations, we performed snapTotal-seq45, an alternative low-input library preparation that uses random primers rather than oligo(dT). snapTotal-seq results were highly consistent with Smart-seq data (~70% overlap; Extended Data Fig. 1e). Moreover, we compared our dataset to P-body-enriched transcripts previously reported in HEK293T cells29 and found that 3,038 mRNAs (76%) were shared between the datasets (Extended Data Fig. 1f). To confirm P-body-seq results using an orthogonal approach, we employed single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (smFISH) in conjunction with immunofluorescence (IF)46 and verified the localization of POLK and TET2 within P-bodies (Fig. 1i,j and Extended Data Fig. 1g). In line with previous reports26,38, approximately 70% of total POLK and TET2 mRNA was localized to P-bodies determined using either smFISH or P-body-seq, demonstrating substantial transcript sequestration in P-bodies.

P-bodies have been proposed as sites for RNA decay20,21,47,48; however, P-body enrichment showed poor correlation with transcript half-life measurements in HEK293T cells49, consistent with previous reports29 (Extended Data Fig. 1h). Read distribution analysis also showed no evidence of increased truncated transcripts in P-bodies relative to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1k), in line with previous reports26,29,38. In addition, we observed poor correlation between mean polyA tail length50 and P-body enrichment (r = −0.028 in Smart-seq data and r = −0.075 in snapTotal-seq data) (Fig. 1l), indicating that P-body-localized RNAs are intact and are not preferentially deadenylated relative to cytoplasmic transcripts.

We next asked whether properties intrinsic to RNAs correlated with P-body enrichment. Transcript length had no appreciable relationship with P-body localization, but transcripts with high AU content were enriched among P-body-targeted mRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 1i). Notably, AU-rich sequences are associated with inefficient translation28,51,52. Accordingly, analysis of published ribosome profiling data obtained in HEK293T cells50 revealed reduced translation efficiency for P-body-associated transcripts (Fig. 1m). These data suggest that transcripts sequestered in P-bodies are translationally repressed compared to cytoplasmic-enriched mRNAs.

P-body-associated transcripts can reenter translation following genetic or environmental perturbation19,25,29,51,53,54, suggesting that their sequestration may influence developmental fate decisions. Yet, defining P-body function in complex biological processes has been challenging, in part because sequencing-based approaches to define P-body contents have been limited to nonvertebrates or transformed cell lines25,29,55. We thus applied P-body-seq to profile transcripts in various human cell types across developmental stages. We stably integrated GFP-LSM14A at the AAVS1 locus in human ES cells and cultured them under naive and primed conditions, which model the pre- and post-implantation epiblast, respectively56. We also induced differentiation of the same human pluripotent stem cell line into progenitors of all three germ layers (mesoderm, endoderm and neural progenitors) and ultimately into neurons (Fig. 2a). IF confirmed robust differentiation into the expected lineages (80% efficiency or greater; Extended Data Fig. 2a), which was supported by the expression of lineage-specific genes (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We detected EDC4+ P-bodies in each cell type, albeit in varying amounts (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d), suggesting differences in RNA sequestration between cell types.

Enrichment significance was calculated with the permutation test (two sided), with multiple-testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method (FDR < 0.05). l, GSEA performed on P-body-versus-cytoplasm differential expression in human naive ES cells for human blastomere and naive ES cell-related gene sets from refs. 58,103. Enrichment significance was calculated with the permutation test (two sided), with multiple-testing correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg method (FDR < 0.05).

To profile P-body contents, we sorted GFP-LSM14A+ particles from each cell type. Particle size and fluorescence varied between cell types (Fig. 2b), likely reflecting differential expression of GFP-LSM14A from the AAVS1 locus, but, in all cases, we isolated sufficient RNA for P-body-seq. Supporting our observations in HEK293T cells, analysis of half-life data in human pluripotent stem cells57 suggested that RNA in P-bodies is not preferentially degraded compared to cytoplasmic RNA (Extended Data Fig. 2e). We observed diverse RNA biotypes in P-bodies, including protein-coding mRNA and lincRNA (Extended Data Fig. 2f). We note, however, that RNA sequestration in P-bodies is not merely a reflection of expression level, as the expression of P-body-enriched transcripts was distributed similarly relative to that of cytoplasmic and unenriched transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 2g). We likewise identified repetitive elements in P-bodies, although we did not detect marked differences in their abundance between P-bodies and the cytoplasm (Extended Data Fig. 2h,i). Based on principal-component analysis, we observed unique mRNA profiles for P-bodies from each cell type, suggesting that distinct cell identities have unique transcripts stored in P-bodies (Fig. 2c). Principal-component analysis further suggested a stepwise progression from naive ES cells toward mesoderm and/or endoderm lineages on one path and the ectoderm lineage on another (Fig. 2c). Notably, we found that P-body contents did not necessarily cluster most closely with the cytoplasm from the same cell type (Fig. 2c). For example, P-body samples from neurons cluster most closely with cytoplasmic samples from neural progenitors and P-body contents of mesoderm progenitors cluster with the cytoplasm of primed ES cells (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that P-bodies sequester transcripts from stem and progenitor cells to suppress their protein-level expression during differentiation.

We grouped transcripts based on their enrichment across cell types (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 2j). A fraction of transcripts was enriched in the P-bodies of all cell types, and GO categories linked to DNA damage and cell cycle progression were common across cell types (Fig. 2e). By contrast, transcripts enriched in the P-bodies of single cell types encoded fate-instructive factors, such as LEUTX and DUXA in naive ES cells (Fig. 2f). Both LEUTX and DUXA are associated with totipotency and the eight-cell (8C) embryo58,59, the developmental stage preceding naive pluripotency. To explore whether P-bodies sequester transcripts important for stem and progenitor cell maintenance during differentiation, we identified P-body-enriched transcripts related to cell fate and examined their localization in differentiated cell types and corresponding developmental precursors (Fig. 2g). P-bodies of differentiated cell types contained transcripts associated with the preceding developmental state, while these transcripts were largely cytoplasmic or unenriched in precursor cells (Fig. 2g and Discussion). smFISH analysis of OCT4 (POU5F1) in human primed ES cells and endoderm progenitors confirmed these findings, with OCT4 transcripts transitioning from primarily cytoplasmic localization in primed ES cells to P-bodies during endoderm differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). We also observed a significant overlap between transcripts that were more expressed in precursor cells and P-body enriched in differentiated cells (Fig. 2h–j). Finally, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using differential gene expression data from P-body and cytoplasmic fractions for each cell type (Fig. 2k,l and Extended Data Fig. 3c). In neurons, we observed robust enrichment of a transcriptional signature characteristic of neural progenitor cells in the P-body fraction (Fig. 2k). Consistent with these findings, P-body dissolution impaired neuronal specification from neural progenitors28,35,36, providing functional evidence that P-bodies sequester genes related to stem and progenitor cell self-renewal to facilitate differentiation. Conversely, a neuronal transcriptional signature was enriched in the cytoplasm of neurons, where these transcripts are expected to be available to translational machinery (Fig. 2k).

Next, we assessed the functional requirement of P-bodies in endoderm differentiation using a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-based approach to deplete DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6)28 and dissolve P-bodies19 (Extended Data Fig. 3d). DDX6 depletion significantly impaired differentiation toward AFP+ hepatocytes (Extended Data Fig. 3e) and suppressed the induction of other hepatic differentiation markers such as ALB, G6PC and CYP3A7 compared to control cells (Extended Data Fig. 3f). These results suggest that P-bodies are essential for differentiation to hepatocytes.

To test whether P-body-associated transcripts eventually decline after differentiation is completed, we extended neuronal differentiation to 20 d (Extended Data Fig. 3g). Analysis of P-body contents in mature neurons showed substantial overlap (~50%) with transcripts sequestered from neurons at day 7 of differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 3h); however, prolonged culture led to progressive depletion of neural progenitor-associated transcripts from P-bodies (Extended Data Fig. 3i). Similar patterns were observed in mature endoderm progenitors, which showed decreased enrichment for primed ES cell expression profiles compared to newly differentiated endoderm progenitors (Extended Data Fig. 3j,k).

We next examined P-body-associated transcripts across pluripotent states. In primed ES cells, P-bodies showed enrichment of naive ES cell-specific gene signatures (Extended Data Fig. 3c), consistent with observations that P-body dissolution promotes primed-to-naive state conversion28. Similarly, P-bodies in naive ES cells were enriched for gene expression signatures characteristic of the preceding developmental stage, including zygotic genome activation (ZGA), the 8C embryo and 8C-like cells (8CLC)58,59 (Fig. 2l and Extended Data Fig. 3l). While naive human ES cells typically express low levels of ZGA- and 8CLC-related transcripts58, our data suggest that these transcripts are sequestered into P-bodies to prevent their translation and inhibit inappropriate reversion to an earlier developmental state. Conversely, naive pluripotency transcripts were enriched in the cytoplasm relative to P-bodies (Fig. 2l), likely reflecting active expression of genes supporting the naive cell fate. These findings suggest that RNA condensates in ES cells selectively sequester totipotency-associated factors. Altogether, these data indicate that P-body contents do not simply reflect the gene expression profiles of a given cell type but are instead enriched for transcripts characteristic of the preceding developmental stage.

Next, we investigated whether P-body contents and functions are conserved across vertebrate species. We first considered mouse naive and primed ES cells60. Similar to their human counterparts, naive mouse ES cells resemble the in vivo pre-implantation mouse epiblast, while the primed state represents post-implantation epiblast cells61. Conversion from naive to primed mouse ES cells was efficient (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig. 4a), with both cell types harboring similar numbers of P-bodies (Fig. 3c).

Gene number in each transcript cluster is indicated in the figure (n = 2 biological independent samples per group, P < 0.05; reg., regulation). f, GSEA analysis of blastomere-related genes63 in the purified P-body fraction versus the cytoplasmic fraction from naive mouse ES cells (normalized enrichment score (NES) = 1.28, P = 0.03).

P-body-seq analyses of mouse naive and primed ES cells (Fig. 3d) revealed that a significant fraction of P-body-enriched transcripts exhibited cell type-specific localization (54%) (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 4b), reinforcing our observations in human pluripotent stem cells. GO analysis revealed that transcripts enriched in P-bodies of both naive and primed ES cells were associated with cell cycle progression and RNA processing, similar to human datasets (Fig. 3e). Transcripts exclusively enriched in P-bodies of naive and primed ES cells were associated with chromatin remodeling and growth factor response, respectively (Fig. 3e).

Direct cross-species comparison revealed that ~50% of P-body-enriched transcripts were shared between mice and humans in both naive and primed cell states (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d).

To test whether this mechanism is conserved in phylogenetically distant vertebrates, we transduced chicken ES cells with a GFP-LSM14A lentivirus. Chicken ES cells are derived at the blastoderm stage and contribute to chimeric embryos62. In line with our findings in human and mouse cells, we detected GFP-LSM14A particles in chicken ES cells (Extended Data Fig. 4e), which we purified by FAPS. After P-body-seq, we found that mRNAs enriched in P-bodies of chicken ES cells exhibited extensive overlap with the P-body transcriptomes of mice and humans (Extended Data Fig. 4f). Comparative analysis revealed similar transcript features among all three species, particularly in the preferential sequestration of AU-rich mRNA in P-bodies, regardless of transcript length (Extended Data Fig. 4g). Thus, RNA sequestration in P-bodies is conserved across vertebrates.

Further analysis using the odds ratio statistic identified a significant positive association of chicken ES cells with both mouse and human ES cells, with the strongest association observed between mouse and human samples (Extended Data Fig. 4h). GO analysis of P-body-associated transcripts shared between chicken ES cells and mouse and human naive and primed ES cells revealed enrichment in categories related to RNA processing, transcription, chromatin organization and cell cycle (Extended Data Fig. 4i,j). These data indicate that transcripts sequestered in chicken ES cell P-bodies encode important regulatory factors, consistent with our findings in human and mouse ES cells.

In human naive pluripotent stem cells, we found that P-bodies sequester transcripts related to the 8C stage embryo (Fig. 2l and Extended Data Fig. 3l). In mice, the equivalent developmental stage occurs in the two-cell embryo, although rare cells in naive mouse ES cell cultures, known as 2C cells, transiently express genes characteristic of the two-cell state63. To determine whether transcripts enriched in the P-bodies of mouse naive ES cells comprise a signature characteristic of totipotent cells, we performed GSEA. Consistent with our findings in human naive ES cells, we observed a significant enrichment of 2C-associated transcripts among P-body-enriched mRNAs, regardless of library preparation method (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 5a). smFISH analysis confirmed that the naive pluripotency markers Dppa2 and Zfp42 were predominantly cytoplasmic in naive ES cells but primarily P-body enriched in primed ES cells (Extended Data Fig. 5b–e). This observation further indicates that P-body-based regulation of developmental processes is conserved between species.

To test the functional consequence of sequestration of 2C transcripts, we employed CRISPR–Cas9 to KO Ddx6 and dissolve P-bodies in mouse ES cells harboring the 2C-specific reporters MERVL-tdTomato and Zscan4c-GFP64,65 (Fig. 3g, schematic). Ddx6 depletion significantly increased signal from both reporters (Fig. 3h,i) without altering cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 5f), suggesting that disrupting P-bodies facilitates the otherwise rare conversion of naive ES cells to the 2C state. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of MERVL and Zscan4 double-positive cells confirmed increased expression of genes (Obox3, Zscan4b, Zscan4d, Zscan4e and Zfp352) and transposable elements (MERVL, MT2B1, MLT2E) characteristic of the 2C state following Ddx6 suppression (Fig. 3j,k), suggesting that P-body dissolution enhances cell fate conversion. KO of other essential P-body factors, encoded by Eif4enif1 and Lsm14a32, similarly led to P-body loss and activation of the MERVL and Zscan4 reporters (Fig. 3h,i), supporting our hypothesis that P-bodies sequester fate-instructive 2C transcripts that are transiently suppressed and enter translation upon P-body disruption.

To explore this possibility further, we assessed the integrity of P-body-associated transcripts in ES cells, including those encoding 2C regulators. Analysis of both snapTotal-seq and Smart-seq data revealed over 70% overlap in P-body-associated transcripts (Extended Data Fig. 5g) between methods. Further comparison between P-body enrichment and mRNA half-lives in ES cells based on 4-thiouridine labeling66 demonstrated minimal correlation between mRNA stability and P-body enrichment (r = −0.069) (Extended Data Fig. 5h). We found no appreciable evidence of truncated mRNAs or preferential deadenylation67 of P-body-associated RNAs compared to cytosolic fractions (r = −0.092) (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j), consistent with previous reports26,29,38. These findings suggest that, in ES cells, similar to our observations in HEK293T cells, P-body-associated transcripts are not preferentially degraded compared to cytosolic transcripts. We then examined the translation rate of RNAs within P-bodies of mouse ES cells68,69. We observed a strong, inverse correlation between P-body enrichment and translation efficiency, suggesting that RNAs localized to P-bodies in naive and primed ES cells are characterized by poor translation efficiency (Fig. 4a). These results indicate that P-body-associated RNAs in ES cells are intact and translationally suppressed.

To directly assess whether P-body-enriched mRNAs engage with translational machinery in stem cells after P-body dissolution, we generated a targeted DDX6 degron system in mouse naive ES cells (Ddx6-FKBP12F36V) (Fig. 4b) and performed polysome profiling after acute DDX6 loss. Addition of degradation tag-13 (dTAG-13) facilitated DDX6 protein degradation and eliminated detectable P-bodies within 6 h (Fig. 4c–e and Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). Consistent with our model, we observed a significant increase in the ribosome occupancy of P-body-associated mRNAs following DDX6 suppression compared to total cytosolic RNAs (P < 2.2−16; Fig. 4f,g). GO analysis confirmed that transcripts exhibiting enhanced ribosome occupancy were associated with stem cell maintenance (Extended Data Fig. 6d). Given the observation that disrupting P-bodies in mouse naive ES cells facilitated conversion to the 2C state, we next asked whether 2C-related transcripts demonstrated higher ribosome occupancy after DDX6 degradation. Indeed, 2C-associated mRNAs enriched in P-bodies exhibited increased ribosome occupancy after P-body dissolution (Fig. 4h,i). These data provide further evidence that mRNAs sequestered in P-bodies engage translational machinery upon their release from P-bodies in ES cells, which in turn, alters cell fate.

To measure protein-level changes, we performed large-scale, quantitative proteomics in Ddx6 degron ES cells after dTAG-13 treatment for 1 and 3 d. P-body dissolution caused significant upregulation of proteins encoded by P-body-associated mRNAs (Fig. 4j), including regulators of 2C-like cells (Fig. 4k). Elevated levels of these proteins facilitated the transition of ES cells to a 2C-like state, as shown by the increased abundance of totipotency factors such as ZSCAN4C, ZSCAN4D, ZSCAN4F, USP17LE and EIF1 (ref. 64) (Fig. 4l). These findings demonstrate that disrupting RNA sequestration in P-bodies promotes the translation of proteins important for cell fate transitions.

In line with previous studies, a fraction of P-body-enriched RNAs underwent degradation after acute loss of DDX6 (Extended Data Fig. 6e). These downregulated mRNAs were linked to differentiation processes (Extended Data Fig. 6f), perhaps reflecting a separate mechanism for protecting transcripts needed for differentiation until appropriate signals or conditions are achieved during development70.

Our data suggest cell type-specific sequestration of mRNA into P-bodies, yet the underlying mechanism remained unclear. We first considered RNA modifications, focusing on N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant modification in eukaryotic mRNA71. We used a human ES cell model that permits doxycycline-inducible ablation of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 (TET-OFF METTL3)72 (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Eight days of doxycycline treatment suppressed METTL3 expression (Extended Data Fig. 7b) and reduced global m6A levels (Extended Data Fig. 7c), while pluripotency genes remained unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 7d). IF for EDC4+ puncta revealed no change in P-body numbers upon METTL3 deletion (Extended Data Fig. 7e). We profiled P-body contents and found no significant differences in METTL3-KO cells compared to the control (85% overlap; Extended Data Fig. 7f; compare white and gray circles). Moreover, only a small fraction of P-body-enriched RNA was m6A methylated, and enrichment remained largely unchanged after METTL3 KO (Extended Data Fig. 7f). These results indicate that m6A methylation does not primarily direct RNA sequestration into P-bodies in human ES cells, consistent with findings on stress granules in mouse ES cells73.

We next explored the potential involvement of RBPs in RNA sequestration within P-bodies by mapping the P-body enrichment of transcripts targeted by 53 RBPs using published crosslinking immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP–seq) data74 (Fig. 5a). Targets of RBPs that localize to RNA granules, including PUM2 and HNRNPU19,75, were enriched in P-bodies; however, these proteins are widely expressed and unlikely to confer cell type specificity. De novo motif analysis of P-body-enriched transcripts predicted recognition by multiple RBPs that were conserved across cell types, with no evident cell type-specific patterns (Extended Data Fig. 7g,h). GO analysis of the identified RBP targets revealed enrichment for pathways consistent with known P-body functions, including 3′ untranslated region (3′-UTR) processing, ribonucleoprotein granule assembly and mRNA stabilization (Extended Data Fig. 7i). These data suggest that RBPs are unlikely to drive cell type-specific RNA sequestration.

Source data

Further inspection of the CLIP–seq data revealed enrichment for targets of the Argonaute protein family (AGO1, AGO2, AGO3 and AGO4) within P-bodies (Fig. 5a). AGO proteins are essential components of the RNA-induced silencing complex and cooperate with miRNAs to suppress mRNA translation76,77. Previous studies have shown localization of AGO proteins in P-bodies and suggested a connection between certain miRNAs and mRNA recruitment to ribonucleoprotein granules in nonmammalian cells and transformed cell lines23,78,79,80. Moreover, miRNAs are expressed in a cell type-specific manner and play a prominent role in cell fate transitions81,82.

To test the role of miRNAs in directing RNA sequestration of developmental transcripts into P-bodies, we profiled small RNA populations in both P-body and cytoplasmic fractions across mouse and human pluripotent cells and neural progenitors using small noncoding RNA-seq83 (Extended Data Fig. 8a). Uniform manifold approximation and projection plot analysis revealed clustering of naive and primed mouse ES cell samples according to their cellular origin (Fig. 5b). Subsets of miRNAs were selectively enriched in P-bodies of pluripotent cells as well as progenitor cells (Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 8b–d), including miR-300 and miR-let-7, which are known regulators of stem cell potency84,85. Targets of miRNAs enriched in P-bodies were also sequestered within these RNA condensates (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 8e–g) and translationally repressed (Fig. 5d). Further analysis86 revealed that P-body-targeted transcripts were enriched for specific miRNA binding sites that were absent in cytoplasmic transcripts (Extended Data Figs. 8h,i and 9a,b).

We plotted P-body enrichment for targets of miR-let-7, miR-300 and miR-381 across cell types. In both naive and primed ES cells, we observed increased enrichment of their targets in P-bodies (Fig. 5e,f). By contrast, we found no enrichment for target transcripts in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) P-bodies (Fig. 5e,f). Together, our data suggest that miRNA-targeted genes are sequestered into P-bodies in a cell type-specific manner.

Previous studies demonstrated the importance of AGO2 in the sequestration of let-7 targets into P-bodies in transformed cells78. To investigate the involvement of AGO2 in global RNA sequestration, we generated Ago2-KO mouse ES cells87 (Extended Data Fig. 9c). Ago2-KO cells had similar numbers of P-bodies as wild-type (WT) cells (Extended Data Fig. 9d), although P-bodies appeared modestly smaller (Extended Data Fig. 9d). We then sorted P-bodies from Ago2-KO ES cells and compared their transcriptome to WT counterparts. We found that Ago2 KO significantly reduced miRNA-targeted mRNA levels in P-bodies (Fig. 5g).

Next, we investigated whether modulation of polyA site usage (that is, alternative polyadenylation (APA)) influenced RNA sequestration into P-bodies. APA generates RNA isoforms that commonly differ in the length of their 3′ UTR88. Because miRNA target sequences are frequently found in the 3′ UTR, we reasoned that forcing proximal polyadenylation (that is, shorter 3′ UTRs) would relieve miRNA-based targeting of transcripts into P-bodies. To test this, we suppressed expression of Nudt21, encoding a component of the CFIm complex that facilitates distal polyadenylation5,89, in MEFs during reprogramming to pluripotency (Fig. 5h). We chose this context because a matched dataset of APA changes is available5, permitting direct comparison between polyA site usage and P-body enrichment. Nudt21 knockdown (KD) led to increased reprogramming efficiency (Extended Data Fig. 9e) and expression of pluripotency-related genes5 (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Similar to Ago2 KO, P-body numbers were largely unaffected by Nudt21 suppression (Extended Data Fig. 9g). P-body-seq from uninduced MEFs as well as reprogramming intermediates with and without Nudt21 silencing revealed that, in MEFs and day 3 control reprogramming cells, 3′ UTRs of P-body-targeted RNAs were longer than cytoplasmic counterparts, suggesting that regulatory sequences within 3′ UTRs mediate P-body enrichment (Fig. 5i). After Nudt21 suppression, we observed a global reduction in 3′ UTR length and the 3′ UTRs of transcripts enriched in P-bodies had similar lengths relative to those of cytoplasmic transcripts (Fig. 5i). We next used published data to compare changes in polyadenylation site usage to changes in transcript localization between P-bodies and the cytoplasm after Nudt21 KD5. Notably, transcripts enriched in P-bodies of control cells but absent from P-bodies after Nudt21 KD (that is, genes that relocated away from P-bodies) had shorter 3′ UTRs after Nudt21 suppression (Fig. 5j). Analysis of previously published polyA site usage data5 revealed that these transcripts contained significantly fewer miRNA target sites after Nudt21 KD (Extended Data Fig. 9h). These results suggest that the loss of miRNA binding sites prevents mRNA localization to P-bodies.

We next examined whether manipulating specific miRNAs could impact RNA localization and cell identity by depleting miR-300 in mouse ES cells using an antisense inhibitor (Fig. 6a). Following 48 h of anti-miR-300 treatment, we observed a significant reduction of miR-300 targets in P-bodies (Fig. 6b).

Source data

To test whether releasing miR-300 targets from P-bodies was sufficient to induce a change in cell fate (Fig. 6a), we examined the expression of 2C-related genes. We observed upregulation of 2C-related transcripts, including Zscan4 and MERVL, upon miR-300 suppression, suggesting that miR-300 restricts reversion of pluripotent cells to an earlier developmental fate (Fig. 6c). Notably, these transcripts are not direct targets of miR-300, suggesting that their upregulation results from a change in cell fate, rather than regulation from the miRNA itself. These findings indicate that RNA sequestration in P-bodies can be manipulated to change cell identity.

We next tested whether mRNAs could be directed into P-bodies through the addition of miRNA target sequences. We generated reporter constructs based on the pluripotency master regulator encoded by Nanog, which included a 3′ UTR with either six WT or six mutant let-7 sequences (let-7WT and let-7Mut)90 and 24 bacteriophage MS2 stem loops (Extended Data Fig. 9i). These stem loops recruit a tagged version of the MS2 coat protein (JF546 HaloTag-NLS-MCP) to permit direct, subcellular visualization of Nanog mRNA. We note that the nuclear localization signal on MCP effectively clears free MCP from the cytoplasm, strongly increasing the signal-to-noise ratio for the assay91. After transfection into Nanog-KO ES cells, Nanog-let-7WT-MS2 transcripts colocalized with the P-body marker EDC4 (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9j), suggesting that let-7 target sequences were sufficient to direct Nanog mRNA into P-bodies. By contrast, Nanog-let-7Mut-MS2 transcripts failed to accumulate in P-bodies (Fig. 6d and Extended Data Fig. 9j). Both constructs produced similar steady-state RNA levels (Fig. 6e), excluding the possibility that the observed localization patterns arose from differences in RNA abundance. NANOG protein levels, however, were lower in cells expressing Nanog-let-7WT-MS2, supporting a nondegradative, posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism (Fig. 6f).

Finally, we investigated whether miRNA-dependent recruitment of RNAs into P-bodies could be leveraged to alter cell identity. Under naive conditions, Nanog-KO cells self-renew; however, when switched to serum–LIF ES culture medium, NANOG helps to sustain self-renewal. We therefore transitioned Nanog-KO cells expressing either Nanog-let-7WT-MS2 or Nanog-let-7Mut-MS2 from naive to standard culture conditions. Cells expressing Nanog-MS2-let-7WT had substantially lower self-renewal capacity than Nanog-let-7Mut-MS2-expressing cells, as evidenced by increased colony number and size in clonal assays (Fig. 6g–i). These data highlight the crucial role of miRNA-mediated RNA sequestration in regulating cell potency.

We next sought to manipulate P-bodies to facilitate otherwise inefficient cell fate conversions from human pluripotent stem cells to rare, clinically relevant cell types. We first focused on human totipotent-like cells, which have been identified in vitro at a frequency of 0.1% in naive pluripotent cell culture58. P-bodies in naive human pluripotent stem cells sequester transcripts associated with the totipotent 8C state (Figs. 2l and 6j), likely preventing their translation and restricting naive ES cell plasticity. To test whether P-body dissolution could overcome this restriction, we generated human naive ES cells carrying a totipotency-specific reporter, TPRX1-GFP59 (Fig. 6k). DDX6 suppression increased the proportion of TPRX1-GFP+ cells by 100-fold (~0.1% to ~10%) over previous reports58 (Fig. 6k,l). As further validation, we used CRISPRi to deplete DDX6 (ref. 28), which activated H3Y1, a DUX4 target gene expressed in the 8C embryo92(Fig. 6m). Proliferation rates were unchanged between DDX6-KD and control samples (Extended Data Fig. 9k), suggesting that disrupting P-bodies increased the rate of cell fate conversion rather than cell expansion. Sorted TPRX1+ cells displayed increased expression of genes (for example, DUXA, ZSCAN5B, ZSCAN4) and transposable elements (for example, LTR12, MLT2A1) (Fig. 6n,o) associated with totipotency and the 8C state, while downregulating primed pluripotency markers such as POU5F1 and MER51B93, consistent with enhanced cell fate conversion. These findings demonstrate that P-bodies sequester totipotency-associated transcripts to suppress their expression and suggest that manipulating P-bodies could enable the induction and expansion of rare human cell types in vitro.

We next explored whether modulating P-bodies could enhance the conversion from human ES cells to PGCLCs, which are difficult to derive in vitro, share transcriptional features with totipotent stem cells94,95 and are highly relevant for reproductive medicine. Our data indicated that P-bodies in primed human ES cells sequester transcripts associated with a primordial germ cell signature96 (Fig. 6p), including FXR1, ING2, EIF4G3 and MEIOC (Extended Data Fig. 9l). We introduced shRNAs targeting DDX6 into primed human pluripotent cells carrying primordial germ cell (PGC)-specific reporters, TFAP2C-GFP and PRDM1 (BLIMP1)-Tomato96 (Fig. 6q). We induced germ cell fate and achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of less than 8% in standard conditions; however, DDX6 suppression consistently increased the formation of TFAP2C-and-BLIMP1 double-positive PGCLCs to greater than 24% (Fig. 6r). Furthermore, DDX6-depleted TFAP2C+BLIMP1+ PGCLCs exhibited elevated expression of PGC markers, including TFAP2C, PRDM1 and DPPA3 (Fig. 6s), without significant changes in cell proliferation (Extended Data Fig. 9m). These findings demonstrate that P-body dissolution facilitates the efficient programming of primed human ES cells toward the germ cell lineage. Our work further establishes a framework for using condensate biology to expand clinically relevant stem cell populations, highlighting P-body modulation as a strategy for cell fate engineering.

We identified RNA sequestration through P-bodies as a fundamental regulatory mechanism in development and differentiation (Extended Data Fig. 9n). Using FAPS, we compared P-body contents between cell types at distinct developmental stages. Our analyses revealed cell type-specific RNA sequestration patterns that reflected transcriptional profiles characteristic of preceding developmental stages. These data suggest that transcripts important for stem and progenitor cells are directed to P-bodies to inhibit their translation upon differentiation. Functionally, disrupting P-bodies in naive mouse ES cells led to the upregulation of established 2C reporters and drove a transcriptional signature characteristic of the 2C state. We observed increased ribosome occupancy and protein levels for P-body-enriched transcripts, including 2C genes, after acute disruption of P-bodies in mouse naive ES cells, suggesting that sequestration directly inhibited translation. Together, these data provide functional evidence that P-body-based regulation is sufficient to alter cell fate.

Our findings suggest the potential of manipulating P-body-mediated regulation to facilitate conversion of pluripotent stem cells into clinically relevant cell types. While human totipotent stem cells were previously identified at a low frequency (~0.1%) in naive pluripotent cell populations58 or generated using chemical reprogramming at low efficiency (~1%)59, disrupting P-body-mediated regulation strongly enhanced the frequency of TPRX1-GFP+ totipotent-like cells to nearly 10% under naive culture conditions. Totipotent cells hold promise for producing high-quality blastoids and for generating differentiated cells with unprecedented efficiency59,97,98. We also manipulated RNA condensates to promote specification of human pluripotent stem cells into PGCLCs, which could assist research on germ cell specification and the development of therapeutics for infertility95,96,99. Moreover, our P-body-seq identified fate-instructive factors within P-bodies in adult progenitor cells of the three germ layers, suggesting that manipulating P-bodies in these cells could similarly redirect cell fate or expand cell populations that are currently challenging to propagate. These insights establish a foundation for leveraging condensate biology to engineer cell fate.

P-body-mediated RNA sequestration is likely to function in biological contexts beyond development, including stem cell maintenance and homeostasis. For example, OCT4 must be precisely regulated to support stem cell self-renewal100; too little OCT4 leads to precocious differentiation, while only 1.5-fold overexpression directs cells toward primitive endoderm and mesoderm101. P-body sequestration of key transcription factors in progenitor cells may fine-tune their expression to preserve stem cell self-renewal. Indeed, we observe signal for some transcription factors (for example, those encoded by FGF20 and SOX1; Fig. 2g) in both the cytoplasm and P-bodies of stable stem cell populations.

Our findings suggest that differentiating cells may employ RNA sequestration as a reversible mechanism that enables developmental plasticity during fate transitions. Analogous to the ‘gatekeeping' role of NANOG in balancing pluripotency and differentiation102, P-body localization may permit stem and progenitor cells to sample the environment and direct cell fate accordingly. Supporting this model, sequestered transcripts ultimately decline in terminally differentiated cells, suggesting that P-body localization is involved in processes requiring rapid changes in gene expression programs, such as development and stress responses.

The observation that P-bodies store distinct transcripts in diverse developmental contexts raises the question of how particular mRNAs are selected for sequestration. We show that a subset of miRNAs, which are often cell type specific, is enriched in P-bodies, and disrupting miRNA–target interaction through multiple orthogonal approaches prevented P-body enrichment of corresponding miRNA targets. That said, RNA sequestration patterns likely reflect a complex interplay of regulatory factors that intersect with miRNA activity and the presence of a given miRNA in multiple cell types does not imply that its targets will exhibit identical localization outcomes between different cell types. Additional factors, including miRNA target abundance, 3′ UTR length, the presence or absence of RBPs and combinatorial targeting of transcripts by multiple miRNAs likely contribute to cell type-specific P-body enrichment.

Mouse ES cells used in this study were C57BL/6 × 129S4Sv/Jae F1-derived v6.5 ES cells. These cells were maintained at 37 °C in a culture medium suitable for naive mouse ES cells, which consisted of a 1:1 ratio of DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) and Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies). The culture medium was supplemented with 1× MEM Non-essential Amino Acid Solution (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM l-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 U ml−1 penicillin (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 mg ml−1 streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), N2 and B27 supplements (referred to as N2B27 medium), two small-molecule inhibitors, PD0325901 (1 μM, Axon Medchem) and CHIR99021 (3 μM, Axon Medchem), and mLIF (10 ng ml−1, R&D Systems).

For the induction of mouse primed ES cells, a seeding density of 1.0 × 105 mouse naive ES cells was used. These cells were plated into the wells of a 12-well plate that had been precoated with Matrigel (Corning). The culture medium for this induction consisted of N2B27 medium supplemented with 20 ng ml−1 activin A (PeproTech), 12 ng ml−1 bFGF (PeproTech) and 1% KnockOut Serum Replacement (KSR, Life Technologies).

Conventional human primed ES cells (UCLA-4 and WIBR3 ‘TET-OFF METTL3', both female cell lines) as well as CRISPRi GEN1C hiPSCs28, were cultivated on Matrigel-coated dishes in mTeSR1 medium (Stemcell Technologies) at 37 °C. These cells were propagated by using a 0.02% EDTA solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for passaging purposes. Cell passaging occurred every 4–5 d to ensure proper maintenance.

In the context of the doxycycline experiment, the TET-OFF METTL3 cell line was cultured in mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 2 μg ml−1 doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 week.

To achieve reversion to a naive state, female UCLA-4 human ES cells that had been passaged 6 d beforehand underwent a procedure involving washing with 1× PBS (Life Technologies) and then treatment with TrypLE Express Enzyme (1×, Life Technologies) for 3 min. This enzymatic treatment enabled cell dissociation into a single-cell suspension, which was subsequently plated at a density of 30,000 cells per 9.5 cm2 on irradiated CF-1 MEFs (a mixture of pooled male and female cells). This process occurred in human ES cell medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 (Axon Medchem). After a 2-d incubation period, the medium was changed to 5i/LAF and then replaced daily. The 5i/LAF medium composition consisted of a 50:50 mixture of DMEM/F12 (Sigma-Aldrich) and Neurobasal Medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 1× N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 1× B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 10 ng ml−1 bFGF (PeproTech), 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), l-glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μg ml−1 BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 μM IM-12 (Axon Medchem), 0.5 μM SB590885 (Axon Medchem), 1 μM WH-4-023 (Axon Medchem), 10 μM Y-27632 (Axon Medchem), 20 ng ml−1 activin A (PeproTech), 20 ng ml−1 rhLIF (PeproTech), 0.5% KSR (Life Technologies) and 1 μM PD0325901 (Axon Medchem). After approximately 8–10 d, cells were detached using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), and subsequent centrifugation was performed in fibroblast medium composed of DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS (Corning), l-glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then replated after passage through a 40-μm cell strainer in 5i/LAF medium on irradiated CF-1 MEFs. The established naive human ES cell lines were cultured on irradiated CF-1 MEFs at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells per 9.5 cm2 in 5i/LAF medium and were passaged every 6–7 d. The cells were provided with fresh medium daily. These naive human ES cells were maintained under low-oxygen conditions (5% O2) at 37 °C.

Human mesoderm progenitors were generated from human primed ES cells using the STEMdiff Mesoderm Differentiation Kit (Stemcell Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For the derivation of human endoderm progenitors from human primed ES cells, the STEMdiff Definitive Endoderm Differentiation Kit (Stemcell Technologies) was used following the manufacturer's instructions.

To induce neural progenitors, human primed ES cells were cultivated in neural induction medium. This medium composition included a 1:1 ratio of Advanced DMEM/F12 medium and Neurobasal Medium, supplemented with 1× N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 1× B27 supplement (Life Technologies), l-glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), 4 μM CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem), 3 μM SB432542 (Stemcell Technologies), 5 μg ml−1 BSA, 10 ng ml−1 human LIF (PeproTech) and 0.1 μM Compound E (γ-Secretase Inhibitor XXI, PeproTech). After 9 d, the cells were passaged onto Matrigel-coated dishes using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich). They were then maintained in neural induction medium with the omission of Compound E. For the purpose of neuronal differentiation, the neural progenitors were cultured on Matrigel-coated dishes, using DMEM/F12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich), 1× N2 supplement (Life Technologies), 1× B27 supplement (Life Technologies), 300 ng ml−1 cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.2 μM vitamin C (Sigma-Aldrich).

hPSCs were sequentially differentiated toward anterior-most primitive streak, definitive endoderm and then mature endoderm progenitors, as previously described105. Briefly, the following medium compositions were used on each day of differentiation: day 1, CDM2 base medium supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 activin A (PeproTech), 3 μM CHIR99021 (Axon Medchem), 20 ng ml−1 FGF2 (PeproTech) and 50 nM PI-103 (Tocris); day 2, CDM2 base medium supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 activin A, 250 nM LDN-193189 and 50 nM PI-103; day 3, CDM3 base medium supplemented with 20 ng ml−1 FGF2, 30 ng ml−1 BMP4 (R&D Systems), 75 nM TTNPB (Selleck) and 1 μM A-83-01 (Reprocell); days 4–6, CDM3 base medium supplemented with 10 ng ml−1 activin A, 30 ng ml−1 BMP4 and 1 μM forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich).

The composition of CDM2 basal medium is 50% IMDM medium, 50% F12, l-glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mg ml−1 polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma), 1% (vol/vol) chemically defined lipid concentrate (Thermo Fisher), 450 μM 1-thioglycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.7 μg ml−1 recombinant human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 15 μg ml−1 human transferrin (Sigma). The composition of CDM3 basal medium is 45% IMDM, 45% F12, l-glutamine (2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% KSR (Thermo Fisher), 1 mg ml−1 polyvinyl alcohol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (vol/vol) chemically defined lipid concentrate (Thermo Fisher).

For hepatic differentiation, endoderm cells were differentiated for 4 weeks in SFD-based hepatic induction medium supplemented with ascorbic acid (50 μg ml−1, Sigma), monothioglycerol (4.5 × 10−4 M, Sigma-Aldrich), BMP4 (50 ng ml−1), bFGF (10 ng ml−1), VEGF (10 ng ml−1), EGF (10 ng ml−1), TGFα (20 ng ml−1, PeproTech), HGF (100 ng ml−1, PeproTech), dexamethasone (1 × 10−7 M, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% DMSO (Sigma). SFD serum-free medium consists of 75% IMDM (Life Technologies), 25% Ham's F12 (CellGro), 0.5× N-2 Supplement (Gibco), 0.5× B27 without retinoic acid (Gibco), 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich), 50 μg ml−1 ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium (Wako) and 4.5 × 10−4 M monothioglycerol.

BTAG human iPSCs were maintained on iMatrix-511 (Reprocell) in StemFit medium (Reprocell) supplemented with 100 ng ml−1 bFGF (PeproTech). PGCLC induction was achieved as previously described96. iMeLCs were induced by plating 2.0 × 105 hiPSCs per well of a 12-well plate coated with human plasma fibronectin (Millipore, FC010) in GK15 medium (GMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 15% KSR, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 ng ml−1 activin A (PeproTech), 3 μM CHIR99021 and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632, Axon Medchem). hPGCLCs were induced by plating 4 × 103 iMeLCs per well in a cell-repellent V-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One, 651970) in GK15 medium supplemented with 1,000 U ml−1 hLIF (Millipore, LIF1005), 200 ng ml−1 BMP4 (HumanZyme), 100 ng ml−1 SCF (R&D Systems, 455-MC), 50 ng ml−1 EGF (R&D Systems, 236-EG) and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.

For HEK293T cells, mouse ES cells and MEFs, pEGFP-LSM14A from the Weil laboratory29 was assembled into pLV-EF1a-Ires-Blast (Addgene, 85133).

For human ES cells, the EGFP-LSM14A fragment from pEGFP-LSM14A was amplified using primers F (CCTACCCTCGTAAAGCCGGGCTACCGGTCGCCACCATG) and R (AACTAGAAGGCACAGTTAATGGATCCTTAGGGTCCAAAAGC) and assembled into pAAVS1-tet-iCas9-BFP2 (Addgene, 125519), replacing the iCas9-BFP2 sequence with pEGFP-LSM14A.

To introduce a sequence encoding FKBP12F36V-HA-2A-mCherry in place of the endogenous Ddx6 stop codon, a first donor plasmid was created by integrating two 200-bp homology arms specific to the Ddx6 gene into the pNQL004-SOX2-FKBPV-HA2-P2A-mCherry targeting construct (Addgene, 175552). In conjunction with this donor plasmid, a Ddx6-targeting sgRNA (AGGTACATACGTGCTTGTTA) was cloned into the pSpCas9 (BB)-2A-Hygro plasmid (Addgene, 127763). Both donor plasmids were transfected into GFP-LSM14A mouse ES cells using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection method. Cells exhibiting stable mCherry expression were subsequently isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting to establish single-cell clones. Homozygous insertion was confirmed by genotyping PCR. For this purpose, a forward primer (GCTGGGGACAGAGATCAAACC) and a reverse primer (GTAGGGCTATGCGGCCCTAC) within the DDX6 homology arms were used, along with a reverse primer specific to the mCherry sequence (ATCTGGGCAACCCCTTCTTCC). Loss of endogenous DDX6 upon dTAG-13 treatment was confirmed through western blot analysis.

The Ago2-KO cell line was established with a paired CRISPR–Cas9 approach implemented on WT mouse ES cells, as previously described in ref. 87.

Briefly, v6.5 mouse ES cells underwent transfection with pX458-sgRNA_Ago2_3 and pX458-sgRNA_Ago2_4 plasmids (Addgene, 73531 and 73532). GFP-positive cells were isolated by single-cell sorting in 96-well plates. To verify the deletion, PCR using the Ago2KOΔEx1_Fw (GAAGGCGAAAAAGCCTCCCC) and Ago2KOΔEx1_Rev (GAGCTAGCTTCCCGTCGC) primers was conducted. Positive clones were expanded and verified by western blot and RT–qPCR analyses.

The pLKO-shDDX6 (TRCN0000074696) vector, designed to target the human DDX6 gene, was sourced from the Molecular Profiling Laboratory of the MGH Cancer Center.

To target the mouse Ddx6 gene, shERWOOD UltramiR Lentiviral shRNAs (82, ACAGCTGAACCAGTTGAAGAA; 83, CTGGGCTACTCTTGCTTTTAA) were procured from Transomic Technologies, as previously described28.

To accomplish Nudt21 gene silencing, oligonucleotide pairs encoding shRNA sequences specific to Nudt21 (GGACAACTTTCTTCAAATT) were annealed and cloned into the pSICOR-mCherry-puro vector (Addgene, 31845). The efficacy of KD was validated by RT–qPCR.

In the context of miRNA KD experiments, miR-300 and control miRNA inhibitors (miRNA Power Inhibitors, Qiagen) were directly introduced into the cell culture medium. These inhibitors were added at a final concentration of 50 nM, according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

For knockin TPRX1-EGFP generation, sgRNA (GCTCCCGAGCTAGTTTGGCG) targeting the insertion site of the donor construct containing homologous arms flanked by an EGFP–puromycin cassette, kindly gifted by the Esteban laboratory (Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health,Chinese Academy of Sciences)59, was cloned into the pDonor plasmid. Donor plasmids were electroporated into UCLA-4 human ES cells using the Neon Transfection System. Homozygous insertion was confirmed by genotyping PCR.

Plasmid pNZ176, containing Halo-NLS-MCP, was a kind gift from T. Stasevich (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University). The Halo-NLS-MCP fragment was amplified by PCR from this vector in parallel with PCR amplification of the Ires BFP fragment from the TRE KRAB Cas9 Ires BFP plasmid (Addgene, 85449) using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The resulting fragments were used for NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly (New England Biolabs). The final vector was transfected along with the PBase vector (VectorBuilder) into Nanog-KO106 mouse ES cells using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection method. BFP-positive cells were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

The MS2 reporter construct for Nanog was generated using a multistep cloning approach. First, Nanog was amplified by PCR from the pMXs-Nanog (Addgene, 13354) plasmid using Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Primers to amplify Nanog were CGCTGTGATCGTCACTTGGCGCCGCCATGAGTGTGGGTC and CGCTGTGATCGTCACTTGGCCCACCATGAGTGTGGGTC. The PCR product was treated with DpnI (New England Biolabs) and purified using a PCR cleanup kit (Qiagen). The resulting Nanog fragment was used for Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) with pUB_smFLAG_ActB_MS2 (Addgene, 81083) digested with NotI and NheI (New England Biolabs). The resulting pNANOG-MS2 plasmid was used for Gibson assembly (New England Biolabs) with the let-7WT and let-7Mut sequences amplified from the RL-6xB and RL-6xBMUT vectors (a kind gift fromM.R. Fabian (McGill Centre for Translational Research in Cancer, McGill University))90 using the following primers: Wt_F, TGAAATATGATCTAGAGGACAGCCTATTGAACTACCTCACTCG; Mut_F, TGAAATATGATCTAGAGCACAGCCTATTGAACTACCCCTCACT; R, TTGTAGGTTAGCGGCCGCACCGAATGCG. Finally, the Nanog-let-7WT-MS2 and Nanog-MS2-let-7Mut-MS2 fragments were amplified using the primers F (ACCCTCGTAAAGGTCTAGAGGCCACCATGAGTGTGGGTC) and R (GTCCTCTAGATCATATTTCACCTGGTGGAGTCAC) and assembled into the PiggyBac vector PB-TRE-EGFP-EF1a-rtTA-Blasti digested with Nhe1 and Kpn1. The resulting PiggyBac vectors carrying Nanog-let-7WT-MS2 or Nanog-MS2-let-7Mut-MS2 cassettes were used to transfect Nanog-KO ES cells expressing HALO-NLS-MCP IRES BFP.

P-body purification was performed as previously described. Briefly, GFP-LSM14A cells were subjected to lysis for 20 min on ice using lysis buffer (comprising 50 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl and 0.2% Triton X-100), supplemented with 65 U ml−1 of the ribonuclease inhibitor RNaseOut (Promega) and an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). After this step, the lysates underwent centrifugation at 200g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei from the mixture. Residual DNA was removed by incubation in the presence of 10 mM MgSO4, 1 mM CaCl2 and 4 U ml−1 RQ1 DNase (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 10,000g for 7 min at 4 °C, pellets were resuspended in 40 μl lysis buffer containing 80 U RNaseOut (Promega) to generate the cytoplasmic fraction. P-bodies were then isolated from this cytoplasmic fraction using FACSAria-based sorting. After sorting, the P-body samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000g for 7 min at 4 °C. These pellets, alongside aliquots of the corresponding presorting cytoplasmic fraction, were stored at −80 °C.

For P-body-seq, RNA was isolated from P-body and cytoplasmic fractions using the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were constructed using the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra kit and the Nextera XT kit for Illumina (Takara Bio). When indicated in the text, libraries were prepared using the snapTotal-seq protocol as previously described45. Libraries were sequenced with paired-end 150-bp reads.

Smart-seq data were analyzed by mapping reads using hisat2.1.0 (ref 107) to the mouse mm10 genome assembly, the human hg38 assembly or the chicken gal6 assembly, all retrieved from UCSC. Gene counts were annotated using featureCounts version 1.6.2 using the corresponding UCSC refGene annotation.

snapTotal-seq data were processed using the nf-core RNA-seq pipeline (version 3.9) within a Singularity container. Reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 genome assembly and the human hg38 genome assembly, both of which were retrieved from UCSC with corresponding UCSC refGene annotations. Raw counts were obtained from salmon (version 1.10.2), and the resulting dds objects from nf-core were exported to R for downstream analysis. To determine P-body-enriched and -depleted genes, lowly expressed genes (<10 reads over all samples) were filtered out. Next, DESeq2 version 1.40.2 was used to calculate differential expression between the P-body and cytoplasmic fractions, setting an FDR of P < 0.05 as a threshold for significance. P-body-to-cytoplasmic ratios are represented as log2 (FC (P-body/cytoplasm)), where positive log2 (FC) indicates P-body enrichment and negative log2 (FC) indicates P-body depletion (cytoplasm enriched).

Cell fate gene sets were generated from sequencing data from the cytoplasmic fractions. DESeq2 analysis was performed comparing progenitor cell types with the differentiated cell type in pairwise comparisons (that is, naive versus primed; primed versus endoderm progenitors, mesoderm progenitors and mature endoderm progenitors; and neural progenitors versus neurons). Cell type-specific gene sets were defined as genes with log2 (FC) > 0 and Padj < 0.05. For GSEA, these gene sets were further filtered with a log2 (FC) threshold of >2.5 and Padj < 0.05. GSEA were performed using the fgsea version 1.26.0 R package with nperm = 50,000. Additional GSEA was performed with publicly available data from the following sources: human neurons108, human naive cells103, mouse 2C63, human 8C58, human 8CLC58, ZGA58 and PGCLCs96. Gene ranks were determined with the stat parameter in the results tables generated using DESeq2. GO analysis was performed using enrichGO from the clusterProfiler package, with the universe parameter set to only genes detected in sequencing data.

Orthologs were determined using Ensembl BioMart genes version 108. To calculate GC content and transcript length distributions for P-body- and cytoplasm-enriched genes, we used the biomaRt package to access cDNA sequences from Ensembl (hsapiens_gene_ensembl). Sequences were retrieved using the ‘cdna' attribute, with GC content calculated as the percentage of G and C nucleotides and transcript length as sequence length in nucleotides. For uniformity, only the longest isoform per gene was retained. Transposable element abundance was quantified by mapping reads to RepeatMasker109 (mm39 and hg38) annotations using a custom pipeline to identify repeat family expression patterns across samples.

miRNA targets were obtained from the miRDB database110, in which targets with a threshold score greater than the 75th percentile were deemed a target. To infer targets of RBPs, we used previously compiled CLIP data29 from the CLIPdb 1.0 database, focusing on targets of RBPs that are bound at the 3′ UTR of the target genes. For miRNA and RBP plots, the log2 (FC) P-body-to-cytoplasm ratio of the targets was plotted.

To calculate GC content and transcript length distributions for P-body- and cytoplasm-enriched genes, we used the biomaRt package to access cDNA sequences from Ensembl (hsapiens_gene_ensembl). Sequences were retrieved using the cdna attribute, with GC content calculated as the percentage of G and C nucleotides and transcript length as sequence length in nucleotides. For uniformity, only the longest isoform per gene was retained. To determine the relationship between P-body enrichment and expression levels, RPKM of genes in naive and primed human ES cells were obtained from GSE111020 (ref. 56).

To assess the correlation between P-body enrichment and mRNA half-life, publicly available SLAM-seq data from HEK293T cells49,111, mouse ES cells66 and human iPSCs were used57. Additionally, polyA tail length, as an indicator of mRNA stability, was evaluated by comparing PAIso–seq data from mouse ES cells67. For each dataset, a Pearson correlation was calculated.

Gene coverage plots were generated using PyCoverage (geneBody_coverage.py from the RSeQC package). BED12 files were created for P-body-enriched genes, cytoplasm-enriched genes and all transcripts for each cell type (gene sets defined previously in RNA-seq methods). Gene annotation files in BED format were downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser for mm10 and hg38 genome assemblies, selecting Genes and Gene Predictions group, NCBI RefSeq track and the UCSC RefSeq (refGene) table. These files were converted to BED12 format with custom R code, with which block sizes were calculated as the difference between exon start and end positions and block starts were calculated as the difference between exon start and transcript start. Only the longest isoform per gene was retained. Filtered genome BED12 files for the specified gene lists were then used in the geneBody_coverage.py command, with BAM files for each fraction (two replicates each) analyzed per cell type and species. Resulting outputs were plotted in R, displaying read counts across gene bodies.

RNA-seq data from polysome-containing samples and total RNA samples were analyzed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.9) with default settings. Reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 genome assembly, retrieved from UCSC using the corresponding UCSC refGene annotation. Raw counts were obtained from salmon version 1.10.2.

To determine differentially expressed genes in DDX6-KD samples, lowly expressed genes (<10 reads over all samples) were filtered out. Next, DESeq2 was used to call differential expression between control and dTAG-13-treated total RNA samples. An FDR of P < 0.05 was used as the threshold for significance of differentially expressed genes.

For polysome fractionation analysis, genes were filtered to protein-coding genes using the mm10 refGene annotation. Ribosome occupancy was calculated as log2 (ribosome-bound/total RNA) using DESeq2. Change in ribosome occupancy was calculated as ribosome occupancy degron − ribosome occupancy control. GSEA was performed as described above using mouse gene sets from 2C63, naive104 and primed69 cells.

Ribo-seq data were obtained from ref. 68. To download Ribo-seq raw data, GSE133794 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus and processed using the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline (version 3.9). Reads were aligned to the mouse mm10 genome assembly, retrieved from UCSC using the corresponding UCSC refGene annotation. Raw reads were obtained from salmon version 1.10.2. Reads were normalized by RPKM, and lowly expressed genes (<10 reads over all samples) were filtered out. Translation efficiency was calculated as log2 (reads in Ribo-seq/reads in RNA-seq) for each gene.

Current methods of culturing human epithelial organoids from adult stem cells may not be compatible with clinical applications as they rely on xenogeneic, chemically undefined or non-standardized components such as the basement membrane extract Matrigel. Matrigel provides a source of extracellular matrix molecules, including laminins and collagen IV, which interact with β1 integrins expressed on organoid cells. Here we describe a single-chain (sc) version of antibody TS2/16 that allosterically activates integrin β1 function in organoids. The addition of monomeric scTS2/16 to organoid medium results in up to a fivefold increase in the yield of all gastrointestinal organoids grown in Matrigel. Moreover, scTS2/16 supports a six- to sevenfold increase in the yield of these organoids when cultured in collagen I hydrogels, both in 3D and 2D. Collagen I is well defined, available in clinical-grade formulations and, when combined with scTS2/16, may support the clinical application of epithelial organoids derived from gastrointestinal tissues and other epithelial sources.

Organoids are self-organizing, miniature versions of epithelial tissues that can be expanded over long time periods. Since the 2009 report of a 3D technique to culture adult stem cell-derived intestinal organoids1, protocols have been published for the isolation of organoids representing epithelial tissues derived from all three germ layers1. However, efforts to apply organoids in areas such as drug screening and clinical transplantation have been hindered by limitations of the culture conditions, which typically include xenogeneic, chemically undefined or non-standardized components.

One essential element of these culture conditions is a growth factor cocktail mimicking the stem cell niche. This typically has to be optimized for each individual tissue, yet always contains three key ingredients: potent activators of the Wnt pathway (for example, Wnt3A or its surrogate, plus R-spondins), a tyrosine kinase receptor activator (for example, EGF) and inhibitors of TGFβ and/or BMP (for example, noggin).

A second critical component for proper organoid formation is a cell culture substrate consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which in vivo are presented by the basement membrane2 (Fig. 1a). This thin layer of a specialized ECM forms the supportive structure for epithelia and includes various laminins (Lns), collagen type IV and, to a lesser degree, arginine–glycine–aspartic acid (RGD) motif-containing molecules such as fibronectin. Lns are heterotrimeric proteins assembled from one of five α chains, one of three β chains and one of three γ chains. In higher organisms, these isoforms show varying degrees of cell and tissue specificity. Collagen IV is a heterotrimeric molecule composed of three α-type chains, which form polygonal networks through several types of intermolecular interactions. Both collagen type IV and Lns are produced in vivo by epithelial cells and form independent networks that are connected by nidogen and the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan. A highly concentrated blend of these proteins, approximating the composition of the basement membrane, is produced by the mouse Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm tumor after inoculation into the abdomen of mice3. Its major component, embryonic α1β1γ1 Ln (Ln-111), has essential roles in the polarization and differentiation of epithelial cells4. The ECM protein collagen type IV is another major component. Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm tumor extracts, collected from mice, are marketed under the names Matrigel and basement membrane extract (BME). Both are enriched for ECM and, especially Matrigel, have been used extensively for culturing epithelial cells1, including 3D structures from mammary epithelium4. Matrigel has also enabled the establishment of adult stem cell-based organoid technology5. The use of Matrigel is hampered by its cost, batch-to-batch variability, contamination by mouse proteins and ethical considerations on the use of experimental animals. Clinical-grade Matrigel has not been available.

a, In vivo, integrin receptors on the basal membrane of epithelial cells contact a mix of ligand proteins of the basal lamina (basal lam.). In vitro, these are replaced by Matrigel or BME proteins. b, Organoids were grown in BME in the absence (control, Cntrl) or presence of a strong inhibitory integrin β1 Ab (AIIB2). Subsequent staining for basal marker integrin β1, in both conditions, was performed on organoids with permeabilized cells. The apical marker zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and nuclear marker DAPI were used. Yellow marked boxes indicate examples of line scans to quantify the intensity profile of the markers shown in c. Scale bars, 50 µm. c, Intensity plot of fluorescent apical and basal markers in cross-sections of the membrane. Permeabilized control- and mAb AIIB2-treated intestinal organoids as shown in b were stained for basal marker integrin β1, apical marker ZO-1 and nuclear marker DAPI as a reference. Apical and basal positions (black vertical lines) were identified based on F-actin staining with phalloidin (not shown), and the mean profile (sharp colored lines) of multiple organoids (n = 8 per condition) was calculated (shadowed areas show the s.d.). d, Quantification of Ki67-positive nuclei after 2 days of culture of control and mAb AIIB2-treated intestinal organoids (N = 1 independent experiment), using immunofluorescence staining (one-tailed t-test P value is 8.8 × 10−3 for n = 4 biological replicates). e, Culture images (n = 1 biological replicate) of the survival of intestinal organoids in the presence or absence of AIIB2 at days 0 and 9. Scale bars, 2 mm. f, For quantification of viable cells (N = 1 independent experiment), an ATP-sensitive luminescence assay (CellTiter-GLO) was performed at the indicated days. Mean values for consecutive days represent the mean ± s.d. (n = 3). Data were normalized based on the mean values of day 0.

The contact that epithelial cells make in vivo with ECM proteins (or in vitro with Matrigel) is mediated by αβ1 integrins6. The specificity of the interaction with individual ECM components is determined by the various α chains, while the resulting intracellular signals are transduced by the β1 chain. Interactions with Lns proceed via α3β1 and α6β1 (ref. 7). The GFOGER motif in collagen allows adhesion in conjunction with α1β1 and α2β1 integrins6. A third class of ECM proteins, which includes fibronectin, interacts with α5β1 integrin through the short RGD sequence.

Various studies have described synthetic hydrogels (for example, polyisocyanide (PIC)8 or polyethyleneglycol (PEG))9, functionalized with integrin-binding motifs taken from ECM proteins. The individual chains of heterotrimeric laminins act cooperatively in binding to integrins with high affinity, and as a consequence, no simple binding motifs have been defined. Therefore, recombinant full-length Ln-111 was coupled to a PIC gel10. The in vitro synthesis of trimeric laminins in mammalian cells is, however, complex and expensive. By contrast, several synthetic PEG gels have been described in which the GFOGER peptide, alone or in conjunction with the RGD adhesion motif, maintains gastrointestinal organoids, albeit less efficiently than the Matrigel benchmark11. Similar results were obtained with ductal pancreas organoids12.

To improve the growth of human intestinal organoids in hydrogels, we were inspired by allosteric antibodies activating the integrin β1 chain operating on leukocytes, first described approximately three decades ago13. Like epithelial cells, leukocytes express several β1 integrins, which mediate interactions with ECM components as well as other cells. Leukocyte adhesion is a highly regulated and essential process in the immune response and inflammation. The human integrin β1-specific TS2/16 antibody14 strongly enhances the adhesion by α2β1, α5β1 and α6β1 integrins with their respective ECM ligands, as well as of α4β1 to endothelial VCAM protein. A similar TS2/16-induced increase in cell-substrate adhesiveness has been observed for non-hematopoietic cells: for example, neuronal cells in defined stages of chicken embryo development were induced to bind to Ln in vivo in the presence of the β1-activating antibody TASC15.

The non-constitutive nature of integrin interactions implies that ligand binding requires structural changes in the integrins themselves. This was first shown for the αVβ3 and αIIbβ3 integrins16. Electron microscopy (EM) studies subsequently revealed that the β1 integrins adopt similar conformational changes17. Integrins are known to exist in three formational states16: two low-affinity states, bent–closed and extended–closed, and one high-affinity state characterized by an extended conformation with an open ligand binding domain (headpiece). A variety of β1 subunit-specific antibodies have been used to induce or stabilize these conformational states and measure their affinity (Supplementary Fig. 1). For example, the anti-integrin ß1 blocking antibody AIIB2 allosterically stabilizes the bent, low-affinity conformation of the β1 integrin chain18. By contrast, TS2/16, binds to closed headpieces in the absence of ligand17 and stabilizes the open, high-affinity headpiece conformation in the presence of ligand14,17. This well-described ability of TS2/16 to enhance leukocyte adhesion inspired us to explore its properties in epithelial organoid cultures. We designed a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of the original TS2/16 antibody that similarly activates β1 integrins with the additional advantage of being expressed in bacteria at high yields. The potency of this designed integrin activator in organoid culture is shown across various human epithelial organoids in 3D and 2D in Matrigel and collagen I hydrogels.

Adult stem cell-derived intestinal organoids, showing a basal-out phenotype in the presence of external Matrigel, invert their polarity to basal-in when cultured in the absence of Matrigel19. We tested the role of integrin β1, dominantly expressed in various organoid models (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2), on polarity and associated physiology. The rat anti-integrin β1 antibody AIIB2 has previously been shown to allosterically block the recognition of β1 integrins for all three major integrin ligand classes (Ln, collagen and RGD-class proteins)18. This antibody enabled us to comprehensively test the role of the β1 integrin component in basal–apical polarization of diverse organoid types. Figure 1b–f summarizes the strong effects of adding the AIIB2 antibody to human colon organoids. The ‘basal-out' phenotype of these organoids, cultured in the presence of BME, inverted within 12 h to a basal-in phenotype following exposure to AIIB2 (Fig. 1b–f). This condition resulted in an immediate abrogation of growth, measured as a strong decrease in the percentage of cells expressing the nuclear proliferation marker Ki67 (Fig. 1d), in visual growth kinetics (Fig. 1e) and in a quantitative cellular ATP assay (Fig. 1f). These observations implied that integrin-mediated signals normally maintain growth and are blocked by AIIB2. Further confirmation for cell cycle exit in response to AIIB2 was seen during a time-course experiment on 2D BME-coated transwells loaded with a human ileal organoid line, stably expressing the fluorescent ubiquitination based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) reporter(Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). A quantitative PCR analysis, performed on 3D BME-grown duodenal organoids, indicated that AIIB2-arrested cells differentiate into enterocytes and goblet cells (Extended Data Fig. 3).

We next examined the ability of an activating antibody to functionally activate the integrins at the epithelial-organoid cell surface6. We constructed a humanized IgG version and single-chain (sc) derivative of the mouse TS2/16 antibody, the latter for ease of production in bacteria (Fig. 2a). We determined the hybridoma-derived sequences of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of the mouse Ab TS2/16 (ref. 14) and used human codon-optimized synthetic DNA (Extended Data Fig. 4) to clone these into huIgG1 H- and қL-chain vectors. The humanized IgG was subsequently purified using standard chromatography purification (Fig. 2b). For the sc version, the combined V regions of the H and L chains were linked in two orientations (Fig. 2a) and connected via a 3×(GGGGS) linker. Both protein versions (Extended Data Fig. 5) were cloned into a pET expression vector using Escherichia coli codon-optimized DNA. To obtain pure sc versions, a routine protocol for protein extraction, solubilization and refolding was implemented20. On average, we obtained 1 mg pure scTS2/16 per 50 ml of bacterial suspension, sufficient for approximately 7 l of cell culture medium at a final concentration of 5 nM. sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the purified scFv version of TS2/16 (VH–VL) is shown in Fig. 2b. We also developed a protocol to produce scTS2/16 in the human cell line HEK293 (Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). The scTS2/16 (VH–VL) bound the ectodomain of the β1 subunit in solution, analogous to its parental IgG version (Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Functionally, both huIgG1 and scFv versions (VH–VL) induced adhesion at low nM concentrations of K562 (erythroleukemia) cells to fibronectin, a standard assay for integrin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 2c,d). We decided to focus on the scFv (VH–VL) version of TS2/16 (scTS2/16) for subsequent studies.

a, Integrin recognition-providing VH and VL chains of the mouse hybridoma TS2/16 were cloned into a human IgG1 backbone or combined in a single-chain antibody version. Both scFv orientations (VH–VL and VL–VH) are shown with the N-terminal and C-terminal. The concept of the procedure is schematically displayed. b, SDS-PAGE analysis of purified TS2/16 IgG (±180 kDa) and scFv (±26 kDa) (shown is the VH–VL version) under reducing and non-reducing conditions (N = 2). Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The positions of separate H and L chains of IgG under reducing conditions are indicated. The molecular weights of markers in kilodaltons (kDa) are indicated on the left margin. c, Bright-field images of the K562 leukocyte cell-based adhesion reporter assay. K562 cells were allowed to adhere to plastic-coated fibronectin for 1 h at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 5 nM of IgG- or scFv-type TS2/16 antibody. Cells, remaining after three buffer washes under the conditions indicated, are shown (triplicate values). N = >3 for number of experiments. Scale bars, 100 µm. d, A luminescence cell viability assay (CellTiter-Glo) was used to quantify the adhesion of K562 cells (N = 3 for number of experiments) to the fibronectin-coated plate under conditions shown in c.

One of the main components of BME is the protein Ln-111. Four different integrins, α3β1, α6β1, α7β1 and α6β4, differentially bind to members of the Ln family of proteins21. Integrin α6β1 (ref. 22) binds to Ln-111, the embryonic Ln present in BME. The organoid-expressed α3β1 and α6β4 integrins bind to Ln-332 and Ln-511/521 (Extended Data Fig. 8), but these are absent in BME. The specific role of α6β1 integrin in Ln-111 binding was confirmed by exogenous expression of integrin α6β1 in K562 cells. Ln-111 recognition acquired following integrin-α6 transfection was evident, but certainly not maximal. It could be strongly enhanced by adding the activating TS2/16 antibody23.

We tested whether this phenomenon would translate to potentiated adhesion of colon organoid cells to coated BME. We used a series of concentrations of scTS2/16 in the low nM range. The adhesion in the absence of scTS2/16 (11 × 105 relative light units (RLU)) reached its maximum (22 × 105 RLU) at 2 nM (Fig. 3a). The AIIB2 blocking antibody inhibited the spontaneous adhesion of organoid cells, as a validation of this adhesion assay. As BME contains both Ln-111 and collagen IV, we tested the contributions of these components independently in organoid adhesion. Again, we detected maximum enhancement effects of scTS2/16 at 2 nM for the individual components. The inhibitory AIIB2 antibody completely inhibited the adhesion of organoids to both coats (Supplementary Fig. 3). To assess whether the integrin α6 subunit was also crucial in mediating growth of colon organoids in BME, we added the inhibitory integrin α6-specific GoH3 antibody24 while regularly splitting colon organoid cultures. The results shown in Fig. 3b indicated a strong GoH3-induced reduction of growth. We then tested whether activation of the β1 integrins could enhance the growth of colonic organoids. Addition of scTS2/16 to standard 3D colon organoid culture in BME at 5 nM led to a 3-fold increase in colon organoid growth (0.9 × 106 to 2.8 × 106 RLU). This was observed after 10 days of culture by assessment of total genomic DNA, ATP-dependent luminescent light units (Fig. 3c) and bright-field images of the organoid cultures (Fig. 3d). An essential component of integrin adhesion is the presence of cations of manganese (Mn2+)21,25. We supplemented 1 nM MnCl2-containing, complete organoid medium with 1 mM MnCl2. The latter serves as the benchmark for maximal integrin adhesion. We then directly compared the Mn2+ effects on adhesion and proliferation to 5 nM scTS2/16. While both induced an increase in adhesion, only scTS2/16 potentiated growth (Supplementary Fig. 4b). The proliferation-promoting effects of scTS2/16 are reflected in the increase of Ki67-positive nuclei from 20% in the absence of the scFv to 36% in the presence of the scFv (P = 4.1 × 10−4) (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Single-cell cloning from primary tissue or from organoids is generally highly inefficient5,26. We tested the effect of scTS2/16 on the plating efficiency of such single cells and noted that the clonal outgrowth in the presence of scFv TS2/16 (at 5 nM) improved from 30 × 103 RLU in the absence of scTS2 to 330 × 103 RLU in the presence of scTS2 (Fig. 3e,f). By contrast, the outgrowth of organoids, even in the presence of scTS2/16, was completely blocked by adding the inhibitory integrin α6-specific GoH3, emphasizing the importance of the integrin α6 component. The positive effects of integrin β1-stimulatory antibodies on the outgrowth of organoids from single cells were much less strong for the two other β1-chain conformation-stabilizing antibodies, 9EG7 (ref. 27) and 12G10 (ref. 28) (number of clones 15, 35, 20 and 100 at 5 nM for the control, 12G10, 9EG7 and TS2/16, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6). The TS2/16-stabilized high-affinity conformation of β1 integrins on leukocytes enhances intercellular (VCAM-1)29 and cell-to-ECM adhesion17,30. Our data show that an scFv version of the antibody also improves the establishment and expansion of epithelial organoids by the enhancement of α6β1-mediated interaction with Ln-111/collagen IV as presented in the BME.

We then tested whether the observed integrin β1-regulated proliferation of intestinal organoids in BME also held for organoids derived from other regions of the human gastrointestinal tract: duodenum (N = 2), J2 jejunum (N = 2) and N39 ileum (N = 2), stomach organoids31 (N = 1) and ductal-type organoids from the pancreas32 (N = 2) and liver33 (N = 2). The pertinent organoids were grown in BME supplemented with control medium or with 5 nM of either the inhibitory mAb AIIB2 or the stimulating scTS2/16 antibody. AIIB2-induced inhibition and scTS2/16 enhancement of growth (compared with the medium without antibody) were observed in all cases (fold increases in examples shown in Fig. 4 were 5-fold (stomach), 2.2-fold (duodenum), 1.6-fold (liver), 8.1-fold (pancreas), 1.5-fold (jejunum) and 1.4-fold (ileum)) (Fig. 4). To exclude major morphological changes resulting from the use of scFv, high-magnification confocal images of 3D BME-scTS2/16-grown jejunal organoids are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7. To assess whether scTS2/16-stimulated growth caused shifts in the transcriptome of the cells, bulk sequence experiments were performed on control and Ab-stimulated 3D BME cultures of P26N colon, Duo-72 duodenum and J2 jejunum organoids (Extended Data Fig. 9). The statistical analysis revealed no significant changes. We concluded that growth of gastrointestinal tract organoids depends on β1-class integrins and is strongly enhanced by the addition of scTS2/16 to their medium.

Single-cell initiated cultures of stomach (N = 1), duodenum (N = 2) and ductal organoids from the liver (N = 2) and pancreas (N = 2), jejunum (N = 2) and ileum (N = 2) were grown in the presence of either 5 nM inhibitory mAb AIIB2 or activating scTS2/16. The organoid and medium types are indicated at the left and top of the figure, respectively. Scale bars, 2 mm. For quantification of the number of viable cells, an ATP-sensitive luminescence assay (CellTiter-GLO) was performed on the same day the images were taken. The mean RLU (×105) ± s.d. is indicated. One-tailed t-test P values for the control versus AIIB2 and scTS2/16 are 1.5 × 10−4 and 3.1 × 10−3 for the stomach (number of experiments, N = 1; n = 3 biological replicates). Similarly for duodenum, 4.0 × 10−11 and 5.8 × 107 (number of experiments, N = 2; n = 6 biological replicates); liver, 3.1 × 10−11 and 4.2 × 10−6 (number of experiments, N = 4; n = 10 biological replicates); pancreas, 9.0 × 10−6 and 1.1 × 10−10 (number of experiments, N = 5; n = 9 biological replicates); jejunum, 6.0 × 10−8 and 2.8 × 10−3 (number of experiments, N = 2; n = 5 biological replicates); and finally, ileum 3.0 × 10−4 and 7.67 × 10−5 (number of experiments, N = 2; n = 5 biological replicates).

Based on the scFv-generated improvement of gastrointestinal organoids in BME, we tested the hypothesis that organoid growth in an alternative hydrogel would also benefit from the addition of scTS2/16. Collagen recognition by integrins was shown to be highly sensitive to TS2/16 (ref. 34) and has been explored extensively for in vivo and in vitro applications35,36,37. In a first attempt to enhance growth by scTS2/16 in a collagen type I hydrogel, we focused on colon organoids. A commercially available preformulated isotonic form of collagen I with neutral pH forms a 3D hydrogel by simply warming to 37 °C (PureCol EZ Gel). In total, 4 α-integrin subunits (α1, α2, α10 and α11) harbor a collagen-binding I-domain insert and share the β1 subunit. Of these, we observed the expression of α2β1 in BME-grown colon organoids, both at the RNA level (Extended Data Fig. 1) and by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 5a). In accordance with these findings, the scTS2/16 amplified adhesion of colon organoid cells toward PureCol EZ Gel (uninduced 7.5 × 105 to 22.5 × 105 when scTS2/16-induced) (Fig. 5b). By contrast, the inhibitory AIIB2 antibody blocked the uninduced and induced components of this adhesion (Fig. 5b). P26N colon organoids showed a ±3-fold increase of their growth in collagen (Supplementary Fig. 8b). Also in these colon organoids, no major morphological changes were observed in confocal images (Supplementary Fig. 8c).

The targeted base is highlighted in orange, and the PAM sequence is identified in blue. Single colonies were grown in the presence of scTS2/16 and picked for sequencing. The image represents the relevant DNA sequence of 1 of 3 verified clones. d, Parental and ITGA2-KO organoids were grown in parallel in BME and PureCol EZ Gel, in the presence of scTS2/16 (N = 3 for number of experiments). Growth was quantified by CellTiterGlo. Mean ± s.d. of the relative light units (RLU × 103) of biological replicates (n = 4). In parallel wells (n = 1 biological replicate), tissue yield was measured by counting cells (numbers shown in the images). e,f, Primary biopsies (N = 3 experiments) of colon (e) and cholangiocyte (N = 2 experiments) (f) tissue were processed and embedded in collagen I in the presence or absence of scTS2/16. For the colon, images and quantification were done after 10 days of culture (n = 4 biological replicates). P value for control versus scTS2/16 = ±3 × 10−3. Scale bars, 2 mm. For primary cholangiocytes, collagen-derived organoids (Supplementary Fig. 11) were cultured for 3 weeks. Subsequently, scTS2/16 sensitivity was measured (N = 1 for number of experiments, with 6 biological replicates) by counting the number of cells (P value one-tailed t-test for scFv effect 5.8 × 10−5).

We then created null alleles of the gene for the integrin α2 subunit (ITGA2) by CRISPR to confirm the relevance of the collagen-recognizing (α2β1) integrin for colon organoid growth in collagen hydrogels (Fig. 5c). As predicted, ITGA2 gene mutation blocked organoid growth in collagen I, even in the presence of scTS2/16. While BME enabled isolation of the ITGA2−/− cells, growth was slightly reduced compared with the parental organoids, indicating that BME growth of organoids is at least in part controlled by collagen IV (Fig. 5d).

We then tested fresh colon biopsies for organoid outgrowth in collagen I hydrogel, both in the presence and absence of scTS2/16. Colon tissue from donors (N = 3) was enzymatically processed and epithelial cell suspensions were embedded in collagen I. The addition of 5 nM of scTS2/16-containing medium yielded substantial more organoids (average of 25 clones; n = 4) compared with standard colon medium (average of 6 clones; n = 4) (Fig. 5e). Both BME-established organoid lines, as well as those from primary biopsies, showed difficulty expanding in collagen hydrogel after repeated splitting. A ‘niche-inspired' medium was recently designed for intestinal organoids38. We tested the contribution of the growth factors IGF1 and FGF2 (taken from this protocol) for application in collagen hydrogel (of note, the relevant receptors are expressed at the mRNA level). Each of these contributed to improved growth. In addition, CHIR and forskolin further enhanced the culture. We compared growth (percentage Ki67) and apical–basal polarity (ezrin and integrin β1, respectively) of an ileum organoid line in three hydrogel conditions: BME, collagen and collagenscTS2/16. At passage 1, organoids growing in the absence of scTS2/16 lost their apical–basal polarity as well as the proliferation marker Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 9). We then tested the same culture conditions growing an ileum organoid line harboring fluorescent reporters for all three secretory cell types, enabling monitoring of ongoing differentiation. These N39 triple-reporter organoids could be passaged at least six times in collagen (Supplementary Fig. 10d), but appeared fully dependent on it for the addition of scTS2/16. Cells from passages P0 and P2 showed differentiation toward all three secretory cell types when subjected to differentiation medium. Supplementary Fig. 10a presents fluorescent confocal images of the reporters while Supplementary Fig. 10b provides a quantitative analysis of these reporters based on flow cytometry.

When ITGA2-expressing human liver bile duct organoids (Extended Data Fig. 1) were stimulated by scTS2/16, increased adhesion toward collagen I ensued. Guided by these results, we tested the outgrowth of cholangiocyte organoids in collagen I hydrogels, directly from primary liver biopsies. This mirrored the adhesion results. There were consistently more organoids in the scTS2/16 medium compared with the control medium from 3 to 13 (ctr versus scFv) and from 13 to 22 (ctr versus scFv), respectively (n = 2) (Supplementary Fig. 11). These proved to be epCAMhigh, as expected for this cell type. We subsequently quantified the scTS2/16 effects on the newly derived collagen-based cholangiocyte organoids (Fig. 5f). A substantial twofold increase in number of organoids (ctr 15 to 35) was seen for ctr and scTS2/16, respectively.

Based on the principles established in the 3D cultures, we tested whether collagen-based culturing of organoids in 2D would similarly be enhanced by scTS2/16. Such cultures have been described previously, in which intestinal cells were cultured on a monolayer of myofibroblasts39. Other protocols allow short-term human organoid growth40 or apply a more complex collagen sandwich technique in combination with the use of small molecules (CHIR and valproic acid) to maintain growth41.

Here we tested scTS2/16-supported growth of P26N colon, Duo-72 duodenal and J2-jejunal organoids in transwells. These were coated with the same collagen used in 3D. Growth was compared with that in BME-coated inserts under otherwise identical conditions. Results are shown in Supplementary Fig. 12 (P26N), Supplementary Fig. 13 (duodenum) and Supplementary Fig. 14 (jejunum). scTS2/16-supplemented P26N colon cultures produced 2.8-fold to 4.5-fold more tissue, on BME and collagen, respectively. For the Duo-72 duodenum cultures, improvements in response to scTS2/16 were measured both on BME (amplification ±2.4-fold) and collagen (amplification ±2.4-fold). For the jejunum line (Supplementary Fig. 14), these amplification factors were ±7.5 (BME) and ±4.75 (PureCol EZ Gel). Similarly to the 3D cultures, we tested the stability of the transcriptomes of these 2D cultures in the presence of scTS2/16. Bulk RNA sequencing confirmed the stability of these in vitro intestinal cultures (Extended Data Fig. 10).

Given these positive short-term 2D results, we then tested whether these effects would be maintained in long-term culture. We first cultured Duo-72 duodenum organoids in collagen-coated transwell inserts in the presence and absence of scTS2/16 (Fig. 6a). We passaged both types of cultures four times, restarting with a fixed number of single cells at each round. The experiment was quantified by scoring the number of cells in inserts at the end of each passage. By extrapolating these values over four passages, we found that approximately 15 times more cells were produced in the presence of scTS2/16. For the second experiment (Fig. 6b), we cultured J2 jejunum organoids in collagen-coated inserts for six passages in the presence of scTS2/16. We then tested the competency of these cells to differentiate to the major specialized intestinal cell types. Cells, sequentially for 2 weeks in patterning42 and 2 weeks in IL22+ maturation42 media (both scTS2/16+), had retained the capacity to differentiate toward enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells and enteroendocrine cells (Fig. 6b). The results were found to be indistinguishable from the same cells grown under the same conditions but on a BME coat.

a, Jejunal organoid cultures were started with 5 × 104 cells (n = 2) on PureCol EZ Gel-coated inserts of transwells. Intestinal expansion medium, ±scTS2/16, was present in the upper and lower compartments. Passaging of control and scFv cultures took place after approaching full confluency in the latter. In both control and scTS2/16 conditions, cells were counted and gain factors calculated (table at the bottom). Freshly coated inserts were reloaded with 5 × 104 cells. Cumulative growth as depicted in the graph was calculated by multiplying the measured gain factors in successive passages. b, Duodenal organoids were scTS2/16 grown in collagen I-coated transwells. After 6 passages, the expansion medium was exchanged with ‘patterning' medium for 14 days, and subsequently for 14 days with ‘maturation medium'. Both scTS2/16-supplemented differentiation media were applied only to the bottom compartment (liquid–air culture). The panels show confocal images of ApoA1 staining in enterocytes, lysozyme (LYZ) in Paneth cells, mucin 2 (Muc2) in goblet cells and chromogranin A (CHGA) in enteroendocrine cells.

Here we exploit the functional importance of integrin β1 in epithelial organoid cultures derived from the human small intestine, colon, stomach, pancreas and liver. We describe an sc integrin-activating antibody, scTS2/16, that is easily produced and strongly enhances organoid outgrowth. We observe potent growth-blocking effects of the inhibitory integrin β1 subunit-specific antibody AIIB2, while the activating integrin β1 subunit antibody TS2/16 enhances organoid growth. The agonistic scTS2/16 binds the human β1 subunit with high affinity. Moreover, scTS2/16 is highly potent in supporting the establishment and growth of organoids in the standard BME hydrogel, simply by addition to the culture medium as a soluble monomer. We observe a crucial role for the integrin α6 component in BME-dependent growth. We currently believe that organoid growth in BME results from the parallel interaction of α2β1 with collagen IV and α6β1 with Ln-111, both natural ECM components present in BME. We also find that scTS2/16 supports the growth of organoids in hydrogels of purified collagen I. CRISPR-mediated ITGA2-gene knockout showed the α2β1 integrin to be responsible for this effect. Our 2D protocol reveals that scTS2/16 enables potent, long-term culturing of intestinal tissue on collagen coats. The tissue generated under these conditions remains competent to differentiate into secretory Paneth cells and cells participating in the absorption of nutrients (enterocytes) and the production of mucus (goblet cells) and hormones (enteroendocrine cells).

The TS2/16 antibody reinforces adhesion and growth in organoids most probably by providing a counterforce to contractility of the cytoskeleton. A strong indication of this is the inhibition of collagen contraction by TS2/16 (ref. 43), identical to the effect of Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitors44. Involvement of ROCK inhibition in growth was shown in primary keratinocytes, which are conditionally transformed following prolonged exposure to small-molecule inhibitors of the ROCK kinase45. Functional evidence for the initiating role of integrin–ligand signaling in these effects was nicely shown by deleting ITGB1 in preimplantation epiblasts46. The versatility of scTS2/16 arises most probably from the fact that the integrin α chains of the ECM proteins Ln and collagen I or collagen IV share the β1 signal transduction chain.

Several earlier studies describe well-defined hydrogels for gastrointestinal organoids. Generally, these studies have used organoids established in Matrigel as starting material. The first two involved synthetic PEG gel11,12, functionalized with ligand mimetic peptides PHSRN-RGD (Fn) and GFOGER (Col), combined with a mix of ECM-sequestering peptides. In one of the studies11, growth of human small intestinal organoids was successful, although the gel did not match the Matrigel benchmark of the organoid emergence rate and overall proliferation. The collagen mimetic GFOGER peptide clearly dominated in driving proliferation over the PHSRN-RGD peptides. This is in line with our collagen results and with fibrinogen hydrogel findings by others47. The second study describes growth of normal mouse ductal pancreas organoids, and mouse and human adenocarcinoma organoids12. In these three organoid types, growth was again largely dependent on the GFOGER peptides. Notably, growth was reduced in the presence of antagonists of laminin–α3β1 or α6β1 interactions in adenocarcinoma-type organoids. It is unclear whether this Ln-driven growth is a characteristic of the adenocarcinoma status, is specific for mouse species or is a result of the PEG-bound ECM-binding peptides retaining cell-secreted laminins. It thus remains unclear whether normal human pancreas organoids would also grow in this gel. An obvious possibility is to supplement such systems with scTS2/16, thereby improving integrin interaction with both ligand mimetics and cell-secreted ECM proteins. A PIC hydrogel, decorated with high concentrations of Matrigel isolated laminin–entactin, or recombinantly produced laminin-111, successfully maintained human liver organoid cultures10. It appears unlikely that this PIC-recombinant Ln-111 hydrogel would provide an affordable hydrogel. One previous study has described that human colon organoids can be grown in collagen I directly from primary tissue39. We predict that this approach will benefit from the addition of scTS2/16.

The Yersinia protein invasin is known to activate α3β1, α4β1, α5β1 and α6β1 integrins, but not the collagen receptors α1β1 and α2β1. We have shown recently that an invasin coat replaces the use of Matrigel in 2D organoid sheet cultures48. This approach is complementary to the current study: invasin acts fully independently of a hydrogel yet does not work in solution, unlike scTS2/16. Moreover, it replaces the ECM support provided by laminins but not by collagen.

The observation that the activation of β1 integrins by scTS2/16 in leukocytes extends to epithelial organoid cells opens a range of applications. The availability of this reagent, which allows organoids to grow in collagen-only hydrogels, may avoid the need for BME or Matrigel. Moreover, its production in E. coli or in the HEK293 line allows the generation of clinical-grade batches. Clinical-grade collagen preparations are already widely available for tissue repair37 and cosmetic applications. Mouse and human colon organoids have been shown to be transplantable in mice49,50,51. To date, two ASC-based early-phase organoid clinical trials have been registered: the transplantation of autologous colon organoids as treatment of ulcerative colitis (clinical trial UMIN000030117, Japanese Registry) and the transplantation of salivary gland organoids for treatment of radiation-induced xerostomia (dry mouth syndrome) (clinical trial NCT04593589). The use of scTS2/16 would improve expansion of such transplantable human organoids. Moreover, an scTS2/16-induced high-affinity state of the transplanted organoid cells may instruct these to engraft more efficiently.

P26N human colon organoids were grown for 2 days in BME ± the rat anti-integrin β1 antibody AIIB2 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB) catalog number AIIB2, Research Resource Identifier (RRID): AB_528306) at a concentration of 1 μg ml−1. Organoids were collected using cell recovery solution (Thermo Fisher) and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 1 h. Hereafter, organoids were washed with PBS 0.1% Tween (PBST) (2% BSA). Three-dimensional imaging of organoids was performed essentially as described previously52. In short, organoids were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies binding ZO-I (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog number 61-7300, RRID: AB_2533938), ITGB1 gene product (R and D Systems catalog number MAB1778, RRID: AB_357909) and Ki67 (Millipore catalog number AB9260, RRID: AB_2142366) or ITGA2-encoded gene (Abcam catalog number ab30487, RRID: AB_775702). Following extensive washing with PBST, binding of primary reagents was visualized by overnight incubation in PBST–2% BSA containing donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog number A10042, RRID: AB_2534017) and goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog number A-11070, RRID: AB_2534114). Phalloidin Atto 747N (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for direct visualization of F-actin. DNA was stained with DAPI D1306 (Thermo Fisher). Organoids were optically cleared in a glycerol–fructose clearing solution before imaging. Organoids were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope. Analysis was done with ImageJ software.

We used a simplified workflow to sequence the variable regions of the mouse TS2/16 hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) HB-243) as described53. A human codon-optimized DNA sequence encoding the VH and VL domains of antibody TS2/16 was synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher) and cloned into pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hK, respectively (Invivogen). Expression vectors were co-transfected into Expi293F human suspension cells using ExpiFectamine (Thermo Fisher). IgG protein was purified by affinity chromatography using CaptivAHF protein-A affinity resin (Repligen), followed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva).

E. coli codon-optimized DNA coding sequences of the TS2/16 scFvs (Supplementary Fig. 3) were synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher) and cloned into a pET21 vector harboring a C-terminal 6x-HIS tag (Novagen) using standard molecular biology techniques. Protein expression induction, using 1 mM IPTG (Sigma), was done in BL21(DE3) cells starting with an optical density (OD)600 of 0.6 in standard lysogeny broth (LB) medium. Production was at 28 °C for approximately 18 h. Bacterial pellets obtained were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.4% Triton ×100) and then sonicated (5 cycles; 10 s on, 20 s off). The insoluble fraction, obtained by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min, was guanidine–hydrochloride solubilized and refolded as described previously20. The partially purified and refolded scFv was further purified using Ni-NTA (Qiagen), followed by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex S200 increase 10/300 GL size-exclusion column (Cytiva) in HBS (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl). An analysis of the quality of protein purification was performed running samples, under reducing and non-reducing conditions, on a 4–15% TGX precast SDS-PAGE (Biorad) gel. Proteins were visualized using InstantBlue Coomassie Protein stain (Abcam).

The coding sequence of the TS2/16 scFv (VH–VL orientation) containing the artificial human kappa L-chain signal sequence, and C-terminal tags (8×His tag), HRV 3C site (LEVLFQ/GP), Fc-tag (huIgG1) and a stop codon, was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Extended Data Fig. 4). Expression was performed by transient transfection of Expi293 cells using the ExpiFectamine transfection kit (Gibco) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After 4 days, the TS2/16 scFv-Fc was captured from the conditioned media with CaptivA−HF protein-A affinity resin (Repligen, CA-PRI-0100) and eluted with IgG elution buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 300 mM NaCl and neutralized with 100 mM Tris pH 8.0 to reach eventually pH 7.0. The sample buffer was exchanged to 1 × HBS (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl) using Amicon centrifugal filters (MWCO 30 kDa) and treated with PreScission protease (Cytiva) overnight at 4 °C. Next, the Fc-tag was captured with CaptivA−HF protein-A affinity resin and the PreSission protease with Glutathione Sepharose 4C (Cytiva). Finally, the TS2/16 scFv was purified on size-exclusion chromatography with Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytivia) on the ÄKTA pure chromatography system (Cytivia) in 1 × HBS running buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 300 mM NaCl). The TS2/16 scFv was then concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore, MWCO 10 kDa) and sterilized by filtration over a 0.22-μm centrifugal filter (Merck). Protein concentration was determined via NanoDrop A280 reading using the respective protein molecular weight and extinction coefficient. Size-exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis for final quality control are shown in (Extended Data Fig. 4).

We used the procedure reported previously20 to recombinantly produce the extracellular domain of β1 subunit in the absence of any α-subunit. Deletion of the ~30 amino acid specific-determining loop in the I-like domain is essential for stable secretion of this ectodomain. The DNA coding sequence was synthesized by GeneArt (Thermo Fisher) and cloned into vector pcDNA3.1 (Addgene). Expression vector was transfected into Expi293F human suspension cells using ExpiFectamine (Thermo Fisher). Purification of the C-terminally Flag epitope tagged was performed by absorption of secreted protein to M2-agarose beads (Sigma), and elution by excess 3 × Flag peptides (Sigma). Eluted proteins were subsequently subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva). For immunoprecipitation experiments of the β1 ectodomain, we used ProteinG (Sigma) or M2-agarose (Sigma). All washes and antibody incubations were in standard PBS. The anti-integrin β4 antibody (Abcam catalog number ab110167, RRID: AB_10866385), the anti-β1 antibody (R and D Systems catalog number MAB1778, RRID: AB_357909) and the anti-HUTS4 (Millipore catalog number MAB2079Z, RRID: AB_11214024), M2 anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number F3165, RRID: AB_259529), anti-Flag HRP (Abcam catalog number ab49763, RRID: AB_869428) and anti-6 × HIS HRP (R and D Systems catalog number MAB050H, RRID: AB_357354) antibodies were used. We used 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel (Biorad) under reducing conditions, and PVDF membrane (Immobilon) for blotting. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (GE HealthCare) was used in the study.

Erythroleukemia cell line K562 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) with 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin and 5% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Bovine fibronectin (Thermo Fisher) was diluted to 20 μg ml−1 in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a flat-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner). Subsequently, wells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. K562 cells were resuspended in DMEM/F12 advanced medium (Gibco). Wells were loaded with equal amounts of cells, in the absence of antibodies, or presence of 5 nM of TS2/16 in scFv or IgG format. Following incubation of cells for 90 min at 37 °C, unbound cells were removed by three washes with DMEM-F12 advanced medium. The number of adherent cells was analyzed by bright-field microscopic images and a luciferase-based ATP assay (CellTiter-Glo Promega).

Colon (P26N) and duodenum (Duo-72) organoids were enzymatically processed to single cells and incubated with integrin component-specific antibodies, each directly conjugated to a different fluorophore. Stained cells were forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) gated to remove debris and to focus the integrin analysis on live cells. Analysis of antibody staining was performed on 104 cells per analysis and compared with the same unstained cells. Stainings were performed by using combinations of the directly fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies listed below:

Ileum N39 (ref. 42) organoids cultured in BME were released from the matrix by incubation with dispase (10 U ml−1) at 37 °C (ref. 5). The organoids were then washed with cold DMEM/F12 medium and centrifuged (5 min, 4 °C, 300 × g) to remove residual dispase. The pelleted organoids were treated with TrypLE (no rho kinase inhibitor) at 37 °C to generate cell clusters. This enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding cold DMEM/F12, followed by centrifugation to pellet the cell clusters. The resulting cell clusters were resuspended in 2 mg ml−1 PureCol EZ Gel or BME and plated as small collagen droplets (10–20 µl). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow for complete collagen polymerization. After polymerization, the collagen droplets were overlaid with complete expansion medium supplemented with either 1 mM Mn2+ or 5 nM scTS2/16. On the first day of the cultures, 10 µM of rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 was supplemented to the culture media as well. After day 1, the ileum organoids were maintained in expansion medium supplemented with either 1 mM Mn2+ or 5 nM scTS2/16, with the medium refreshed every 2–3 days. On day 7, organoid cultures were imaged using bright-field microscopy followed by quantification of viable organoids using CellTiter-Glo.

The FUCCI sequence comprising mCherry-Cdt1-T2A-Geminin-hmAzami-Green was PCR amplified from a construct provided as a gift by G. Kops (Hubrecht Institute). With the use of a Gibson Assembly (NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly), it was cloned into a p2Tol-based vector harboring puromycin resistance (Addgene category catalog number 714859). Reporter organoids were generated by co-electroporation of 5 µg of the FUCCI expression construct together with 5 µg mT2TP transposase mediating the tol2-dependent random integration into the cell's genome. Stable transfectants were isolated based on puromycin resistance and expression of both FUCCI fluorescent signals.

RNA was extracted using a QIAwave RNA Minikit (catalog number 74534) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Real-time PCR was performed on the Biorad CFX96 Real Time PCR System using iQ SYBR Green Supermix 1708880.

For single-guide RNA (sgRNA) plasmid preparation, the following sequence was ordered containing a universal priming part and the sgRNA (underlined): TTGTGTAATACTGATTCCCCGGTGTTTCGTCCTTTCCACAAG. The additional bold cytosine residue is included to obtain sufficient transcription from the U6 promoter. Side-directed mutagenesis in SpCas9-vector 47511 was done using Q5 high-fidelity polymerase with the mentioned primer and the following universal 5′/phos/- GTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAGTTAAAATAAGGC primer. Following PCR cleanup, T4-ligase and Dpn1 were used to relegate and generate the plasmid; this was done according to the manufacturer's protocol (NEB). DNA was transformed into DH5α bacterial cells, and plasmids were verified using Sanger sequencing (Macrogen Europe BV) with sequence primer GGGCAGGAAGAGGGCCTAT.

Organoid electroporation was performed as described previously54 with some modifications. Wild-type organoids were maintained in expansion medium. Two days before electroporation, 1.25% (vol/vol) DMSO was added to the organoid medium. Electroporation was done with 106 cells per electroporation with BTXpress solution containing 2.5 μg ITGA2 gene directed sgRNA plasmid, 5 μg plasmid DNA encoding Piggybac transposase, 5 μg plasmid DNA encoding Piggybac hygromycin cassette55 and 7.5 μg C>T base editor_eGFP plasmid (Addgene plasmid number 112100). Hygromycin 100 μg μl−1 (Invivogen) selection was started 5 days post-transfection. Then, 14 days after selection, surviving hygromycin selection clones were individually picked and RT-PCR obtained DNA, sequenced with the following primers: ITGA2_fwd GCACCTGCCACCTTCTCCATCA; ITGA2_rev GAAAAGAGGAAAGAAGCAGATT. DNA was obtained using a ZYMO Research DNA isolation kit. During clonal outgrowth and selection, scTS2/16 was always present in the media.

Proteins were run on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel (Biorad) under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Marker proteins were obtained from Thermo Scientific (26616, Pager ruler). SDS-PAGE gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Scientific reference 88518). Transfer efficiency was controlled with Ponceau staining. For blocking, 5% non-fat milk protein in PBS was used. For direct HIS-tagged protein staining, a mouse anti-HIS tag HRP conjugated antibody (R and D Systems catalog number MAB050H, RRID: AB_357354) was used. Indirect staining for the HIS-tag was performed using anti-HIS (Abcam catalog number S2917, RRID: AB_10641949) in combination with anti-mouse-HRP (R and D Systems catalog number MAB050H, RRID: AB_357354). FLAG-tagged proteins were directly visualized using HRP-conjugated M2 anti-FLAG (Abcam, RRID: AB_869428) or indirectly by combining M2 anti-flag (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number F3165, RRID: AB_259529) and anti-mouse-HRP (Abcam catalog number ab6808, RRID: AB_955441). Chemiluminescent substrate ECL (GE-Healthcare) was used.

RNA was extracted using a QIAwave RNA Minikit (catalog number 74534) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA integrity was measured using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano kit with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and RNA concentrations were determined using the Qubit RNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA integrity number values of RNA samples were typically 9.5–10.0 and never <9.0. RNA libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded messenger RNA polyA kit and single-end (1 × 50 base pairs) sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000. Reads were mapped to the human GRCh37 genome assembly. Differential gene expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package in RStudio (v.2022.02.2). Data visualization was performed using the packages ggplot2 and pheatmap in RStudio or manually plotted using GraphPad Prism (v.8.2.0). The coefficient of determination (R2) was determined using either the ggplot2 package in RStudio or GraphPad Prism.

Organoids grown in BME (Cultrex) were passaged by releasing them first from the matrix by incubation for 20 min on ice in cell recovery solution (Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 10 μM of the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Abmole)5. Subsequent DMEM/F12-washed organoids were either mechanically sheared or TrypLE-digested to single cells. Following additional washing with DMEM/F12, organoids were resuspended either in fresh BME or, alternatively, in PureCol EZ Gel (Advanced Biomatrix). For complete gelation of the BME or PureCol EZ Gel gel, plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min or 60 min, respectively. Hydrogels were covered with relevant organoid medium and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Passaging of organoids growing in collagen was achieved by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min maximally, with collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma-Aldrich C0130) diluted in DMEM/F12 to a concentration of 1 mg ml−1. For complete removal of the proteolytic enzyme, organoids were washed twice with an excessive volume of DMEM/F12 medium before re-entry into PureCol EZ Gel. The β1-specific inhibitory AIIB2 antibody was added to organoid cultures at 30 nM. The ITGA6-inhibitory antibody G0H3 was added to organoid cultures as 1:1,000 diluted ascites. The Fab versions of SNAKA51, 9EG7 and 12G10 antibodies were provided by J. Li, Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital. Culture images were taken with an EVOS cell imaging microscope.

Transwell inserts (Thincerts, 12-well, pore size 0.4 μm, Greiner Bio-One 665641) were coated overnight with 2% dilutions of BME (ref. 5) or PureCol EZ Gel in DMEM-F12 medium at 4 °C. Hereafter, inserts were washed twice with DMEM-F12 before the cells were added. Inserts were loaded with approximately ±50,000 cells, prepared as a TrypLE-dissociated single-cell suspension. Following digestion, cells were 40-μm-filtered and washed twice in DMEM-F12 medium in the continuous presence of rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Abmole). Cells were resuspended in 250 µl relevant culture medium supplemented with rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (overnight) and optionally long term with 5 nM scTS2/16. Subsequently, 1 ml of identical medium was added to the lower compartment. Passaging of the cultures was started by removing media from both compartments, briefly washing with DMEM-F12 and then filling both compartments with TrypLE.

Patterning medium42 is intestinal medium lacking the p38 inhibitor nicotinamide and PGE2, but has 3 μM CHIR 99021 (Stemgent 04-0004-base) and 5 nM scTS2/16.

Maturation medium42 is patterning medium lacking CHIR 99021 but having recombinant human IL22 (200-22 Peprotech) at a concentration of 2 ng ml−1. Wnt-Surrogate was present at a 30× lower final concentration (±16 pM).

For immunofluoresence staining, to allow differentiation of organoids, the intestinal expansion medium in the bottom compartment was replaced for 14 days by ‘patterning' medium and successively by ‘maturation' medium42. The upper compartment was exposed to air during this period. Hereafter, the medium was removed, tissue 4% PFA-fixed for 20 min, washed twice with excess PBS and permeabilized by incubating in PBS–0.1% Triton X-100–2% BSA for 1 h. Finally, tissue was washed with PBS 2% BSA. For visualization of enterocytes, we stained for the marker ApoA1 by using rabbit antibody PA5-88109 (Thermo Fisher) (RRID: AB_2804657). Goblet cells were visualized by mouse anti-muc2 antibody 11197 (Abcam) (RRID: AB_297837); for enteroendocrine cells, rabbit antibody 23342-1-AP (Proteintech) detecting chromogranin A (RRID: AB_2879259); and for lysozyme secreted by Paneth cells, rabbit antibody GTX72913 (Gene Tex) (RRID: AB_374812). Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:500) used were donkey anti-mouse Alexa488 (1:500) Thermo Fisher A21202 (RRID: AB_141607) and donkey anti-rabbit Alexa 568 Thermo Fisher A10042 (RRID: AB_2534017). Actin was stained using Phalloidin-Atto 647 from Sigma. DNA was stained with DAPI D1306 (Thermo Fisher). All reagents were diluted in PBS–2% BSA.

Ileum N39 (ref. 42) organoids cultured in BME were first released from the matrix protein using dispase (10 U ml−1)38. The organoids were incubated with dispase at 37 °C for 30 min, after which they were washed twice with cold DMEM/F12 and collected by centrifugation (5 min, 4 °C, 300 × g). The washed organoids were then treated with TrypLE (without rho kinase inhibitor) at 37 °C for 5 min to dissociate the organoids into clusters of cells. To stop enzymatic activity, the cell suspension was washed again with cold DMEM/F12 and centrifuged (5 min, 4 °C, 300 g). The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of one of the following conditions: DMEM/F12, complete expansion medium (EM), EM + Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 or EM + Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 + scTS2/16. The cell suspension was herein incubated for 30 min (room temperature), allowing conditioning before embedding in hydrogel. After this incubation, cells were centrifuged (5 min, 4 °C, 300 × g) and cell pellets resuspended in 2 mg ml−1 collagen EZcol hydrogel. The suspension was plated in 10–20-µl domes which were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow polymerization. Hereafter, cultures were covered with EM supplemented with rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and 5 nM scTS2/16. The next day, Y-27632 was removed from the medium, and cultures were maintained in EM with 5 nM scTS2/16 to analyze the effect of diffusion of scFv in collagen hydrogels. After 5 days of culture, the number of outgrown organoids was quantified using CellTiter-Glo viability assay (Promega).

Ileum (N39) organoids were cultured in expansion medium consisting of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 100 U ml−1 P/S, 10 mM HEPES, 1× Glutamax, 2% B-27 with VitA, 3% (v/v) recombinant R-spondin-3, 2% (v/v) recombinant noggin, 1 mM N-acetylcysteine, 0.5 nM Wnt surrogate, 0.1 µg ml−1 hIGF-1 (Peprotech), 0.05 µg ml−1 hFGF2 (Peprotech), 10 nM gastrin, 0.5 µM A83-01, 0.05 µg ml−1 hEGF, 3 µM CHIR 99021 and 10 µM forskolin (Tocris)42. For collagen cultures, ileum organoids grown in BME were first released from the matrix by incubation with dispase (10 U ml−1 for 30 min at 37 °C). Hereafter, organoids were washed twice with cold DMEM/F12 and collected by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Organoids were then treated with TrypLE (no rho kinase inhibitor) at 37 °C for 5 min and further disrupted mechanically to dissociate organoids into small clumps of cells (avoiding complete single-cell dissociation). Organoids were washed again with cold DMEM/F12, centrifuged under the same conditions and resuspended in 2 mg ml−1 PureCol EZ Gel. The matrix–cell suspension was seeded in 10–20-µl droplets onto a culture plate, which was subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to allow polymerization. Hereafter, the droplets were covered with the expansion medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 rho-kinase inhibitor (initial 12 h) and 5 nM scTS2/16. The following day, this medium was refreshed, with the expansion medium lacking rho kinase inhibitor but continuing with 5 nM scTS2/16. This medium was refreshed every 2–3 days. For passaging of organoids, the collagen domes were incubated with 1 mg ml−1 collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C, and digestion monitored using bright-field microscopy (small clumps of cells). Organoids were collected in a 15-ml tube and washed twice (centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g) with an excess volume of cold DMEM/F12. The clumps of cells were washed twice and resuspended in fresh PureCol EZ Gel (2 mg ml−1).

The ileum N39 triple reporter line, with fluorescently marked specific intestinal cell types (goblet cells: Muc2-GFP; enteroendocrine (EEC) cells: CHGA-iRFP; and Paneth cells: DEFA5-dsRED), was described42. It was propagated in 3D hydrogel. At both passage 0 (P0) and passage 2 (P2), the organoids were induced to differentiate. Then, 7 days following passaging, the expansion medium was replaced with differentiation medium in all 3 hydrogel conditions: (1) collagen, (2) collagen + scTS2/16 and (3) BME. The differentiation (patterning) medium was prepared as described previously42. The differentiation process was monitored daily using EVOS fluorescence microscopy to track the emergence of the differently marked mature epithelial types. After 5 days, mature epithelial cells were observed in the collagen- and BME-cultured organoids. At this point, organoids in all hydrogel conditions were fixed to maintain consistency in imaging and downstream analyses. For quantitative assessment of differentiated secretory cells, we used flow cytometry (BD Fortessa). A total of 5,000 DAPI-negative single cells per hydrogel condition were analyzed to compare differentiation efficiencies to the expansion culture. Organoids were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (pH 7.4) and subsequently analyzed using SP8 confocal microscopy.

The human small-intestinal duodenum line Duo-72 was described56.

Jejunum J2 organoids were provided by M. Estes, Baylor College of Medicine. Organoids were described57.

Ileum N39 organoids were described58.

The ileum N39 triple reporter was described42

Primary colon biopsies (Fig. 5e, N = 4) were derived from the Utrecht Portal for Organoid Technology. Patients (University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU)) provided informed consent for the generation of such organoids based on protocol UPORT Cancer Biobank 21-042 and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Dutch law. This study complies with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants.

P26N colon organoids were described47.

Primary liver human ductal organoids (Fig. 5f, N = 3) were derived from UMC biopsy codes 057932, 061530 and 061500. The study was approved by the UMCU ethical committee (TCBio 21-042) and was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Dutch law. This study complies with all relevant ethical regulations regarding research involving human participants.

The ductal pancreas line, code HUB-08-A2-007, was obtained from the biobank of UMCU (Toetsingscommisie Biobanken TCBio (Biobank research Ethic Committee)) approved by protocol 12-093 HUB-Cancer and informed donor consent.

Established human liver and pancreas ductal lines were described earlier59.

All patients participating in this study signed informed consent forms approved by the responsible authority. In all cases, patients can withdraw their consent at any time, leading to the prompt disposal of their tissue and any derived material. Future distribution of organoids to an academic party will have to be authorized by the Medical Ethics Committee of the UMCU (TCBio).

All effects measured between two groups, in response to agonistic (TS2/16) or antagonistic (AIIB2 or G0H3) antibodies, such as CellTiterGLO units—number of cells—or fold-change differences in gene expression levels in qPCR, were tested for significance using one-tailed t-tests. P values and the number and type of replicates (designated n) are provided in the relevant legends of the main figures, extended data figures and supplementary figures. Significance of results from bulk sequence comparisons (Extended Data Figs. 9 and 10) were analyzed using a Wald test for negative binomial distribution in the expression between scFv and control samples. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple testing. The number of independent identical experiments is designated N in all legends.

Organoid expansion medium for each organoid type included the following components: a ‘+' indicates that the component is present in the medium for the corresponding organoid.

We consulted a series of tissue- and organoid-derived single cell RNA-seq databases to obtain a concise overview, specifically, of integrin β1 and selected integrin α-component expressions. Strong co-expression is inferred for collagen binder ITGA2, laminin binder ITGA3 and ITGA6, and RGD binder ITGAV. Script that we used to compose this table is to be found at; https://github.com/Hubrecht-Clevers/Integrin_B1_TS216.

A, N39 Ileum organoids, stably expressing the live cell cycle progression-reporter FUCCI, were cultured on BME-coated transwell inserts. Red signal identifies G1 cells, the green signal the S-G2- and M phases. Yellow signal arises as a mixed red/green signal, occurring at the transition from G1 to S-phase. B, The AIIB2 ab (30 nM) was added to medium in the bottom compartment, binding β1 integrins at the basal membrane of epithelium. Incubation times are indicated. Cells were then enzymatically processed to single cells and expression of the cell phase-specific fluorescent signals - in DAPI-neg cells – analyzed by flow-cytometry.

Duo-72 Duodenal organoids were cultured in 3D hydrogel in regular expansion medium or supplemented with 10 nM AIIB2 ab for the indicated times. RNA, isolated for each condition, was converted to cDNA and subjected to qPCR using primer sets for enterocyte markers ANPEP, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, or goblet cell marker TFF3. ΔCt (delta Ct) values were calculated for indicated target genes and reference gene GAPDH and beta-actin within the same sample. The fold change values quantify the increase in expression of individual markers in AIIB2-treated cells versus cells in its absence. Their average and STDEV are indicated and based on 4 technical replicates (PCR reactions performed on mRNA of the same organoid sample). P values for one-tailed T.test no Ab vs 96 hrs AIIB2 are 2.7 ×10^-4 for ANPEP, 5.39 ×10^-7 for CYP2c9, 2.8 ×10^-5 for CYP2C19, and 1.92 ×10^-4 for TFF3.

Children born to women living with HIV (WLWH) suffer increased morbidity and, in low-income settings, have two to three times the mortality of infants born to women without HIV. The basis for this increase remains elusive. In low-income settings, breastfeeding is recommended because health benefits outweigh the risk of transmission, especially when maternal antiretroviral therapy is provided. We profile the milk metabolome of 326 women with and without HIV sampled longitudinally for 18 months postpartum using global metabolomics. We identify perturbations in several metabolites, including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, and a recently discovered antiviral ribonucleotide, that are robustly associated with maternal HIV infection. Quantitative tryptophan and kynurenine levels in both milk and plasma reveal that these perturbations reflect systemic depletion of tryptophan and alterations in tryptophan catabolism in WLWH. Finally, we validate these signatures of maternal HIV infection in an independent cohort of healthier WLWH. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that milk tryptophan content and availability decrease among WLWH, which may indicate perturbations in milk tryptophan catabolism. The link between this perturbation and the increased morbidity and mortality of children born to WLWH merits further investigation.

Children born to women living with HIV (WLWH) experience significantly increased morbidity and mortality, even when they themselves are not infected (HIV-exposed, or CHEU). While CHEU in high-income countries are more likely to be hospitalized1,2,3, those in low-income countries have mortality rates two to three times higher than infants born to women without HIV (WWoH)4,5,6,7. Most of this morbidity and mortality is due to infections, particularly pneumonia, diarrhea, and meningitis7,8. Additionally, CHEU faces challenges related to growth and cognitive development7. Although maternal antiretroviral therapy has improved CHEU health outcomes, they still experience significant risks, the basis of which remains unclear.

HIV infection, even with optimal viral suppression by antiretroviral therapy, is associated with chronic inflammation characterized by persistent macrophage activation, elevated levels of interferon-inducible cytokines, and intestinal barrier dysfunction9. This systemic inflammation also affects pregnant WLWH and is reflected in their CHEU infants10,11,12,13,14. Similar to their mothers, CHEU infants display perturbed biomarkers of immune monocyte activation, including elevated interferon-inducible cytokines, which impair immune function and germinal center development throughout infancy15,16,17,18. Such changes are not unique to HIV as maternal immune activation due to maternal influenza and other infections is associated with the development of neurodevelopmental disorders19,20,21,22,23,24 as well as the development of tissue-specific immunity and inflammation25,26,27 in their offspring.

HIV-associated immune dysregulation is largely driven by metabolic alterations, particularly in the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway and accelerated tryptophan catabolism, both of which impair immune function28,29. Tryptophan, an essential amino acid obtained solely from the diet, is primarily catabolized via the kynurenine pathway, with its metabolites playing key roles in immune regulation, neuronal function, and intestinal homeostasis30,31,32. A key marker of IDO activation is the kynurenine-to-tryptophan (KT) ratio33, which is elevated in HIV infection and associated with disease progression, dementia, and mortality34. Although the KT ratio decreases with viral suppression, it does not normalize completely35,36. High KT ratios are linked to microbial dysbiosis, TH17 cell loss, and an imbalance between TH17 and Treg cells in the gastrointestinal mucosa29,37. Additionally, elevated KT ratios have been associated with stunting in children38,39, suggesting that disrupted tryptophan metabolism may have broader health impacts.

Breast milk is essential for optimal growth and development, particularly for infants born to WLWH in low- and middle-income countries. The dietary source of tryptophan for nursing infants is human milk. There are very few reports describing levels of tryptophan in milk, it appears that tryptophan, free and bound, are higher in colostrum and then decline with time40,41,42,43,44. Utilizing longitudinal samples from a cohort of WLWH and WWoH prior to the routine use of antiretroviral therapy, we characterize the metabolomic profile of breast milk over the first 18 months postpartum. We identify a metabolomic signature of milk in WLWH that demonstrates decreased levels of tryptophan throughout lactation. This depletion of tryptophan is associated with elevations of the type I interferon response28. Using targeted assays for tryptophan and kynurenine in both milk and plasma, we demonstrate that quantitative levels of tryptophan and kynurenine are systemically altered in WLWH. Furthermore, in later experiments we identify an initially unknown compound, which is highly elevated in the milk of WLWH, as 3'-deoxy-3'4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC), the free base of an interferon-inducible innate antiviral ribonucleotide45. Lastly, we confirm this milk metabolomic signature of HIV in a second, healthier cohort of WLWH on antiretroviral therapy from Haiti (see study overview, Fig. 1).

To investigate the milk metabolome of WLWH, global metabolomics was performed on 1599 whole human milk samples collected as part of a randomized clinical trial46. The Zambia Exclusive Breastfeeding Study (ZEBS) was conducted in Lusaka, Zambia, between 2001 and 2008 and investigated the feeding strategy for WLWH recommended by the World Health Organization at that time. This trial was conducted prior to the routine use of antiretroviral therapy, with most women receiving single-dose nevirapine for prevention of vertical transmission per standard of care. Women/infant pairs were followed for 24 months postpartum. Longitudinal breast milk samples spanning the first 24 months of lactation were selected from 38 WWoH and a stratified sample of 288 WLWH enrolled in the trial. The clinical characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. Thirty-six (12.5%) of WLWH died during the course of the study compared to no WWoH (p < 0.05). WLWH had lower CD4 T cell counts (315 vs. 840 cells/mm3) and higher CD8 T cell counts (759 vs 563 cells/mm3) than WWoH (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Children of WWoH weighed more at birth (3.3 vs 2.9 kg; p < 0.01) and 3 of these children died during the study.

All but 2 of the 1599 whole breast milk samples were successfully characterized and included 765 named and 74 unnamed metabolites for a total of 839 metabolites. Of the 765 named metabolites, 20 metabolites classified as “drug-antibiotic” or “drug-antiviral” were removed from further analyses, leaving a total of 819 metabolites included in the analyses. Samples were excluded from this analysis if there were insufficient samples at that timepoint for meaningful interpretation (n = 72) or if the milk was collected post-weaning (n = 99), leaving 1,426 samples spanning 18 months of lactation in the final analysis (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. 1).

Overall milk metabolomic profiles were strongly influenced by study visit (4.0% variance, p < 0.001), and by HIV infection (0.19% variance, p < 0.001), maternal CD4 count (0.14% variance, p < 0.001), maternal BMI (0.12% variance, p < 0.001), and infant sex (0.07% variance, p = 0.009) (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Linear mixed effects regression identified 103 metabolites with significantly altered levels in WLWH versus WWoH when all study visits were considered in aggregate (Supplementary Data 1). Post hoc comparisons stratified by study visit identified a core set of altered metabolites (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 3; Supplementary Data 2), including tryptophan, dimethylarginine, cytosine, and an uncharacterized compound, X-12127. Levels of tryptophan, dimethylarginine, cytosine, and X-12127 were significantly and consistently altered in the milk of WLWH across the entire study time course (p < 0.001; Fig. 2B, red stars).

Blue and red points metabolites are significantly decreased and increased in WLWH versus WWoH, respectively. b Normalized abundances of selected metabolites across the study course. Solid lines indicate mean abundances, and shaded areas denote 95% confidence intervals. Red asterisks along the top denote study visits at which the selected compound was differentially abundant in WLWH versus WWoH. Black asterisks along the bottom denote study visits at which the compound was selected as a predictive feature in the random forests modeling. All metabolites that were significantly differentially abundant at the 1-month timepoint are shown.

As expected, tryptophan, cytosine and X-12127 were strongly correlated with baseline maternal CD4 count, baseline maternal plasma viral load, and contemporaneous breast milk viral load (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 3). N-acetylalanine (p = 0.006) and N-acetylserine (p = 0.007) were elevated in WLWH with greater separation at the earlier timepoints, 1 and 4 months. In contrast, the linoleic acid metabolites 9,10-DiHOME and 12,13-DiHOME were significantly elevated in WLWH at 1 month (p < 0.05), but not over the entire study time course. X-07765, an unknown metabolite significantly elevated at the one-month timepoint in the linear regression model (p = 0.003), did not appear to be as robust a marker as the other metabolites and was not significant over the entire time course (p = NS; Fig. 2B). Other features, including many lipid and amino acid metabolites, were found to be altered later in lactation (Supplementary Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 4) and may reflect the far-reaching impact of HIV infection on milk composition. In an orthogonal analysis, random forests models for maternal HIV status also identified many of these same features as significant predictors of maternal HIV (Fig. 2B black stars, Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Data 5). Finally, sub-analyses of WLWH whose children remained uninfected during the course of the study (38 WWoH versus 154 WLWH with CHEU) and those whose children survived through the entire study course (35 WWoH versus 143 WLWH) confirmed the metabolic signature of maternal HIV infection to be independent of child outcome (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Data 6–9). Taken together, these results point to a robust and sustained effect of HIV infection on the composition of metabolically relevant compounds in human milk.

The striking separation in normalized abundances of tryptophan and X-12127 across the study course (Fig. 2B) led to further investigations of these two metabolites. Of note, although tryptophan abundance declined slightly between the 1-week and 1-month milk samples in WWoH, there was a notable dip in tryptophan abundance in the WLWH, followed by some recovery and continued significant separation of tryptophan throughout the study course. The normalized abundance of X-12127 rose sharply between 1 week and 1 month and remained elevated, a pattern that was mirrored by cytosine. It was also noted that dimethylarginine, N-acetylalanine, and N-acetylserine all had similarly shaped normalized abundance curves.

The significant depletion of tryptophan across the study duration was mirrored by an increase in levels of X-12100 (tentatively identified as a hydroxylated tryptophan compound) as well as a consistent, albeit smaller, increase in levels of kynurenine (Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Data 1-2). Although none of the comparisons in the analysis stratified by visit demonstrated significant differences after adjustment for multiple comparisons (Supplementary Data 2), kynurenine was increased in the mean effects model (p = 0.007, Supplementary Data 1). Moreover, the kynurenine to tryptophan (KT) ratio, a marker of IDO activity, was significantly elevated at all study visits (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 2; p < 0.001).

To confirm the findings of the elevated KT ratio from the global metabolomics panel, a quantitative KT panel was performed on 98 milk samples from 21 WWoH and 77 WLWH at the 4-month timepoint (Supplementary Table 3). The 4-month timepoint was selected because paired milk and plasma samples were available from almost all participants at this timepoint due to the trial design. Quantitative and global KT values were highly correlated (Fig. 3B, rho = 0.9132 and 0.8792 for tryptophan and kynurenine, respectively; both p < 2.2e−16), indicating that the global panel could be used for accurate estimation of the quantitative KT-ratio. Milk tryptophan levels were significantly lower, 0.367 ug/mL versus 0.572 ug/mL (p < 0.001), and kynurenine levels were significantly higher, 0.177 ug/mL versus 0.125 ug/mL (p = 0.028) in WLWH versus WWoH (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table 4). Correspondingly, the KT log-ratio was significantly higher in WLWH as well (p < 0.001, Fig. 3C and Supplementary Table 4).

The lower levels of tryptophan in the milk of WLWH could reflect lower plasma levels of tryptophan in WLWH, decreased transfer of tryptophan to the milk of WLWH, or altered tryptophan metabolism in the milk of WLWH. Given that tryptophan transport across the gut can be perturbed by infection47, we sought to determine whether transport across the breast epithelium was similarly affected. To distinguish between these possibilities, quantitative plasma and milk tryptophan and kynurenine levels were compared from 118 women (31 WWoH and 87 WLWH, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 3). As expected, milk and plasma levels were highly correlated (rho = 0.50, p < 0.001 for kynurenine; rho = 0.66, p < 0.001 for tryptophan). Plasma tryptophan levels were significantly lower, 5.03 ug/mL versus 8.13 ug/mL (p < 0.001), and kynurenine levels were significantly higher, 0.468 ug/mL versus 0.369 ug/mL (p < 0.001) in WLWH versus WWoH (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Data 10).

To further investigate the transfer of tryptophan or kynurenine to milk, we compared the quantitative levels in 92 women (21 WWoH and 71 WLWH, Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 3) who had both plasma and breast milk samples collected at the 4-month timepoint (Supplementary Fig. 10A). Milk levels of tryptophan were 6.8% and 8.3% of the plasma levels for WWoH and WLWH, respectively; this proportion did not differ significantly by maternal HIV infection (p = 0.14, Supplementary Fig. 10B and Supplementary Table 4). A similar trend was observed for kynurenine with breast milk levels at 32.4% and 36.6% of the corresponding plasma levels for WWoH and WLWH, respectively (p = 0.42, Supplementary Fig. 10B and Supplementary Table 4). Altogether, these results suggest that the decreased levels of tryptophan and increased levels of kynurenine observed in the milk of WLWH reflect plasma levels as opposed to selective transfer to the milk or altered local metabolism.

Levels of an unknown compound, initially labeled X-12127, were significantly elevated in WLWH compared to WWoH at all study visits except immediately postpartum (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Data 2). Given the robustness of this marker, we sought to better characterize this compound by mass spectrometry. The compound, with an m/z value of 226.0824 in positive ionization mode, was analyzed using tandem MS/MS, revealing a cytosine fragment and two water loss events, suggesting the presence of two OH groups and a composition similar to 2'-deoxycytidine (dC) minus two hydrogen atoms (Fig. 4). Structural similarity exploration and predicted fragmentation indicated 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine (ddhC) as a likely candidate. This was confirmed through standard acquisition and extensive comparison of fragmentation patterns at different collision energies, leading to the definitive identification of the compound as ddhC (Fig. 4E).

To assess the generalizability of these findings, global metabolomics profiling was performed on the milk from a previously described cohort of 22 WLWH and 25 WWoH from Haiti (Table 1)48. Notably, these women were on antiretroviral therapy with a mean CD4 count of 541 cells/mm3, and milk was sampled at a single visit during the first 6 months of lactation (median 45 days; Fig. 1E). Regression estimates of the associations between HIV status and metabolites were obtained while including infant age in days as a covariate given the non-uniformity of sampling. Nevertheless, estimates from the Haiti cohort were strongly correlated to those from the main cohort at the 1 month and 4 month visits (r = 0.126 and 0.386, p < 0.001 for all metabolites, respectively; r = 0.812 and 0.789, p < 0.001 when only the metabolites observed to be significantly associated with HIV status in the ZEBS cohort were included; Supplementary Fig. 11A). Three metabolites were significantly increased in the milk of WLWH, cytosine (p < 0.001), methionine sulfone (p = 0.090) and a different unknown metabolite, X-12193 (p = 0.054) (Supplementary Fig. 11B and Supplementary Data 11). Tryptophan trended lower and kynurenine trended higher in the milk of WLWH in the Haiti cohort as observed in the main cohort, although neither reached statistical significance. Notably, the KT log-ratio was significantly higher in the milk of WLWH (unadjusted p = 0.05).

Approximately 1.3 million children are born to WLWH annually, and despite maternal antiretroviral therapy, these children continue to experience differences in immune function, growth, and cognition. In this study, we find that the milk of WLWH is characterized by decreased levels of tryptophan and perturbations of tryptophan catabolism via the kynurenine pathway. These interferon-inducible metabolic alterations may serve as a common denominator to explain some of the increased morbidity and mortality experienced by CHEU.

Normal immune function depends on the regulation of key components of innate and adaptive immunity in lymphoid tissues. Interplay between antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, is critical to host defense by maintaining mucosal barriers and attenuating inflammation. Immune dysregulation mediated by cellular immunity is associated with alterations in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and tryptophan catabolism in individuals with HIV29. Chronic viral infections are also known to alter tryptophan catabolism31. Recent studies of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) demonstrate that individuals with long COVID have decreased circulating serotonin levels secondary to viral RNA-induced type I interferons, reducing tryptophan uptake through the gut epithelium47. Additionally, a tryptophan-deficient diet is sufficient to lead to circulating tryptophan and serotonin deficiency in a mouse model47. Tryptophan starvation appears to be part of the innate immune response to bacterial and parasitic infections49. Tryptophan catabolism, much of which is carried out by intestinal microbes, serves an essential role in physiological homeostasis and immune regulation and can rapidly be adapted in the stress response32. HIV infection may stimulate IDO-1 activity through virally associated increases in type I and II interferons and microbial products. Multiple tryptophan metabolites are endogenous ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which serves as an environmental sensor that integrates immune responses50. Thus, deficiency or perturbation of tryptophan catabolites can lead to alterations of the gut microbiota and immunity by alterations in the IDO1-AHR axis51. Importantly, T helper cell subsets, including TH17 and regulatory T cells, express AHR, so alterations in these pathways may alter immune homeostasis and immune development in children of women living with HIV50. In the context of growth, tryptophan serves as a limiting amino acid for protein metabolism. Additionally, alterations in tryptophan catabolism have been associated with stunting38,39. Cognitive effects of tryptophan depletion are thought to be due in part to decreased availability of serotonin, as serotonin is critical for neuronal differentiation, migration, and synapse formation during embryonic development51. Altered tryptophan catabolism may also explain some of the neurocognitive deficits in children of WLWH by leading to increases in neurotoxic metabolites, such as quinolinic acid, and decreases in neuroprotective metabolites, such as kynurenic acid30. Kynurenine and quinolinic acid are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with HIV and correlate with the severity of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder31,52.

Type I interferons also lead to the production of 3'-deoxy-3',4'-didehydro-cytidine triphosphate (ddhCTP), an innate antiviral compound produced by the interferon-inducible protein viperin (virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-inducible)45. ddhC, which is highly elevated in the milk of WLWH, is the free base of this naturally occurring antiviral ribonucleotide and is also being investigated as a biomarker for acute viral infection53,54. ddhCTP has direct antiviral properties and acts as a chain terminator for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases from multiple members of the Flavivirus genus45, Zika Virus, and likely SARS-CoV-254,55,56. Furthermore, HIV-1 infection of macrophages induces viperin-mediated inhibition of viral replication57. Viperin is a multifunctional protein and product of an ancient gene that is part of the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes56. The metabolic pathways, products, and serum cytokine associations of viperin are being elucidated54. Viperin is co-transcribed with cytidylate monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2) during interferon stimulation. It has been proposed that CMPK2 primarily functions to produce enough substrate for the viperin-mediated production of ddhCTP, which catalyzes the conversion of cytidine triphosphate to ddhCTP.

Cytosine was also persistently elevated in the milk of WLWH. Viral infection has been associated with alterations in host cytosine metabolism58 and the production of ddhCTP59. While ddhCTP is a viral chain terminator, host RNA and DNA polymerases are not affected by ddhCTP45. We found cytosine elevations in both our primary cohort and our validation cohort. We hypothesize that the elevated levels of cytosine in the milk of WLWH reflect the breakdown of ddhCTP. The elevation of dimethylarginine alone and with the N-acetylated amino acids (N-acetylalanine and N-acetylserine) in our cohort is consistent with oxidative stress and increased protein catabolism. Our study does not discriminate between symmetric versus asymmetric dimethylarginine. There is emerging data on symmetric arginine methyltransferases potentially playing an important role in immune cell development and homeostasis60. Alterations in T cell development may underpin the immunologic abnormalities seen in children of WLWH.

These findings raise the question of whether replacement of tryptophan in the diet of children of WLWH, if low tryptophan is found in investigations of CHEU, will lead to resolution of the immune, cognitive, and growth perturbations experienced by this population. It is not known if the low milk tryptophan levels are sufficient, how well the tryptophan is absorbed, or the proportion of bound tryptophan in the milk. Systemic inflammation has been described in CHEU infants, which may alter tryptophan catabolism, leading to increases in neurotoxic metabolites. These possibilities deserve careful study. Breastfeeding remains the recommended form of infant feeding because health benefits outweigh the risk of HIV transmission. With effective maternal antiretroviral therapy, HIV transmission risk has decreased to the point where shared decision-making about breastfeeding entered US guidelines in 2023. The decreased levels of milk tryptophan in the setting of chronic HIV infection are likely due to downregulation of tryptophan transporters in the maternal gut, resulting in lower tryptophan plasma levels47. Whether the pro-inflammatory milieu of milk similarly affects infant tryptophan absorption is unknown. Prudence is also demanded as inflammatory imprinting from the milk of WLWH might drive tryptophan catabolism down the IDO pathway and lead to subsequent buildup of neurotoxic tryptophan metabolites in the developing infant. That CHEU infants display perturbed biomarkers of monocyte activation, including elevations in interferon-inducible cytokines, is supportive of this possibility15,16,17,18. Careful study of tryptophan replacement in the setting of chronic viral inflammation in animal models will be necessary to ensure that replacement will result in beneficial effects. If replacement alone is insufficient, then replacement with agents to modulate the kynurenine pathway, such as IDO-inhibitors, which are in development, may be necessary31.

The primary strength of this investigation is the longitudinal profiling of almost 1600 milk samples from a deeply characterized cohort from a randomized clinical trial. The dense and consistent sampling over the first 18 months postpartum allows us to identify both temporally specific and persistent effects of maternal HIV infection. Much of the present study focuses on the first 4 months postpartum, which represents a critical window for infant development as well as the primary period of exclusive breastfeeding, and we also observed robust longitudinal perturbations in the milk metabolome. That this large study utilizes samples taken in the pre-antiretroviral therapy era is both a blessing and limitation. It is often difficult to deconvolute the profound metabolic signatures of different antiretroviral agents and HIV infection itself, which makes analysis of pure disease signatures more complex in the setting of antiretroviral therapy. However, the strength and robustness of the signatures for HIV infection observed in the present study are likely to some extent due to the severity of disease progression in the absence of effective antiretroviral therapy; maternal CD4 counts, viral loads, and tragically, mortality are all abundant evidence to this point. Growing evidence suggests that antiretroviral therapy reduces but does not fully ameliorate the chronic inflammation associated with HIV infection. Neither, unfortunately, does maternal antiretroviral therapy fully normalize the adverse health outcomes of CHEU. Consistent with these points, the metabolomic signature in the milk of WLWH is partially observed in the validation cohort of women on antiretroviral therapy with higher CD4 counts. Finally, the present study only includes samples from WLWH and WWoH with no measurements in the infants. Consequently, the effect on the infants has to be inferred as it was not directly measured. Replication of these findings in a large cohort of WLWH and their infants in contemporary settings with universal maternal antiretroviral therapy is necessary to confirm the hypothesized mechanisms on the health outcomes of CHEU.

We identified a robust and persistent metabolomic signature in the milk of WLWH comprising the kynurenine/tryptophan axis as well as dimethylarginine, cytosine, and ddhC, the free base of a recently discovered antiviral molecule, ddhCTP, that spans the first 18 months of lactation. This signature is consistent with a model in which chronic viral inflammation associated with maternal HIV infection leads to induction of the type I interferon response. Virally induced elevation of type I interferons decreases transport of tryptophan across the gastrointestinal wall, thereby leading to systemic depletion of tryptophan and subsequent reduction of tryptophan levels in the milk of WLWH. Since human milk is the only source of nutrition for exclusively breastfed infants, maternal tryptophan deficiency and chronic immune activation during gestation and lactation may drive subsequent serotonin deficiency and altered tryptophan catabolism in children of women living with HIV. If alterations in tryptophan and tryptophan catabolism are directly confirmed in infants, this may provide opportunities for targeted interventions to ameliorate the substantial global burden of immunologic, neurocognitive, and growth abnormalities observed in CHEU infants.

The Zambia Exclusive Breastfeeding Study (ZEBS)46 conducted in Lusaka, Zambia between 2001 and 2008 (clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT00310726) investigated a feeding strategy for WLWH recommended by the World Health Organization at that time. The strategy, intended to decrease infant infection with HIV during an era prior to the widespread availability of antiretroviral medications, was to rapidly wean infants from breastfeeding after 4 months of lactation. In ZEBS, WLWH were randomized to either breastfeed until usual breastfeeding cessation or to rapidly wean at 4 months. Almost all women received only a single dose of nevirapine for the prevention of vertical transmission, as was the standard of care at the time. Mother/infant pairs were followed for 24 months postpartum. From this parent trial, a sub-study of WLWH and WWoH was selected based on sample availability as described below. The clinical characteristics of the women included in this sub-study are given in Table 1.

Whole breast milk and plasma samples were stored at −80C as previously published61.

Breast milk sample selection for the global metabolomics panel.

Longitudinal breast milk samples spanning the first 24 months of lactation from women living without (N = 38) and with HIV (N = 288) were selected on the basis of sample availability. Samples were selected from all 38 women living without HIV (WWoH) included in the trial, 35 of their infants survived (279 samples), and 3 infants died (9 samples). A stratified sample of WLWH was selected for inclusion by known infant outcomes for this metabolomics study. Specifically, the samples selected for study inclusion were as follows:

All WWoH (N = 38; 288 samples)

A random sample of 76 (out of 622) WLWH with infants who did not experience HIV infection and who survived (N = 76; 396 samples)

All WLWH whose infants did not experience HIV infection but died in the first 24 months of life (N = 78; 193 samples)

All WLWH whose infants tested positive for HIV between 1 week and 1 month of life (N = 53; 221 samples) or after 1 month of life (N = 81; 401 samples).

To account for the parent trial study intervention, only milk samples from women who reported they were actively still breastfeeding were included in the final analysis.

Breast milk (n = 101) and plasma samples (n = 125) were run for quantitative KT analysis. A random subset of 21 women without HIV and 80 women living with HIV, 20 each from the groups above, with paired maternal plasma and milk samples at the 4-month timepoint, were selected for the comparison. The 4-month timepoint was selected because this was the first plasma collection during lactation.

Milk samples from WWoH (n = 25) and WLWH (n = 22) from a previously described cross-sectional study were used as an independent validation cohort48. In contrast to the main study cohort, these women were primarily on antiretroviral therapy and had relatively minor disease progression, most with CD4 counts above 350.

Global metabolomics was performed on 1599 whole human milk samples collected longitudinally using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry by Metabolon Inc. according to published methods62,63,64.

Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR® system from Hamilton Company. Several recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes. To remove protein, dissociate small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into multiple fractions: two for analysis by two separate reverse phase (RP)/UPLC-MS/MS methods with positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI), one for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, one for analysis by HILIC/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, while the remaining fractions were reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap® (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. The sample extracts were stored overnight under nitrogen before preparation for analysis. QA/QC: Several types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: a pooled client matrix (CMTRX) sample generated by taking a small volume of each experimental sample served as a technical replicate throughout the data set; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a cocktail of QC standards that were carefully chosen not to interfere with the measurement of endogenous compounds were spiked into every analyzed sample, allowed instrument performance monitoring and aided chromatographic alignment. Four technical replicates (n = 4) of either client matrix (CMTRX) or QC samples are run for every 36 study samples in the global metabolomics panel. For the ZEBS Cohort 1599, human milk samples (n = 1) were analyzed with an additional 180 QC samples.

All methods utilized a Waters ACQUITY ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and a Thermo Scientific Q-Exactive high resolution/accurate mass spectrometer interfaced with a heated electrospray ionization (HESI-II) source and Orbitrap mass analyzer operated at 35,000 mass resolution63. The dried sample extracts were then reconstituted in solvents compatible to each of the four methods. Each reconstitution solvent contained a series of standards at fixed concentrations to ensure injection and chromatographic consistency. One aliquot was analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions, chromatographically optimized for more hydrophilic compounds (PosEarly). In this method, the extract was gradient eluted from a C18 column (Waters UPLC BEH C18-2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm) using water and methanol, containing 0.05% perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPA) and 0.1% formic acid (FA). Another aliquot was also analyzed using acidic positive ion conditions; however, it was chromatographically optimized for more hydrophobic compounds (PosLate). In this method, the extract was gradient eluted from the same aforementioned C18 column using methanol, acetonitrile, water, 0.05% PFPA, and 0.01% FA, and was operated at an overall higher organic content. Another aliquot was analyzed using basic negative ion optimized conditions using a separate dedicated C18 column (Neg). The basic extracts were gradient eluted from the column using methanol and water, however, with 6.5 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate at pH 8. The fourth aliquot was analyzed via negative ionization following elution from a HILIC column (Waters UPLC BEH Amide 2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 µm) using a gradient consisting of water and acetonitrile with 10 mM Ammonium Formate, pH 10.8 (HILIC). The MS analysis alternated between MS and data-dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion. The scan range varied slightly between methods but covered 70–1000 m/z. Raw data were uploaded to a publicly available database; see data availability below. Data Analysis: Compounds were identified by comparison to library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities based on authenticated standards that contain the retention time/index (RI), mass to charge ratio (m/z), and fragmentation data. Biochemical identifications are based on three criteria: retention index within a narrow RI window of the proposed identification, accurate mass match to the library +/− 10 ppm, and the MS/MS forward and reverse scores between the experimental data and authentic standards. Metabolite Quantification and Data Normalization: Peaks were quantified using area-under-the-curve. A data normalization step was performed to correct variation resulting from instrument inter-day tuning differences. Essentially, each compound was corrected in run-day blocks by registering the medians to equal one (1.00) and normalizing each data point proportionately.

Frozen human milk samples from the Haiti Cohort were processed by Metabolon, Inc. using the CMTRX made from the ZEBS Cohort in order for the data to be merged. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the internal standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers. Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites present in 100% of the Client Matrix samples, which are technical replicates of pooled client samples. For the Haiti Cohort 47 human milk samples (n = 1) were analyzed with an additional 8 QC samples.

The independent identification of ddhC was conducted at the Northwest Metabolomics Research Center, University of Washington. Breast milk samples were processed using a protein precipitation method. Briefly, 250 µL methanol was added to 50 µL breast milk, vortexed, stored at −20 °C for 20 min, centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 150 µL of the supernatant was collected. Samples were dried in a Vacufuge at 30 °C and reconstituted in 500 µL of LC-matching solvent before LC-MS analysis.

MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 6546 LC/Q-TOF MS using HILIC chromatography. Accurate mass analysis identified the molecular formula of X-12127 as C9H11N3O4, based on the [M + H]+ ion. Tandem MS/MS with a collision energy ramp of 5–40 V revealed its fragmentation patterns. While no database matches were found, the presence of a cytosine fragment suggested the metabolite might be ddhC. This identification was confirmed by matching the experimental MS/MS spectrum and retention time of [M + H]+ with a ddhC standard, and the identification was finalized using a parallel analysis of a ddhC reference standard with the study samples.

Plasma and whole breast milk samples were analyzed for Tryptophan and Kynurenine by LC-MS/MS (Metabolon Method TAM220: “LC-MS/MS Method for The Determination of 15 Metabolites in Human Plasma (GFR-Panel)”. The method was adapted to analyze whole breast milk samples. Briefly, the plasma and whole milk samples were extracted with an organic solvent containing isotopically labeled internal standards (Tryptophan-d5, CIL Catalog# DLM-1092-0 and Kynurenine-d6, CIL Catalog# DLM-7842-0), injected on the Agilent 1290/SCIEX QTrap 5500 LC MS/MS system with a BEH Amide UHPLC column operating in positive mode using electrospray ionization, and the peak area of each analyte product ions measured against the peak area of the product ions of the corresponding internal standards. Quantitation was performed using a weighted linear least squares regression analysis generated from fortified calibration standards with ranges of 0.0250-10.0ug/mL for L-Kynurenine and 0.200-80.0ug/mL for L-Tryptophan that were generated immediately prior to the run (Tryptophan, Sigma Catalog# 93659 and Kynurenine, Sigma Catalog# 61250). For the quantitative/targeted KT panels, 6 QC samples are run per batch. These are spiked samples with varying concentrations of analyte stocks for Tryptophan and Kynurenine. Two are low concentration, two are medium concentration, and two are high concentration. There were 101 milk samples and 125 plasma samples analyzed, with an additional 24 QC samples for this study.

Principal coordinates analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) were performed using Euclidean distances calculated on normalized metabolite abundances. Linear mixed effects models of the form metabolite ~ HIVExposure*Visit + (1 | PID), where HIVExposure is an indicator variable for WLWH versus WWoH, Visit is a categorical variable for the study visit, and PID is the unique participant identifier, were used to identify differentially abundant metabolites as well as differences in KT log-ratio. Estimated marginal means were used to conduct the post hoc comparisons, either averaged or stratified by study visit. Results are reported as t-ratios, which are the estimates of the regression coefficients divided by their standard error. For the quantitative KT panel data, comparisons were performed using a Kruskal-Wallis (for more than two categories) or Welch's t (for two categories) test. Spearman's rank correlation was used to compare global and quantitative KT data and to compare metabolite abundances with maternal CD4 counts and viral loads.

Random forest classification models were constructed separately for each study visit with HIV exposure as the outcome. A two-step approach was utilized to select both the optimal number of features as well as the specific features used for each model. In the first step, one hundred forests each comprising 10,000 trees were built to obtain feature importance values calculated as mean decrease in accuracy. In the second step, tenfold cross-validation with a sequentially reduced number of features was then used to identify the optimal number of features to be used. Finally, a sparse model was constructed for each study visit containing the optimal number of metabolites calculated in step 2 (up to a maximum of twenty features to aid interpretability), with features selected by the highest importance as calculated in step 1. Model accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Matthew's correlation coefficient were calculated from the out-of-bag error estimate for the final sparse model.

Analysis of the Haiti validation cohort was performed using linear regression models of the form metabolite ~ HIVExposure + InfantAge, as there were no repeated measures. Infant age in days was included as a covariate in this regression model, given the range of ages at which milk samples were collected. Regression estimates from this validation cohort were compared to those from the main cohort at the 1-month and 4-month timepoints, as this best matched the distribution of infant ages between the two cohorts.

All statistical analyses were conducted in the R statistical environment (version 4.1.3). A full list of all R packages used in the analyses is given in Table 2. All p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate method, and a cutoff of p < 0.05 was accepted as significant.

All women provided written informed consent. The original protocol was approved by institutional review boards at Boston University, Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Columbia University, and the University of Zambia Research Ethics Committee. The current study was approved by Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (IRB# CCI-03-110-CR002), University of California, Los Angeles (IRB# 16-000798), and Columbia University (AA6449 and AJ8851).

Mapping microcirculation at the whole-organ scale in 3D is crucial for understanding vascular pathologies and improving diagnostics. Although 3D ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) enables microscopic resolution by localizing intravenously injected microbubbles in small animal models, visualizing entire organs in large animals or humans remains challenging due to limited field of view, low sensitivity, and probe technological complexity. Here, we demonstrate how a multi-lens array method overcomes these limitations. Combined with 3D ULM, it maps and quantifies large vascular volumes (up to 120 × 100 × 82 mm³) at high spatial resolution (125–200 µm) with a volumetric acquisition rate of 312 Hz, using low-cost technology. This approach enables deeper insights into hemodynamics from large vessels to pre-capillary arterioles, by providing vast and rich datasets of whole-organ vascularization. It could also facilitate diagnosis of microcirculation disorders and monitoring of small-vessel disease treatments by addressing key limitations of current imaging modalities.

Microcirculation plays a vital role in sustaining tissue health by regulating blood flow and facilitating the exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste products. In key organs such as the heart, kidneys, and liver, proper microcirculation is essential for their optimal function. Any structural or functional alteration in these networks can lead to severe clinical outcomes, including heart failure, renal failure, and various chronic diseases. By evaluating the integrity of the circulatory system from the largest arteries down to small arterioles, clinicians could identify and treat dysfunctions early, potentially preventing irreversible damage1. Nevertheless, the amount of information to deal with in order to reach such a goal is massive. Building a 100 × 100 × 100 mm3 raw data volume with a 100 µm voxel size at a classical 300 Hz frame rate for hemodynamic estimations leads to a typical acquisition movie of 300 billion of voxels per second.

CT angiography (CTA) is the clinical gold standard to non-invasively visualize blood vessels at the whole-organ scale by injecting ionizing contrast agents, providing detailed anatomical insights into vascular structures in clinic. The recent advancement of photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has further improved CTA by offering enhanced spatial resolution and better tissue contrast2. However, CTA, even with PCCT, has limited capacity to assess flow dynamics due to its static nature and temporal constraints. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), particularly with 4D flow imaging, enables detailed whole-organ or whole-body visualization of flow dynamics by capturing blood flow patterns over time in three dimensions3. This capability makes it highly effective for hemodynamic assessments and functional imaging. However, MRI faces limitations, including a spatial resolution limited to a few tenths of a millimetre, high costs, and limited accessibility, which can hinder its widespread clinical use. On the other hand, ultrasound is being routinely used to assess blood flow and its dynamics in the clinic, but it usually suffers from low resolution and sensitivity. Nevertheless, ultrasound imaging is an active research field, and major technical advances achieved over the past decades open perspectives for developing high-performance imaging modes that could rapidly be translated to clinics, given the relatively low cost and portability of ultrasound technologies4,5,6.

In the past decade, ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) was developed to map microcirculation at the microscopic scale in preclinical organ models7,8. This technique has progressed to the point of demonstrating 2D proof-of-concept in patients to image organs in super-resolution, such as the brain9, heart10, and kidney11. However, 2D imaging has inherent limitations, including its inability to provide a complete view of the organ under study. Improper positioning of the imaging plane can lead to increased risks of diagnostic misinterpretations, highlighting the importance of developing three-dimensional approaches to overcome these constraints12. Recently, three-dimensional (3D) ULM has been applied to map the whole organ microcirculation in small animals13,14,15,16,17,18, providing valuable insights into organ function and enabling a more comprehensive understanding of their physiological processes. However, physiology, anatomy, and size of small animal organs are hardly comparable to human organs and translation of 3D ULM to large animal models has been limited by current technology. State-of-the-art matrix array probes are associated with high complexity, expensive, and cumbersomeness hardware, primarily due to the necessity to connect each individual element of the probe to a receive channel. Thousands of elements and receive channels are thus required to cover the entire volume of a human organ, which limits their current applications.

To alleviate these issues, we have recently introduced the concept of multi-lens arrays both in simulations19 and in in vitro experiments with a simplified prototype20. It consists in using a large aperture probe filled with large elements combined to individual acoustic diverging lens. Large elements provide increased sensitivity while covering a wide probe surface. Diverging lenses are used to restore a low directivity, compensating for the reduced angular aperture typically associated with large elements. This design improves the focusing quality and enhances image resolution. Comprising of a few hundred elements, the probe is compatible with ultrasonic scanners commonly available in clinical settings. When combined to 3D ULM methods, these arrays can assess the blood flows across several spatial scales, down to the micron scale across the whole organ. In this manuscript, we introduce a first large multi-lens array probe and a full post-processing framework to enable the imaging and quantification of microcirculation of living organs in unprecedented large volumes. Applied to map organs in a large animal swine model, we demonstrate ULM imaging over massive volumes (up to 120 × 100 × 82 mm3), including ex-vivo heart, in-vivo kidney and liver with an effective temporal resolution depending on the accumulation time required for ULM reconstruction. It provides vast and rich mdatasets of whole organ vascularization and hemodynamics that could prove invaluable for advancing AI-driven medical and comprehensive medicine.

In this article, we presented the results of a multi-lens matrix array probe with a large aperture of 104 × 82 mm² and a reduced number of elements (252 elements), as illustrated in Fig. 1a. A schematic diagram of a single large element coupled to a compound diverging lens is shown in Fig. 1b, highlighting the principle of this composite material. It consists of a plano-convex lens combined to plano-concave lens which according to Snell's law enables to create a strong diverging lens (part Principles and definitions in the Supplementary Methods section).

The beam path through the blue plano-concave lens is also illustrated. (a–c created using Autodesk Inventor Professional 2025.0.1). d Schematic and 3D maps of maximum transmitted acoustic pressure field, illustrating directivity performances over a volume of 60 × 60 × 60 mm³: d.i the compound lens material coupled to a single large element of an (3λ × 3λ) compared to d.ii a single large element without lens (3λ × 3λ), and d.iii a single small element (λ/2 × λ/2). d.iv Graphs show the angular directivity [degrees] as a function of intensity threshold level, measured at a depth (z) of 35 mm from the maximum pressure field shown in (d). for three configurations: single lens with large element (solid green), large element without lens (blue dashed), and small element (red curve). e Spatial distribution of the intensity field received by the multi-lens probe (e.i) over a large volume (~105 × 100 × 100 mm³) compared to conventional probes, fully populated (e.ii) and sparse matrix arrays (e.iii). (e.iv) Graph showing the intensity threshold level as a function of the covering volume for the three probes: multi-lens array (solid blue curve), fully populated array (red curve), and sparse array (orange dashed curve).

The first red line inside the plano-convex lens represents the beam originating from the transducer. The second red line shows the beam refracting due to the difference in sound velocity between the plano-convex lens (c1 = 2570 m s−1), and the flat lens layer (c2 = 1015 m s−1). The third red line illustrates additional refraction as the beam passes from the plano-concave lens into the biological soft tissue (c3 = 1540 m s−1). The Fig. 1c further illustrates the refraction principles of the two diverging lenses in the compound design, showing how both lenses contribute to beam divergence.

Figure 1d compares the simulated acoustic field emitted by a large element with a compound lens to a large element with no lens and a small element used in a conventional dense matrix. The pressure fields produced by the large element with the compound lens (Fig. 1d. i) and the small element (Fig. 1d. iii) show low directivity and a wider field of view. Large element with and without the compound lens show high energy transmission (Fig. 1d. ii). The large element with the compound lens is the only approach that combines low directivity and high transmitted energy. The angular directivity at −6 dB, measured at a depth of 35 mm in the pressure field, is presented in the Fig. 1d. iv. The angular directivity for the large element with compound lens, the large element and the small element were found to be 33.17°, 10.27°, and 51.13°, respectively.

The sensitivity response of the multi-lens array probe was compared to a dense matrix array and a sparse array with the same number of elements, as shown in Fig. 1e. Sensitivity was defined as normalized intensities received from a transmitter placed in the medium of interest. Qualitative observations in Fig. 1e.i illustrate the sensitivity response of the multi-lens array probe, revealing high sensitivity across a large simulated volume (105 × 100 × 100 mm³). In contrast, the dense matrix array demonstrates a confined sensitivity below the aperture (Fig. 1e. ii), while the sparse array shows low sensitivity, especially in the far field (Fig. 1e. iii). These qualitative observations were quantified and presented in Fig. 1e. iv, which shows that the multi-lens array achieves significantly higher sensitivity for an intensity above −18 dB within the simulated volume and covering up to 1050 cm³. In comparison, the dense matrix and sparse array showed lower sensitivity, covering 443 cm³ and 580 cm³ of the total volume, respectively.

The simulated points spread functions (PSF) of the multi-lens array probe was performed and quantified, revealing a grating lobe level of approximately –25.50 dB, –24.57 dB, and –25.36 dB, and lateral resolution was found to be 1.15 mm, 1.17 mm, and 1.26 mm at –6 dB for imaging depths of 30 mm, 45 mm, and 60 mm, respectively. These results were obtained using synthetic aperture imaging with 252 transmit sources. Additionally, we evaluated image quality under ultrafast imaging conditions using a reduced number of transmit events (16 sources), to reflect the practical configuration used during acquisitions. The corresponding results are presented in the Supplementary Fig.  2.

The tip of a needle was imaged in vitro to study the PSF of the multi-lens array probe, as illustrated in Fig. 2b. Grating lobes with an intensity of -22.40 dB and a lateral resolution of 1.06 mm at −6 dB were quantified for an ultrafast imaging sequence using 16 sources in transmit (Fig. 2c). The measured -6 dB width of the PSF was consistent with the theoretical resolution calculated based on the ultrasonic wavelength, focal distance, and array aperture.

Significant differences between the neighbouring voxels ( ~ 75 µm) within the velocity profile were demonstrated using an unpaired two-sided Student's t-test.

Measurements are technical replicates. g Flow rate measurements as function of the inlet flow rate set by the syringe pump, showing a linear relationship as shown by blue curve fit (y = 1.06x – 7.83; y: measured flow rate and x: inlet flow rate, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.98); Red dots represent the mean values of the data points (n = 10 samples for each measurement) and the horizontal red lines indicate the error bars as ± SD: 73 ± 6, 101 ± 3, 143 ± 5 and 209 ± 5 (from left to right); Measurements are technical replicates.

3D ULM was performed on a large flow phantom containing a tube with injected microbubbles (MBs). The results presented in Fig. 2d, showed the reconstructed MB density volume of the tube, revealing a large imaging volume of 100 × 93 × 30 mm³. Grating lobes were filtered out by the tracking algorithm. Absolute flow velocity was measured in the tube (Fig. 2e), revealing a Poiseuille flow profile (Fig. 2f). A statistical Student's t-test showed significant differences between neighbouring voxels along the velocity profile (P values from left to right are P1 = 0.0004, P2 = 3.23 × 10−11, P3 = 0.0022, P4 = 4.22 × 10−05, P5 = 0.0059, P6 = 8.03 × 10−05), indicating a resolution of 75 µm.

The inner tube diameter was measured using skeletonization: 916 ± 38 µm which was in a good agreement with the manufacturer tube diameter (870 µm). The maximum absolute velocities at the centre of the tube were measured for the four flow rates: 62 ± 5 mm s−1, 86 ± 4 mm s−1, 122 ± 5 mm s−1, and 177 ± 4 mm s−1. Flow rates were quantified: 73 ± 6 mL h−1, 101 ± 3 mL h−1, 143 ± 5 mL h−1, and 209 ± 5 mL h−1, respectively. The measured flow rates were in a good agreement with the imposed flow rates (R2 = 0.98), Fig. 2g.

For more complex spatial and flow patterns, the twisted-tube configuration was imaged. The 3D microbubble (MB) density map (Supplementary Fig. 3c). reveals a detailed reconstruction of the tubes over a large volume, clearly illustrating the separation between the intertwined tube segments (Supplementary Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3f). Flow direction mapping demonstrated both upward and downward flow within the structure (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Quantification of flow velocity revealed a Poiseuille profile, with high spatial resolution (Supplementary Fig. 3g).

The multi-lens array probe provided the 3D visualization of the whole coronary microcirculation network of the isolated swine heart (Fig. 3a) in a large imaging volume of 120 × 100 × 82 mm3 as illustrated by the 3D MB density volume in Fig. 3b.

The red horizontal line indicates the median; boxes denote the 25th and 75th percentiles; Whiskers extend to the extreme non-outlier data points. n samples correspond to the number of MB passing through each voxel (15, 37, 65, 86, 105 and 95 from left to right). other points, outliers.

Coronary network can be visualized in different directions as illustrated by the YZ and XY projections of the 3D density (Fig. 3c). The Fig. 3d shows the maximum intensity projection (XZ view) of the Power Doppler image of the ex vivo porcine heart. The high temporal resolution achieved by the 3D ultrafast ultrasound imaging allowed for the estimation of absolute flow velocities via tracked MBs, as shown in Fig. 3e, with velocity ranges from 10 mm s−1 in small vessels to over 300 mm s−1 in the largest vessels. A Poiseuille flow profile was observed by analysing the velocity profile in a large vessel (Vessel 1 in the magnified view in Fig. 3f). A statistical Student's t-test revealed significant differences of velocity values along the profile between neighbouring voxels (voxel size = 150 µm) containing tracked MB velocities as shown in Fig. 3g. A magnified view of 3D density in Fig. 3h highlights the coronary trees, with the skeletonization in Fig. 3i to estimate vessel radii, revealing a range from approximately 75 µm for the smallest vessels to 600 µm for the largest vessels. Figure 3j shows the flow direction in the coronary network, where red (downward) can be associated with the arterial flow system and blue (upward) the venous flow system. Fitting to a power law, the flow rate radius relationship provides an exponent of 2.3 (R² = 0.82), as shown in Fig. 3k, which is consistent with Murray's law21. The number of tracked MBs within the coronary network is shown as function of their estimated velocity in Fig. 3l, with a maximum velocity of 300 mm s−1. The Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC) analysis was performed to estimate spatial resolution for the 3D ULM coronary mapping, achieving a resolution of approximately 125 µm at the intersection of the FSC and ½ bit curves, as shown in Fig. 3m.

The multi-lens probe was positioned on the right lateral side of the swine, in front of the kidney, and held using an articulated arm. Ultrasound acquisitions were synchronized with the Electrocardiogram (ECG) R-peak wave, during periods of minimal respiratory motion, as illustrated in Fig. 4a. The Fig. 4b shows a B-mode image of the porcine kidney obtained with a portable ultrasound device. 3D ULM of the kidney was performed over a large volume of 60 × 80 × 40 mm³, and the results is presented as 3D MB density maps in Fig. 4c and a YZ projection view in Fig. 4d. The 3D absolute flow velocity shown in Fig. 4e, was evaluated, reaching a maximum velocity of approximately 280 mm s−1 in the large vessels. 3D directional flow velocities reveal the arterial flow system in red and the venous flow system in blue (Fig. 4f. i and Fig. 4f. ii for XZ and YZ projections view, respectively). A maximum intensity projection (YZ view) of the Power Doppler image of the in vivo porcine kidney is shown in Fig. 4g. A skeletonization algorithm was applied on the volume showing in white box in Fig. 4c, to estimate vessel radii, revealing a range of 70 µm to 400 µm as illustrated in Fig. 4h. A spatial resolution of 147 µm was obtained by applying the FSC, as shown in Fig. 4i. Fitting to a power law, the flow-rate radius relationship provides an exponent of 2.13 (R2 = 0.70), which is in good agreement with Murray's law, as shown in Fig. 4j. The number of tracked Mbs within the kidney vasculature is shown as function of their estimated velocity in Fig. 4k. The Fig. 4.l shows a Poiseuille flow profile by analysing the velocity profile in porcine kidney within the vessel (i) illustrated in the Fig. 4e. A statistical Student's t-test revealed significant differences of velocity values along the profile between neighbouring voxels (voxel size = 128 µm) containing tracked MB velocities. Dynamic ULM was performed (Fig. 4m), which highlights higher velocities during systolic phase compared to the diastolic phase. This observation is confirmed quantitatively for the velocity's measurements and resistivity indices RI1 and RI2 within the artery vessels 1 and 2 (V1 and V2), as shown in Fig. 4n.

Figure 5a illustrates the implemented 3D rigid inter-block motion correction pipeline. For each acquisition block at a low respiratory phase, a Power Doppler volume reconstruction was generated. An intensity-based registration between these volumetric Power Doppler blocks was then performed to compute a transformation, which was subsequently applied to the corresponding tracked microbubble points for each block.

As a result, Fig. 5b presents a qualitative comparison of the cortical density map of the kidney before (Fig. 5b. 1) and after (Fig.b.2) motion correction. The Fig. 5c represents a magnified view of the region highlighted by the white box in Fig. 5b to appreciate the effect of the correction. Additionally, a quantitative comparison of vessel density measurements (vessels i and ii) shows an increase in density after motion correction, indicating improved vessel visualization and alignment.

The multi-lens probe was positioned above the swine, placed in front of the liver, and held using an articulated arm. Similarly to the kidney experiment, ultrasound acquisitions were synchronized with the ECG R-peak trigger and during periods of minimal respiratory motion as illustrated in Fig. 6a. Real-time B-mode imaging using a portable ultrasound device allowed 2D visualization of the liver (Fig. 6b). The multi-lens array probe enabled wide-field imaging, enabling high-depth visualization of the liver's vasculature and capturing a substantial imaging volume of 65 × 100 × 82 mm³, as demonstrated by the 3D density maps in Fig. 6c. The Fig. 6d shows the Power Doppler volume corresponding to the in vivo acquisition of the porcine liver. The Fig. 6e illustrates the 3D absolute flow velocity within the liver, reaching a maximum velocity value of 300 mm s−1. The direction of MBs flow through the liver's vasculature is shown in Fig. 6f, with upward flow in red and downward flow in blue. Dynamic velocity measurement was performed for arterial (pulsatile), vein (pulsatile/retrograde) and portal (no pulsatility) vein vessels, representing in V1, V2 and V3 respectively in the Fig. 6g, which highlighted higher velocities during systolic phase compared to the diastolic phase in case of an arterial vessel in Fig. 6g. i. The Fig. 6g. ii, shows the velocity profile within a hepatic vein in the liver, reflecting the characteristic pulsatile flow of the hepatic venous system. The Fig. 6g. iii suggests that the flow velocity is uniform in the portal vein. The Fig. 6h presents a Poiseuille flow profile by analysing the velocity distribution within the vessel (i) in porcine liver flow velocity illustrated in the Fig. 6e. A statistical Student's t-test revealed significant differences of velocity values along the profile between neighbouring voxels (voxel size = 159 µm) containing tracked MB velocities. Fitting the flow-rate-to-radius relationship to a power law yielded an exponent of 2.36 (R² = 0.61), which is consistent with Murray's law (Fig. 6i). Spatial resolution of 200 µm was measured using Fourier Shell Correlation (FSC), as demonstrated in Fig. 6j.

In this study, an ultrasonic multi-lens array approach was developed to map and quantify micro-scale vascular network and flow dynamics. This method overcomes the limitations of conventional ultrasound imaging by enabling high-resolution volumetric imaging of large organs.

This innovative ultrasonic imaging method was initially conceived and validated through numerical simulations, followed by in vitro experiments on large phantoms. It was then applied to an explanted swine heart and in vivo swine kidney and liver, demonstrating whole-organ volumetric imaging capabilities. It enabled a complete visualization of the vascular network with a spatial resolution of a few tenths of micrometre (down to 125 µm) with a very high temporal resolution (312 Hz frame rate), providing anatomical details with high precision. Fine vascular quantification was achieved by measuring the vessel radius at every voxel, ensuring structural mapping across the entire vascular tree. Beyond structural imaging, the method offered advanced flow dynamic assessment across all vascular scales, capturing both macro and microcirculatory hemodynamic. This detailed analysis allowed for the differentiation of arteries and veins based on axial flow direction and enabled the measurement of absolute flow velocity along with its Poiseuille profile, which is a key indicator of laminar flow behaviour. These precise flow measurements pave the way for advanced physiological evaluations, including velocity distribution mapping, flow rate calculation, pulsatility index, and the assessment of Murray's law, a principle that links vessel diameter to optimal flow efficiency. This level of anatomical and functional measurements details beyond those of the conventional imaging techniques, allowing assessment of vascular structures and flow.

The combination of whole-organ volumetric imaging with high-resolution vascular quantification effectively addresses key limitations of existing modalities, such as ultrasound Doppler imaging, CT angiography, and 4D flow MRI. The high spatial resolution achieved with this technique is due to the implementation of 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) and 3D dynamic ULM22,23, going beyond the diffraction limit that traditionally constrains standard ultrasound resolution. The method demonstrated a spatial resolution approximately ten times finer than conventional ultrasound, enabling the visualization of small vascular structures. Additionally, the limited field of view commonly associated with classical matrix arrays was resolved through the use of a low-frequency, and large-aperture matrix array. This innovative approach allowed the reconstruction of large volumetric datasets, both laterally and in depth, enabling the visualization of entire organs without compromising image resolution or frame rate.

The enhanced resolution allows precise quantification at a small scale, significantly improving anatomical visualization compared to standard ultrasound and CT angiography. Beyond structural imaging, the method also offers flow dynamic assessment, overcoming the temporal limitations of CT angiography. Assessing flow dynamics across all vascular scales also surpasses 4D flow MR,I which is often limited to the flow assessment of large vessels. Furthermore, the non-invasive nature and real-time capabilities make it a cost-effective and accessible alternative, reducing the financial and logistical barriers often associated with MRI.

For the explanted swine heart, a retrograde perfusion was set to perfuse the coronary network10,14,24, which was imaged and quantified over the entire heart. The swine model is considered an ideal experimental model to study the coronary artery network because cardiac, vascular anatomies and dimensions are comparable to those of humans. It is often used to study coronary artery diseases because swine models have negligible collateral circulation, so each coronary artery supplies a specific cardiac region, which is ideal to induce myocardial infarction. The method would be particularly suited for preclinical cardiovascular research, particularly in the study of physiological processes, drug development and ex vivo investigations of ischaemia-reperfusion injury25. Note that Modulating temperature to increase motion could provide an interesting experimental model for evaluating the accuracy and robustness of motion correction algorithms. Moreover, being able to map the complex network of a swine heart, envision the capability of mapping the coronary network in humans. Direct applications include the characterization of human grafts for assessing graft quality, addressing the critical challenge of determining the donor heart's viability for transplantation26.

The swine's kidney network was mapped over a large volume (60 × 80 × 40 mm3). The large arterial network visualized through Doppler imaging in Supplementary Fig. 5 demonstrated qualitative similarity to X-ray scan, with comparable arteries clearly identified in both imaging modalities. The entire network, including smaller vessels, were evaluated. Translation to human applications is anticipated in the near future, as no fundamental barriers exist to prevent its realization. Imaging kidney microcirculation in patients is particularly important in chronic kidney disease. In most cases, the peripheral kidney microvascular is damaged, yet there are currently no non-invasive and quantitative diagnostic tools to effectively assess this condition. Swine models of chronic kidney disease could also be a natural continuation of this work27, where quantitative description of flow distribution could be used to detect microvascular impairment.

Liver imaging in ULM is more challenging due to respiratory, cardiac, stomach motions28 and most of the liver is placed behind the ribs, next to the lungs, where strong reflection can occur. Still, we were able to map a large volume of liver (65 × 100 × 82 mm3) and to retrieve and quantify 3D maps. Translation to humans is envisioned with the current technology and could benefit to patients with chronic liver disease. Early detection of chronic liver diseases is particularly important, but current non-invasive diagnostic methods are insensitive to early lesions. 3D ULM has the potential to detect early liver fibrosis as well as early development of hepatic tumour.

Accurately capturing the dynamics and structure of microcirculation across entire organs enables the creation of detailed datasets that cover a broad range of physiological and pathological conditions. It would enable the development of sophisticated algorithms in artificial intelligence and machine learning capable of detecting patterns and anomalies in medical images with remarkable precision, often surpassing human capabilities. Moreover, the concept of digital twins, a virtual replica of a patient's physical characteristics, marks a significant advancement in personalized medicine. These digital models allow for simulations and predictions of disease progression and treatment outcomes. Leveraging extensive datasets, healthcare providers can customize treatments based on individual patient profiles, leading to more effective and efficient care. Thus, by mapping and analysing microcirculation across whole organs, researchers can generate vast and rich datasets that are invaluable for advancing AI-driven medical analysis, digital twins, and comprehensive medicine.

The method relies on the development of a custom matrix array and post-processing algorithms. The matrix array aperture is large compared to conventional ultrasonic matrix arrays, allowing its footprint to cover entire swine organs like the heart and the kidney. The piezoelectric elements are large, three times larger than the wavelength, allowing only 252 piezoelectric elements to cover the entire aperture. As a matter of comparison, to cover the same aperture with half-wavelength-size piezoelectric elements used in conventional arrays, a total of 15042 elements would have been needed, which is simply not achievable with current technologies. Large elements also present the advantage of delivering more energy in the medium of interest and being more sensitive in receiving compared to half-wavelength elements. This is particularly important when comparing to sparse array techniques, often limited by their low signal-to-noise ratio29. Large elements must be combined into a diverging lens, which has the ability to lower the directivity of large elements, which is required to maximize the antenna gain of the array. A diverging lens can be of different geometry: plano-convex, plano-concave or compound, depending on the speed of sound of the lens material. The speed of sound in the lens rules the beam divergence according to Snell's law and the material can be tuned to achieve the desired directivity. For an equal number of elements, the multi-lens array was shown to be more sensitive than the small-aperture probe and sparse array. Sensitivity of small aperture probe suffered on the side of the volume mainly due to the limited angular aperture associated to small aperture. Sensitivity of the sparse array was particularly low in the far field due to the small surface area of the small elements, which limits the amount of energy transmitted and received.

Row-column addressable (RCA) arrays have emerged as a promising alternative to fully populated matrix probes for 3D ultrasound imaging30,31,32, including applications such as ultrafast imaging33,34 and Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM)35. By independently addressing rows and columns, RCA arrays drastically reduce the number of active channels, simplifying hardware architecture. However, the design of RCA arrays imposes certain limitations. Specifically, achieving a large aperture suitable for imaging entire organs is challenging due to the inherently large elevational dimension, which can lead to signal decorrelation and degraded image quality. To address this, recent developments have introduced RCA arrays equipped with acoustic lenses36,37 or mechanically curved configurations24 to enable diverging wave transmission and increase the field of view. While the row-column approach provides higher frequencies and improved spatial resolution with a reduced number of active channels, it is better suited for superficial or medium-depth imaging. In contrast, the proposed multi-lens array was specifically designed to achieve a larger 3D field of view and greater penetration depth, which are essential for imaging deep and voluminous whole abdominal organs such as the liver, kidney, and heart. The two systems are thus complementary, each optimized for distinct anatomical targets and imaging requirements.

While fully populated matrix arrays have demonstrated volumetric ULM in localized brain regions, their field of view and application remain organ-specific38,39. Our custom multi-lens array approach offers scalable, whole-organ imaging across diverse deep tissues, though adaptation for transcranial human use will require dedicated redesign. The 1 MHz central frequency of the multi-lens array could be an important parameter to enable ultrasonic waves to travel through the human skull, by reducing high attenuation and aberration. Thus, it could have the potential to image the whole brain vasculature in large animal models or humans through the skull, offering promising capabilities for the early diagnosis of neurovascular pathologies40,41. The multi-lens array probe was characterized in vitro. The 3D Velocity map was quantified and a laminar flow was characterized by the Poiseuille profile. The profile was used to calculate a spatial resolution using dynamic information9 and a resolution of 75 µm was found, corresponding to a resolution of λ/20, which is in agreement with the literature for ULM methods42,43.

Cost of the system (less than €200k) was considered low in comparison to the investment usually required for fully populated matrix arrays (~€1 M).

Like any other approach, the multi-lens array approach has some limitations. In this study, 252 elements were chosen to fit the research ultrasound device composed of 256 channels. A higher number of elements could have been chosen to achieve an even larger field of view. For the same configurations, an array of 1008 elements driven with multiplexed approaches44,45 could achieve a field of view of 200 mm by 160 mm. The current spatial resolution, estimated at 75 × 75 × 75 µm3 could be not enough to visualize the smallest capillaries (less than 10 µm). It could be improved by developing multi-lens arrays operating at higher frequency (2 to 3 MHz), while maintaining a good penetration in the far field. Thanks to 3D ULM, grating lobes do not appear to be a limitation and did not appear on the density and velocity maps due to the two thresholds applied during the localization process. The first is based on signal amplitudes which allows to suppress high random noise and grating lobes that have lower amplitudes than the main lobe of microbubbles. The second threshold is based on the value of the correlation coefficient calculated between the local maxima neighbourhood and a modelled Gaussian PSF. Since the shape of the grating lobes differs significantly from the shape of the main lobe, the remaining grating lobes were efficiently filtered out. This processing step could be optimized by modelling a more realistic PSF, which takes into account grating lobes instead of a Gaussian PSF, which only fits the main lobe. Machine learning approaches could also be an interesting solution to maximize the number of detected microbubbles46.

Quasi real-time contrast-enhanced Doppler imaging (0.3 vol s−1 at a grid reconstruction resolution of λ ≈ 1.5 mm) with the multi-lens probe was employed as a guidance tool to facilitate precise probe positioning and to confirm effective acoustic coupling throughout the acquisition process. To further improve and accelerate experimental procedures, the development of a faster algorithm for real-time contrast-enhanced Doppler imaging could be investigated. In addition, for real-time B-mode imaging, B-mode-based intra-block motion correction, colour Doppler or elastography modes, grating lobes could remain an issue. To address this, the probe design could be further optimized by reducing the interelement pitch at the cost of the aperture array size. Alternatively, introducing a randomized distribution of element positions within the aperture could break the array symmetry and suppress grating lobes. In addition to hardware-level improvements, several post-processing strategies could be employed to mitigate image artifacts and enhance resolution, including deconvolution techniques47,48, multiply and sum beamforming techniques49,50, spatiotemporal matrix beamforming51, or short-lag spatial coherence of backscattered echoes52 could be used. Finally, advanced machine learning based approaches may offer further enhancement of image quality by learning to suppress noise and artifacts adaptively53. Regarding the microbubble injection protocol employed in this study, it was not optimized for clinical practice. Future work will focus on improving and adapting this protocol for clinical applications.

The size of the array may cause patient discomfort when pressure is applied to ensure acoustic coupling. To alleviate this issue, an acoustically transparent pad could be placed in front of the probe to distribute pressure more evenly and enhance patient comfort54. Thanks to its low central frequency, the multi-lens probe is not too impacted by attenuation and imaging depth could be increased in the presence of the pad. Furthermore, probe design could be adapted and optimized to accommodate specific organ features, such as their size and vascular complexity.

Reduced sensitivity can be observed at the edges of the density volumes (coronary network, Fig. 3b). This effect may come from the central positioning of the transmit sources on the probe, resulting in lower energy delivery to the side regions of the imaged volume. To alleviate this issue, different approaches could be considered, such as increasing intersources pitch or transmitting successively with sources located on the sides of the probe. The in vivo 3D ULM images could be enhanced by applying the SVD beamformer to correct phase aberration through different tissues55. Furthermore, the detection of slowly moving MBs through the small vessels could be improved using adaptive spatiotemporal SVD56, or amplitude-modulated SVD for ultrafast imaging57.

Motion artifacts were minimized through an optimized experimental setup and acquisition strategy designed to reduce physiological motion in the data. An inter-block motion correction algorithm was applied, resulting in improved MB density and alignment of vascular structures. While B-mode–based motion correction is a common alternative in ULM literature10,58, its effectiveness requires a high B-mode image quality, which could not be achieved by the current multi-lens probe. To assess intra-block motion, each block was subdivided into three shorter segments to compute intra-block power Doppler volumes. This analysis, detailed in the Supplemental Materials, demonstrated the presence of residual motion within blocks and the benefit of increased temporal segmentation. Further improvement could be achieved by implementing frame-by-frame intra-block motion correction, enabling more precise compensation for physiological motion such as pulsatility. SVD on short temporal sliding windows and advancing methods such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP)59, could also be used to improve the localization of the slowest bubbles.

While individual glomeruli were not explicitly segmented in this study, their size (~150 µm) falls within the resolution range of our imaging system. Previous studies have demonstrated glomerular detection using Ultrasound Localization Microscopy11,60, but required extensive postprocessing methods. In contrast, our approach prioritizes whole-organ 3D vascular imaging with flow dynamics, enabling global assessment of renal perfusion and microvascular integrity. Future work may incorporate dedicated segmentation strategies to extract glomerular features from these volumetric datasets.

The liver imaging results presented in this study are preliminary and currently show limited vascular detail compared to other organs. This can be attributed to the inherent complexity of hepatic microvasculature, as well as suboptimal acquisition parameters not specifically optimized for liver imaging. While major vessels were captured in 3D with flow information, further improvements, such as optimized microbubble dilution, and longer acquisition durations, will be necessary to fully demonstrate the super-resolution potential of the system in the liver. Future work will focus on addressing these factors to enhance vascular detail and clinical relevance. While CT angiography was used to validate kidney imaging, it was not performed for the liver due to the complexity of contrast timing and breath-hold synchronization in porcine models. As liver angiography is not standard clinical or preclinical practice, the liver results presented here serve as a feasibility demonstration, with future studies planned to include anatomical validation.

In this study, we introduced a large multi-lens array probe combined with a robust post-processing pipeline to assess vascular networks and dynamics at the micro-scale across large volumes. The method was rigorously validated through simulations as well as in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments on the kidney and liver. This approach holds significant potential to become a pivotal tool for preclinical research and clinical applications, particularly when evaluating complex microcirculation networks in 3D over large fields of view. Its potential is further underscored by the simplicity of the underlying technology, making it highly accessible for widespread adoption in research laboratories and hospitals.

The experiments were approved by the animal ethics committee and were carried out according to project authorization [#28654-2020121509545743]. The pigs are housed in group enclosures with solid floors, providing a surface area exceeding the standard requirements (minimum 0.7 m² per animal). The enclosures are equipped with alternating day and night lighting, maintained at a temperature of 18 to 22 °C, with humidity levels ranging from 45% to 65%, and an air exchange rate of 10 volumes per hour. The animals are fed daily with appropriate pellets at a rate of 20 g kg−1 body weight, have continuous access to fresh drinking water, and are provided with sawdust bedding and toys to promote their well-being.

The same multi-lens array probe was used in simulation, for in vitro validation and during ex vivo and in vivo experiments. The total aperture size of the probe was 104 × 82 mm². The probe was composed of three acoustic principal layers. The first layer consists of 252 large transducer matrix piezocomposite elements (14 × 18). The size of an individual element was set to 4.5 × 4.5 mm² representing 3 times the acoustic wavelength (3λ² ≈ 4.5 mm², wavelength; λ ≈ 1.5 mm). The pitch between elements was set to 5.48 mm (corresponding 3.65λ) in both directions, this choice represents a compromise design to avoid large lens overlap while limiting grating lobe artefacts and preserving pressure field uniformity. The transducer layer was aligned with a second layer composed of diverging acoustic lenses (plano-convex lenses), also arranged in 14 × 18 configuration. The two layers were assembled with structural adhesive and an acoustic matching layer. A third flat lens layer (silicon plano-concave lens) was moulded above the diverging lens layer, completing the assembly of a compound diverging lens. The compound diverging lens was made of an epoxy plano-convex lens of a maximum thickness of 3.2 mm, corresponding to a radius of curvature of 3.2 mm, a speed of sound c1 of 2570 m s−1 and an acoustic impedance of 3 MRayl. A silicon plano-concave lens was set on top with a maximum thickness of 0.375 mm and a radius of curvature of 3.2 mm, a speed of sound c2 of 1015 m s−1 and an acoustic impedance of 1.1 MRayl. Other layers as backing and mechanical stiffener were added behind the piezocomposite. Technical schematic details of the custom multi-lens probe are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The central frequency was set to 1 MHz with a 67% bandwidth to minimize attenuation. The array used in the experiments was manufactured by Vermon®, France.

The multi-lens array probe performance was assessed through simulation using k-Wave toolbox61. The transmit pressure field of a two-cycle pulse from an individual element of the array was simulated in a volume of 60 × 60 × 60 mm3 within a grid spacing of λ/10 (λ = 1.54 mm) and a time step of 30 ns. It was compared to the transmit pressure field of a large element of the same size without a lens and a small element (λ/2 × λ/2) used in conventional array probes. The speed of sound and density of the simulated medium were set to 1540 m s−1 and 1000 kg m−3, respectively.

The maximum acoustic pressure during propagation was recorded in the volume of interest and presented in decibels (dB) for the three elements, as shown in Fig. 1d. The amplitude profile of the pressure field was used to quantify directivity as the angle at −6 dB at a 35 mm depth along a circular arc. Comparison results for the three elements are plotted in Fig. 1d.iv.

A synthetic phantom was designed consisting in three scatterers at depths of 30, 45, 60 mm, distributed at the centre of a volume of 70 × 104 × 100 mm3. The multi-lens probe and a synthetic aperture imaging sequence62 were simulated to obtain Radio Frequency (RF) signals of the scatterers. RF signals were beamformed (detailed in the section Beamforming processing) and 3D B-mode volumes were displayed to visualize numerical points spread functions as a function of depth (Supplementary Fig. 2). The simulation was executed in CUDA language, provided by the k-Wave toolbox, and processed on GPU units of NVIDIA®, model RTX A6000 (GPU Memory = 48 giga bytes).

The points spread functions were quantified by applying maximum intensity projection in the lateral direction to assess the grating lobes and the lateral resolution.

Sensitivity simulations in receive were conducted using the Field II toolbox63,64. The multi-lens array probe was compared to two arrays with the same frequency (1 MHz) and number of elements (252) but with small elements size (λ/2 × λ/2). Sensitivity of a dense matrix probe and a large sparse array probe (with the same aperture size as the multi-lens probe) was studied.

Sensitivity can be defined as the array capability to detect weak acoustic signals. In this study, it was defined as the intensity of received signals from a small transducer by the array probes across various spatial locations.

The sensitivity responses of the three probes were evaluated through the following steps: a small transmitter, with a size of λ/2, was modelled within a 105 × 100 × 100 mm³ volume to emit an acoustic wave toward the matrix array probes at different locations on a grid spaced of λ in all spatial directions. The arrays received the ultrasonic waves and simulated RF signals were stored in memory for each point location of the transmitter. The received intensity distribution over the volume was calculated from the RF signals amplitude as:

where \({{{{\rm{RF}}}}}_{i}({{{\rm{x}}}},{{{\rm{y}}}},{{{\rm{z}}}},{{{\rm{t}}}})\) is the Radio-frequency signal as a function of time t, recorded by the element i for the transmitter located at the (x,y,z) coordinates. \({t}_{0}\) and T are the start and end recording time, respectively. n is the number of elements in the array.

Intensity spatial distributions were normalized with the maximum absolute intensity value obtained by the multi-lens array probe and presented in decibels scale (dB), to observe regions of highest and lowest intensity within the field of view.

The sensitivity response of the three probes was compared and assessed and by presenting the intensity threshold level as a function of the number of voxels within the volume of 105 × 100 × 100 mm3 as shown in Fig. 1e. iv.

Several experimental studies were performed using the multi-lens array, including point spread function characterization, resolution and flow rate validations on a large flow phantom, ex vivo assessment of an isolated porcine heart, and in vivo proof of concept on a porcine kidney and liver.

For the in vitro studies, a flow phantom consisting of a polyethylene tube immersed in a water tank was imaged (inlet diameter ~870 µm, depth = 60 mm). A solution of 100 µL of microbubbles (Sonovue® Braco, Italy) mixed with 100 mL of water was continuously injected into the tube using a syringe pump (KDS Legato 130, KD Scientific, Holliston, USA) at a rate of 75 mL h−1 during acquisition. Four different flow rates were studied (75 mL h−1, 100 mL h−1, 150 mL h−1, and 200 mL h−1). Additionally, imaging was performed on a twisted-tube configuration to assess more complex flow patterns. This setup used a polyethylene tube with an inner diameter of 870 µm. The tube was inclined, extending from 42 mm to 80 mm of imaging depth. A microbubble solution diluted at a 1:1000 ratio was injected at a flow rate of 200 mL h-1.

For the ex vivo experiment on the isolated perfused heart, a porcine heart from a 30 ± 1 kg pig was anesthetized, explanted, cannulated at the aorta. Retrograde perfusion was established through the aorta according to the Langendorff method10,14,24, with an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution and a perfusion rate of approximately 0.25 L min−1. The heart was immersed in a box made of a TPX polymer, chosen for its low acoustic attenuation and impedance mismatch. Heart motion was reduced by setting the Krebs solution temperature to 3 C°. A 100% concentration of MBs solution was added to the perfusion flow at 0.25 mL min−1 and injected into the aorta using a syringe pump set to a rate of 15 mL h−1, corresponding to a 1:1000 dilution of the initial MB solution. The multi-lens array was positioned in the apical view orientation (Fig. 3a).

For the in vivo experiments, the studies were performed on three swines (12 weeks old and weighing 30 to 36 kg). The swines were anesthetized with sedation with Zoletil 0.1 mL kg−1 IM, then Comfortan 1 mL IV, then isoflurane 2% anaesthesia with air-oxygen mixture, after tracheal intubation and the use of a Minerve Alpha 100® respirator. A trained physician performed a renal angiography in porcine 1. X-ray dye (iodixanol, Visipaque™ 320, GE Healthcare) was injected through the catheter and GE® (model OEC 9900 Elite) X-ray generator was used to image the kidney artery network. The images of renal angiography of porcine 1 were stored in memory and illustrated in the Supplementary Fig. 5. Real-time B-mode imaging was performed by a trained physician with a linear phased array connected to portable ultrasound scanner (Philips® Lumify, probe S4-1U) to acquire B-mode images for initial anatomical localization and alignment. The images were stored in memory. The multi-lens array probe was positioned in front of the kidney and fixed using an articulated arm. Subsequently, quasi-real-time contrast-enhanced Doppler imaging with the multi-lens probe was employed as a guidance tool to facilitate precise probe positioning and to confirm effective acoustic coupling throughout the acquisition process. An initial bolus of 1 mL of microbubble solution was injected through the intravenous system into the porcine ear. This was followed by additional intermittent bolus injections of 0.5 mL every minute for the rest of the acquisition. The ultrasound acquisitions were triggered between two respiratory phases to minimize motions artefacts. Similarly, real-time B-mode imaging was performed by a trained physician to image the liver network after MBs injection. The multi-lens array probe was positioned in front of the liver, fixed using an articulated arm, and an initial bolus of 1 mL of microbubble solution was injected through the intravenous system into the porcine ear. This was followed by additional intermittent bolus injections of 0.5 mL every minute for the rest of the acquisition. The ultrasound acquisitions were triggered between two respiratory phases to minimize motion artifacts. Physiological parameters during the experiment (Electrocardiogram, respiratory signals) were monitored and acquired with a PowerLab device (ADInstruments®, Dunedin, New Zealand), equipped with spirometers and differential biological potential amplifiers, and managed by LabChart software.

To ensure efficient acoustic coupling and avoid air bubbles between the probe surface and the tissue, specifically, the skin in in vivo experiments and the heart container in ex vivo settings, a custom-degassed gel was employed for both ex vivo and in vivo experiments. The gel consisted of a 1:1 mixture of water and commercial ultrasound gel, which was degassed via centrifugation for 4 min. Following gel application to the probe surface, the probe was carefully angled and gradually applied to the tissue to eliminate air bubbles and ensure optimal acoustic coupling.

The ultrasound acquisition sequences were performed using the multi-lens array probe described in section (Multi-lens array) driven by a programmable ultrasound device with 256 transmit-receive channels (Vantage, Verasonics®, USA). Transmit schemes were programmed to perform 3D ultrafast ultrasound imaging in order to preserve a sufficient temporal resolution. The selected configuration consisted of 16 sequential transmissions, each using a single element of the probe to emit a diverging wave. The spatial arrangement of these 16 sources is positioned in the centre of the probe. For each transmission, the source was located at the physical position of the active element on the transducer surface as illustrated in the Supplementary Fig. 2b. Backscattered echoes were recorded with all elements after each transmission and RF data were stored in memory, digitalized at 100% bandwidth (two samples per wavelength). Diverging wave emissions consisted in short pulses of two cycles centred at a frequency of 1 MHz. Given the imaging depth, the pulse repetition frequency was set to 5000 Hz and associated volume rate was 312.5 Hz. The acquisitions were divided into blocks of 830 ms, corresponding to 256 volumes for the in vitro and ex vivo experiments, and into blocks of 1.2 s for the in vivo kidney and liver experiments. The number of blocks in one acquisition varied depending on the application: 1000 blocks were acquired for the tube phantom, 400 blocks for the ex vivo heart, 290 blocks for the kidney and 133 blocks for the liver porcine. Each block was repeated every 300 ms, allowing the RF data block to be stored on the memory disk. The acquisition durations were as follows: 13 min for the flow phantom imaging shown in Fig. 2, 5 minutes for the isolated porcine heart in Fig. 3, 5 minutes for the in vivo kidney in Fig. 4, and 162 s for the in vivo liver in Fig. 6. The total amount of data per acquisition block varied from 1.1 gigabytes to 2.8 gigabytes.

3D rigid motion correction was performed between blocks using a Power Doppler-based registration workflow14. Specifically, both the 3D Power Doppler volumes and the corresponding microbubble (MB) tracked positions for each block were used as inputs. Intensity information in 3D power Doppler images was used to compute the transformation that maximized the Advanced Normalized Correlation between a selected reference Power Doppler volume (chosen as the one with the highest number of tracked MBs) and each of the other 3D Power Doppler volumes to be aligned.

The registration algorithm was implemented using Elastix 5.0 (https://elastix.lumc.nl/) and performed in full 3D space. A rigid transformation comprising both rotation and translation components was estimated and subsequently applied to the microbubble (MB) tracks to spatially align all datasets across blocks. The transformation matrix was computed using Elastix's rigid parameter configuration, which employs a multi-resolution registration framework based on the MultiResolutionRegistration method and uses a B-spline interpolator (BSplineInterpolator) in combination with the Euler transform model.

For intra-block motion correction presented in the Supplementary Fig. 4, we implemented a 3D registration strategy within each acquisition block. Each block was arbitrary divided into three temporal sub-blocks, for which 3D Power Doppler volumes were computed and rigidly registered using the same framework as inter-block correction. The corrected sub-blocks were then concatenated to form a motion-compensated volume for the full block. This corrected Power Doppler volume, along with the corrected microbubble tracks, was then used as input for the standard inter-block motion correction.

EVERETT, Wash. — In an industrial stretch of Everett is a boxy, windowless building called Ursa. Inside that building is a vault built from concrete blocks up to 5 feet thick with an additional layer of radiation-absorbing plastic. Within that vault is Polaris, a machine that could change the world.

Helion Energy is trying to replicate the physics that fuel the sun and the stars — hence the celestial naming theme — to provide nearly limitless power on earth through fusion reactions.

The company recently invited a small group of journalists to visit its headquarters and see Polaris, which is the seventh iteration of its fusion generator and the prototype for a commercial facility called Orion that broke ground this summer in Malaga in Central Washington.

Few people outside of Helion have been provided such access; photographs were not allowed.

“We run these systems right now at 100 million degrees, about 10 times the temperature of the sun, and compress them to high pressure… the same pressure as the bottom of the Marianas Trench,” said Helion CEO and co-founder David Kirtley, referencing the deepest part of the ocean. 

Polaris and its vault occupy a relative small footprint inside of Ursa. The majority of the space is filled with 2,500 power units. They're configured into 4-foot-by-4-foot pallets, lined up in rows and stacked seven high. The units are packed with capacitors that are charged from the grid to provide super high intensity pulses of electricity — 100 gigawatts of peak power — that create the temperatures and pressure needed for fusion reactions.

All of that energy is carried through miles and miles of coaxial cables filled with copper, aluminum and custom-metal alloys. End-to-end, the cables would stretch across Washington state and back again — roughly 720 miles. They flow in thick, black bundles from the pallets into the vault. They curl on the floor in giant heaps before connecting to the tubular-shaped, 60-foot-long Polaris generator.

The ultimate goal is for the generator to force lightweight ions to fuse, creating a super hot plasma that expands, pushing on a magnetic field that surrounds it. The energy created by that expansion is directly captured and carried back the capacitors to recharge them so the process can be repeated over and over again. 

And the small amount of extra power that's produced by fusion goes into the electrical grid for others to use — or at least that's the plan for the future. 

Helion is a contender in a global race to generate fusion power for a rapidly escalating demand for electricity, driven in part by data centers and AI. No one so far has been able to make and capture enough energy from fusion to commercialize the process, but dozens of companies — including three other competitors in the Pacific Northwest — are trying.  

The company aims by 2028 to begin producing energy at the Malaga site, which Microsoft has agreed to purchase. If it hits this extremely ambitious target — and many are highly skeptical — it could be the world's first company to do so.

“There is a level of risk, of being aggressive with program development, new technology and timelines,” Kirtley said. “But I think it's worth it. Fusion is the same process that happens in the stars. It has the promise of very low cost electricity that's clean and safe and base load and always on. And so it's worth being aggressive.”

Some in the sector worry that Helion will miss the mark and cast doubt on a sector that is working hard to prove itself. At a June event, the head of R&D for fusion competitor Zap Energy questioned Helion's deadline.

“I don't see a commercial application in the next few years happening,” said Ben Levitt. “There is a lot of complicated science and engineering still to be discovered and to be applied.”

Others are willing to take the bet. Helion has raised more than $1 billion from investors that include SoftBank, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sam Altman, who is OpenAI's CEO and co-founder, as well as Helion's longtime chair of its board of directors. The company is able to unlock an additional $1.8 billion if it hits Polaris milestones. 

The generator has been operating since December, running all day, five days a week, creating fusion, Kirtley said. 

Helion is highly cautious — some would say too cautious — in sharing details on its progress. Helion officials say they must hold their tech close to the vest as Chinese competitors have stolen pieces of their intellectual property; critics say the secrecy makes it difficult for the scientific community to verify their likelihood of success in a very risky, highly technical field.

In August, Kirtley shared an online post about Helion's power-producing strategy, which upends the conventional approach. 

Most efforts are trying to achieve ignition in their fusion generators, which is a condition where the reactions produce more power than is required for fusion to occur. This feat was first accomplished at a national lab in California in 2022 — but it still wasn't enough energy that one could put electricity on the grid. 

Helion is not aiming for ignition but rather for a system that is so efficient it can capture enough energy from fusion without reaching that state. 

Kirtley compares the strategy for producing power to regenerative braking in electric vehicles. Simply put, an EV's battery gets the car moving, and regenerative braking by the driver puts energy back into the battery to help it run longer. In the fusion generator, the capacitors provide that initial power, and the fusion reaction resupplies the energy and a little bit more.

“We can recover electricity at high efficiency,” Kirtley said. Compared to other commercial fusion approaches, “we require a lot less fusion. Fusion is the hard part. My goal, ironically, is to do the minimum amount of fusion that we can deliver a product to the customer and generate electricity.”

Seattle is looking to celebrate and accelerate its leadership in artificial intelligence at the very moment the first wave of the AI economy is crashing down on the region's tech workforce.

That contrast was hard to miss Monday evening at the opening reception for Seattle AI Week 2025 at Pier 70. On stage, panels offered a healthy dose of optimism about building the AI future. In the crowd, buzz about Amazon's impending layoffs brought the reality of the moment back to earth.

A region that rose with Microsoft and then Amazon is now dealing with the consequences of Big Tech's AI-era restructuring. Companies that hired by the thousands are now thinning their ranks in the name of efficiency and focus — a dose of corporate realism for the local tech economy.

The double-edged nature of this shift is not lost on Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson.

“AI, and the future of AI, and what that means for our state and the world — each day I do this job, the more that moves up in my mind in terms of the challenges and the opportunities we have,” Ferguson told the AI Week crowd. He touted Washington's concentration of AI jobs, saying his goal is to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its downsides.

Seattle AI Week, led by the Washington Technology Industry Association, was started last year after a Forbes list of the nation's top 50 AI startups included none from Seattle, said the WTIA's Nick Ellingson, opening this year's event. That didn't seem right. Was it a messaging problem?

“A bunch of us got together and said, let's talk about all the cool things happening around AI in Seattle, and let's expand the tent beyond just tech things that are happening,” Ellingson explained.

So maybe that's the best measuring stick: how many startups will this latest shakeout spark, and how can the Seattle region's startup and tech leaders make it happen? Can the region become less dependent on the whims of the Microsoft and Amazon C-suites in the process? 

“Washington has so much opportunity. It's one of the few capitals of AI in the world,” said WTIA's Arry Yu in her opening remarks. “People talk about China, people talk about Silicon Valley — there are a few contenders, but really, it's here in Seattle. … The future is built on data, on powerful technology, but also on community. That's what makes this place different.”

And yet, “AI is a sleepy scene in Seattle, where people work at their companies, but there's very little activity and cross-pollinating outside of this,” said Nathan Lambert, senior research scientist with the Allen Institute for AI, during the opening panel discussion.

No, we don't want to become San Francisco or Silicon Valley, Lambert added. But that doesn't mean the region can't cherry-pick some of the ingredients that put Bay Area tech on top.

Whether laid-off tech workers will start their own companies is a common question after layoffs like this. In the Seattle region at least, that outcome has been more fantasy than reality. 

This is where AI could change things, if not with the fabled one-person unicorn then with a bigger wave of new companies born of this employment downturn. Who knows, maybe one will even land on that elusive Forbes AI 50 list. (Hey, a region can dream!)

But as the new AI reality unfolds in the regional workforce, maybe the best question to ask is whether Seattle's next big thing can come from its own backyard again.

If you've been on TikTok in the past couple of weeks, you've probably noticed people posting about belonging to “Group 7.”

The trend is actually an experiment by indie singer Sophia James, who released a series of videos set to her song “So Unfair” in an effort to manipulate TikTok's algorithm and get more people listening to her music. After trying a few different tactics, following typical TikTok formats, James started placing people into exclusive groups. And it has worked—Group 7, the final video in James' TikTok “science experiment,” has garnered over 76 million views and spawned legions of comments and reaction videos, with even Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai repping her elite status as a member.

James kicked off the videos on October 17, posting a video that followed the same TikTok formula we've seen since the dawn of the platform: herself mouthing and dancing along to a song—her song—and holding a parking ticket. In her second video, she says “it has always been and will always be me versus the algorithm. And today I have decided that I'm winning” while “So Unfair” plays softly in the background.

It's not until the fourth video that she introduces the categories, telling TikTokers: “If you're seeing this you are in Group 4.”

“I am posting a bunch of videos and seeing which ones reach the most viewers,” the text reads as her song blares. “This is the fourth post of the batch, so you are Group 4.“

This declaration didn't do much to shake the algorithm, and neither did her Group 5 and 6 videos. But sometimes the best is left for last. After her Group 7 video went massively viral, James says, “‘So Unfair' has definitely seen an uptick in listeners all across the board, and it's kind of spread through a lot of my other music, too, which is really fantastic.”

Still, even James seems confused that she managed to hack the algorithm. WIRED asked James about why she decided on this experiment and the double-edged sword of using social media as an indie artist.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

WIRED: How did you get started in the industry?

Sophia James: I have been making music ever since I had the ability to. My late mother was a professional singer. And my father is a touring drummer, and so it was kind of, I mean, audibly passed down to me and also, I guess, encoded in my DNA in a way. I kind of won the lottery by being their daughter and just sort of being able to absorb the world of live music and the musician hustle. From the get-go.

I had a quick sort of experience with [a] boutique record label who provided me with a few producers … but [with] my third EP, the label experience didn't end up being very fruitful for me. Somewhere down the line, they lost funding, and I was left in the dark about a lot of it. It made me start to really question the mechanics of the music industry and the whole corporate side of things and the business side of things, and it was a real wake-up call to start putting my head down and learning about the industry and kind of arming myself with knowledge about how the business works. Somewhere along that line, I met producer and platinum hit songwriter Alex Bilowitz. And he reached out to me because he had found a video on social media of me playing one of my original songs.

A lot of artists, whether they're smaller artists or superstars, have this conflicting understanding of what the music industry is right now in the face of social media. Which brings us to the Group 7 of it all. What pushed you to do it?

I mean, the primary reason that I'm on TikTok, and on social media in general, is to promote my music and get it heard and get it out to the people that resonate with it and want to listen to it. I care too much about this batch of music specifically, and I'm too excited about it to not put my best foot forward, just swallow my pride and start playing the social media game and taking it very seriously in order to try and cut through the noise.

And yeah, along with that, I've been putting every effort into chasing whatever trends or trying different methods of hacking this algorithm, this mysterious algorithm, to just try and like, get the word out about my music so that I can continue to make a living off of what I love to do.

I don't really have many other skills. So it wasn't really an option for me. So I'm like, you know, for better or for worse, social media right now is the tool that gives you that chance to do what you love.

I really wanted to also just dive into the types of “Group” videos you made, because they were all different. The first video wasn't even labeled as a Group 1. It was just you saying that you got a parking ticket. The Group 3 video was you opening the ticket, and then the Group 6 video had you sitting completely still in a corner, just letting your song play in the background. Why do you think the Group 7 video popped off in the way that it did?

I have not really had a moment to sit and think about it all. But I mean, I put my song “So Unfair” in the background of each of these videos or at the forefront, and so there was no difference with sound or no sound, or “So Unfair” or no “So Unfair.” It's a puzzle to me. What I've observed is that in the seventh video, I'm talking to the camera. I'm audibly using my voice. I don't know if it's anything to do with the aesthetics, with the sound or whatever. I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that, like, numerically, the seventh video in a batch has a higher chance of hitting the algorithm?

I simply don't know. What I do know is that when I started seeing comments flooding on the Group 7 video, there were a lot of … silly camaraderie-based things and like putting really funny reaction memes in it and stuff.

Like, this is very silly, and I think it was definitely driven by the people commenting on the video. I don't know how, or how the video got to the For You pages of those commenters, but I'm really glad [it] did.

It's over 50 million views right now. This is a worldwide meme at this point. Who was the most unexpected person for you to hop on this trend?

Sorry, I'm just having a little bit of an out-of-body experience. Like seeing how silly this is. It's so funny. It's delightful.

Anyway, I woke up to a text from a friend. I think it was two days ago or yesterday, just saying Malala is in Group 7. Like the women's education activist Malala. That was incredibly unexpected. And she was using it to promote her new book, which, you know, is fantastic. And I hope it's fruitful for her, and I hope that it drives people to read her new book.

Yeah, that was the one that really was like, wow.

In your Group 2 video, you said, “It has always been and will always be me versus the algorithm. And today I have decided that I'm winning.” How have social media algorithms affected artists in the age of music discovery?

The algorithm really does not favor artists, especially independent artists, because there is no machine behind them pushing their content out. I come from a large network of truly DIY independent artists, and across the board, I'm hearing all the time just that TikTok hates musicians; TikTok hates independent artists and songwriters and stuff.

If you really scroll or take the time to search for independent artists promoting their songs, there are millions on millions on millions of videos of independent artists trying their hardest and their best to do what I'm trying to do to get their music out there and find find their audience, and it just is really disheartening that it hardly ever seems to work.

There was this kind of, I guess, “golden age” of music discovery on TikTok in the Covid era because everyone was in their homes, and there was this like mass signing of “TikTok artists” to major labels. But five years later, that trend or that movement or whatever you call it has completely flipped, and it's really, really frustrating.

Has your music had more reach since the video popped off?

Yeah! I'm so eternally grateful and still bamboozled. But “So Unfair” has definitely seen an uptick in listeners, all across the board, and it's kind of spread through a lot of my other music, too, which is really fantastic.

My catalog is very diverse. So, you know, it's exciting to see people kind of discover little corners of the discography and find themselves connected to this song as opposed to this song, or this EP as opposed to this EP. It's really thrilling to witness people be surprised as they begin to explore my largely undiscovered and underground music.

After the explosion of the Group 7 video, do you think what you said in your Group 2 video happened? Do you feel like you “won?”

I meant what I said in that video. It always has been and always will be me versus the algorithm. And it's going to continue to be. But I guess this Group 7 video has, at least in this moment, proved that the algorithm can be broken through. Musicians can break through it.

So long answer short, I'm taking it as a win for the time being. And I'm taking it as a win for the independent artist.

Nvidia's DGX Spark, the company's new $4,000 mini PC platform powered by the Grace Blackwell GB10 superchip, is under fire after John Carmack, the former CTO of Oculus VR, began raising questions about real-world performance and power draw. His comments were enough to draw tech support from Framework and even AMD, with the offer of an AMD-driven Strix Halo-powered alternative.

In a post on X, Carmack said that the DGX Spark appears to max out at 100 watts of power draw, which is less than half of its 240-watt rating. While Nvidia advertises one petaflop of sparse FP4 compute, Carmack assumes the dense equivalent should be closer to 125 teraflops, and says he's getting far less than that. He also flagged “spontaneous rebooting on a long run,” asking if the system had been “de-rated before launch.” (Expand the tweet below to see his comments.)

DGX Spark appears to be maxing out at only 100 watts power draw, less than half of the rated 240 watts, and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted performance (assuming 1 PF sparse FP4 = 125 TF dense BF16) . It gets quite hot even at this level, and I saw a report…October 27, 2025

Similarly, independent testing by ServeTheHome found that a retail Spark unit pulled just under 200 watts under combined CPU+GPU load, and couldn't hit the full 240W ceiling in any workload they ran.

Will be on standby for anything to support your exploration on Strix Halo.October 27, 2025

Drawn in by the claims, Framework dropped by Carmack's thread to offer an AMD Strix Halo-powered box for him to try instead, and AMD's Anush Elangovan, the company's Vice President of AI Software and the public face of its CUDA-challenging ROCm software, even joined the pile-on, adding "Will be on standby for anything to support your exploration on Strix Halo."

Carmack's post has kicked off a broader re-examination of what Nvidia actually promised. The petaflop figure is included across multiple pages as FP4 with sparsity, which implies 2:4 structured sparsity. This is a technique that can double effective throughput but only applies to certain matrix operations. When evaluated in denser formats like FP8 or BF16, the theoretical ceiling drops sharply. Nvidia's specs list 273GB/s of memory bandwidth and 128GB of unified LPDDR5X shared between a 20-Arm-core Nvidia Grace CPU, making Spark a capacity-focused system with nowhere near the bandwidth of an HBM-equipped GPU.

Spark is meant to host large models in-memory rather than race through tokens per second. Nvidia's marketing even suggests it can run 20-billion-parameter models locally, a feat few discrete setups can manage, due to its Blackwell architecture. But the growing number of users citing reboot issues and apparent power ceilings suggests Nvidia's tight thermal and power envelope within a 150mm chassis may be starting to bite, especially when most users would have been more than happy for the Spark to ship in a larger footprint if that meant better performance and sufficient cooling.

What's causing this suboptimal performance, such as a firmware-level cap or thermal throttling, is not clear. Nvidia hasn't commented publicly on Carmack's post or user-reported instability. Meanwhile, several threads on Nvidia's developer forums now include reports of GPU crashes and unexpected shutdowns under sustained load.

It's still very early days for DGX Spark, but with expectations for GB10 sky-high among users, Nvidia will need to explain why its flagship developer kit might be leaving so much performance potential on the table.

A new report exploring the potential for the Pacific Northwest to stake its claim as the global leader in responsible AI offers a paradoxical view. The Cascadia region, which includes Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, B.C., is described as a proven, promising player in the sphere — but with significant risks that threaten its success.

“We created companies that transformed global commerce,” writes former Gov. Chris Gregoire in a forward to the document. “Now we have the chance to add another chapter — one where Cascadia becomes the world's standard-bearer for innovation that uplifts both people and planet.”

The Cascadia Innovation Corridor, which Gregoire chairs, released the report this morning as it kicks off its two-day conference. The economic advocacy group's eighth annual event is being held in Seattle. 

The study is built on an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group that ranks Cascadia's three metro areas against 15 comparable regions in the U.S. and Canada for their economic competitiveness, including livability, workforce, and business and innovation climate. Seattle came in fourth behind Boston, Austin and Raleigh, while Portland ranked 13th and Vancouver 14th.

Over the past decade, the region's gross domestic product and populations have both grown significantly, and when combined, their economies approach the 18th largest in the world. 

Cascadia's strengths, the report explains, include tech engines such as cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon in Washington, silicon chip manufacturing in Oregon, and quantum innovation in Vancouver, as well as academic excellence from the University of Washington, University of British Columbia and Oregon State University.

But as time goes on and as business and civic leaders aim for the prize of AI dominance, cracks in the system are increasingly troubling. 

The report notes that multiple regions around the U.S. and Canada have created AI-focused hubs with hundreds of millions of dollars in public and private funding to bolster their hold on the sector. 

New Jersey has a half-billion dollar “AI Moonshot” program including tax incentives and public-worker AI training programs; New York's “Empire AI Consortium” has an AI computing training center at the University of Buffalo and startup supports; and California has a public-private task force to increase AI adoption within government services and connecting tech leaders with state agencies.

For its part, Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell announced a “responsible AI plan” this fall that provides guidelines for the municipality's use of artificial intelligence and its support of the AI tech sector as an economic driver, which includes the earlier launches of the startup-focused AI House and Foundations.

But what the region really needs to succeed is a collaborative effort tapping all of the metro areas' assets. 

“For Cascadia, the lesson is clear: without a coordinated strategy that links our strengths in cloud computing, semiconductors, and research, we risk falling behind,” states the Cascadia Innovation Corridor report. “Acting together, we can position Cascadia not just to keep pace, but to lead.”

Bissell 

Amazon

Bissell

If you're looking for a reliable, powerful, but not extremely expensive cordless vacuum, the Bissell PowerClean FurFinder is the one for you. This is similar to the popular Bissell IconPet Turbo stick vacuum, but it's new this year. The PowerClean FurFinder has everything you want in a good stick vacuum: three power levels you can easily control, a big headlight to spot dust, and a nice set of attachments, plus it stands up by itself.

This vacuum's name comes from the included 6-inch FurFinder head, which is a small head that's designed for vacuuming up pet hair. It worked great on my cat tree and left the upholstery looking new. The dust cup pops off easily, and the build quality is solid for the price point. It has a HEPA filter to keep debris from just recirculating into the air. It's all around a great vacuum for the price, and it's usually on sale, too.

Ryobi

Home Depot

Ryobi

I love this affordable stick vacuum from Ryobi. It has powerful suction of up to 89 IOW with cyclonic filtration, an easily removable roller bar for cleaning, and lights on the vacuum head to better see the debris. It has both plush and brush rolls for hard and carpet flooring, where they move together to suck up pet hair without getting tangled. The vacuum uses two HEPA filters, the dust cup is convenient to empty, and the vacuum stands upright unsupported. Plus, its easily removable and rechargeable battery makes it easy to charge separately (without having to lug the whole vacuum to an outlet), and the battery is compatible with Ryobi's line of various other tools. It also doubles as a handheld vac, and it comes with crevice tools and a dust brush for cleaning in smaller areas and furniture. This cordless vacuum far exceeded my expectations for this relatively low price point. —Molly Higgins

Dyson

Amazon (V15 Detect)

Amazon (V15 Detect Plus)

Dyson

There are a lot of Dyson vacuum models, but the V15 Detect is the best in Dyson's lineup with a reasonable price—for a Dyson, that is—and a good mix of features. Time and time again, though, the power of a Dyson vacuum can't be beat, especially the power and attachments the V15 Detect has.

It gets a deeper clean in my carpet than cheaper vacuums, and the sensor in the vacuum can actually tell you how many particles it's picking up if you want to get into the data. There's a nice range of attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has a green laser to find dust and debris on hard floors. It does have a trigger-style power button, so you'll have to hold it down the entire time you use it. That can be annoying if you know you want to use it on a lot of carpet or hard floors, but it's handy for target-cleaning areas like staircases. It's an all-around great vacuum and noticeably more powerful than cheaper options if you have the budget to splurge.

Ecovacs

Amazon

Best Buy

Ecovacs

This robot vacuum launched earlier this fall at IFA 2025 and has an interesting set of features. Unlike other robot vacuums, it doesn't have a bag, but instead has a design similar to a Dyson vacuum with a canister that cycles debris in a circle to keep it from clogging. It also has a fast-charging system that will frequently top up the battery, so the vacuum won't have to take a break to recharge for a while in the middle of cleaning larger homes. It uses Lidar and RGB cameras, multifloor mapping, and a dual-function mop and vacuum. There's also Matter compatibility, a climbing driving wheel for tricky flooring spots, and AI-enabled smarts to switch cleaning modes. There's also both a regular cleaning fluid and a heavy-duty fluid you can put into the vacuum and switch between, but the heavy-duty solution is harder to find.

All and all, it's a great robot vacuum, particularly for the self-emptying canister design. It's not perfect, however: WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has found that the lid can fall of and be annoying to replace when she checks the roller, and the driving wheels can be confused on different surfaces in her home, forcing her to tap the wheels to get them working again.

Matic

Matic

WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has been testing gear for over a decade, and the Matic robot vacuum is the only 10/10 review she's ever given. She calls it a game-changer robot vacuum for a reason.

There are several reasons for this, actually. First off, its six RGB infrared cameras create a seamless, detailed 3D model of your home, allowing the vacuum to see above itself and in the dark. Its map isn't relative, so it doesn't get confused when you move the vacuum or a single piece of furniture like a chair. The waste bag will contain wet and dry debris, so no more emptying the dirty brown water after every cleaning session. It can actually clean the toe kicks under your kitchen counters, and is quiet enough that you can run it while still being able to watch TV. You can teach the vacuum to go around certain obstacles, plus share the app and control of the vacuum with your family members. For all those features, it's also a compact vacuum that also doesn't need a massive docking station. Plus, it's cute, too, with a more unique design than the sea of round robot discs.

It does have lower suction power than other vacuums we recommend, but this vacuum is thorough enough that So hasn't noticed a difference. She has, however, noticed that she can fill a waste bag in three days (Matic says one bag lasts one to four weeks, though). They're expensive to stock up on, and you can only get them on Matic's website. Still, it's worth noting that the waste bags are fantastic, with absorbent crystals, charcoal, and a HEPA filter in the bag itself.

Ryobi

Amazon (Without Battery)

Home Depot

Ryobi

This powerful, lightweight hand vacuum comes with brush and crevice tool attachments, and although the vacuum is powerful on its own, the dust brush worked well for cleaning fabrics and effectively brushed up pet hair, and the crevice tool was small enough to fit between upholstery and hard-to-reach places in my car. Emptying the vacuum's debris was simple, with a button to eject the dust cup, and the vac has a dual HEPA filter system that untwists when it's time to be cleaned.

Plus, like other Ryobi tools, it attaches to a rechargeable 18-volt lithium-ion battery pack for power (which also helps to conserve space), and the battery works with other Ryobi tools. This multifunctional tool boasts 37-inch sealed suction IOW (inches of water) suction power, holds almost three cups, and has a three-year warranty. I consider it a great value at less than $100. —Molly Higgins

Worx

Amazon

Worx

I have a toddler, which means I'm constantly battling messy cars. I've tried a slew of car-designed vacuums, with longer hoses and promises of easier cleans. My favorite by far is the cube-shaped Worx vacuum, which proves something can be both adorable and incredibly useful.

The handle on top of its boxy form is comfortable to hold, and the hose wraps around that handle when it's in storage. I found it most comfortable to hold the square base in one hand and the hose in the other as I moved around my car cleaning it, but the three-foot hose does mean you could put it down and reach plenty of spots in the car. It has a small dustbin, but was plenty for the sand and Cheerio debris that haunts our vehicles. It uses a power tool-style battery that pops off and charges in a base, and is a great choice if you have other Worx tools (and batteries!) in your garage.

Black and Decker Dustbuster Flex for $89: This is another cool handheld vacuum that's great for cars, or even indoor areas like staircases. It has a 4-foot hose, longer than most compact vacuums, and has a handy little charging mount that the accessories clip into. And thank goodness for the charging mount, since the battery only lasts 15 minutes.

Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum for $280: Dyson's latest handheld vacuum was designed specifically for cars (and boats!) in mind, so if you have a vehicle to clean, this is made for it. It's got a fantastic battery life compared to other handheld vacuums.

Dyson Gen5 Detect Cordless Vacuum for $935: This is Dyson's current top of the line stick vacuum, and it's fantastic, especially for homes with a lot of pet hair. But it's expensive and rarely on sale, making it a hard upgrade when you'll still get a great experience with the Dyson V15 Detect. But this vacuum does have a HEPA filter, while the V15 Detect does not.

Roborock Qrevo S for $800 (used): This is technically our top robot vacuum pick, but Roborock recently updated the Qrevo line with new models that aren't shipping to the United States, and the model we like best is only available secondhand.

Tineco Pure One Station 5 for $459: If you want a cordless stick vacuum but don't want to deal with emptying it all the time, this Tineco vacuum comes with a self-emptying docking station. You'll eventually have to empty the station, but it's a great bonus feature and keeps the vacuum from falling over around your home since it's stored safely in the docking station.

Which Style Vacuum Is Right for You?

Here's what makes each style of vacuum great to help you choose which one you should buy.

What About Upright Vacuums?

An upright vacuum is the classic, original vacuum style that sits straight up on its own and is much heavier than cordless stick vacuums, and requires an outlet connection to work. We currently don't have an upright vacuum we recommend, since cordless stick vacuums have become the main focus for most shoppers (and as frequent vacuumers ourselves, we usually reach for cordless and robot vacuums anyways). We're considering upright vacuums to test in the future, however, and feel free to comment on this guide with models we should consider.

Do You Need a Stick Vacuum and a Handheld Vacuum?

Do you need a handheld vacuum if you already have a cordless vacuum? Likely no, because most stick vacuums can transform into a handheld vacuum already. Stick or cordless vacuums usually allow you to remove the stick part from between the vacuum head and canister base and instead connect those two pieces directly, making it into a handheld vacuum. It'll be much heavier than a vacuum designed to always be handheld, and might be irritating if you have a specific use case you want it for, but you don't need both unless there's a specific reason. A handheld is a good add-on if you already have an upright vacuum you love that doesn't need replacing.

How Often Should You Replace Your Vacuum?

Vacuums last about five years, depending on the use frequency and build quality. Some cheaper stick vacuums might only last about a year or two, though, so it's worth investing in a better vacuum than finding a cheap dupe. If you're curious what signs might indicate your vacuum needs replacing, check out our guide to how long vacuums can last.

U.S. and China buyers now see just 70% order fulfillment, as AI demand drives DDR5 shortages and PC parts follow suit.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The DRAM supply chain is choking, and server memory is taking the first hit. According to DigiTimes, major U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers are now receiving just 70% of the server DRAM they order. That's despite agreeing to contract price increases of up to 50% for Q4, well above the 30% hike many buyers had budgeted for earlier this year.

Naturally, AI sits at the core of all this. While it's HBM that gets the headlines, demand for conventional DDR5 RDIMMs is also outpacing supply, particularly at advanced nodes where Samsung and SK hynix have diverted capacity toward parts bound for AI acceleration. Samsung's recent pricing adjustments confirm the reprioritization, with the company having raised server SSD prices by up to 35% and RDIMM contract rates by as much as 50%, citing sustained demand from enterprise and cloud customers.

What's left is a market where even the largest buyers can't secure enough memory. Spot prices have surged since late September, and several top-tier suppliers are reportedly refusing to quote for October allocations. DDR5 16 GB modules that traded at $7 to $8 last month are now hovering around $13, with availability tightening further into November. Module makers are bracing for out-of-stock situations by the end of the quarter.

The rest of the market fares worse. Channel players and smaller OEMs are seeing order fulfillment rates closer to 35% to 40%. With hyperscalers locking in fixed allocations, lower-priority customers are pushed to the spot market or told to wait until capacity opens up in 2026.

Micron warned of this in its most recent earnings call, telling investors that DRAM is a “tight industry” and that bit supply growth will lag demand through the end of next year. TrendForce also flagged a potential quote freeze across certain modules, as suppliers shift to day-to-day pricing in China and avoid locking themselves into bad deals.

This is causing retail DDR5 prices to creep upward, with no sign of stabilization before year's end. DDR4, meanwhile, is in slow decline. China's Nanya Technology recently said standard DDR4 makes up just 20% of the total DRAM market, and it's no longer being prioritized for volume production. Unless demand unexpectedly cools or yields improve sharply, DRAM allocation for everyone outside the top buyers will be constrained into 2026.

Adobe said on Tuesday that it is launching the latest iteration of its image generation model, Firefly Image 5. The company is also adding more features to the Firefly website, support for more third-party models, and the ability to generate speech and soundtracks. Notably, the update allows artists to come up with their own image models using their existing art.

Image 5 can now work at native resolutions of up to 4 megapixels, a massive increase from the previous-gen model, which could natively generate images at 1 megapixel but then would upscale them to 4 megapixels. The new model is also better at rendering humans, the company said.

Image 5 also enables layered and prompt-based editing — the model treats different objects as layers and allows you to edit them using prompts, or use tools like resize and rotate. The company said it makes sure that when you edit these layers, the image's details and integrity are not compromised.

Adobe's Firefly site has supported third-party models from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Runway, Topaz, and Flux to augment its appeal to its creative customer base, and now the company is taking that a step further by letting users create custom models based on their art style. Currently in a closed beta, this feature lets users drag and drop assets, such as images, illustrations and sketches, to create a custom image model based on their style.

The company is also adding some new features to its Firefly website, which was redesigned earlier this year. The site now lets you use the prompt box to switch between generating images or videos, choose which AI model you want to work with, change aspect ratios, and more. The site's home page now features your files and recent generation history, and you also get shortcuts to other Adobe apps (these were previously housed in a menu).

Adobe has also redesigned the video generation and editing tool to support layers and timeline-based editing. This design change is currently only available in a private beta, and will be rolled out to users eventually.

Firefly is also getting two new audio features: Users can now employ AI prompts to generate entire soundtracks and speech — using models from ElevenLabs — for videos. There's also a new way to easily come up with prompts: just add keywords and sections by selecting words from a word cloud.

As its competitors like Canva add AI to their platforms, Adobe is trying to cater to new-age creators who are increasingly using AI in their workflows. “We're thinking of the target audience for Firefly as what we call creators or next-generation creative professionals. I think there are these emergent creatives that are GenAI-oriented. They love to use GenAI in all their workloads,” Alexandru Costin, the company's VP of generative AI, told TechCrunch over a call.

He added that with Firefly, the company now has more freedom to add new features and play around with the interface as it doesn't have to adhere to the muscle memory of creative professionals who might be used to certain workflows in Adobe's existing Creative Cloud tools.

The viability of Linux as a gaming platform has come on leaps and bounds in recent years due to the sterling work of WINE and Proton developers, among others, and interest in hardware like the Steam Deck. However, the most recent stats from ProtonDB (via Boiling Steam) highlight that we are edging towards a magnificent milestone. The latest distilled data shows that almost 90% of Windows games now run on Linux.

Having nine in ten Windows games accessible in a new Linux install is quite an achievement. The milestone comes as we see computer users flocking to other platforms during the transition from the Windows 10 to 11 eras. Of course, the underlying data isn't quite so simple as the headline stat. There are different degrees of compatibility gamers must consider when checking if their favorite Windows games work on Linux distros like Mint, Zorin, Bazzite, or even SteamOS.

Windows Games' Compatibility on Linux Is at an All-Time High: https://t.co/G06smdohrX #linux #linuxgaming #update #gaming #steam #proton #steamplay #wine #compatibility #windows pic.twitter.com/e598JNzqgPOctober 26, 2025

The above chart relies on Boiling Steam's five definitions of playability, but these aren't a million miles from the Steam Deck ratings Valve dishes out. The main difference seems to be that Boiling Steam doesn't seem to care whether Steam Deck performance is a gaming-limiting factor. So, in a way, its ratings are perhaps more useful to desktop and laptop PC users who typically have systems that easily outpace a Steam Deck.

Boiling Steam platinum (green) rank denotes games that run perfectly, out of the box. Gold (light green) requires just minor tweaks. Silver (yellow) games are playable but have some imperfections. Borked (dark red) games simply refuse to launch. Lastly, Bronze (red) titles exist in the murky water between silver and borked.

Looking at the chart trends, we see an encouraging growth in the number of new releases that are platinum (green) rated, and a thinning down of the red/dark red zone. Developers will, of course, benefit from more hardware being able to play their games with few if any wrinkles, so there must be an incentive to spend at least a little time checking a new Windows game on Linux, or the Steam Deck specifically.

On the flip side, there are some popular titles that don't look like they will be becoming Linux-friendly anytime soon. The well-known compatibility issues with various anti-cheat technology platforms look set to persist, for now. Moreover, Boiling Steam notes that other devs just seem to be averse to non-Windows gamers. There is quite a bit that can be done with those non-intentionally stubborn games, though. We'd recommend researching community-driven Linux compatibility tips and tweaks for your favorite games.

                Reading time: Reading time 1 minute
      

You may have noticed some big changes to our consumer tech coverage this year. We revamped our gadget news, reviews, and guides, and have steadily elevated our product photography and videos as we've added new experts to bring you everything happening in the weird and inventive world of consumer tech.

As the end of the year draws near, it's time to announce Gizmodo's Best Tech of 2025 Awards. We reviewed a tremendous amount of gadgets this calendar year—several from new categories like smart glasses with displays—and we're going to expand into even more categories in 2026. We couldn't be more excited to share with you all the products that impressed us the most.

Across over a dozen categories, every winner is a product that Gizmodo's consumer tech team has either reviewed or tested extensively—so you can trust we've done our jobs. We didn't just hand out awards willy-nilly.

We've also got a few additional winners to award in the coming weeks; some products are releasing after this list publishes, so it's only fair that we wait to include them for consideration.

Not everyone will agree with our picks, but don't worry, dear reader, you'll get a chance to vote for your favorite tech of the year in a separate Reader's Choice Awards.

Most importantly, thank you for reading consumer tech stories. Our North Star is to provide authoritative, fair, and entertaining coverage. We hope you enjoy going through our Best Tech of 2025 Awards!

China has completed the first phase of construction of what it claims is the world's first underwater data center (UDC). Located in Shanghai's Lin-gang Special Area with a price tag of roughly RMB 1.6 billion ($226 million), it's a significant milestone in the quest for sustainable solutions to the growing energy demands of China's computing infrastructure.

Powered entirely by wind energy, the initiative has a total power capacity of 24 megawatts. According to the Lin-gang management committee, its completion represents a key breakthrough in incorporating renewable energy into data storage, processing, and distribution.

Traditional land-based data centers run hot and must be kept cool to operate efficiently. Air conditioning systems alone can account for up to 50 percent of total energy consumption.

Lin-gang's UDC solves this problem by submerging servers beneath the surface of the ocean where seawater acts as a natural cooling system, according to Su Yang, general manager of Shanghai Hicloud Technology, one of the contractors on the project. This reduces the energy demand for cooling to less than 10 percent.

The industry-standard metric for measuring the energy efficiency of a data center is PUE (power usage effectiveness). The UDC's first phase is designed to achieve a PUE of no more than 1.15, a remarkable goal considering theoretical perfection is 1.0. Meanwhile, China's national policy requires new data centers to achieve a PUE of less than 1.25 by the end of 2025.

The project is environmentally sustainable in other ways. More than 95 percent of its electricity comes from offshore wind turbines. Overall, the designers estimate that this reduces energy consumption by 22.8 percent. Huang Dinan, president of Shenergy Group, another of the project's contractors, noted that the East China Sea offers unique offshore wind resources with more than 3,000 hours of annual utilization. Land usage is reduced by more than 90 percent, a major factor in densely populated coastal cities like Shanghai, and the need for fresh water is eliminated entirely.

The UDC is not an isolated effort. As part of a broader national strategy in China, Shanghai aims to become a global center of scientific and technological innovation by growing its cloud computing industry to more than RMB 200 billion (approximately $28.25 billion) by 2027.

This initiative also complements—and perhaps offers an alternative to—the “East Data, West Computing” megaproject, which launched in 2022. That project seeks to build data centers in China's less developed, western regions to process data generated by coastal economic centers to the east. Lin-gang's UDC, on the other hand, processes data close to where it is generated, while using marine resources to mitigate negative environmental impacts.

The UDC's 24-megawatts capacity is just the beginning. During the announcement for the project, the main contractors, including Shanghai Hicloud Technology, Shenergy Group, the Shanghai branch of China Telecom and INESA, signed a new agreement to launch another offshore wind-powered UDC project with a much more ambitious goal: 500 megawatts.

However, the transition from proof-of-concept projects to large-scale application presents significant challenges. “UDC construction is still in its early stage,” cautioned Wang Shifeng, president of Third Harbor Engineering, another company involved in the current project. Wang stressed that for broader deployment, operation and maintenance optimization, as well as technological reliability, must be achieved first.

PayPal said on Tuesday that it is adopting a protocol in combination with OpenAI's “Instant Checkout” feature to let users pay for their shopping directly within ChatGPT, starting in 2026.

PayPal is adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open source specification developed by OpenAI that lets merchants make their products available within AI apps, consequently enabling users to shop using AI agents. Meanwhile, OpenAI's “Instant Checkout” feature, launched in September, lets users confirm their order, shipping, and payment details, and complete purchases without leaving ChatGPT.

Customers can use their PayPal wallets for checkout, which, the company said, would enable it to provide buyer and seller protection, as well as dispute resolution. The company is also providing technology to handle card payments from within ChatGPT using a separate payments API.

And next year, merchants using PayPal products will have their products be discoverable on ChatGPT, starting with categories like apparel, fashion, beauty, home improvement, and electronics. Merchants will not need to build any integrations, as PayPal will handle merchant routing and payments behind the scenes.

The company said it is also launching an agentic commerce suite that would let merchants feature their catalogs within AI apps, accept payments on different AI apps, and get insights about consumer behavior.

PayPal has been working to insert itself as a payments partner within various companies' AI-enabled shopping experiences, particularly as people increasingly use AI apps to do their daily tasks. In May, the company teamed up with Perplexity to let users check out within the AI search tool, and in September, PayPal said it was adopting Google's Agent Payments Protocol to integrate its products within various Google products.

PayPal said, apart from the partnership on commerce, the company is giving enterprise access to ChatGPT to all of its employees and allowing its engineers to make better use of OpenAI's coding tools, Codex.

“Hundreds of millions of people turn to ChatGPT each week for help with everyday tasks, including finding products they love, and over 400 million use PayPal to shop,” Alex Chriss, president and CEO of PayPal, said in a statement. “By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,” he added.

5090 performance for half the price.

Shunt mods on mobile devices are always exciting because they seem to push the boundaries of what's possible in a more practical way. Laptops are thermally constrained and, thus, power-limited compared to their desktop counterparts. Even a fully specced-out mobile GPU can't compete against its desktop variant, so when someone tries to break through the manufactured barriers to unlock its full potential, well, we let the results speak for themselves. And the numbers coming out of this Reddit user's laptop are nothing short of impressive.

On the r/GamingLaptops subreddit, user u/thatavidreadertrue (we'll call him Avid) details their experience shunt-modding an Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 gaming laptop with an RTX 4090, and they come with the benchmarks to back it all up. For those unaware, shunt-modding essentially refers to tricking your GPU into thinking it's consuming way less power than it actually is. This allows the GPU to boost higher and for longer before thermal-throttling, enabling the silicon to be overclocked through clever electronic surgery rather than brute-forcing the cooling.

In Avid's case, they took a 1 mΩ resistor and placed it in parallel with the GPU's existing 5 mΩ shunt resistor on the motherboard. Through Ohm's law, that comes out to an 83% reduction in resistance, meaning the GPU is now underreporting its wattage by roughly 6x (down to just 0.83mΩ). The 4090 in the Zephyrus M16 has a 150W TGP, meaning the firmware won't allow it to go past that. But with the shunt mod, the GPU's internal logic is altered, so when it says it's consuming 40-45W, it's actually drawing around 240W in reality.

This allows for a pretty incredible bump in performance, so much so that this 4090 starts to match or even outperform the RTX 5090 mobile in a multitude of scenarios. Avid didn't test any games, but the synthetic benchmarks are enough to give us an idea. The most drastic difference comes in Solar Bay Extreme, where the shunt-modded 4090 scored 24,617 points, which was 35% higher than the "next best M16" which could only manage 18,166. Compared to the average 5090 laptop that can achieve 22,877 points, our 4090 with wings was still 7.6% ahead.

There was essentially no difference in Port Royal, though, and the shunt mod was actually a smidge slower in Steel Nomad, but across all tests, the average gain was still 3.5% compared to a regular 5090 mobile, and almost 20% compared to the other 4090 GPUs in the Zephyrus M16. To deal with the extra heat, all Avid had to do was upgrade the liquid metal to PTM7950 phase-change thermal pads, and swap out the stock VRM thermal pads with Upsiren UX Pro Ultra.

While thermal details were scarce, Avid did mention in a comment that the 4090 gets up to 80-84°C but "doesn't thermal throttle" while the CPU can get a bit toasty at around 90°C. We also learned that Avid undervolts the shunt-modded 4090, limiting the voltage to 800mV for gaming, which makes sense since otherwise the GPU would keep boosting to potentially dangerous levels.

Overall, this config can strike a nice balance between power, performance, temps, and noise. That's before we even factor in the price, because Avid actually got this Zephyrus M16 from the secondhand market for only $1600, which is a good deal in and of itself. But, when you consider that it beats an RTX 5090 laptop after modding for almost no additional charge, it transforms into next-level value.

As always, a disclaimer is due: Messing with your hardware on this level can cause irreparable harm to your device, especially if you're not sure what you're doing. The machine is designed with a certain thermal and power envelope in mind, so bypassing that can only lead to so much improvement before you hit the point of diminishing returns. However, if there's room, Avid's shunt mod shows us it doesn't take much to raise the ceiling.

Measuring the pixel-per-degree of a display, researchers found the human eye can see up to 94 PPD for grey, but as few as 53 for yellow and violet.

Researchers at the University of Cambridge and Meta Reality Labs have conducted a new study into how the human eye perceives pixels on displays at different sizes and resolutions, and claim that once you get to a certain size and detail, there's no discernible difference, via TechXplore. According to the calculator they developed, at 10 feet distance, a 50-inch screen looks almost identical at 1440p and 8K resolution.

The researchers highlighted that as displays grow larger and more detailed, with ever greater resolutions, it's important to know what humans can actually see so that we aren't developing technologies that are largely redundant. But where previous studies have looked at the perceived retinal resolution, these researchers looked at what resolution the viewer could perceive with utmost clarity and no blur, indistinguishable from a perfect reference, and measured it distinctly for different colors and tones.

Using a sliding display to maintain continuous resolution control, researchers found that the human eye can perceive black and white pixels at up to 94 pixels per degree, and up to 89 pixels per degree for red and green patterns, but just 53 pixels per degree for yellow and violet.

The researchers looked into the effects of looking directly at a pixel or from an angle, the overall size of the screen, its pixel density, the brightness (or darkness) of a room, and the distance between the viewer and the screen.

In correlating all this data together, the researchers developed a calculator where you can input various factors like resolution, distance from the screen, and screen size, to see how the study would extrapolate the results. Using that data, we can see that with a 50-inch screen at 10 feet distance, the subjects of the study wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between a 1440p screen and one at 8K resolution. The calculator indicates that for a 50-inch 1440p display viewed at 10 feet, only 1 percent of the population would notice the difference between that image and a 'perfect' image. At 4K, that number becomes 0%; naturally, 8K would be the same. According to the scientists, all three resolutions would look broadly the same at that distance.

"If you have more pixels in your display, it's less efficient, it costs more and it requires more processing power to drive it," said co-author Professor Rafał Mantiuk, from Cambridge's Department of Computer Science and Technology.

"So we wanted to know the point at which it makes no sense to further improve the resolution of the display."

Before this study, the human eye was thought to be capable of viewing 60 pixels per degree, so it raises the bar for what the human eye can perceive at certain distances and screen sizes. That could prompt display manufacturers to adjust their designs, and indeed, the researchers hope the results could help guide display development, as well as image, rendering, and video coding technologies in the future.

Although it feels like there's an argument to be made that 8K displays are still somewhat redundant when there's little native content for them or powerful enough GPUs to run them, I still feel like I can tell the difference between them and 1440p. Maybe not at extreme distances, but at something pedestrian like 10 feet? I feel like that'd be doable.

Maybe it's a perceived resolution increase from the added detail such a rendered image might show, more than actually seeing the pixels? Also, maybe I should just listen to the scientists who've done the kind of testing I'd need to do to prove my point.

Meta plans to lay off more than 100 employees in Washington state as part of a broader round of cuts within its artificial intelligence division.

A new filing with the state's Employment Security Department shows 101 employees impacted, including 48 in Bellevue, 23 in Seattle, and four in Redmond, along with 23 remote workers based in Washington. 

The filing lists dozens of affected roles across Meta's AI research and infrastructure units, including software engineers, AI researchers, and data scientists. Meta product managers, privacy specialists, and compliance analysts were also affected. 

Meta is cutting around 600 positions in its AI unit, Axios reported last week. The company is investing heavily in AI and wants to create a “more agile operation,” according to an internal memo cited by Axios. Meta has just under 3,000 roles within its superintelligence lab, CNBC reported.

The separations at Meta in Washington take effect Dec. 22, according to the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) notice filed Oct. 22.

Meta employs thousands of people across multiple offices in the Seattle region, one of its largest engineering hubs outside Menlo Park. 

The latest reductions mark another contraction for Meta's Pacific Northwest footprint following multiple rounds of layoffs over the past several years.

The company's rapid expansion in Seattle over the past decade made it one of the emblems of the region's tech boom, coinciding with Microsoft's resurgence and Amazon's rise.

Among the Bay Area titans, Google was among the first to establish a Seattle-area engineering office, way back in 2004. However, it was Facebook's decision to open its own outpost across from Pike Place Market in 2010 that really got the attention of their Silicon Valley tech brethren.

In the decade that followed, out-of-town companies set up more than 130 engineering centers in the region.

However, more recently Meta has made moves to trim its Seattle-area footprint. 

Apple earlier this year took over a building previously occupied by Meta in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood, near Amazon's headquarters. CoStar reported in April that Meta listed its other Arbor Blocks building for sublease.

Meta previously gobbled up much of the planned office space at the Spring District, a sprawling development northeast of downtown Bellevue, including a building that was originally going to be a new REI headquarters. But it has subleased some of the space since then to companies such as Snowflake, which recently took an entire building from Meta at the Spring District.

Meta's office in Redmond, near Microsoft's headquarters, is focused on its mixed reality development. 

GeekWire has reached out to the company for an updated Seattle-area headcount.

Meta's cuts come amid reported layoffs at Amazon that could impact up to 30,000 workers.

Tech companies have laid off more than 128,000 employees this year, according to Layoffs.fyi. Last year, companies cut nearly 153,000 positions.

Grokipedia, Elon Musk's alternative to Wikipedia, sparked to life on Monday afternoon. Then it went dark again. Then it sparked to life again Monday evening. As of this writing, it is up. In terms of style, it looks like Wikipedia with its optional dark mode turned on. 

Based on a very brief review, it contains articles on most topics one would most easily expect in an encyclopedia, professing to have just under 900,000 in total. The website Wikicount says there are about 7 million English Wikipedia articles. 

There are gaps in Grokipedia, however. For instance, at the moment it does not currently appear to have a dedicated article about the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 

Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, was building an online encyclopedia late last month, saying it would be a “massive improvement over Wikipedia.” The idea for Grokipedia was born during an appearance by Musk on the All-In Podcast. Host and fellow high net worth individual David Sacks asked Musk point blank to create it, noting that Wikipedia was “hyper-partisan” and full of “activists.” 

Here are some comparisons between Wikipedia articles and Grokipedia articles. These are copied verbatim from the intros of articles with the footnotes and links removed for ease of reading: 

Nicholas Joseph Fuentes (born August 18, 1998) is an American far-right political commentator, activist and live streamer. He identifies as a Christian nationalist and part of the incel subculture. His views have been described as racist, white supremacist, misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic, and Islamophobic. Furthermore, he has been described as a neo-Nazi and a Holocaust denier. His supporters are known as Groypers.

Nicholas Joseph Fuentes (born August 18, 1998) is an American political commentator, live streamer, and activist who hosts the nightly internet program America First and organizes the annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC). A self-professed traditional Catholic, Fuentes advocates for policies centered on national sovereignty, including a moratorium on immigration, withdrawal from foreign entanglements, and preservation of America's historic European-descended majority. His rise began as a teenager supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, after which he withdrew from Boston University amid threats following his attendance at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Title: “Great Replacement conspiracy theory”The Great Replacement (French: grand remplacement), also known as replacement theory or great replacement theory, is a debunked white nationalist far-right conspiracy theory coined by French author Renaud Camus. Camus' theory states that, with the complicity or cooperation of “replacist” elites, the ethnic French and white European populations at large are being demographically and culturally replaced by non-white peoples—especially from Muslim-majority countries—through mass migration, demographic growth and a drop in the birth rate of white Europeans. Since then, similar claims have been advanced in other national contexts, notably in the United States. Mainstream scholars have dismissed these claims of a conspiracy of “replacist” elites as rooted in a misunderstanding of demographic statistics and premised upon an unscientific, racist worldview.

Title: “Great Replacement theory”

The Great Replacement is a theory originated by French writer Renaud Camus in his 2011 essay Le Grand Remplacement, which contends that the historic populations of European nations are undergoing demographic substitution through sustained high levels of immigration from Africa and the Middle East, compounded by sub-replacement fertility rates among native Europeans (typically below 1.5 children per woman in most EU countries) and comparatively higher fertility among immigrant groups (often exceeding 2.0). Camus describes this process as an orchestrated “genocide by substitution,” driven by elite policies favoring multiculturalism over national continuity, resulting in the erosion of indigenous cultural dominance without violent conflict. Empirical underpinnings include United Nations projections indicating that net migration will account for nearly all population stability or growth in Europe amid native decline, with foreign-born residents comprising nearly 10% of the EU population by 2024 and contributing disproportionately to births—one-third or more in nations like Austria and Germany

Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg (Swedish: [ˈɡreːta ˈtʉːnbærj]; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish activist best known for pressuring governments to address climate change and social issues. She gained global attention in 2018, at age 15, after starting a solo school strike outside the Swedish parliament, which inspired the worldwide Fridays for Future movement. She has since broadened her focus to include human rights and global justice, voicing support for Ukraine, Palestine, Armenia, and Western Sahara. In 2025, Thunberg twice joined a humanitarian flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip.

Thunberg has been credited with sparking the “Greta effect”, influencing environmental awareness and youth engagement worldwide. She has received numerous honors, including inclusion in Time's 100 Most Influential People and being named Person of the Year in 2019.

Greta Thunberg (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish activist recognized for launching a solo school strike for climate action on 20 August 2018 outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, an action that catalyzed the international Fridays for Future movement involving millions of students protesting government inaction on climate change.

Thunberg, diagnosed at age 11 or 12 with Asperger syndrome—a form of autism spectrum disorder—along with obsessive-compulsive disorder and selective mutism, has described these conditions as providing her with a focused “superpower” for advocacy. Her high-profile speeches at venues including the United Nations General Assembly and the World Economic Forum in Davos amplified calls for immediate emissions reductions and policy shifts, earning her Time magazine's Person of the Year designation in 2019 as the youngest recipient. While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests.

Overall, Grokipedia gives off the impression of a site where topics and people that Elon Musk likes or supports are presented without framings that cast any doubt on their validity, and those he dislikes are presented with criticism front-and-center.

As others have pointed out, some articles are strikingly similar to Wikipedia's, and contain notes at the bottom saying they were adapted from Wikipedia under a ShareAlike 4.0 license, which would seem to indicate that those particular Grokipedia articles are also available to share freely. However, the url for Grokipedia is at the .com top-level domain, not the .org domain like Wikipedia.

Grokipedia also mostly (or perhaps entirely) lacks photos and illustrations. It's understandable that biographical articles don't have portraits, but articles like “Tesseract” would benefit from clarifying illustrations and even animations, like on Wikipedia. 

Some Grokipedia articles are quite long and detailed—long past the point of general interest. For instance, the article for Gizmodo, while seemingly accurate after a brief scan, seems like it would benefit from a human editor. 

Overall, the project seems very much like what it purports to be: a version of Wikipedia with articles written by Grok, a large language model that favors Elon Musk's views. 

Gizmodo reached out to xAI about all of this, asking for comment. That email received an immediate, three-word reply: “Legacy Media Lies.”

Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia in 1812 was one of history's most disastrous retreats. New research bolsters the theory that diseases made the calamitous situation even worse.

Researchers in France and Estonia have identified pathogens in the remains of soldiers who retreated from Russia that cause paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. While the study doesn't determine how widespread the diseases were, it identifies potential culprits behind the symptoms described in historical records of Napoleon's army.

“The retreat from Russia spanned from October 19 to December 14 1812 and resulted in the loss of nearly the entire Napoleonic army,” the researchers wrote in a study published Friday in the journal Current Biology. “According to historians, it was not the harassment from the Russian army that claimed the lives of about 300,000 men, but rather the harsh cold of the Russian winter, coupled with hunger and diseases.”

The team recovered and sequenced DNA from the teeth of soldiers previously exhumed in Lithuania, who likely died from infectious diseases. Their analysis revealed evidence of two pathogens—a subspecies of Salmonella enterica belonging to the lineage Paratyphi C (S. enterica Paratyphi C), which causes paratyphoid fever; and Borrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever.

The results represent the first genetic evidence of Napoleon's soldiers being afflicted by these pathogens. Specifically, four of the soldiers tested positive for S. enterica Paratyphi C and two for B. recurrentis. Both diseases can cause high fever, fatigue, and digestive problems, and their symptoms align with those described in historical records of Napoleon's army. With soldiers already suffering from cold, hunger, and poor hygiene, one can only imagine the state of these men.

Because the researchers only investigated 13 soldiers out of the approximately 300,000 who died during the retreat from Russia, they can't determine how many deaths these pathogens may have caused. Nonetheless, “the presence of these previously unsuspected pathogens in these soldiers reveal that they could have contributed to the devastation of Napoleon's Grande Armée during its disastrous retreat in 1812,” the researchers explain.

Investigating the genomic data of historically relevant pathogens sheds light on the development of infectious diseases, carrying implications for the study of such illnesses today, Nicolás Rascovan, co-author of the study and head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur, explained in a statement by the institute.

Rascovan and his colleagues' work further bolsters the hypothesis that in addition to stressors such as fatigue, cold, and harsh conditions, infectious diseases contributed to the collapse of Napoleon's 1812 campaign in Russia. More broadly, the study also offers additional insight into an infamous military failure, one whose historical lessons were largely ignored by Adolf Hitler over a century later during Operation Barbarossa, when his own poorly equipped troops suffered in the freezing Russian cold.

In a study of more than 100,000 screening mammograms, researchers demonstrated the potential of an AI tool to help identify women at higher risk of developing interval breast cancers, breast cancer that is diagnosed between regular screening mammograms. Results of the new study were published today in Radiology, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

Interval cancers generally have a worse prognosis compared with screen-detected cancers, because they tend to be either larger or more aggressive. That's why it's important to minimize the number of interval cancers that you have in any screening program."

Fiona J. Gilbert, M.B.Ch.B., co-author, professor of radiology, Department of Radiology at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom (U.K.), and honorary consultant radiologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital

Using a large retrospective dataset from the U.K.'s triennial screening program, Dr. Gilbert and lead researcher Joshua W. D. Rothwell, an M.B.B.S./Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, employed AI to identify women for supplemental imaging to find interval cancers.

"Personalized breast cancer screening depends on accurately assessing an individual's risk of developing breast cancer within a specific timeframe," Dr. Gilbert said. "We can use supplemental imaging and adjust screening frequency based on a woman's breast density and likelihood of developing breast cancer within a short timeframe."

The study cohort included 134,217 screening mammograms on the same number of women (aged 50-70), with 524 interval cancers. The exams were performed between 2014 and 2016 at two U.K. triennial Breast Screening Program centers using two different mammography systems.

Negative (no cancer found) digital screening mammograms were processed by Mirai, a deep learning-based algorithm, producing a generalized risk score for developing an interval breast cancer. The AI tool primarily uses information from the mammogram, including tumor features and breast density, to make a risk prediction.

The AI tool's 3-year risk scores retrospectively predicted 3.6% (19/524), 14.5% (76/524), 26.1% (137/524) and 42.4% (222/524) of the 524 interval cancers for women assigned the highest 1%, 5%, 10% and 20% scores. Identification of the interval cancers is equivalent to an additional cancer detection rate of 0.1, 0.6, 1.0, and 1.7 per 1,000.

"Our results suggest that further workup of mammograms within the top 20% of scores could yield 42.4% of interval cancers, meaning that Mirai could be used to identify women for supplemental imaging or a shortened screening interval, instead of or in addition to breast density," Rothwell said.

The AI tool performed better at predicting interval cancers within a year of the screening examination versus 12 to 24 months or 24 to 36 months later. While the tool was less effective in women with extremely dense breast tissue, it showed superior performance compared to conventional risk prediction tools.

In the U.K., 2.2 million women are screened for breast cancer every year. According to Dr. Gilbert, AI could help optimize the country's triennial breast cancer screening program by improving the selection criteria for women who could benefit from supplemental imaging, such as MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography, or by shortening the screening interval.

"If we called back 20% of women for supplemental imaging, we'd have to find the capacity to offer contrast-enhanced mammography or MRI to 440,000 women," she said.

Next steps for the researchers include comparing commercially available predictive AI tools, conducting economic modeling and a cost-effective analysis, and conducting a trial utilizing predictive AI to identify women most likely to benefit from supplemental breast imaging following screening mammography.

"Identifying women at an increased risk of developing breast cancer is a complex, multifactorial problem," Dr. Gilbert said. "The goal is to accurately identify the women most likely to have an interval cancer while minimizing the volume of supplemental imaging performed."

Addressing the question of whether and how immune cells (macrophages) in the central nervous system (CNS) traffic out, researchers have now identified a perineural pathway through which the HIV virus can redistribute throughout the body. The findings from a study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, shed light on how these cells travel from the brain through the body, reseeding HIV and sustaining inflammation despite treatment with antiretroviral therapy.

The CNS has long been considered anatomically and immunologically segregated from the rest of the body because of the presence of tight junctions, the perception of limited draining lymphatics, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier. However, the connection between the CNS and the peripheral nervous system (PNS, outside the blood-brain barrier) is often overlooked and not well understood.

Co-lead investigator Kenneth C. Williams, PhD, Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Biology Department, Boston College, explains, "In a monkey model of HIV, we injected two different colored nanoparticles directly into the cerebrospinal fluid—the protective liquid of the brain and spinal cord. These particles effectively labeled the CNS macrophages upon absorption. By using distinct colors, we could mark macrophages at different stages of infection—early versus late—and subsequently determine the specific routes these tagged cells used to exit the CNS."

Not only did we discover that the macrophages can leave under noninfection conditions, but we also found that they exit via cranial and peripheral nerves."

Robert V. Blair, PhD, DVM, co-lead investigator, Tulane National Primate Research Center

The CNS is recognized as a critical reservoir for viruses such as HIV and its monkey-equivalent SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus), with perivascular macrophages being the primary HIV- and SIV-infected cells in the CNS. The new understanding of immune cell movement uncovered by this study reveals that this reservoir is not static but actively contributes to persistent viral activity and inflammation throughout the body.

"These results underline the importance of the connection between the CNS and PNS in immunity, particularly the impact of macrophage traffic on persistent myeloid activation in the dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nerves. Our findings provide critical insights that will inform new strategies in the challenge of eradicating HIV," concludes co-lead investigator Zoey K. Wallis, PhD, Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Biology Department, Boston College.

As modern lifestyles increasingly challenge the body's natural circadian rhythm, the American Heart Association is spotlighting the potential health consequences of regular disruptions to our body's internal clock with a new scientific statement published today in its flagship journal Circulation. The statement, "Role of Circadian Health in Cardiometabolic Health and Disease Risk," outlines how disruptions to circadian rhythm may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and health risk factors including obesity, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Additionally, circadian disruption may be particularly relevant to cardiovascular–kidney–metabolic health, which is associated with cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality risk.

Circadian rhythms are produced by the body's natural 24-hour internal clock that regulates a multitude of biological processes like sleep, wakefulness, hormone release, digestion and body temperature. Regular interruptions to the body clock are much more than simple inconveniences like staying up too late or waking up too early. These disruptions may trigger adverse health effects in several different ways. Aligning our daily behaviors, when we sleep, eat and move, with our internal clock is important to support optimal cardiometabolic health."

Kristen Knutson, Ph.D., FAHA, volunteer chair of the statement writing group, volunteer chair-elect of the Association's Sleep Science Committee and associate professor of neurology, Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago

Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-hour cycles in physiological processes that regulate key functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, metabolism and hormone secretion such as cortisol, important for stress response and metabolism. The statement defines circadian health as the optimal function, rhythmical character and alignment of the circadian system with the light–dark cycle. The circadian system is synchronized primarily though light detected by the retina in the eye and transmitted to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (special neurons in the brain's hypothalamus region). Inside these neurons and throughout the body are special genes and proteins (like CLOCK, BMAL1, PER and CRY) that help generate rhythmic activity. They turn on and off in a regular cycle, creating the rhythm of the body's internal clock.

The timing of when an individual sleeps, eats and engages in physical activity are among the behaviors that can influence this alignment. Circadian disruption can occur if a person's internal body clock does not align with their behavior. For example, if an evening person must wake earlier than their body clock expects, perhaps on an overseas trip or for an early morning job, they will be awake during their biologic night, which could disrupt circadian rhythms.

Knutson, who specializes in sleep and circadian research specifically focused on associations with cardiometabolic and cognitive health, noted, "Although circadian rhythms play an important role in keeping us healthy, they are often overlooked in everyday medical care. It's important to realize what these disruptions can do to our body and how to lessen any impact."

Currently, researchers can only measure circadian rhythms accurately in small, highly controlled lab settings. In everyday health care, doctors often rely on simple clues, such as what time a person says they go to bed, which aren't always precise. New technologies may soon make it easier. Tools like wearable devices, advanced lab tests and artificial intelligence could help track patterns in things like skin temperature and heart rate over 24 hours, giving a clearer picture of an individual's natural body clock rhythm.

"Everyone has an internal clock, and it's time we start listening to it," Knutson said. "Simple changes, like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, eating meals earlier and getting morning sunlight, may make a meaningful difference in your heart and metabolic health. We still need more research to establish causality and understand how and why circadian rhythms affect health. Ideally, such research may help scientists figure out the best times for healthy habits like sleeping, exercising and eating, and create personalized strategies that match people's natural body clocks."

Every day, 17 Americans die while waiting for an organ transplant. Opt-out organ donation policies, which enroll everyone into post-mortem donation programs by default unless people choose to opt out, have been touted as a way to increase the supply of desperately needed organs. But opt-out organ donation policies may reduce living organ donations, leaving systems no better supplied with lifesaving organs.

Pascal Güntürkün and colleagues analyzed epidemiological data from 24 countries between 2000–2023 and conducted four experimental studies with over 5,000 participants to examine how switching from opt-in to opt-out organ donation policies affects both deceased and living donor rates. The authors found that while opt-out policies led to a non-significant increase in deceased donors of 1.21 people per million population, the policies significantly decreased living donors by 4.59 people per million population-a 29% reduction.

Through experimental and comparisons between Germany (opt-in) and Austria (opt-out), the authors demonstrated that this crowding-out effect primarily affects so-called "altruistic donations" to acquaintances and strangers, rather than donations to family members. People living in countries with opt-out systems perceive organ supply as sufficient, and are consequently less willing to become living donors. According to the authors, the findings reveal the unintended consequences of a public policy nudge and suggest that policymakers should consider potential crowding-out effects when implementing opt-out organ donation systems.

Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance between a target and the sensor using high-frequency sound waves that are inaudible to humans. The process is simple: the sensor emits ultrasonic waves, which reflect off the target and return to the sensor. By calculating the time it takes for the waves to return, the device determines the distance.

Beyond distance measurement, ultrasonic fluid level sensors can also be adapted for other applications such as monitoring depth, temperature, velocity, pressure, and acceleration. In these cases, the emitted waves are detected and interpreted by the appropriate type of sensor.

Due to their small size and low power consumption, ultrasonic level sensors are widely used in different industrial use cases. They are predominantly utilized in the machinery, medical, aerospace, agriculture, security, and automotive industries.

Ultrasonic sensors are important for automating the factory floor. The sensor is utilized to figure out an object's position by transmitting ultrasonic waves to identify objects within a detection zone.

Ultrasonic sensors are placed at different points to make sure there are no blind spots. They are also utilized for sorting items, high-speed counting, robotic machine sensing, and liquid level controls.

The need for efficient and precise tracking of materials and items is growing. The supply chain and warehousing industry uses ultrasonic sensors for counting, sorting items, high-speed counting, robotic machine sensing, and liquid level controls.

Ultrasonic sensors quantify the pieces per second as they pass along a conveyor line or via a port. They may be utilized for sorting and classifying objects and keeping track of a conveyor line's flow rate. Ultrasonic level sensors oversee levels in storage tanks or bins. Using an array sensor, various ultrasonic sensors enable automatic control of bin levels without opening bins' tops or doors.

Ultrasonic level sensors are also utilized for waste management and recycling programs. For waste management, they monitor levels in dumpsters, compactors, and trash trucks to ensure the proper amounts are being disposed of.

Ultrasonic sensors are especially useful for compacted trash, as users do not need to open the truck or bin to know whether it is full.

Ultrasonic liquid level sensors examine liquid levels in storage tanks or silos, typically externally mounted. The ultrasonic device transmits a sound wave into the liquid and then tracks how long it takes for the echo to come back. This time is utilized to calculate the liquid level. The Ultrasonic Liquid Level Meter gives users a reliable leak detection solution by utilizing these devices to detect leaks

Introtek has produced non-invasive ultrasonic air bubble detectors, continuous liquid level sensors, optical blood component detectors, and now pressure occlusion detectors. Introtek sensors utilize a patented pulse-type ultrasonic technology that detects air bubbles, air-in-line, and liquid levels with the highest degree of accuracy and reliability, thereby maintaining an extremely high MTBF. Introtek sensors are not susceptible to the limitations exhibited by continuous wave, capacitive, or load-cell sensors.

Cancer immunotherapy, especially using T cells, is showing a lot of promise in treating blood cancers. Bioengineered T cells, especially those equipped with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR-T cells), have revolutionized cancer treatment. But while they've delivered impressive results against certain blood cancers, they've struggled to make an impact in solid tumors, such as those in the breast, lung, and prostate.

A major problem is the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a mix of cells and molecules that can dampen immune responses. In most solid tumors, inhibitory signals dominate while helpful ones (that tell T cells to keep going) are weak or entirely absent. Since engineered T cells rely on these environmental cues to stay active and functional, they often fall short. This has led scientists to explore ways of building extra receptors into the T cells, so they can pick up tumor-specific signals and respond with added strength.

Researchers have tried to create receptors that can sense and react to the TME, but designing them has been difficult because building custom signaling proteins is a complex endeavor. Meanwhile, most current methods for doing so rely heavily on trial-and-error, which eventually makes it hard to control how these synthetic receptors will eventually behave when deployed against a tumor.

Now, a team led by Patrick Barth at EPFL and Caroline Arber at UNIL-CHUV has developed a computational platform for designing synthetic protein receptors from scratch. These receptors, called T-SenSERs (tumor microenvironment-sensing switch receptors), are engineered to detect soluble signals found in tumors and convert them into co-stimulatory or cytokine-like signals that boost T cell activity. When combined with conventional CAR-T cells, the synthetic receptors enhanced their anti-tumor effects in models of lung cancer and multiple myeloma.

The study is published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

The computational platform can put together artificial receptors by designing and combining different protein domains, like building with molecular Legos. Each receptor includes an external domain that binds a tumor-associated signal, a middle region that transmits that signal across the cell membrane, and an internal domain that activates useful functions inside the T cell.

What sets this approach apart from current protein design approaches is that it doesn't treat proteins as rigid structures. Instead, it models them as dynamic, shape-shifting machines-allowing researchers to see, for the first time, how signals travel through these synthetic receptors to control cell behavior."

Patrick Barth at EPFL 

Using the platform, the team created two families of T-SenSERs: one that responds to VEGF, a protein that promotes blood vessel growth and is common in tumors, and another that responds to CSF1, a protein that negatively influences the behavior of immune cells in tumors. They designed 18 versions and selected the best-performing ones based on simulations and lab tests.

When tested, T cells equipped with both a CAR and a T-SenSER responded more strongly to tumors than CAR-T cells alone and showed ligand-specific activities faithfully reflecting the signaling programs encoded by the design method.

The VEGF-sensing version (called VMR) only activated the T cell when VEGF was present, while the CSF1-sensing version (CMR) provided a small baseline boost even without CSF1, but ramped up its effect in the presence of the ligand. In mouse models of lung cancer and myeloma, T cells with these synthetic receptors showed improved tumor control and longer survival.

Importantly, the team found that their design method allowed them to fine-tune the receptors' behavior, choosing whether it should be always-on, ligand-dependent, or somewhere in between.

"This study represents the first demonstration of the computational design of single-pass, multi-domain receptors with programmable signaling functions and paves the way for the accelerated development of synthetic biosensors with custom-built sensing and response capabilities for basic and translational cell engineering applications," says Barth.

An international clinical study led by the Medical University of Vienna shows that the drug patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) can have a promising effect in patients with active brain metastases of various tumor types. Patients with advanced disease benefited from treatment in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and metastatic breast cancer, as shown in two simultaneous publications in The Lancet Oncology.

The study was conducted at centres in Austria and Spain, including the Clinical Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna. The investigations focused on the antibody-drug conjugate patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), which binds specifically to the cell surface protein HER3. Brain metastases are a common and difficult-to-treat problem in advanced cancer. Around one-third of patients with NSCLC and a significant proportion of patients with metastatic breast cancer develop metastases in the brain during the course of their disease. Existing treatment options are limited, especially when metastases progress after prior local treatment. Previous research by the Department of Oncology has already indicated that HER3 is particularly frequently expressed in brain metastases. This observation suggests that HER3 could be a promising therapeutic target.

In cohort 1 of the TUXEDO-3 study, 21 patients with metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases were treated. Regardless of tumor subtype (hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, triple-negative), 23.8% achieved a response in the brain. Side effects were mostly manageable; serious adverse events occurred in 28.6% of patients, with no treatment-related deaths.

In about a quarter of patients with metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases, HER3-DXd showed clear signs of activity in the brain. These were heavily pretreated patients, many of whom had no remaining effective treatment options  -  so a response rate of around 25% is a notable achievement. Just as important is the ability to maintain, or even improve, quality of life during therapy."

Rupert Bartsch, lead author, oncologist at the Clinical Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna

Cohort 2 of the TUXEDO-3 study investigated the efficacy of HER3-DXd in 20 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and active brain metastases. An objective intracranial response was observed in six patients (30%), thereby meeting the predefined study endpoint. Remarkably, responses also occurred in patients without oncogenic driver mutations, suggesting that HER3-targeted antibody-drug conjugates may have broader therapeutic applicability beyond molecularly defined subgroups. According to Thorsten Füreder, first author of the publication and oncologist at the Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I at the Medical University of Vienna and University Hospital Vienna, the study represents a significant step forward: "In TUXEDO-3, we evaluated for the first time the efficacy of a HER3-directed antibody-drug conjugate specifically in patients with advanced brain metastases from lung cancer. The observed intracranial responses constitute a meaningful advance for this particularly hard-to-treat population."

"Both studies provide initial prospective evidence that HER3-DXd could be a novel, targeted treatment option for patients with brain metastases of lung and breast cancer," explains study leader Matthias Preusser, Head of the Clinical Division of Oncology at the Department of Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna. "Our results suggest that HER3-DXd may be a potential treatment option not only for genetically defined subgroups, but also for broader patient groups with active brain metastases from breast and lung cancer."HER3-DXd is not yet approved. Further larger studies are needed to confirm its clinical benefit.

A new report from the SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute (SDGHI), supported by the Octava Foundation, has mapped Singapore's programs supporting children's mental health.

The study, Children's Mental Health and Wellbeing in Singapore: A Landscape Brief, reviewed 43 programs across public, private and civil society providers. While it found a vibrant ecosystem committed to accessibility and inclusion, with strong momentum and promising initiatives, the report also noted some areas to strengthen, including fragmentation, workforce gaps, and a lack of sustainable funding. Mental health disorders currently account for 28.2% of the disease burden among children, adolescents, and young adults.

The report identifies a dynamic and committed landscape of mental health support for children in Singapore. The mapping of 43 programs reveals a strong foundation, with many initiatives effectively combining promotion, prevention, and literacy, and being deeply embedded within schools and communities. Building on this, the study points to an opportunity to enhance coordination and create more seamless support pathways between these valuable services:

The following highlight some of the key recommendations to strengthen funding, capacity, coordination, and child-centred practice across Singapore's children's mental health ecosystem; further recommendations are detailed in the full report.

Reflecting on the report's findings, the authors and their partners emphasise that turning these insights into lasting impact will require a whole-of-society effort:

"Overcoming hurdles like stigma and limited access requires a unified, collaborative effort," said Professor Anne-Claire Stona, lead of the Global Mental Health Program at SDGHI. "This report provides a data-driven roadmap for our partners to strengthen Singapore's children's mental health ecosystem and ensure every child can flourish."

Raman Sidhu, CEO of Octava Foundation, noted: "This landscape map shows strong intent in Singapore to secure the mental wellbeing of our children and young people - even as sustained funding and delivery capacity are still developing. Strong mental wellbeing foundations are built in childhood. We need sustained investment in prevention and promotion efforts, alongside capacity-building for locally designed, evidence-informed solutions. At Octava Foundation, we are committed to supporting preventive and promotive approaches that strengthen mental wellbeing through the formative years."

The study used a mixed-methods approach: a semi-structured survey mapping 43 programs; 32 in-depth interviews with programme leads and practitioners; and a validation workshop with 47 stakeholders across public, private and non-profit sectors. The work aligns with the WHO–UNICEF Service Guidance on the Mental Health of Children and Young People (2024) and Singapore's National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy (2023).

Medical educators and health professionals warn that new federal student loan caps in President Donald Trump's tax cut law could make it more expensive for many people to become doctors and could exacerbate physician shortages nationwide.

And, they warn, the economic burden will steer many medical students to lucrative specialties in more affluent, urban areas rather than lower-paying primary care jobs in underserved and rural communities, where doctors are in shortest supply.

"The growing financial barriers may deter some individuals from pursuing a career in medicine, particularly those from low-income backgrounds," said Deena McRae, a psychiatrist and associate vice president for academic health sciences at University of California Health.

The new federal loan limits, which are enshrined in the GOP legislation signed by Trump on July 4, cap the amount professional degree students can borrow at $50,000 a year, up to a maximum of $200,000 — well below the average cost of a four-year medical school education.

For students who graduated this year with an MD degree from a four-year medical school in the United States, the median cost of attendance was $318,825, according to Kristen Earle, director of student financial services at the Association of American Medical Colleges. And for those who entered a U.S. medical school in the 2024-25 academic year, the median first-year cost was $83,700.

Health care experts and politicians on both sides of the aisle agree that medical schools must find ways to lower their costs, but critics of the loan caps say limiting federal lending isn't the answer. Congressional Republicans, who voted for the caps, say they are intended to stem a sharp rise in federal student lending over the past two decades that has driven the cost of attendance higher.

"Uncapped loan limits gave no incentives for schools to reduce any of their costs, recognizing that taxpayers, students, or students' families would eventually foot the bill," said Sara Robertson, a spokesperson for the GOP-controlled House Committee on Education and Workforce. "Our reforms and loan limits will put downward pressure on costs to provide better outcomes and lower debt for all students."

The budget law brings back caps for graduate and professional education that Congress eliminated in 2006. Since then, students have been able to get federal loans that cover the total cost of their degree programs. Reimposing the caps, along with other changes to federal student loans, is expected to save the federal government $349 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Whether the new federal loan policy will push down tuition costs remains to be seen.

Robertson pointed to a 2023 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research showing that the more generous federal lending policy since 2006 has led to "significantly higher program prices" in graduate education. The study also found that the additional federal support failed to increase enrollment in graduate programs, including for underrepresented students.

However, data provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges shows that cost-of-living increases, not tuition, drove up the expense of studying medicine in recent years.

Students already in medical school who have taken out federal loans before the new rules take effect on July 1 will be exempted from the cap. But students whose loans are capped under the new law will need to make up the difference, in many cases by taking out private sector loans, which typically have less flexible repayment terms and require a strong credit rating — a heavy lift for students from low-income communities.

Robertson cited a 2017 analysis showing that nearly 60% of graduate students could have obtained a private loan at a lower interest rate than any available federal loan. Federal loans, however, come with advantages that private loans don't. For instance, federal loans can include monthly repayments calibrated to income, and they offer two debt forgiveness paths, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which erases the balance for those who work in a government or nonprofit organization and make their monthly payments for 10 years.

Critics and proponents agree on at least one thing: Now is the time for medical schools to think creatively about lowering costs for students. This might include reduced tuition, more chances for debt forgiveness, and accelerated programs that allow students to graduate in three years rather than four, reducing costs by 25% and getting them more quickly into paid jobs.

"I hope that coming out of this, medical schools and others find a way to seize the moment and help us figure out how to reduce the total cost of medical school," said Martha Santana-Chin, CEO of L.A. Care. "Maybe this is an opportunity for us to rethink how the system is working."

Roughly a fifth of medical schools offering an MD degree have accelerated programs, including the University of California-Davis, according to the Consortium of Accelerated Medical Pathway Programs.

A data analysis of eight medical schools led by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, whose core MD curriculum is three years, shows that students in three-year programs derive a lifetime financial gain totaling over $240,000 due to the cost savings of less time in medical school, interest not paid on the corresponding amount not borrowed, and faster progression to a salaried position.

In addition to lowering costs, accelerated medical programs seek to address health care workforce shortages by training physicians more quickly. And with the new loan caps about to make it more difficult for many students to finance their medical education, these programs suddenly have a new timeliness.

Students who spend three years in medical school instead of four have lower debt and get to a higher salary sooner, said Caroline Roberts, a family physician and director of rural education at the University of North Carolina's School of Medicine. UNC offers a three-year track for students who want to be primary care doctors and work in rural areas of the state, where doctor shortages are a major problem.

Zoe Priddy, who is in her second year of UNC's three-year program, said that if the federal loan limits had been in place at the time she was making plans to attend medical school, she would have needed a job that paid better than the research lab where she worked after completing her undergraduate degree.

"I would have had to change my trajectory if I still wanted to pursue medicine, and I don't know if it would have been possible for me," Priddy said. However, the lower debt associated with the three-year track "eased my decision" to go into pediatrics, a lower-paying specialty, she said.

In April, Thomas Sanford, a medical student who regularly listens to "An Arm and a Leg," set out to create a resource he could easily share with patients to help them deal with unaffordable medical bills.

In this mini-episode, host Dan Weissmann talks with Sanford about how handing out charity care information on tiny cards snowballed into an ever-growing list of resources to erase medical debt. They discuss the inspiration behind his project, the role "An Arm and a Leg" listeners played in building it, and how others can contribute. 

Dan Weissmann  @danweissmann Host and producer of "An Arm and a Leg." Previously, Dan was a staff reporter for Marketplace and Chicago's WBEZ. His work also appears on All Things Considered, Marketplace, the BBC, 99 Percent Invisible, and Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting.

Note: "An Arm and a Leg" uses speech-recognition software to generate transcripts, which may contain errors. Please use the transcript as a tool but check the corresponding audio before quoting the podcast.

Dan: Hey there. So here's a story — a project — that's given me more encouragement than anything I can think of lately. It's driven by you- by listeners to this show.

One of my big dreams for An Arm and a Leg, from almost the beginning, has been to connect people, to help folks learn to help each other. 

And I think I'm seeing the beginnings of a win. 

It started with one listener, trying to do what he could for people right around him. He asked us for advice, we asked folks who get our First Aid Kit newsletter to pitch in. 

And now, with that help, our original listener has started creating a tool I think can ultimately help a LOT of people help each other. 

It seems like the start of a virtuous cycle. And you can help keep it going, and growing.

OK, here's the story — so far: 

Thomas Sanford goes to medical school in Brooklyn. He says he's listened to this show for years, but some of the things we talk about here got more vivid for him last fall, as he started his third year.

Thomas Sanford: …where I go out of the classroom and I start spending my days in the hospital interacting with patients and and appreciating that for especially folks in my area — which is one of the poorest parts of Brooklyn- that can be a financial death sentence. It will ruin you in debt that you cannot get out of. And I listened to your episode about Dollar For, the nonprofit that helps people apply for charity care. 

Dan: We've talked about Dollar For a lot over the last few years. Their founder, Jared Walker, has helped a lot of people, including me, understand how powerful hospital charity care can be. 

A few months ago, Jared's small organization hit a big milestone: 

Eliminating more than 100 million dollars in hospital bills, over just a few years.

Jared Walker: And we have been able to do that without charging a single dollar to patients.

Dan: That's Jared, in a video he posted over the summer to mark the occasion.

Jared Walker: We're a nonprofit. We help people eliminate hospital bills, mostly by enforcing hospital financial assistance policies,. These programs reduce or eliminate hospital bills for people within certain income requirements. The problem is, is they don't tell you. So we do.

Dan: Now, working in a hospital himself, Thomas Sanford decided to help spread the word.

He wrote to the folks at Dollar For, and they sent him a PDF for a "touch card" — it's like the size of a business card. 

It says, "Struggling with hospital bills? Most hospitals offer bill forgiveness programs. On average, a family of four, earning less than 100 thousand dollars a year will qualify. Dollar For can help - for free."

And then, there's a web address in big type, and a QR code to scan — and on the back of the card, the whole thing in Spanish.

Thomas Sanford: And I just went and printed out a thousand of them, started handing 'em out to residents and giving them to patients.

Dan: Handing them out to other residents, so they could pass cards to their own patients. 

Thomas says he also left boxes of cards in the break room, so residents could grab as many as they wanted. And then he went to other local hospitals to distribute the cards in bulk.

Thomas Sanford: A lot of little hospitals or community clinics that have like little like business card holders, on the counter in the waiting room, and I just bring a stack and just dump them in.

Dan: And all of this is already extremely cool. And then, Thomas did something else: He wrote to us — to tell us about what he was doing, and to ask for help.

Because over the course of months,as he'd been passing out these cards, Thomas had found: Charity care didn't necessarily cover everybody's needs — like paying for prescription drugs. 

Thomas Sanford: And just very frankly, I was busy doing the whole medicine thing, trying to take care of people, and I wish I had the time to sit with them and, you know, search for what would help them specifically, and I just didn't. So I was looking for, really hoping for, very selfishly, a resource where I could just say, here's your one-stop shop. It'll almost certainly cover what you need. I hope this helps.

Dan: He wrote to us, to ask if we knew of anything good. And honestly we didn't.

So we asked you for help. In our First Aid Kit newsletter, we told Thomas's story, we added a link to that PDF from Dollar For — because that seemed worth passing around — and we did two more things:

First, we made our own first draft — basically, an annotated list of the resources we would put on a one-page handout.

And second, we asked: Help! What are we missing here? Including: Has anybody actually already made a version of this?

And: You wrote back! 

As it turned out, a couple of you had worked on some great online projects. One was from the nonprofit PIRG — another group I've learned a ton from over the years. And the other was actually created by the federal government. 

And, they were great! We wrote about them in First Aid Kit, with links. Other folks had tipped us off to resources that hadn't been on our original lists — we added those..

And THOMAS took all of that and ran with it. Meaning: He started printing up a rough draft to hand out.

Thomas Sanford: I keep a little stack of them in my backpack, as it's become somewhat complete and vaguely presentable, and at times I've just be like, hold on, leave, come back and be like, here you go.

Dan: And he says: It worked. He told me about this especially dramatic example.

Thomas Sanford: I was in the emergency department and someone come in having a heart attack — very serious. This could kill you. And their only concern when they got there is, what is this going to cost me? And it's a difficult time to be having that conversation, but being able to say, look, here's a crummy first draft of something I've been working on. I hope this gives you a little relief, but please, right now, let me focus on what's a little more important, which is keeping you alive 

Dan: Recently Thomas wrote to us AGAIN, to say: Here's the vaguely-presentable version I've been handing out. Can I get more help making it better?

We went back to you — published Thomas's draft in First Aid Kit, asked if anybody could pitch in, created a sign-up form.

And you've been pitching in! Thomas says he's added more resources, and he's gotten help making things more presentable.

Thomas Sanford: Just little type things about, you know, me not having to use a period correctly. Big things like maybe you name this document a little more correctly.

Call it help with your medical expenses.

Dan: He's just shared the most recent version with us, and he says he could still use more help. 

Thomas Sanford: If you know how to copy edit, and you can take my terrible descriptions and make them great. If you know graphic design and can make my, very basic, PDF into something that's a little more presentable, that would be amazing. Also, if you want to make a version of this, you customize for your own hospitals. instead of a link for dollar four, put in a link to your hospital's charity care policy. 

Dan: This is actually one of the coolest things. Thomas is using what's called a "Creative Commons" license. That basically means anybody can take it, make copies of it, make variations on it. 

Thomas Sanford: You can make your own version of it. You don't need my permission. You can do whatever you want with it. The only thing you have to do is share it under the same license and share it freely

Dan: And give credit to the original creator, so people know where it started. But Thomas wants people to make it their own.

Thomas Sanford: I think that that's really the ideal: when people start taking it, just make their own version, put it out there and it sort of just evolves on its own, becomes the best thing it can be.

Dan: So, I hope you can see why I'm so excited about this project. I think it's got incredible potential. I'm inviting you to pitch in, however you want, and however you can. 

?And at Thomas's suggestion: We're posting a PDF of the current version. Print it out, make copies, tell us how you're using them. 

We're also posting a google doc that ANYONE can comment on. 

And we're posting that sign-up form again, so you can volunteer to pitch in. Designers, editors, experts — translators.

And especially: if anyone has a talent for organizing groups of volunteers on a project like this, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. That would be truly amazing. 

You'll find these links wherever you're listening 

And the place where we're really gonna keep digging in on this project is where it started — in our First Aid Kit newsletter. I'd love for you to sign up. The place for that is www dot arm and a leg show dot com, slash, first aid kit.

Metagenomics is the study of all organisms present in a particular environment, such as soil, water, or the human body. A key part of metagenomic analysis is understanding what species are present (classification), how much of each there is (abundance), and the function of the microorganisms present.

Real-time metagenomics - the immediate analysis of data while sequencing is in progress - holds the potential to speed up the detection, monitoring, and response to microbial threats in a multitude of settings, including agricultural, environmental, and biosecurity.

However, one of the key barriers to realizing the full potential of real-time metagenomics is the lack of flexibility in current tools available, increasing the time it takes for sample analysis to be returned to the site of application. 

MARTi, published today in Genome Research, is an open-source software tool that powers real-time analysis and visualization of metagenomic data. The team have created an accessible interface which increases the usability and accessibility of metagenomic analysis.

Dr Ned Peel, first-author and postdoctoral research scientist at the Earlham Institute said: "It's operationally very lightweight, you can use it in-field for taxonomic classification on a standard laptop, or undertake larger, complex analysis using high-performance computing."

One of the key impacts of MARTi is the immediacy of analysis results - it could be very useful in situations where a quick identification is essential."

Dr. Ned Peel, Study First-Author and Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Earlham Institute

In clinical environments this could allow clinicians to rapidly speed up the identification and targeted treatments of pathogen infection.

Dr Richard Leggett, Group Leader and author said: "MARTi has its origins in software we developed for really rapid identification of pathogens in preterm infants, but we've since adapted it to use in a wide range of settings including on board research vessels in the antarctic, in agriculture, and in biosurveillance and security.

"MARTi is now our first line analysis tool for any metagenomic project and we're using MARTi in several current collaborations. Through testing both simulated and real data we have demonstrated the robustness of results."

The in-field analysis MARTi provides underpins the group's work sequencing the air for pathogen threats.

AirSeq - a technology developed by the Earlham Institute and the Natural History Museum, London, takes in samples of air and extracts and purifies the tiny amounts of DNA present. This is then sequenced and analyzed using the MARTi software. 

"One end-goal in agricultural settings would be to have a box in a farmer's field that could continually sample the air, analyzing the data onboard with MARTi and then providing the farmer with an alert in real time." added Richard.

MARTi has two components: the MARTi Engine, which analyses the sequencing data and can be installed on either a local machine, such as a desktop or laptop, or a high-performance compute (HPC) system; and the MARTi GUI (graphical user interface), a web-based tool allowing users to view and compare results, as well as generate graphs and figures for scientific publications and presentations. 

MARTi is highly customizable and users can tune parameters and databases to the needs of their particular research. "We've created a user-friendly tool that should be flexible, customizable, and easy to install," added Ned. 

At the Earlham Institute we are passionate about developing, adapting, and applying the latest technologies to answer complex biological questions. From new workflows and bespoke software, Earlham Institute scientists are constantly creating and refining technological methods in order to maintain the pace of discovery.

An international study led by experts at the University of Sydney and the Universidad Europea in Spain has found that longer periods of continuous walking are more beneficial to cardiovascular health than walking the same number of steps in shorter, more sporadic bouts. 

The study published in the Annals of International Medicine analyzed the impact of walking on the health of physically inactive people. 

The results showed that among those who took fewer than 8000 steps per day, those who accumulate most of their steps across one or two walks lasting at least 10-15 minutes or longer have a lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack or stroke) compared to those who take their steps in very short bouts of less than five minutes. 

Co-lead author Dr Matthew Ahmadi, Deputy Director of the Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub and member of the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney said: "For the most inactive people, switching from brief walks here and there to longer continuous walks may come with some health benefits. 

There is a perception that health professionals have recommended walking 10,000 steps a day is the goal, but this isn't necessary. Simply adding one or two longer walks per day, each lasting at least 10-15 minutes at a comfortable but steady pace, may have significant benefits – especially for people who don't walk much."

Dr. Matthew Ahmadi, Deputy Director, Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub 

The study analyzed 33,560 adults aged between 40-79 years who walked less than 8000 steps a day and had no cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. 

Participants wore a research wristband for a week which measured not only how many steps they took but also how their step count was accumulated. Following the participants' health outcomes over the course of an average of eight years, the researchers found: 

People who walked continuously for 10-15 minutes per day had a 4 percent chance of having a cardiovascular related event such as heart attack or stroke. Meanwhile those who walked continuously for only 5 minutes a day had a 13 percent risk of having a cardiovascular incident. 

The health benefits of continuous bouts of walking were most pronounced among the least active, for example those who walked 5000 steps a day or less. Among this group, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease halved from 15 percent for those who walked up to 5 minutes a day, to 7 percent for those who walked up to 15 minutes a day. 

Among the most sedentary group (5000 steps a day or less) the risk of death dropped from 5 percent for those who walked in 5 minutes stretches during the day, to less than 1 percent for those who walked up to 15 minutes a day. 

Senior author Professor Emmanuel Stamatakis, Director of the Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub and physical activity theme leader at the Charles Perkins Centre said: "We tend to place all the emphasis on the number of steps or the total amount of walking but neglect the crucial role of patterns, for example 'how' walking is done. 

"This study shows that even people who are very physically inactive can maximize their heart health benefit by tweaking their walking patterns to walk for longer at a time, ideally for at least 10-15 minutes, when possible." 

Co-lead author Dr Borja del Pozo from the Universidad Europea said: "Our research shows that simple changes can make all the difference to your health. If you walk a little, set aside some time to walk more often and in longer sessions. Such small changes can have a big impact."

Women living in parts of the United States with lower air quality, especially neighborhoods with heavy emissions from motor vehicles, are more likely to develop breast cancer, according to a multiyear analysis involving more than 400,000 women and 28,000 breast cancer cases.

The research, which included Veronica Irvin of the Oregon State University College of Health, was published in the American Journal of Public Health.

The project combined data from five large breast cancer studies conducted over multiple decades that tracked individuals even as they changed addresses and followed them for as long as 10 years prior to their diagnosis. The researchers overlaid outdoor air quality information from more than 2,600 monitors to look for an association between air pollution and breast cancer.

The scientists found that a 10-parts-per-billion increase in nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the air equated to a 3% increase in overall breast cancer incidence; nitrogen dioxide is a proxy for pollution from car traffic, Irvin said, and based on the estimated 316,950 cases of female breast cancer expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year, a 3% reduction would mean 9,500 fewer cases.

Irvin and collaborators also found that a 5-microgram-per-cubic-meter rise in the concentration of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, was associated with a higher incidence of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. Cancer cells lacking receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone are generally harder to treat and more deadly.

"It's often not realistic for people to leave their homes and relocate in areas with better air quality in search of less health risk, so we need more effective clean air laws to help those who are most in need," said Irvin, noting that the average nitrogen dioxide concentrations observed in the research were below current Environmental Protection Agency guidelines.

We also need policies that help to reduce car traffic and promote alternative forms of transportation."

Veronica Irvin, College of Health, Oregon State University

The incidence of breast cancer in the United States, where air pollution levels are lower than they are in other populous countries, has been generally on the rise over the past 40 years, the researchers note. It's the second leading cause of cancer death among women, after lung cancer. About one woman in eight in the U.S. will develop breast cancer during her lifetime, and the nation's population includes more than 4 million breast cancer survivors.

Alexandra White of the National Institutes of Health led the study, which also included scientists from Harvard University; the University of Washington; Indiana University; Stony Brook University, the University of California San Diego, La Jolla; The Ohio State University; and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

The NIH, the EPA, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institute of Aging, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute supported the research.

Irvin is the Celia Strickland Austin and G. Kenneth Austin III Endowed Professor in Public Health in the OSU College of Health, which will host a free online panel discussion, "Our Health & Breast Cancer," at noon Pacific time on Thursday, Oct. 30. Irvin will be one of the panelists for the discussion, which will look at screening and survivorship, early detection, research, and support and mentorship for those affected by breast cancer.

A global research team has pinpointed the enzyme fueling hydrogen production in healthy guts and shown how its depletion rewires microbial energy networks in Crohn's disease, reshaping our understanding of gut metabolism.



Study: A widespread hydrogenase supports fermentative growth of gut bacteria in healthy people. Image Credit: crystal light / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature Microbiology, an international team of researchers leveraged a multifaceted study combining genomic, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses to identify the primary driver of fermentative molecular hydrogen (H₂) production in healthy individuals. Molecular H₂ cycling is a vital metabolic process in the human gut, but the specific microbes and enzymes responsible for it remain unresolved.

Decades of research have established that the human gut microbiome is a bustling metabolic reactor, comprising trillions of microbes that ferment consumed carbohydrates. This process results in the production of energy, beneficial short-chain fatty acids, and vast quantities of gases, including molecular hydrogen (H₂).

Conventionally considered a simple waste product, more recent research has revealed that molecular H₂ is a crucial food source for other microbes (known as “hydrogenotrophs”), thereby making fermentation thermodynamically more favourable.

Dysbiosis or imbalances in H₂ production and consumption are increasingly associated with serious health issues, from the gas buildup in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to infections and even gastrointestinal cancers. Furthermore, some pathogens, like Salmonella, have been observed to “hijack” molecular H₂ to fuel their invasion of the gut.

Unfortunately, despite its importance, the microbes and specific enzymes involved in H₂ production and metabolism remain unresolved.

The present study aims to address this knowledge gap and inform future research and gastrointestinal interventions by leveraging a multi-pronged approach to elucidate the microbes and enzymes involved in H₂ production from the ecosystem level down to the single enzyme.

The study comprised several sequential steps: First, a large-scale computational analysis of 300 stool metagenomes and 78 metatranscriptomes was carried out to elucidate the full spectrum of hydrogen-related genes present and active in the healthy human gut. These findings were validated using 102 mucosal biopsy-enriched metagenomes from 42 donors. Furthermore, analyses focused on samples from the terminal ileum, caecum, and rectum to confirm consistency across gut regions.

Next, to demonstrate that these genes were functional, the study selected 19 diverse bacterial species from the human gut and grew them under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions to simulate gut conditions. Gas chromatography assays were used to precisely measure the amount of H₂ gas produced by each bacterial isolate over time.

Finally, biochemical assays (on bacterial cell extracts) were carried out to elucidate the link between H₂ production and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) reaction, a core part of fermentation. Specifically, PFOR substrates (pyruvate and CoA) and inhibitors were added to see how H₂ levels responded, supported by AlphaFold2 modelling, heterologous expression, and spectroscopy/EPR evidence that validated the enzyme's ferredoxin-like domain and catalytic function.

Study findings revealed, for the first time, that the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme was, by far, the most dominant hydrogen-producing gene in the healthy human gut. Abundance estimates found that group B genes were on average 0.75 ± 0.25 copies per genome, about 7.5 times more abundant than the group A1 enzyme (0.10 ± 0.09 copies), which was previously thought to be the leading H₂ producer.

Activity assays supported these findings, showing that group B genes were also the most highly transcribed (active) in the metatranscriptome. Unexpectedly, however, activity assays revealed Bacteroides, one of the most common genera in the gut, as a primary user of group B enzymes and thus a major H₂ producer, a previously under-recognized association.

Analyses of the 19 bacterial isolates confirmed these findings, demonstrating that species encoding the group B gene, including seven different Bacteroides isolates, produced high levels of H₂ gas. In contrast, Bacteroides stercoris, a species that naturally lacks any hydrogenase genes, was observed to produce no H₂, consistent with the absence of detectable hydrogenase genes.

Most significantly, comparing healthy individuals to 46 patients with CD revealed that the “healthy” group B hydrogenase was significantly depleted (P = 0.0023) and notably replaced by other enzymes: the group A1 hydrogenase increased 2.8-fold (P = 6.6 × 10⁻⁷), the group 4a formate hydrogenlyase (often found in E. coli) increased 5.2-fold (P = 6.8 × 10⁻⁶), and the group 1d [NiFe]-hydrogenase increased 2.6-fold (P = 3.8 × 10⁻⁵). Genes for respiratory H₂ oxidation, particularly group 1d [NiFe]-hydrogenases, also increased, supporting a restructured hydrogen economy in the inflamed gut of CD patients.

Expression also varied markedly between individuals, and the combined [FeFe] subgroups were not significantly different between CD and control samples, underscoring that these associations are correlative and require further mechanistic study. Respiratory hydrogenotrophs likely dominate gut H₂ consumption, based on gene abundance and transcription data, though activity-level validation is still needed.

The present study refines and consolidates scientific understanding of a fundamental metabolic process in the human gut, identifying the group B [FeFe]-hydrogenase as the primary driver of fermentative H₂ production in healthy individuals and elevating the Bacteroides genus to a key player.

This discovery opens new avenues for understanding, diagnosing, and potentially treating complex inflammatory gut disorders by leveraging interventions targeting the gut microbiome. It also suggests that respiratory hydrogenotrophs are major consumers of H₂, underscoring the complexity of microbial energy flow in the gut ecosystem.

Kansas City got its first look Tuesday at the FIFA 2026 World Cup Fan Fest planned for the grounds of the National World War I Museum and Memorial.

Fan Fest will be situated on the south lawn and built around a 65-foot-tall heart-shaped entrance, opening into an event organizers say will be free and offer activities for the entire family.

Organizers provided details during a press conference on Tuesday. You can watch the full announcement in the video player below.

Fan Fest will feature a main video board measuring 45 feet by 25 feet, with additional screens throughout the festival.

The Liberty Memorial will serve as the backdrop for Fan Fest, with a secondary stage on the east side of the grounds for additional performances.

KC2026 CEO Pam Kramer says the design — created by teams at Kansas City-based Populous — was “intentional about creating a distinctly Kansas City experience.”

Officials plan for the event to operate for at least 18 days during the multi-week World Cup.

Fan Fest will be open during all six matches hosted by Kansas City at Kansas City Stadium (GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium) and will serve as the region's official watch party for at least three matches with the U.S. national team. Organizers plan to announce additional dates in the future.

“This is our time to shine as a region, and I can tell you with confidence that we are ready," Kramer said.

Fan Fest will offer visitors and locals alike a chance to connect with Kansas City-area cuisine, culture, entertainers and people.

The tailgating experience will be front and center, as will lots of shade, misting fans, and a misting tunnel to keep fans cool during the event.

Kansas City will host group-stage matches on June 16, June 19, June 24 and June 27. The city will also host a Round of 32 match on July 3 and a quarterfinal match on July 11. 

We'll learn who will play in the four group-stage matches when the draw is announced in December.

Officials predict the July 11 quarterfinal match will be the biggest sporting event in Kansas City's history.

Volleyball powerhouse Brazil will host both the Women's and Men's FIVB Volleyball Club World Championships 2025, marking the grand finale to an exceptional year of world-class events for volleyball.

From 9-14 December, the Women's Club World Championship returns to São Paulo for the first time in 31 years, bringing together eight powerhouse teams from across the globe competing for club volleyball's ultimate club honour:

Osasco São Cristóvão Saúde (BRA)– host club

Prosecco DOC Imoco Volley Conegliano (ITA)

Savino Del Bene Scandicci (ITA)

Dentil Praia Clube (BRA)

Club Alianza Lima (PER)

Zamalek Sporting Club (EGY)

Zhetysu VC (KAZ)

The line-up for the Women's Club World Championship is nearly complete, with one final club to be announced at a later stage.

The action then moves north to Belém, where the Men's Club World Championship takes over from 16-21 December. Eight of the world's best men's clubs will go head-to-head, including:

Vôlei Renata (BRA) – host club

Sir Sicoma Monini Perugia (ITA)

Aluron CMC Warta Zawiercie (POL)

Sada Cruzeiro (BRA)

Praia Clube (BRA)

Al-Rayyan Sports Club (QAT)

Osaka Bluteon (JPN)

Swehly Sports Club (LBA)

Known for its electric atmosphere and volleyball-mad fans, Brazil is no stranger to hosting the sport's biggest stages, having recently hosted the Men's Club World Championship 2024 in Uberlândia.

FIVB President Fabio Azevedo said: “The Club World Championship is about more than crowning the best clubs in the world – it's about inspiring the next generation of players and fans. By giving fans in Brazil and around the world the chance to witness the top clubs and athletes in action – whether live in the arenas or through global broadcasts – we continue to inspire new generations to connect with our sport.”

Volleyball World CEO Ugo Valensi commented: “Brazil has always been at the heart of volleyball's global story.

It comes just a week before Los Blancos are due to face Liverpool in the Champions League at Anfield, only five months after Alexander-Arnold decided to end a 20-year association with his boyhood team.

by Martina Alcheva October 28, 2025

It's the first midweek round of Serie A action this season, and while Milan travels to Bergamo to face an unbeaten Atalanta, one notable name is missing from the Rossoneri squad sheet. Christian Pulisic, Milan's standout performer so far this season, has been ruled out of the crucial clash.

After a frustrating 2-2 draw against Pisa at San Siro last Friday, Massimiliano Allegri's Rossoneri now find themselves chasing Napoli in the Serie A standings. The trip to the New Balance Arena in Bergamo comes at a delicate moment for the club, which remains unbeaten but has stumbled in recent weeks.

But as the teams prepare for kick-off, fans quickly noticed the absence of one of Milan's most influential players — Christian Pulisic. The American winger, who has been directly involved in eight goals this season (six goals and two assists), was not included in the matchday squad. The American has been a driving force in Milan's early-season resurgence, recently winning Serie A Player of the Month for September.

In fact, Pulisic is sidelined due to a low-grade hamstring injury picked up during the October international window. The setback occurred while the 27-year-old was representing the United States Men's National Team in a friendly match against Australia on October 14 in Colorado. He was forced off the field in the 31st minute after feeling discomfort in his right leg. Milan's medical staff later confirmed that the injury was mild but required careful management.

Head coach Massimiliano Allegri provided an update in his pre-match press conference, ruling out any possibility of Pulisic featuring against Atalanta or Roma in the coming days. “Absolutely not against Roma,” Allegri said when asked about a possible early return. “We hope to have him on the bench against Parma.”

That timeline suggests that Pulisic will miss at least 10 more days of action, sitting out the club's next fixtures against Atalanta and Roma, before potentially returning for the Parma clash on November 8, just before the international break.

According to Milannews.it, Milan is “prioritizing his long-term fitness rather than rushing him back.” The club's medical staff reportedly advised Allegri to give the winger additional recovery time, especially with crucial fixtures ahead — including the Milan derby after the break.

The situation has also created tension between Milan and the U.S. Soccer Federation. Reports in La Gazzetta dello Sport suggest that CEO Giorgio Furlani is in discussions with the American federation to prevent the winger from being called up for the November friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

The reasoning is simple: the matches carry no competitive significance, and the Serie A giant wants to avoid the risk of another transatlantic trip that could delay Pulisic's full recovery. The Rossoneri's stance is that keeping him at Milanello through the break would benefit both club and country in the long run.

If you're planning on visiting the U.S., Canada, or Mexico in June or July 2026, you're going to be timing your visit with the FIFA World Cup. This is one of the biggest sporting events on the planet, and it hasn't been without controversy already. Despite this, these countries are gearing up to host the massive sporting event, with anticipation building fast as fans across the globe prepare for a summer of packed stadiums and celebrations that will transform entire cities into buzzing hubs of soccer fever.

One of the key U.S. cities playing host to the World Cup is Los Angeles. The City of Angels already has a strong soccer presence, due to being home to Angels FC, the women's soccer team backed by numerous A-list celebrities. In fact, Los Angeles is hosting the opening U.S. match, which is a huge deal. So, if you're heading to LA for the World Cup, this guide has everything you need to know.

 If you're planning a trip to Los Angeles for the FIFA World Cup, there are a few things you need to know. You need to know how to get World Cup tickets, what the entry requirements are for the U.S., of course, how to get around the city. Here are all the World Cup travel tips you need.

To get the official FIFA World Cup tickets for 2026, you need to purchase them through the FIFA website. Here you can find tickets and hospitality packages. This is where you should buy World Cup tickets, as there are already touts and scalpers selling them for well over the designated prices. There is an official resale portal with a 15% fee for sellers and buyers; however, you may be able to find cheaper tickets as the initial demand drops.

The tickets are being released in phases to avoid overloading the system, and this is being done on a blend of lottery and first-come, first-served basis. So, which phase you're in is a lottery, but once you get your access, you need to be quick off the draw. This is because, for the first time, the World Cup tickets are subject to dynamic pricing. That means the more demand, the higher the prices go. Prices start at $60, but this is expected to skyrocket. The cheapest price for the U.S. opening match in LA is $560.

Official travel packages are available through FIFA's official hospitality packages, where you can follow your team around the country or see multiple games in one city, complete with hotel options. There are also third-party packages for individual countries, such as Sportsworld for England fans.

In terms of entry rules for 2026 into the U.S., you need to stay on top of any newly announced travel restrictions. While many countries can enter the U.S. for up to 90 days on an ESTA, paying just $21 for 2 years of validity, some will need a more formal tourist visa, which can take months to process.

U.S. World Cup visa procedures have been allocated more capacity by the Trump administration to prevent bottlenecks. However, with the government shutdown, it's unclear how well this will work in practice. ESTAs usually take up to 72 hours to approve, while short-term tourist visas can take several months and may require interviews at your local consulate, so start the process now.

Of course, there are a few countries competing in the FIFA World Cup that are currently on the U.S.'s banned entry list. While teams have been given special dispensation to come and play, the fans still won't be able to fly out to support their teams. In this case, it's worth checking to see if your team will be playing in Canada or Mexico instead.

Arguably, the best time to visit Los Angeles is at the start of summer, in June. This, of course, coincides with the start of the World Cup, and while the peak heat of the city hasn't hit yet, the California summer vibes are in full flow. When building your World Cup travel itinerary, aim to arrive a couple of days before the game to get over any jet lag and get your bearings in the city.

When thinking about how many days for a World Cup trip, it depends on how many games you're going to see. There are just three days in between some of the 8 LA-hosted games, so you can see a couple in one trip. However, if you're seeing one match, opt to arrive at least the day before and then give yourself 3–4 days after match day to soak up the vibe of the city and see all the key sights.

One of the biggest questions when traveling for tournaments is how to get to the World Cup stadiums. Often, these stadiums aren't in the city center, so you may need to use the Los Angeles metro system or find other methods of World Cup transportation. Here's everything you need to know.

Of course, the main way into Los Angeles is through LAX airport. This is by far the busiest airport in the city, with routes all around the world. For a smaller airport experience, you can also fly into:

If you're traveling domestically, you'll likely arrive by train at Los Angeles Union Station. This connects all across the country, so if you want to enjoy a sleeper train experience before heading to the World Cup, traveling by Amtrak is a great experience. You can also usually bring more luggage than you would on the low-fare domestic airlines.

If you're on a budget, FlixBus recently announced that it'll be running services to all the World Cup host cities across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. They're super cheap and convenient, and mean you can travel more sustainably, versus driving yourself.

To get around Los Angeles on a budget, you'll want to take the metro. The Los Angeles Metro system encompasses buses, rail travel, subways, rental bikes, and micros across the region. You can get a Los Angeles Metro card, called a TAP card, at hundreds of locations across the region, as well as from the TAP vending machines. You can preload these cards and tap-and-go across the city.

TAP also has a Los Angeles transport app of the same name, full of public transport tips. You can download this and use it in the same way for ease. This way, you can also connect it directly to your Google Wallet or Apple Pay. If you want to top up with cash, you need to get a physical TAP card and load it up at a vending machine or a physical vendor.

On the whole, you can pay with a card across Los Angeles, as it's a major city. However, it's always worth having some cash for smaller vendors and tips. You can also buy a local SIM card at many bodegas across Los Angeles, or you can opt for an e-SIM from a provider like Airalo.

SoFi Stadium in Inglewood is the main stadium in LA and will play host to the FIFA World Cup games being played in the city. To get to the stadium, the best match transportation option is the metro. You can get the LA Metro C Line (Green) to Hawthorne/Lennox, and then jump on a free game-day shuttle or Metro Micro to the stadium. As SoFi Stadium is the home of the LA Chargers, there are usually game-day shuttles and procedures around the stadium that are expected to be used for the World Cup.

If you're staying in the Inglewood neighborhood, you can also walk to the stadium or use a rental bike. This is a cost-effective and sustainable way to reach the stadium, and means you avoid lengthy queues for the metro on the way out of the stadium. While the World Cup shuttles haven't been announced yet, there's an expectation that LA will put on extra transportation for game days to alleviate traffic.

 Looking for where to stay for the World Cup 2026 in Los Angeles? Whether you're looking for the best hotels near SoFi Stadium or you're seeking out budget accommodation in Los Angeles, this section has you covered.

The best areas to stay in Los Angeles for the World Cup depend on whether you want to be close to the stadium or close to wider attractions. As the stadium is in Inglewood, this would be the closest neighborhood to the World Cup stadium to stay in. However, it's also super close to LAX, so the airport hotels are a great option if you're just flying in for the World Cup.

Culver City is another great option. It's relatively trendy and central, and is still close to the SoFi Stadium, so it ticks a lot of boxes. Alternatively, if you want a quintessential LA experience, stay in Santa Monica or Marina del Rey. These oceanside neighborhoods are still relatively close to the stadium, but have a relaxing vibe with decent nightlife districts.

Neighborhoods like Downtown LA and West Hollywood are both great for nightlife and tourist attractions, but they are pretty far from the stadium, especially on public transport. However, the main fan park for LA's World Cup is going to be in Exposition Park, near the university district and a stone's throw from Downtown.

If you're looking for World Cup hotels or where to book World Cup lodging, this is the section for you. Of course, as soon as you know you have tickets, you should book your accommodation, as prices are already spiraling out of control.

If you're staying near LAX, the 4-star Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport is an excellent option, and it connects directly to the airport, meaning you can take advantage of the new Metro link. For a more budget-friendly option, check out the 3-star TownePlace Suites by Marriott Los Angeles LAX/Hawthorne. This way, you have more space for cooking your own meals, to keep costs low.

For fan accommodations in Marina del Rey with a luxury edge, the Ritz-Carlton is a favorite for a reason. For a 4-star option, check out the Marina del Rey Hotel, with prime positioning and excellent amenities. If you're looking for hostel vibes, check out Samesun Venice Beach for dorm accommodations, right off Venice Beach.

In Santa Monica, the 5-star boutique hotel of choice is Shutters on the Beach, with an incredible spa and ocean views. For a contemporary 4-star hotel on Ocean Avenue, check out the Shore Hotel. On the budget end of things, the HI Los Angeles Santa Monica Hostel is an affordable spot with plenty of shared social areas and a great location near the beach.

Of course, when you're not at the World Cup games, there are plenty of things to do in Los Angeles. Enjoy classic Los Angeles attractions in the downtown area, or check out day trips from LA to spots up and down the Pacific Coast.

There are so many must-see places in Los Angeles, it can be difficult to cram them all into one trip. In terms of Los Angeles sightseeing, there are a few big-hitters that first-timers will probably want to see, including:

For more local experiences, head to Grand Central Market for delicious street food, wander around the Street Art District, or relax on the less-crowded beaches around El Matador. While the tourist attractions are popular for a reason, it's worth getting out of Downtown or Santa Monica for a day to explore more of LA.

It's no secret that LA is a foodie city. As a city that's a melting pot of different cultures, an LA food guide could be never-ending. You'll find local dishes from all around the world here. Make sure you spend some time dining in Koreatown with its flavorful barbecue, grab a few delicious shrimp tacos at Mariscos Jalisco, and get a mountain of mouth-watering seafood delights at Malibu Seafood.

If you're on a budget, head to Grand Central Market, where you can enjoy world-class street food from all around the world in one place. This doubles as a cultural experience for World Cup fans, as you could probably eat your way around the entire draw in Los Angeles!

Some great day trips from Los Angeles, including weekend escapes up and down the Pacific Coast, and to nearby destinations throughout California. From LA, you can reach the Denmark of America, Solvang. This fairytale town has a huge Danish heritage and looks straight out of a Hans Christian Andersen story.

For beautiful island vibes, jump on the one-hour ferry from the mainland to Santa Catalina Island. With incredible trails, watersports, beaches, and even ziplines, it's an incredible day trip from LA. If you prefer more mountainous day trips, head to Big Bear Lake. It's surrounded by the San Bernardino National Forest and is an outdoor-lover's heaven.

If you love desert vibes and architecture, you need to check out Palm Springs. It's only a short distance from Los Angeles, and it's a place like no other. Known for its mid-century architecture and laid-back vibes, it's a perfect antidote to the hectic pace of downtown LA.

The Los Angeles World Cup venue for 2026 is the SoFi Stadium, otherwise known as the Los Angeles Stadium. Usually, it's home to the Los Angeles Rams and the LA Chargers, who both play in the NFL. So, let's go through some SoFi Stadium facts, as part of our World Cup stadium guide.

As one of the newer stadiums being used for the World Cup, the SoFi Stadium is also one of the biggest out of all the host cities. This is part of the reason why it's hosting the opening U.S. game. With over 70,000 seats, it's a cathedral for sporting events and headlining concerts. Other World Cup venues in LA include Exposition Park, which will host the official Fan Park.

If you're looking for fan experience tips for attending a World Cup match, you need to pay attention to any announcements coming out of the LA World Cup committee. This will include events happening around the city, including shuttles to the stadium, and what's going on in the Fan Park in Exposition Park.

If you're trying to figure out what to bring to the World Cup, think about the temperature of LA in June and July. Bring breathable layers and an empty water bottle to stay hydrated. You'll also want to bring plenty of clothes in your team colors. For stadium entry tips, sign up for alerts from SoFi Stadium and read any emails from your ticket provider carefully. These will tell you what you can and can't bring into the stadium, including soft drinks, the maximum size of your bag, whether you can bring flags with flagpoles, and more.

The big question is, how much does it cost to attend the World Cup? Well, it's not cheap. Any World Cup trip cost is going to be a premium experience, even if you're going for budget accommodation and the lowest tier of ticket. The cheapest ticket for an LA group match is $60; however, due to dynamic pricing and multi-tier ticket structures, the average ticket price for a group game in LA is $615.50. This is heavily weighted with the opening U.S. game, which has a starting price of over $500.

Los Angeles is also a notoriously expensive city for accommodation. In terms of World Cup budget tips, it's worth trying to stay in a slightly cheaper hotel or hostel, especially if you're going to be out exploring the city, rather than having a resort-style trip. For meals and public transportation, you can eat and get around LA relatively cheaply if you research routes and budget dining spots in advance. However, in the stadium and in downtown LA, expect food and drink to be expensive.

As with any major city, you need to keep your wits about you when it comes to travel safety in Los Angeles. While World Cup fan safety is going to be a priority during the event, you still need to be aware of your surroundings, especially in neighborhoods you're unfamiliar with, or if you're traveling around after dark.

Try to explore in a group, either with friends or with other fans, and stick to well-lit areas of the city. As you might expect, don't bring a ton of flashy jewelry or gadgets with you that might make you a target, and make sure you know how you're getting back from the bar to your accommodation, if you plan on drinking a lot. During the World Cup, there will probably be a lot of scammers trying to sell fake tickets, as there have been at every tournament. Remember to check the official resale portal to get genuine tickets.

In terms of local customs in LA, the city is fairly health-conscious, with smoking being prohibited in a lot of areas, including public parks. It's also more casual than you might think, so you don't need to be dressed to the nines if you're heading to the bar. It's also a highly multicultural city, so be respectful of other people's customs and cultures.

So, there's everything you need to know to enjoy World Cup travel to Los Angeles in 2026. In terms of a fan travel checklist, don't forget to pack plenty of light layers, comfortable shoes for exploring, and your team jersey. You can also find forums online to find other fans from your country heading out to LA, ready to share more travel tips for the World Cup 2026.

Remember, this is a global event, so if you're a domestic fan, try and travel sustainably, utilizing LA's metro system and traveling via Amtrak or Flixbus where possible. Also, bring a reusable water bottle to stay hydrated in the LA heat and keep trash to a minimum. This is an incredible event, and will be considered a dry run for the LA Olympics in 2028, so let's get excited!

As the summer ended, Ally Sentnor was on the move.  The Utah Royals traded the 21-year-old to the Kansas City Current in a financial move. Since then, she has been on the pitch for both the Current and US Women's National Team. She has not disappointed either club. 

While with the Current, she has been on the pitch and been a valuable player as they continue to stay atop the standings. It will be important to have fresh legs and a player of Sentnor's caliber to be ready to go as the postseason begins. 

On September 20, she had seven tackles in an impressive victory for the Current against the Seattle Reign. She also connected on over 83% of her passes in the 2-0 win. The Reign could be one of the teams that could be a matchup issue for the Current, although if Sentnor performs as strongly, they could find a way to break through. 

The US lost on Thursday to Portugal 2-1. The team appeared fired up and ready on Sunday. This included the 21-year-old NWSL star. Sentnor was instrumental in two goals during the match. 

In the 1st minute of action, she played aggressively, pushing the ball down the field, which led to the opening goal. It echoed the National Teams of the past, who were known for gaining an advantage by scoring in the early parts of the matches. 

In the 82nd minute, with the determination of the match still in question, she hit a corner kick so precisely that Sam Coffey was able to find the back of the net, leading to the goal that put the US up by two. 

The World Cup is just two years away. In 2023, it was clear that the National Team was in a transition period. Now, coach Emma Hayes has a tough decision to make as to who will make the final roster. Sentnor proved that she should be a name to remember for the next World Cup. 

She should be called for another camp towards the end of this year. But that will be after the Current attempts to push through the postseason. If she comes on strong and adds a goal or two, it could continue to give Hayes something to consider. 

Either Sentnor's year should continue to be monumental as she becomes one of the faces of women's soccer in the United States.

Inter Miami star Lionel Messi says MLS needs to loosen its restrictions on how clubs build their rosters in order to grow soccer's footprint in the United States.

"I think growing soccer in the United States is possible," Messi said in a recent interview with NBC News' Tom Llamas (translation h/t the NBC News broadcast). "I think there are still big changes to be made so that teams can continue to grow."

When asked what changes he wanted to see, Messi answered, "Well, for starters, every team should have the opportunity to bring in players and sign whoever each team wants, without limitations or rules for players to bring them in. I don't think that today all teams in the United States, all clubs, have the power to do that. 

"And I think that if they were given the freedom, many more important players would come and help the growth of the United States."

The interview was posted days after Inter Miami announced Messi had signed a three-year extension to stay with the club through the 2028 MLS season.

Messi first arrived in North America after signing with Inter Miami in July 2023. 

In the middle of the following MLS season, The Athletic's Paul Tenorio reported the league had approved roster construction rule changes including increasing the number of under-22 and designated player slots. 

The changes also increased how many players clubs can buy out during the season as well as how much transfer or loan revenue could be used for general allocation money, per Tenorio.

The league added further roster-building changes ahead of the 2025 season by allowing clubs to use unlimited cash to acquire players in a method similar to the international transfer market, per ESPN's Jeff Carlisle.

Clubs still remain capped by overall salary and roster spot restrictions spelled out in the league's current collective bargaining agreement, which kicked in ahead of the 2021 season and runs through 2027.

MLS commissioner Don Garber has recently indicated the league is considering changing that structure. He said in July the MLS is planning "a review of our entire roster strategy," per Tenorio.

Tenorio noted that the current CBA would need to be reworked in order to institute entirely new roster rules, and that the relationship between the MLS and its players' association "feels strained" after both sides expressed frustration over negotiations regarding Club World Cup bonuses.

MLS clubs currently have a salary budget of $5.95 million to build their first 20 roster spots. Clubs also have money stashed in other pools, with $2.225 million in targeted allocation money and up to $3 million in general allocation money available this season.

Outside of three designated players, who can sign for any salary amount without costing more than the MLS maximum salary charge of $743,750, these salary cap requirements have exercised strict control over how much teams can pay players.

That made sense for a league that, according to estimates published in February by Forbes, features more than half of its teams operating at a loss. Messi's Inter Miami is one of just 14 of 30 clubs Forbes projected brought in revenue in 2024.

The MLS will need to weigh team finances with the possibility that, as Messi said, relaxed roster restrictions could help attract more well-established international stars to North America when negotiating the next CBA ahead of the current deal's January 2028 expiration.

The Latest | Oct 28, 2025

KANSAS CITY (Oct. 28, 2025) — The Kansas City Current and U.S. Soccer's Soccer Forward Foundation celebrated a multifaceted community activation at Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy (KCGPA) Monday afternoon. United States Women's National Team (USWNT) players Emma Sears and Kennedy Wesley, USWNT and Kansas City Current player Ally Sentnor and Olympic gold medalist Staci Wilson, a USWNT alum, joined the festivities to lead an inspiring day of soccer, health and empowerment.

The event at KCGPA featured interactive stations focused on the holistic well-being of over 100 fifth through eighth grade KCGPA students. The students also helped pack hundreds of hygiene kits in collaboration with Giving the Basics, a Kansas City-based nonprofit that provides personal care products to those in need. Participants received giveaways tied to the theme of the event, including sports bras and menstrual health products.

“Partnering with Soccer Forward for this community activation at Kansas City Girls Prep was a powerful way to highlight the power of sport for all,” said Ben Aken, Vice President of Community Relations for the Kansas City Current. “With the USWNT making its first visit to CPKC Stadium, we wanted to ensure local students had the chance to engage with these elite athletes and showcase KC Current's newest mini-pitch in Kansas City.”

KCGPA is the site of the Kansas City Current's fourth mini-pitch in the Kansas City Metro and was formally unveiled Aug. 6. The Current's mini-pitches further the U.S. Soccer Foundation's Safe Places to Play Program, which aims to create 1,000 mini-pitches across the country by 2026. Over 800 mini-pitches have already been built nationally, providing children with safe, accessible places to play in their own neighborhoods.

Monday's event featured small-sided soccer games led by Kansas City Current representatives and a feminine hygiene education session with Giving the Basics. Representatives from U.S. Soccer's Research and Innovation Group, who work directly with the USWNT, and Soccer Forward collaborated to lead sessions on women and girls' health and soccer-based educational activities.

“When girls have access to the game, they gain more than just soccer skills; They gain confidence, belonging, and belief in what's possible,” said Lex Chalat, Executive Director of the Soccer Forward Foundation. “Partnerships like this one with the Kansas City Current and Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy show how we can use soccer to empower the next generation and help every girl feel strong, seen, and supported on and off the field.”

The event coincided with the USWNT's stop in Kansas City ahead of the team's historic first match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium in the world purpose-built for a women's professional sports team. The USWNT faces New Zealand Wednesday night at 7 p.m. CT. The match will broadcast on TNT, TruTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports and FDP Spanish Radio.

Limited tickets for Wednesday's match are available for purchase HERE.

Soccer Forward Community Spotlight. // Photo by Tarik Sykes

The U.S. Women's National Soccer Team is set to play New Zealand at CPKC Stadium on Wednesday, Oct. 29. But, before the best soccer players around the nation take the field, they decided to get involved in the local youth soccer scene. Partnering with the KC Current, on Monday, Oct. 27, the team ventured out to Kansas City Girls Preparatory Academy for a day of fun with the students through an event they call the Soccer Forward Community Spotlight. The students at KCGPA got a chance to meet some of the stars and participate in different activities revolving around the sport and women's hygiene during their Monday school day.

Our photographer Tarik Sykes captured the fun:

With two matches of a three-match camp in the books, the USWNT now faces New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo. This fall camp came after a long hiatus with a 113-day gap separating the July 2 win vs. Canada from this week's first match against Portugal on Oct. 23. On Oct. 23, the U.S. scored early with a beautiful strike from Rose Lavelle in the first match but couldn't shake all the rust off and ultimately fell 2-1 to the European side. Back to it on Sunday, the USWNT — fielding a young and inexperienced team that averaged 21.7 years old and 19.2 caps per player at the start of the match — marched into East Hartford, Conn. and buried goals early and late to beat Portugal, 3-1. Portugal took just one shot on goal in the second match, and it went into the net. On Oct. 26, Olivia Moultrie struck in the first minute and the 10th, her second, enabling the USA to take the lead after the third Portugal header goal of the two-game series. From then on, the U.S. held the line until the end of the match and, in the 82nd minute, Sam Coffey called game with a sublime finish off a corner from Ally Sentnor.

The USWNT now holds a 9W-3L-0D record on the year and a 11W-1L-1D record against Portugal. The USA will finish the three-game set with a match against New Zealand in Kansas City, Mo., on Wednesday, Oct. 29, in the team's first-ever match at CPKC Stadium (8 p.m. ET / 7 p.m. CT, on TNT, truTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo in Spanish and on the radio on Westwood One Sports).

October Matches vs. Portugal & New Zealand

GOALKEEPERS (3): Claudia Dickey (Seattle Reign FC; 3) Mandy McGlynn (Utah Royals; 4), Phallon Tullis-Joyce (Manchester United, ENG; 4)

DEFENDERS (8): Jordyn Bugg (Seattle Reign FC; 3/0), Emily Fox (Arsenal FC, ENG; 69/1), Eva Gaetino (Paris St-Germain, FRA; 1) Tara McKeown (Washington Spirit; 9/0), Avery Patterson (Houston Dash; 8/1), Lilly Reale (Gotham FC; 3/0), Emily Sams (Orlando Pride; 5/0), Emily Sonnett (Gotham FC; 112/2), Kennedy Wesley (San Diego Wave; 0/0)

MIDFIELDERS (8): Sam Coffey (Portland Thorns FC; 40/5), Lindsey Heaps (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 168/38), Claire Hutton (Kansas City Current; 8/1), Lo'eau LaBonta (Kansas City Current; 3/0), Rose Lavelle (Gotham FC; 114/26), Olivia Moultrie (Portland Thorns FC; 10/4), Jaedyn Shaw (Gotham FC; 28/8), Lily Yohannes (OL Lyonnes, FRA; 10/1)

FORWARDS (6): Michelle Cooper (Kansas City Current; 9/1), Catarina Macario (Chelsea FC, ENG; 25/11), Yazmeen Ryan (Houston Dash; 14/2), Emma Sears (Racing Louisville; 10/1), Ally Sentnor (Kansas City Current; 13/4), Alyssa Thompson (Chelsea FC, ENG; 24/3)

In the last FIFA window, Emma Hayes gave five players their first caps – goalkeeper Claudia Dickey, defenders Jordyn Bugg, Lilly Reale and Izzy Rodriguez and midfielder Sam Meza. All but Rodriguez and Meza are back on this roster, which features just one first-time call-up in Kennedy Wesley. Rodriguez and Meza, who started on June 29 vs. Ireland, became the 23rd and 24th players to debut under Hayes in her 27 games at the helm, a remarkable ratio for the Olympic champion head coach. Hayes has given 28 total players their first USWNT call-ups, but she also gave a first cap to a player who did not get a first call-up under her, as Lily Yohannes earned her first call-up under former interim head coach Twila Kilgore but did not see action under Kilgore. The 24 players who have earned their first USWNT caps under Emma Hayes are: Sam Staab, Lily Yohannes, Croix Bethune, Yazmeen Ryan, Hal Hershfelt, Emily Sams, Emma Sears, Mandy McGlynn, Alyssa Malonson, Eva Gaetino, Ally Sentnor, Tara McKeown, Michelle Cooper, Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Phallon Tullis-Joyce, Avery Patterson, Lo'eau LaBonta, Kerry Abello, Claudia Dickey, Lilly Reale, Jordyn Bugg, Sam Meza and Izzy Rodriguez.

Defender Eva Gaetino, who was participating in U.S. Under-23 Women's National Team Training Camp this week outside of Philadelphia, has been called up to the U.S. Women's National Team roster and joined the U.S. camp ahead of the final two matches of the FIFA window. After Trinity Rodman's withdrawal from the October camp roster due to injury, the USWNT entered camp with 25 players. Confident in her players at both the senior and U-23 rosters, and once again emphasizing the importance of the U-23 program, Hayes looked to the oldest of the USA's Youth National Teams to fill the 26th spot. With the U-23s training at the same facility as the USWNT, a call-up could easily be made. With all this in mind, Hayes attended U-23 trainings to assess the players, and, with all of her U-23 teammates looking on, informed Gaetino after one of those trainings that she would be joining the senior team for the rest of camp. The 22-year-old Michigan native was with the senior team for the 2024 SheBelieves Cup, but did not see action, and then earned her first and only cap in a 90-minute performance against Argentina on Oct. 30, 2024 — helping the U.S. squad to a 3-0 win that night. The 5-foot-11 central defender is in her second full season, with Paris Saint-Germain in France's Première Ligue after a banner college career at Notre Dame.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes has compiled a record of 22W-3L-2D through her first 27 matches at the helm of the USWNT and guided the USA to five consecutive shutouts before seeing that streak end against Germany in the group stage of the Olympics. It was the second-longest shutout streak to open the tenure of any full-time USWNT head coach, trailing only the nine consecutive shutouts that opened the Greg Ryan era. Ater the 3-0 opening game win over Zambia at the Olympics, Hayes became the first USWNT head coach to win their first major tournament match by a margin of three or more goals and joined Anson Dorrance as the only head coaches in USWNT history to win their first six matches at a major tournament. Dorrance won all six games with the USWNT at the 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup. Hayes joins three other USWNT head coaches of the last eight in USWNT history who won their first major competition (Anson Dorrance – 1991 FIFA Women's World Cup, Pia Sundhage – 2008 Olympics, Jill Ellis – 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup). The gold medal victory in Paris came in Hayes' 10th match at the helm of the USWNT, the fewest matches before winning a World Cup or Olympics by any head coach in women's soccer history. Hayes picked up her first world honor as head coach of the U.S. Women's National Team when she won the Ballon d'Or as the 2024 Women's Soccer Coach of the Year. France Football, the top soccer magazine in France and one of the most reputable in Europe, has been awarding the Ballon d'Or to men's players since 1956 and to women's players since 2018, but 2024 was the first year it has given out awards to coaches of men's and women's soccer. Hayes then followed that up by winning The Best FIFA Women's Coach award. Hayes won that award in 2021 and finished second to England head coach Sarina Wiegman in 2023.

Thursday's matchup will be the 22nd meeting all-time between the two teams. The U.S. leads the matchup record 19W-1L-1D and a 75-goal gap between the two teams. The most recent meetings between the teams came in January of 2023 when the USA visited New Zealand before the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The USA won both matches handily, 4-0 in Wellington and 5-0 in Auckland. Of the players who scored those nine goals over those two games, only Rose Lavelle, who scored twice in Auckland (while wearing the captain's armband) is on this roster.

 Before those matches, the USA and New Zealand met most recently about 11 months before on Feb. 20, 2022, on the second matchday of the SheBelieves Cup in Carson, Calif. The USA won 5-0 in a match that featured a highly unusual and painful to watch three own goals from one player – defender Meikayla Moore who currently plays for Calgary Wild FC in Canada – along with scores from Ashley Hatch and Mallory Pugh.

The USA and New Zealand met in four consecutive Olympic Games: 2020, 2016, 2012, and 2008. New Zealand and the USA met in the middle game of group play at the delayed 2020 Olympics with the Americans rolling to a 6-1 victory as Rose Lavelle, Lindsey Horan, Christen Press and Alex Morgan scored while the USA forced the Football Ferns into two own goals. The teams also met in the opening game of the group stage match at the 2016 Olympics, the quarterfinal of the 2012 Olympics and in group play at the 2008 Olympics. In Brazil, the USA picked up a 2-0 win behind first-half goals from Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan. In England, the USA won 2-0 on goals from Abby Wambach and Sydney Leroux. In China, the USA won 4-0 on goals from Heather O'Reilly, Amy Rodriguez, Lindsey Tarpley and Angela Hucles. O'Reilly scored 40 seconds into the match which was the fastest goal in Olympic history until Canada's Janine Beckie scored 20 seconds into the 2016 Olympic match against Australia.

Football fans have been left stunned by a video circulating on social media that appears to show plans for the world's first ever 'sky stadium' set to open in time for the 2034 World Cup in Saudi Arabia. 

The footage - which could be merely an AI hoax - shows the Gulf state's Neom Sky Stadium, expected to sit more than 1,000 feet above ground level in a city which is yet to be built called The Line. 

The venue towers hundreds of feet above all surrounding buildings in the dubious concept video. According to reports from various publications, it will only be accessible via high-speed lifts. 

However such information and indeed the video itself has left football fans sceptical whether the stadium, which the Saudis say will boast 46,000 seats, could realistically host any sort of major event.

They've questioned how exactly tens of thousands of fans could all gain access via lifts, the safety issues surrounding a venue situated 1,000 feet in the sky and, incredibly, what would happen if a ball flew out of the stadium. 

One posted on X: 'Thousands going up elevators and then down after the game? Nah, I'm good.'

🚨 Saudi Arabia is set to construct the world's first "sky stadium”. 🏟️ It will be suspended 1,150 feet above the ground, the venue is expected to open around 2032 and will host matches for the 2034 FIFA World Cup. 🇸🇦  pic.twitter.com/LO7WE3RIMV

A video circulating on social media appears to show a concept of Saudi Arabia's Neom Sky Stadium, set to be a venue at the 2034 World Cup

The Gulf state was elected to host the 2034 World Cup without opposition in December 2024

'This is truly a thing of beauty and elegance to imagine, however this project should never be allowed to happen,' another quipped.

'The potential risks in this sky stadium's security, health and safety challenges are deeply interconnected.'

One added: 'Imagine being on the street below and all of a sudden out of nowhere you're attacked by a rogue football from the sky.' 

A final fan simply wrote: 'This seems cool yet totally unnecessary and pretentious. Just because something can exist doesn't mean it should.'

While the video doing the rounds on social media this week may indeed be fake, it has been confirmed that the sky stadium is a project which the Saudis are working on. 

Images posted to Neom's official Facebook page last year show an original concept of the ground, which looks a far cry from the video that emerged on Tuesday. 

The stadium does nevertheless appear in a similarly futuristic style in the older pictures, while perhaps not so elevated into the clouds. 

Works on the Neom Sky Stadium are expected to begin in 2027 and be completed in 2032, two years before the tournament begins. 

Viewers are however sceptical that the video could be merely an AI hoax, citing a host of reasons why the stadium could not feasibly host major sporting events







The ground is part of a Saudi Arabian project called 'The Line', a smart city in the region of Neom which is expected to be car-free and only as long as the Empire State Building is high. 

When the Middle-Eastern nation were controversially awarded the tournament at a FIFA Congress late last year, they promised 'one of a kind' venues. But just four of the 15 stadiums set to host games at the prestigious event had actually been built. 

Eight of the tournament's grounds will be in the country's capital, Riyadh. One of those includes the 92,760 capacity King Salman International Stadium where the opening game and final will be played. 

Other venues include the Qiddiya Coast Stadium and the Prince Mohammed bin Salman Stadium, which will be located on a rooftop. 

The nation will be the second in the Middle East to host a World Cup in just a decade after the tournament went to Qatar three years ago. 

That event was the first to ever take place in the winter, a decision made due to the incredibly warm conditions in that part of the world. 

Images which emerged last year on Neom's official Facebook page showed a very different design of the sky stadium

Works are expected to begin on the ground in 2027 with a view to completion in 2032

Neom Sky Stadium will boast some 46,000 seats, according to plans

It will also feature more than 2,000 box seats and four 'training sites'

And it was revealed earlier this month that the Saudi World Cup could too be held between the months of November and December, when temperatures are considerably lower than those of the summer months. 

Speaking in early October, FIFA President Gianni Infantino claimed football fans need to have an 'open mind' about when the sport's most highly anticipated event takes place. 

'It's not just about one World Cup, it's a general reflection, even to play in some European countries in July is very, very hot, so maybe we have to think,' he said. 

'Actually, the best month to play football, which is June, is not used very much in Europe.

'Maybe there are ways we can optimise the calendar, but we are discussing it and we will see when we come to some conclusions. We just have to have an open mind.

'It is a fact that in the world, if you want to play at the same time everywhere, you can play in March or in October, most likely. Because in December you cannot play in one part of the world and in July you cannot play in another part of the world.

'We need to consider all these elements when we speak about national team competitions, national team release, about club competitions, and see how we can make it better for the benefit of everyone.'

The international match calendar is currently fixed until 2030, with the next two editions of the men's World Cup taking place in the northern hemisphere summer.  

Gianni Infantino suggested there needs to be an 'open mind' over when World Cups are held

The United States, Canada and Mexico are hosting next year's event in June and July.

Kick off times are expected to be 5pm BST, 8pm, 11pm and 2am, mirroring this summer's FIFA Club World Cup.

That tournament was beset by heat issues, so the marquee matches at the World Cup are set to be in the later slots to aid player welfare.

Speaking about what the World Cup could learn from the Club World Cup, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani admitted it was 'kick-off times'.

Elaborating further, he told the Leaders Conference in Twickenham: 'Kick-off times are always an issue in our region because summers are hot in Canada and US.

'We're having conversations daily with European media and other world media, in terms of what's best and which are the stadiums that you can play at 3pm. That's all in the mix now.

'Once the actual schedule comes out after the draw, we will do our best to ensure it's taken into consideration. Will it be that every game will be absolutely perfect from a kick-off time, from a TV perspective? I don't know.'

Morocco, Portugal and Spain have been confirmed as co-hosts of the 2030 tournament. 

Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will also hold matches to mark the centenary edition of the World Cup, which was won by the latter.

Manchester United flop Andre Onana has responded to words of praise from Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola as he continues to revive his career on loan at Trabzonspor. The Cameroonian goalkeeper, whose time in England was defined by blunders and plummeting confidence, is now experiencing an upturn in form in Turkey. He is quietly piecing his career back together, thousands of miles away from the glitz of the Premier League, and his performances are beginning to remind fans why he was once one of Europe's most sought-after stoppers.

Today's News

Sargent and Adams in action Getty Images

It was a weekend of very contrasting fortunes for American players in Europe, featuring giddy highs at Bournemouth and steep learning curves in the Bundesliga.

Welcome to this week's USMNT Player Tracker.

It has rarely been better for Tyler Adams in England.

The USMNT star is one of the Premier League's best defensive midfielders at the moment, and his club, Bournemouth, is hitting new heights.

Despite selling some of their best talent again in the summer, the south-coast club have relied on ever-smart recruitment to recalibrate and go again in their indefatigable style under manager Andoni Iraola.

Now Adams, who missed the U.S.'s October international window as he and his wife expected their second child, can take double satisfaction from Bournemouth's 2-0 win over Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Not only did it push them up to second in the top flight, remarkably just four points behind leaders Arsenal, but he played a pivotal part in his team's second goal.

It was Adams who touched the ball forward as he burst past Forest midfielder Elliot Anderson, and the England international could only drag down the 26-year-old as the ball fell to teenager Eli Junior Kroupi inside the Forest half. Kroupi drove forward 20 yards before firing his effort into the bottom left-hand side of the goal to make it 2-0 — and seal the win.



It's all the more impressive because Bournemouth had to effectively replace their entire back line during the transfer window, meaning Adams' experience and ability to screen the new unit has been needed more than ever.

Iraola will at least be pleased that Adams' quality is staying somewhat under the radar, because chances are richer clubs could start to sniff around him if he continues this form in USMNT colours this summer.

For now, though, Bournemouth and Mauricio Pochettino will be glad they have a model of consistency to call upon who, at 26 years old, can keep improving.

It's not been quite so upbeat for Josh Sargent at Norwich City lately.

The Canaries are usually in the Championship promotion mix but a woeful start to the season, cemented by Saturday's fifth consecutive defeat, left them second from bottom.

Manager Liam Manning is under pressure and the club's American majority shareholder Mark Attanasio is due to fly over to meet with the board this week.

For Sargent, who created Norwich's goal in the 2-1 defeat by Swansea City, and worked unselfishly to get his side back level, it might lead to a period of introspection. He decided against a summer move to Bundesliga team Wolfsburg after a deal had been agreed between the clubs, and could have been forgiven for hoping Norwich could finally engineer a Premier League return.



Of course, with much of the season to go, anything is still possible, but he could not have predicted such a difficult start.

Despite injury problems that required a groin operation, causing him to miss 14 league games, he scored 15 goals last season.

He started the current campaign in rich form, with five goals in four games, but since then Norwich's results have gone downhill and the 25-year-old's form has suffered.

It will likely compound his international frustrations. Sargent was left out of the most recent USMNT roster and is struggling badly for goals for his country, with his last in 2019.

If he is to keep in contention for a summer call-up, something has to give soon.

It hasn't been a barrel of laughs for Weston McKennie in Turin either.

After performing his annual trick of convincing another Juventus manager of his worth and getting back into the team, Igor Tudor was sacked on Monday after seven months in charge, with Massimo Brambilla — who coaches the club's reserve team Juventus Next Gen in Serie C — taking interim charge.

Juventus haven't won in five Serie A games, seven in all competitions, and while McKennie was getting the chance to settle into a midfield role (he was deployed often as a wing-back last term) it remains to be seen who will replace Tudor on a permanent basis and how that will affect the 27-year-old after Sunday's 1-0 defeat at Lazio.

Things are cheerier for another USMNT midfielder. Aidan Morris' form remains strong and Middlesbrough are second in the Championship.

Morris had a strong game in Saturday's 1-1 draw with Wrexham at the Riverside Stadium. According to Opta, the 23-year-old completed the most passes (94) in the match, and won the most duels (eight). 

But things don't always go smoothly for young players thrust into the senior set-up in one of Europe's big leagues. Noahkai Banks has had some great afternoons this season at Augsburg in the Bundesliga, not least when he scored his first goal against Wolfsburg at the start of the month.

The 18-year-old has started his team's last three games, but Saturday was a tough lesson. Augsburg were thrashed 6-0 at home by RB Leipzig, and it was a difficult match for the entire home backline.

“Defensively, we didn't do well,” manager Sandro Wagner told the club's website. “Against a team with such individual quality as Leipzig, you get punished ruthlessly for that. Today we got a real slap in the face, but that's part of our development.”

Banks can only learn from what team-mate Robin Fellhauer described as a “brutal” game and will hopefully have the chance to bounce back when Augsburg play Bochum in the DFB-Pokal tomorrow.

In the Netherlands, it was a cheerier game for Sergino Dest at PSV. He was dropped from the squad after turning up late for a pre-game meeting ahead of their Champions League win over Napoli last week.

But manager Peter Bosz was willing to forgive him and restored the full-back to the team for their game at Feyenoord on Sunday. PSV won 3-2 and moved to level on points with their opponents at the top of the table.

Saudi Arabia has unveiled plans to construct the world's first “Sky Stadium”, a groundbreaking sports arena that will soar 350 metres above ground as part of the $500 billion NEOM megacity project.

Officially called the NEOM Stadium, this futuristic venue marks another bold step in the kingdom's Vision 2030 agenda — an initiative aimed at transforming Saudi Arabia's economy through innovation, sustainability, and global sports leadership.

Designed to accommodate 46,000 spectators, the Sky Stadium will combine architectural brilliance with next-generation technology, including AI-powered systems, augmented reality, and advanced acoustics to enhance the live sports experience. The arena will also be powered entirely by renewable energy, aligning with NEOM's green energy goals.

Project officials revealed that the Sky Stadium will offer breathtaking panoramic views of the linear city below, creating an unparalleled atmosphere for sports and entertainment events.

Construction is expected to be completed by 2032, ahead of the 2034 FIFA World Cup, where the NEOM Stadium is anticipated to host matches up to the quarter-final stage.

Backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and several global partners, NEOM represents a vision of a high-tech, sustainable urban ecosystem. The Sky Stadium project reinforces Saudi Arabia's ambition to become a global hub for sports, tourism, and innovation under its Vision 2030 framework.

However, many experts have expressed doubts about whether such a structure could be built within the World Cup timeline. Neom, launched in 2017, has already faced delays, logistical challenges, and criticism over human rights and environmental issues.

Despite the scepticism, Saudi officials remain optimistic. If realised, the sky stadium could become one of the most striking sports venues in history.

NEWS ALERT: 14,000 corporate jobs cut at Amazon

October 28, 2025, 8:38 AM

MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) — Gio Reyna went into the 2022 World Cup as one of United States' brightest young soccer stars. Controversy over his training effort and a family conflict with the team's then-coach overshadowed his performances.

A World Cup on U.S. soil next year is a guiding light for the 22-year-old Reyna to revive a career dogged by injuries.

Reyna says he'd now handle the 2022 incident differently “in certain ways” and his actions stemmed from frustration, but the dispute wasn't “completely” his fault or that of his family.

Speaking to The Associated Press at his new club Borussia Moenchengladbach last week, the attacking midfielder wants to use this season to convince U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino he still belongs.

“I do obviously think about (the World Cup) pretty often as it's somewhere where I need and want to be,” he said. “But I try to focus daily here, stay present here, work here every day, and hopefully believe everything will fall into place.”

In Qatar in 2022, Reyna played only twice off the bench. Then-U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said after the tournament that an unnamed player, later identified as Reyna, was nearly sent home for a lack of effort in training. 

Reyna's parents — Claudio and Danielle Reyna, both former national team players — lobbied the U.S. Soccer Federation for more playing time for Gio and contacted the USSF about a three-decades-old domestic violence allegation involving Berhalter and the woman who later became his wife — Danielle's former college roommate.

Asked if he'd do things differently if he had that chance again, Reyna told the AP: “Maybe in certain ways, but I'm not just going to sort of sit here and take all the blame for something that was made out to be completely my fault, which I believe it wasn't, and also my family's, too.”

Reyna added the tensions “stemmed from” unhappiness with his game time.

“At the end of the day, I was just upset that, you know, I wasn't really playing. I was playing at Dortmund. I thought that I wanted to play at the World Cup and ultimately in the end, I didn't do that, and that's really what it stemmed from,” he said. 

“I guess the frustration and the disappointment was just wanting to play and help my country. It's so far removed now and so far in the past, I don't even really want to talk about it any more.”

Reyna is hoping Gladbach is his springboard back to the national team. Joining up there with his friend and U.S. teammate Joe Scally was “the cherry on top.”

A litany of muscle injuries have stopped Reyna building momentum. His last three years at Dortmund saw him used as an impact substitute, loaned to Nottingham Forest, then benched for much of last season. 

The last time Reyna played 90 minutes in a league game was in March 2022 and he's played once for the U.S. since the 2024 Copa America. Fitness issues have limited him to playing four of eight Bundesliga games at Gladbach so far.

Even coming off the bench for Gladbach, Reyna said, is “still better than what I was doing last season most of the time.” With only four planned U.S. friendlies before the team's pre-World Cup camp, Reyna's main chance to impress is with Gladbach.

“I think Pochettino was very clear with saying, ‘You need to play, perform and then if you do that then you have a good chance to come in again,'” he said. “It's all on me now.”

Dortmund is known for developing talented youngsters but Reyna now wonders if he should have moved “a little bit earlier” for more game time. “I had a good feeling when I made the decision to stay there. It didn't work out.”

Reyna has had at least eight distinct injuries in the last five years. Most were soft tissue and muscle problems, with one leg fracture.

Fitness issues have also limited his role with Bundesliga struggler Gladbach. 

“I've learned a lot about my body,” said Reyna. That means treating fitness work as more of a dialog with the club's athletic coaches and finding new ways to deal with the mental strain of yet another setback.

“The first 24 to 48 hours are always going to suck. There's no way round that,” he said. “What I've learned now is, after those one or two days where (there's) obviously a lot of pain, a lot of downtime, down energy, you just have to get on with it. You have to kick on, you have to really just attack the rehab.”

Reyna says he's taking on more responsibility on and off the field as he tries to fulfil his potential as a player.

“I would love to look back in the future and say that it was a pivotal year, few years here,” he said. “But talking is not really the way. You have to turn the talking into action.”

October 28 – FIFA has launched the second sales phase of World Cup tickets, with another one million tickets up for sale.

The new sales phase, which runs until Friday (October 31), includes a domestic exclusivity time slot for residents of the three host countries of the 2026 World Cup, the United States, Mexico and Canada.



Once the domestic exclusivity time slot ends, more fans will be eligible to obtain a buying slot starting on November 17.

“We already have seen massive interest from around the world for this tournament, and especially from within the host countries as Canada, Mexico and the United States prepare to host the biggest FIFA World Cup yet,” said Heimo Schirgi, the tournament's chief operating officer.

“This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say ‘thank you' to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well.”

The first sales phase – a Visa Presale Draw for qualifying Visa cardholders – drew worldwide interest with more than 4.5 million applicants. Even so, residents of the host countries bought more tickets than any other nation.

FIFA has received heavy criticism for setting sky-high ticket prices and applying dynamic ticketing, a strategy where prices shift based on demand. The model was previously tested at the Club World Cup and means that ticket prices can climb as sales progress.

World Cup ticket prices range from $60 in the group stages to $6,730 for the final, but the first sales phase revealed that the inventory of category four tickets in the group stages at $60 is very limited. On top of that, RTB (right to buy tickets) holders were mostly forced to purchase category one and category two tickets.

FIFA expects to sell more than 6.5 million tickets for the tournament and generate $3 billion from ticket sales, including from the hospitality segment. The 2026 World Cup will be the biggest yet to date, with 48 finalists.

Saudi Pro League

·25 Oktober 2025

Roshn Saudi League side Al Hilal have booked their place in the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, defeating European heavyweights Manchester City in a classic clash in Orlando on Tuesday.

The 2023-24 RSL champions saw off their illustrious rivals 4-3 after extra-time, with Marcos Leonardo's second of the game at Camping World Stadium sealing a famous victory for the Saudi Arabian giants.

Al Hilal, who opened their Club World Cup account with a brilliant performance against Real Madrid, will now take on Brazil's Fluminense in the last eight at the same venue on Friday.

 – Selasa, 1 Juli 2025

However, Simone Inzaghi's men should be allowed to enjoy the historic result in Orlando, where they rebounded from Bernando Silva's ninth-minute opener to completely turn the game on its head in a blitz right after half-time.

First, Leonardo drew Al Hilal level with a headed rebound, before Joao Cancelo set Malcom free with a delicious through-ball for the Brazilian to race clear and finish expertly past compatriot Ederson in the City goal.

The lead lasted only three minutes, though, Erling Haaland bundling home from Silva's corner. Remarkably, Al Hilal were back in front early into extra-time, when defender Kalidou Koulibaly rose highest to meet Ruben Neves' corner to head into the City net.

Yet, right before the first half of the additional period concluded, City substitute Phil Foden drifted into Al Hilal's penalty area to finish deftly past Yassine Bono at the back post.

Not to be deterred, Al Hilal then clinched the victory eight minutes from time. This time, a counter-attack ended with Ederson saving from Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, leaving Leonardo to prod home the winner.

Al Hilal celebrated wildly after the final whistle and once progression was confirmed – as well they might. Because the RSL representatives, still undefeated in the United States, had a memorable triumph that sent shock waves around the world.

Cricket

England's players before taking to the field against India Matt Roberts-ICC/ICC via Getty Images

One game away from being one game away. Just 100 overs against South Africa in Guwahati stand between England's women and a third consecutive 50-over World Cup final.

A semi-final of a global event is never easy, but England opened their tournament with a 10-wicket victory over the Proteas. They will be bursting with confidence. Skirting around complacency is the key.

Should they win on Wednesday, glory and redemption await. But then so would one of India and Australia — the side England defeated in the 2017 final at Lord's and the team that thrashed them in the 2022 showpiece at New Zealand's Hagley Oval.

England's only group-stage loss was a heavy one to Australia, while they, in the post-match words of former captain Heather Knight, “managed to steal the win at the back end” against India.

With eight of the 11 who played three years ago in the current squad, the group is familiar with 50-over finals. But never before have England's women reached the showpiece match on the sub-continent. Oh, and there is also the small matter of it being the maiden major tournament in leadership roles for head coach Charlotte Edwards and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt.

Here, The Athletic takes you inside what has been a long and rewarding camp.

October 15, 2024, marked the lowest ebb for modern-day England women's cricket.

A six-wicket defeat to the West Indies in Dubai meant a group-stage exit from the 2024 T20 World Cup. Having travelled with hope, perhaps even a little expectation, of lifting the trophy, they limped home — literally in Knight's case — having dropped catch after catch after catch.

Hang on. Scrap the first line of that previous paragraph: the 16-0 Ashes shellacking that followed in Australia was worse still. Knight and Jon Lewis were subsequently removed as skipper and head coach, opening the door for Sciver-Brunt and Edwards.

Exactly a year on, the Colombo rain spared England another potential embarrassment, this time against Pakistan. But just four days later, Sciver-Brunt et al kept their cool in Indore to squeeze India out. Belief inside the camp has rarely, if ever, wavered, but that result caught the attention of those on the outside peering in.

Needing 57 runs from 57 balls with seven wickets remaining, India were on the eve of Diwali delight. “I never thought it was gone, though, because the game never really got away from us,” Lauren Bell, who bowled the game's final over and secured England's four-run win, tells The Athletic. It can neither be confirmed nor denied whether Bell mimicked a Pinocchio nose while making that statement.

“But getting over the line in situations like that fills you with a lot of confidence, especially as a bowling and fielding unit,” she adds. “If we're in that situation again, we know we've done it once before.”

After Linsey Smith removed Smriti Mandhana, India and their partisan home crowd collectively tensed. But Sciver-Brunt's heartbeat remained unchanged.

“She's very laid back,” Bell says. “She's got such a calm and level head — it settles us all down. The India game was a prime example. Having a really calm captain allowed us to protect the game and take it as deep as possible. We didn't go searching to try and make things happen.”

Sciver-Brunt's leadership approach neatly dovetails with Edwards' coaching style. The latter remains England's all-time leading run scorer, still well over 1,000 clear of Sciver-Brunt, Knight and Tammy Beaumont.

Over her 191 international-cap career, Edwards won the 50-over World Cup, the T20 World Cup and five Ashes series. For a decade, she was captain and, since retiring, has coached Mumbai Indians, Southern Brave and Southern Vipers to titles. Once she had applied for the vacancy, her appointment in early April was a near formality.

Many in England's 15-player squad had played with or worked under Edwards previously, but Lauren Filer had done neither until last summer. Yet to play in the current tournament, Filer's description of her interactions with Edwards is telling.

“She's a good mixture — laid back, but says something when it is needed,” Filer begins. “She's not too in your face. She lets you do your own thing and when she needs to give input, she does.”

Edwards is hands-on, often found in the nets on the ball slinger. It is there that her competitive nature creeps out. “She definitely got the better of me today,” Filer admits.

Filer also appreciates Edwards' forthrightness. “If there is bad news to deliver, you don't want someone to beat around the bush. I think you get used to the, ‘Can we have a chat?', talk.”

Is that her stock phrase? Laughter. “Sometimes, or she might just be at training and say something like, ‘It's not good news today, mate'. She explains her reasons, which is good when you're not playing.”

Bell and Filer were speaking to The Athletic immediately after the pre-match meeting for Sunday's eight-wicket win over New Zealand. There is a post-match debrief for each game as well, and the bowling unit will also spend some time together.

Training schedules are carefully calculated, with Bell, Filer and left-arm spinner Linsey Smith often netting against the top order with new balls in hand.

Players have autonomy over their gym schedules. The hard work is constant but there is also a recognition that treating people like adults brings out the best in them. Strength and conditioning coach Helen Greenway-Shipman and analyst Benji Hoppitt are constantly available. Data use outside team meetings is also down to individual preference.

The day before a match, players effectively have a training menu from which to select. They can determine whether to bat, bowl, or work with a coach on a technical aspect or two. They can also pick, so far as is practicable, who they face.

“Tournament cricket's funny because you prep for a different team each week,” Bell explains. “Each time you're training, (as a bowler), you're thinking about a new batter. When I was playing India this summer, I was preparing for Smriti (Mandhana).

“Lottie (Edwards) is very passionate and very much wants us to find a way to get over the line. She's drilled that into us. We think about: ‘How do we play this opposition?'. Then it's hard work and practising the specifics of what we want to do against the teams we're playing.”

The tournament has been long, with England's first game, that dominant win against South Africa, on October 3. But the tour has been longer still — the squad landed in Abu Dhabi for a training camp on September 13. Rather than bonding, that trip was focused on trying to replicate Indian and Sri Lankan conditions.

Should, as they hope, England not return home until next week, they will have spent more than 50 nights in hotels with stops in nine airports.

“When you first start touring, it's a bit strange,” says Bell when asked how she copes with the lifestyle. “But now, if I'm in the same place for three days, I'm like, ‘Right, when are we moving?'. It's not normal life, but it's what we know. Travel days are travel days. Another airport, another flight… it's just part and parcel of it.”

The difficulty is that, unlike on trips to places like Australia and New Zealand, security restrictions mean much longer hours in hotels when in India.

Trips to coffee shops are largely off limits — a blow for any professional cricketer. To mitigate this, the ECB provides a bean-to-cup coffee kit, which, where possible, also travels to grounds on matchdays.

“It was very much requested from a lot of players,” Filer says. She is a rare non-coffee drinker but as a “social butterfly”, she misses heading out with her friends.

The caffeine dispenser also serves a purpose. “You don't want to mess with some people here until they've had a coffee!” Willing to name names? Silence. “I'm just thinking who in particular…” Filer continues. “Heather Knight or maybe Charlie Dean. You can probably tell if Charlie has not had a coffee in the morning.”

Off-spinner Dean earns herself a second namecheck, alongside Amy Jones, as having mastered coffee art, while Sophia Dunkley is barista-in-chief.

To occupy downtime, a roaming activities room has been set up. Puzzles, Lego and colouring are all popular. “It is a bit of a creche,” Filer explains. “We actually joked about that the other day. If people had walked in, they would have been like, ‘What is going on here?'.”

Bell, Filer and Smith dominate the Lego, while Beaumont has brought her own paint-by-numbers — a picture of her and her husband. “Although this is not the first tour that I've seen it on,” Filer adds while passing no judgment.

Knight, whose prankster alter ego ‘Shelley' has returned now that she is no longer captain, and Dean have guitars but there have been no public appearances.

Puzzles, though, are more of a team effort.

“The big one was when we were in Guwahati,” Bell explains. “Filer started a puzzle of the Taj Mahal in front of water.” Lauren Filer is seemingly never known as anything other than simply ‘Filer'. “It was a reflection puzzle. Filer got it out maybe two days before the game started.

“Obviously, we couldn't finish it before the match, but we had to finish it before we left. It became a whole team thing. We did a bit on the morning of the game and after the game we had an hour and a half before we had to pack our bags to finish it.”

The job got done. “Yeah, I probably should have started it a few days earlier,” Filer admits.

Evenings sometimes become quiz nights hosted by assistant coach Alex Gidman. It started during a Southampton trip in the summer, but the 44-year-old was told, in no uncertain terms, that he needed to stop tailoring questions to his generation and think more about his participants.

The latest iteration was, much to Bell's surprise, won by Sarah Glenn, Danni Wyatt-Hodge and Dunkley. Gidman bowed to popular demand and brought his music round into the 2020s.

“I'm going to assume he hadn't heard many of the songs that he was playing for us,” Bell says. While there are a few fierce competitors amongst the squad, Beaumont and Dean amongst them, Gidman at no point lost the room. “He's a pretty harsh quiz master. What he says goes, and his answer is the final answer.”

Naturally, tour fines are in place, with Jones receiving a penalty for getting herself stuck in a lift, and Hoppitt, who is travelling with the group for the first time, paying for bringing a strange weather contraption with him that measures dew levels.

The sense is that England are yet to peak.

There have been a handful of moments of quality — Knight's century against India and her measured 79 not out against Bangladesh, Sciver-Brunt's 117 against Sri Lanka and Sophie Ecclestone's 4-17 just as the game appeared to be slipping away, Jones' 86 not out against New Zealand — but there is more to come.

Pleasingly, the hours England have dedicated to their fielding are visibly showing. “We've worked really, really hard,” Bell tells The Athletic. “We've actually just put in performances that are a representation of how good we are as a fielding side. We've always been very talented and been good fielders. It was a combination of working really hard and getting in a headspace where we can put in performances under pressure and then replicating that on the pitch with high energy levels.”

But there is one question for which England need to find an answer. How does one beat Australia? “They are exceptional,” Bell adds. “We had them 60 for four and they still won by six wickets chasing 245.

“We can take wickets against them, and then it is about belief. You've got to have belief, and we're a talented team. But we will focus on South Africa first.”

'Sky stadium' set to host matches for the 2034 FIFA World Cup, will seat 46,000: Report

Social media is abuzz with revelations that Saudi Arabia has announced plans for the NEOM Stadium, the world's inaugural “sky stadium”. 

It will reportedly be powered by the sun and wind, and will seat 46,000 people.

The stadium, to host matches for the 2034 FIFA World Cup, is set to begin construction in 2027 and complete by 2032, aligning with Saudi Arabia's bid to host the expanded 48-team tournament, according to reports shared on social.

 Saudi Arabia's 2034 World Cup bid, the only one submitted, was formally accepted, reflecting the kingdom's growing influence in global sports.

There's been no mention of the "sky stadium" in legacy Saudi media.

Arab News noted in 2024 that the Kingdom has ushered in a "remarkable transformation" in sports infrastructure with plans for 15 stadiums as part of its FIFA World Cup 2034 bid.

"At the heart of this ambitious project is the King Salman International Stadium in Riyadh, which is set to become the largest stadium in the Kingdom, with a capacity of 92,760, when it is completed in 2029," Arab News reported. 

According to Construction Review, the stadium's design integrates into The Line, a linear smart city within NEOM, showcasing futuristic architecture and sustainability.

The magazine also claimed that the NEOM Sky stadium will be the "world's first sky stadium” for the 2034 World Cup glory. 

"The stadium is suspended at an astonishing 350 meters (1,150 feet) above the desert floor within the futuristic NEOM city of The Line", the magazine stated. 

FIFA's preliminary endorsement highlights the stadium's potential to set new standards in eco-friendly sports venues.

The project faces engineering challenges due to its height and location, requiring innovative solutions for safety and accessibility.

The stadium's proximity to the Health and Well-Being District and University aims to create a sports-focused neighbourhood.

Despite delays in the broader NEOM initiative, initially planned for completion by 2039, which could impact the stadium's timeline, priorities reportedly remain on the 2034 World Cup.

The stadium's iconic status is expected to boost tourism and investment in Saudi Arabia, aligning with Vision 2030's diversification goals.

Many have taken to social media to show their skepticism on the structural integrity on the project.

The plan, however, has also received as many accolades, citing the move as a "groundbreaking" leap for global sports.

Lionel Messi wants to play for Argentina in next year's World Cup, but he says he will listen to his body before deciding whether he can make that dream come true. The 38-year-old striker for Inter Miami of MLS led Argentina to the 2022 World Cup title and yearns to be on the field when the "Albiceleste" defend the crown next year in North America. Eight-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi told NBC News in an interview broadcast on Monday that he will see next year how his body feels before deciding on whether or not he can play in the World Cup co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada.

"It's something extraordinary to be able to be in a World Cup and I would love to," said Messi, who turns 39 next June.

"I would like to be there, to be well and be an important part of helping my national team, if I am there.

"And I'm going to assess that on a day-to-day basis when I start preseason next year with Inter and see if I can really be 100%, if I can be useful to the group, to the national team, and then make a decision."

Messi, who has been playing professionally since 2004, wants the chance for one more star turn on football's biggest stage.

"I'm really eager because it's a World Cup. We're coming off winning the last World Cup and being able to defend it on the field again is spectacular because it's always a dream to play with the national team, especially in official competitions."

Messi, who debuted with Barcelona in La Liga at age 17, joined Paris Saint-Germain in 2021 and moved to MLS in 2023.

"The truth is that I like everything about living here," Messi said of Miami.

"I spent a lot of time in Barcelona, which for me is an extraordinary city, where I grew up and had many spectacular moments, and which we miss a lot.

"But Miami is a city that allows us to live very well, that makes us enjoy life, that allows us to be calm, that allows the kids to be themselves and live day to day."

Messi has 195 appearances for the Argentine national team, scoring 114 goals.

With the WTA Finals beginning this weekend, the year's top eight singles players and doubles teams will compete for the crown-jewel event of the season. From tournament information to player previews, here is everything you need to know heading into Riyadh.

As November approaches, the Hologic WTA Tour reaches its season finale. The WTA Finals Riyadh presented by PIF brings the top eight singles players and doubles teams to King Saud University Indoor Arena for the season-ending championship.

Three new teams are also here to shake things up, including Andreeva and Shnaider, the youngest duo to qualify for the doubles year-end finale in 25 years.  

Road to the WTA Finals: Get to know the eight doubles teams heading to Riyadh

Gauff took home the 2024 WTA Finals title after outlasting China's Zheng Qinwen in a three-set thriller. Along the way to the championship, Gauff bested Sabalenka in the semifinal and picked up straight-set wins over Swiatek and Pegula in the group stage.

Canada's Dabrowski and New Zealand's Routliffe are back to defend their doubles title. In 2024, the second-seeded pair defeated No. 8 seed Siniakova and Townsend 7-5, 6-3 in the final, part of an undefeated campaign.

Aryna Sabalenka

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 4•    Best finish: Finalist (2022)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Semifinals•    2025 hard-court record: 35-6 (.853)•    2025 titles: 4 -- Brisbane International (500), Miami Open (1000), Madrid Open (1000), US Open (Grand Slam)

Sabalenka's success is often defined by her Grand Slams. She began her season winning 11 consecutive matches, taking the Brisbane International title, before Keys ended her streak in the Australian Open final. 

Bouncing back with 1000-level wins in Miami and Madrid, Sabalenka fell short again in the final at Roland Garros, this time to Gauff, followed by a semifinal exit at Wimbledon a month later. The defeats were disappointing, but Sabalenka proved why she's the world No. 1, defending her US Open crown with a straight-set win over Anisimova and winning her fourth-career Grand Slam.

Sabalenka played just one tournament after New York, reaching the semifinals in Wuhan. Approaching Riyadh, her No. 1 ranking, one that she's held since October 2024, has remained intact, and Sabalenka has a chance to finally lift the Billie Jean King trophy in her fifth consecutive WTA Finals appearance. 

Iga Swiatek

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 4•    Best finish: Champion (2023)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage•    2025 hard-court record: 40-10 (.800)•    2025 titles: 3 -- Wimbledon (Grand Slam), Cincinnati Open (1000), Korea Open (500)

Swiatek had another stellar campaign in 2025. Despite losing her bid for four straight French Open titles after a semifinal loss to Sabalenka, Swiatek bounced back and dominated grass-court season, historically her most challenging surface. Playing in her second Bad Homburg Open in three years, she made her way to the final, eventually falling to Pegula in straight sets. But she one-upped herself in her next tournament, winning her first Wimbledon singles title with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory over Anisimova in just under an hour. 

To close out the summer, she racked up hard-court wins in Cincinnati and Seoul, part of a stretch where she won 14 of 15 matches. She enters Riyadh seeking her second career WTA Finals title, joining Gauff as the only players in this field who have won WTA Finals titles.

Coco Gauff

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 3•    Best finish: Champion (2024)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Champion•    2025 hard-court record: 29-9 (.763)•    2025 titles: 2 -- French Open (Grand Slam), Wuhan Open (1000)

Gauff enters Riyadh as the reigning champion, seeking to become the first player to win consecutive WTA Finals titles since Serena Williams achieved the feat from 2012-14. 

The high of Gauff's year came in Paris, where the 21-year-old won her second career Grand Slam at Roland Garros, defeating Sabalenka in three sets after dropping the first. To follow, however, would be a difficult summer. Early exits in Berlin and Wimbledon, followed by a coaching change to address her serve struggles, culminated in a fourth-round loss to Naomi Osaka at the US Open.

A more than two-week break and the beginning of the Asian Swing rejuvenated Gauff ahead of the WTA Finals. Gauff won 9-of-10 matches across Beijing and Wuhan, claiming her third WTA 1000 title in the latter, with the lone defeat coming to compatriot Anisimova in the semifinals in Beijing. 

Amanda Anisimova

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 0, debutant in 2025•    2025 hard-court record: 26-9 (.743)•    2025 titles: 2 -- Qatar Open (1000), China Open (1000)

The lone debutant at this year's WTA Finals, Anisimova had a stellar 2025 campaign, claiming two WTA 1000 titles in Doha and Beijing. The win over Ostapenko in Qatar clinched her first title in more than three years, and it seemed to foreshadow her success the rest of the year. 

En route to the Wimbledon singles final, her first Grand Slam final appearance, she knocked off Sabalenka in three sets in the semifinals before falling to Swiatek. Though the loss was disappointing, she avenged the defeat at the US Open, besting Swiatek in the quarterfinals. Anisimova ultimately reached the singles final in New York, falling to Sabalenka 6-3, 7-6. 

Anisimova rides plenty of momentum into Riyadh following her win in Beijing in early October.

Jessica Pegula

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 3•    Best finish: Finalist (2023)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage (withdrew)•    2025 hard-court record: 35-12 (.745)•    2025 titles: 3 -- ATX Open (250), Charleston Open (500), Bad Homburg Open (500)

Pegula's 2025 produced three titles, and her win in Charleston marked her first on clay. The American is still searching for her first Grand Slam, and her best performance in the Slams this year came at the US Open, where she lost to eventual champion Sabalenka in the semifinals.

In the Asian swing, Pegula reached the semifinals in Beijing and the final in Wuhan, falling to American counterpart Gauff in the latter. That's in addition to her runner-up finishes in Adelaide and Miami earlier this season. 

Pegula, 31, is the eldest player in the singles draw and will make her fourth consecutive appearance at the WTA Finals. In 2024, she withdrew after two matches because of a left-knee injury, and was replaced by Daria Kasatkina.

Elena Rybakina

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 2•    Best finish: Group stage (2023, 2024)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage•    2025 hard-court record: 38-13•    2025 titles: 2 -- Strasbourg (500), Ningbo Open (500)

Rybakina recently qualified for her third consecutive WTA Finals by reaching the semifinals of the Toray Pan Pacific Open. However, Rybakina withdrew ahead of her semifinal match, citing a back injury, which could play a factor in Riyadh. 

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Her 2025 season featured 500-level wins in Strasbourg and Ningbo, Rybakina's ninth and 10th career titles. At the WTA Finals, she looks to advance out of the group stage, having only won one round-robin match each of the past two years.

Madison Keys

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 1•    Best finish: Group stage (2016)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Did not qualify•    2025 hard-court record: 24-6 (.800)•    2025 titles: 2 -- Adelaide International (500), Australian Open (Grand Slam)

The 30-year-old Keys elected to forego the Asian swing. She last competed at the US Open in August, where she lost in the first round. 

Keys started 2025 hotter than any player on tour. She rode the momentum from her title in Adelaide straight into her first career Grand Slam title, outlasting Sabalenka in three sets in the Australian Open. It was a part of a 16-match win streak that didn't end until a semifinal loss to Sabalenka at Indian Wells in March.

But since Indian Wells, Keys has reached only one semifinal. It's been almost a decade since Keys last played in the WTA Finals, exiting in the group stage in 2016. Can she end 2025 the way she started it?

Jasmine Paolini

•    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 1•    Best finish: Group stage (2024)•    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage•    2025 hard-court record: 25-12 (.676)•    2025 titles: 1 -- Internazionali BNL d'Italia (1000)

Paolini secured her qualification for the Finals after reaching the semifinals of the Ningbo Open, falling to eventual champion Rybakina. The semifinal finish was one of five this season, in addition to Miami, Stuttgart, Bad Homburg and Wuhan. She also reached the final in Cincinnati, falling to Swiatek in straight sets.

The Italian's pinnacle moment came on home soil in May at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, where she defeated Gauff 6-4, 6-2 for the title. Paolini became the first Italian woman to win her nation's biggest tournament since Raffaella Reggi in 1985. The victory marked her second WTA 1000 singles title and first on clay. She also won the doubles tournament in Rome alongside Errani. 

Paolini is the only player scheduled to contest in both singles and doubles in Riyadh. In 2025, Errani and Paolini were victorious at WTA 1000 events in Doha, Rome and Beijing, and lifted the trophy at Roland Garros for their first major doubles title. 

With the WTA Finals beginning this weekend, the year's top eight singles players and doubles teams will compete for the crown-jewel event of the season. From tournament information to player previews, here is everything you need to know heading into Riyadh.

Across 25 years on the ATP Tour, Nicolas Mahut crafted a career that any player would envy. Five Grand Slam doubles titles, reaching No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, and a Davis Cup victory for France.

Among the countless memories, one match still stands out — not for a trophy, but for its place in tennis history. Fifteen years on, Mahut can still smile when people ask if he beat John Isner in their record-breaking 2010 Wimbledon epic, which stretched over three days and lasted 11 hours and five minutes.

“It will stay somehow in both categories and that's not a bad thing. It was both a painful moment and a moment that felt quite suspended,” said Mahut. “It is one of my biggest memories, inevitably. At the start, it did bother me a lot because I was tired of being the handsome loser.”

The Frenchman's 70-68 fifth-set loss to Isner once felt like a burden. A reminder of coming so close, but ending up on the losing side of one of tennis' most talked-about matches. But time and perspective have given Mahut peace. He even wrote a book about that extraordinary experience, one that helped him turn heartbreak into strength.

“I now enjoy talking about that match because it was a crazy experience,” Mahut said. “It brought me a lot as a player and as a man. But I can be associated with that match and I can talk about it easily because I know that after that… I managed to win.”

And win he did. Mahut went on to capture 37 tour-level doubles titles, including two Nitto ATP Finals crowns and five major titles with longtime partner Pierre-Hugues Herbert, ascending to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings.

“That's a source of pride. I perhaps wasn't strong enough to leave my mark on the tennis world through my record, but I found a way to be associated, for eternity, with Wimbledon, which for me is the greatest [tournament] in the world,” Mahut, who won Wimbledon in 2016, humbly said.

“When I went this year with my son, walking through the aisles, he saw his name after all, because it's also his. It gives me a little pride and ultimately there's nothing more beautiful for me.”

That sense of pride and completion surrounded Mahut's farewell this week at the Rolex Paris Masters, where he played his final match alongside good friend Grigor Dimitrov — a 6-4, 5-7, 10-4 defeat to Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin on Tuesday afternoon.

“We always wanted to do a few double sessions together throughout the last years, but I was honestly never really able to commit,” Dimitrov said of Mahut. “It was the right time. It was the last tournament for him and it made sense. I have a very sentimental relationship with him.

“For so many years, we played against each other. We competed more than once on such a big occasion. So it's safe to say that it's a good ending for him."

Although his doubles achievements stand tall, Mahut was also a formidable singles player. He earned 181 tour-level wins and lifted four ATP Tour trophies, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, triumphing in ‘s-Hertogenbosch (2013, ‘15, ‘16) and Newport (2013).

Armed with a precise serve and slick volleys, Mahut's attacking instincts made him a threat on fast courts. That translated seamlessly to his later doubles success. Alongside Herbert, he built one of the most accomplished partnerships of the modern era, becoming one of only eight teams to complete the career Grand Slam in men's doubles.

“Being able to win Grand Slams was for me one of the best memories,” Mahut said. “That's what I will remember. Beyond the titles, the trophies that I may have, it's also ultimately everything that happened in order for me to achieve those trophies and victories.

“It's all the doubts, the questioning, the mistakes I made. That is ultimately what makes a career rich, and mine is very rich in that regard.”

This richness was celebrated in moving fashion in Paris, when his longtime sponsor, Lacoste, surprised him at dawn on the new centre court at La Défense Arena. Over the years, Mahut had saved each polo shirt from every collection since the second year of his partnership with the brand — around 60 in total.

“On Saturday, Lacoste surprised me. I wasn't aware. I came in the morning, and on the centre court at 6 a.m. there was no one there,” Mahut said. “When I arrived, they had set them [the polos] up on mannequins around the court. Already the fact of experiencing this, to see again some polos that I wore during certain victories, reminded me of memories.”



Mahut's love affair with tennis began long before his first ATP Tour match. It started in 1991, when a nine-year-old boy in France watched his country lift the Davis Cup trophy. More than two decades later, his dream of replicating that feat became a reality.

In 2017, Mahut won all three of his doubles rubbers during France's title run and finally held the Davis Cup trophy in his hands.

“It has guided my entire career,” Mahut said of the Davis Cup. “That's why I wanted to play, because it made me dream. I wanted to be a tennis player after watching the Davis Cup in 1991. That's what made me want to do it, and I didn't know what I would have to do.

“However, when I saw them win in '91 in Lyon, I thought, ‘This is what I want to do, this is what I want to win', without understanding the effort I would have to put in to make it happen. And in the end, I ended up having the cup at home.”

From the boy who fell in love with tennis watching France win the Davis Cup, to the man who stood atop the world in doubles, Nicolas Mahut's journey has come full circle. His career — rich in perseverance, humility and joy — is one of both inspiration and heart.

As the curtain falls at the Rolex Paris Masters, Mahut bids farewell not defined by any scoreline, but by a lifetime of grace, grit, and the quiet satisfaction of a dream fulfilled.

Felix Auger-Aliassime kept alive his Nitto ATP Finals qualification hopes on Tuesday at the Rolex Paris Masters, where he battled from a set down to defeat Argentine qualifier Francisco Comesana 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-3.

The Canadian won the title at the ATP 250 event in Brussels nine days ago but was forced to retire during his quarter-final clash in Basel last week. Following his first-round win in Paris, Auger-Aliassime moved to within 440 points of eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Musetti meets Lorenzo Sonego on Wednesday.

Auger-Aliassime, currently ninth in the Live Race To Turin, will need a deep run in the French capital if he is to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the second time. The 25-year-old played in Turin in 2022, falling in the round-robin stage.

In a hard-fought battle against Comesana, Auger-Aliassime did not drop a point behind his first serve in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and then overpowered the World No. 68 in the decider to triumph after two hours and 20 minutes in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Auger-Aliassime is 44-21 on the season.

Auger-Aliassime will next meet Frenchman Alexandre Muller in Paris. The Canadian's best result in the French capital came in 2022 when he reached the semi-finals.



Joao Fonseca won his second ATP Tour title on Sunday when he triumphed at the ATP 500 event in Basel. On Tuesday in Paris, the Brazilian backed up that victory with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 comeback win against Denis Shapovalov to reach the second round on his tournament debut.

Fonseca moved past the Canadian en route to becoming the third-youngest ATP 500 champion in series history (since 2009) last week in Switzerland and once again had the better of proceedings.

"In tennis you have to change the mindset week after week," Fonseca said. "I won two days ago and now I am here playing Paris. I am very happy to change the mindset and be ready for this match. I lost the first set and after I changed a few things and I am very happy with the way I was mentally in this match. I wasn't playing my best in the beginning, I felt my hip a bit, but it is all good, nothing we can't adjust for the next round and we keep going."

The 19-year-old, playing at a career-high No. 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings, hit with clean power off both wings and overcame a physical issue in the third set, during which he received a medical timeout, to improve to 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

Fonseca will next meet 10th seed Karen Khachanov. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion is the first Brazilian player to win a match at the Masters 1000 event in Paris since Tomaz Bellucci in 2015.

Daniil Medvedev earned his first victory at the Rolex Paris Masters since 2021, when he reached the final. The 11th seed beat Jaume Munar 6-1, 6-3 to snap a three-match losing streak at the indoor hard-court event.

Medvedev has now earned 40 tour-level wins in 2025 and has looked much improved in recent weeks. He reached the semi-finals in Shanghai earlier this month and then won the title in Almaty. The 2020 Paris champion will play Grigor Dimitrov in the second round.

In other early action, Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot moved past Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 6-3 to set a rematch against his cousin Arthur Rinderknech. Vacherot defeated Rinderknech in three sets earlier this month in Shanghai to become the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990).

Valentin Vacherot brought the flow state that helped him capture the Rolex Shanghai Masters to Paris for the final Masters 1000 tournament of the 2025 season, dropping just four games to upset No. 13 seed Jiri Lehecka, 6-1, 6-3.“Everything I've been living the past two-three weeks helps a lot for me to have no nerves,” Vacherot told Prakash Amritraj in his visit to the Tennis Channel Desk.The 26-year-old has taken a hero's journey towards the top of the men's game this fall, going from a college standout at Texas A&M University to an ATP Challenger Tour stalwart before roaring to the biggest title of his career in Shanghai.“I think the tournament changed when I beat [Alexander] Bublik in the second round,” recalled Vacherot, who had to pass through two rounds of qualifying just to make it into the Shanghai main draw. “I think it was just about focusing on myself because that was working in the first matches. I kept doing the same thing over and over and it kept working. There was nothing to change, all about focusing on myself and adapting during the matches because I was playing such good guys for the first time in my life. I knew it wasn't going to work this good every time, but for this one, it worked pretty well.”

Vacherot went on to score back-to-back wins over Holger Rune and Novak Djokovic, ultimately winning a fairytale final against cousin Arthur Rinderknech. The match against Djokovic, a 24-time Grand Slam champion, is one the rising Monegasque star won't soon forget.“It was already surreal to be on the court against him, once I stepped on court almost all the nerves left because I just wanted to have so much fun out there. I wasn't thinking I wasn't supposed to be here, but I know that if people told me two weeks before I would be in the round of 16, quarterfinals, I would have said they were a bit crazy! But it helped me so much to be a bit stress-free. I was playing so well!”Now up to No. 40 in the ATP rankings, Vacherot credits the grind of the ATP Challenger Tour with helping prepare him for this slew of Masters successes.

“The depth is unreal through No. 300, 350,” claimed Vacherot. “I'm not saying everyone plays the same level but it's pretty close. The Challenger level is so tough. There's not one easy match. It's the same here, of course, but the Challenger level, I feel, is the same. It shows on my record. I made a lot of semifinals and quarterfinals this year but couldn't really push through for a title or a final. So, maybe I just needed to go on the big tour to do it!”A fixture on the “big tour” for the foreseeable future, Vacherot's dreamy month continues in the second round where he'll face cousin Rinderknech for the second time in three weeks. Rinderknech edged past Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in a pair of tiebreakers on Monday.

As the 2025 tennis season winds down, the length of the tour's calendar is once against coming under fire from the top.World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz was asked for his thoughts on the "ideal number" of matches a top player should play in one season ahead of his opening match at the Rolex Paris Masters, the final ATP Masters 1000 event of the season. While Alcaraz wouldn't commit to a number, he wound up singing a familiar refrain about the commitments demanded of players throughout the year."I can't answer with [an] exact number. But obviously they have to do something with the calendar," he said ahead of his 16th tournament this year. "The amount of tournaments that we have to play I think is too high. We don't have such, you know, good period of time that we can practice, we can rest."Even during the season, I think it's week after week after week and we don't have the chance to have a week just to prepare pretty well the tournaments or what we have ahead in the season."Read more: Carlos Alcaraz adds $1 million Australian Open ‘one point' challenge to packed schedule

The ATP recently announced that as soon as 2028, the number of Masters 1000 tournaments will increase from nine to 10 with the addition of a top-tier event in Saudi Arabia. Eight of the nine are currently mandatory for players to play.While the addition comes with the promise of an opportunity to chase more ranking points and prize money, the six-time Grand Slam champion still offered a critique in the aftermath of the announcement that he hasn't been shy in sharing since establishing himself at the top of the sport.Read more: Top ATP, WTA players push Grand Slams again in bid for more money and more say“The calendar is so tight, a lot of tournaments, no days off or not as much days off as I want,” he said as recently as September at the Laver Cup the Laver Cup. “I'm the kind of player who thinks there is a lot of mandatory tournaments during the year, and probably during the next few years [there's] gonna be even more tournaments ... I mean, probably they are going to kill us in some way.”

The 22-year-old is returning to action at tour-level for the first time in almost a month following his triumph in Tokyo, having withdrawn from the recent Shanghai Masters event with a left ankle injury. That followed other notable pullouts by Alcaraz this year from 1000-level events in Madrid (adductor) and Montreal (fatigue)—though he committed to a stacked slate of exhibitions and non-mandatory tournaments in 2025, including a trip to Puerto Rico with Frances Tiafoe before Indian Wells and a US Open mixed doubles appearance with Emma Raducanu. In the off-season, he has one-day appearances planned at A Racquet At The Rock on Dec. 7 in Newark, New Jersey with Tiafoe and Raducanu, and the Miami Tennis Invitational alongside Joao Fonseca on Dec. 8.Together in a draw with world No. 2 Jannik Sinner for the first time since the US Open, Alcaraz will open his tournament against Cameron Norrie on Tuesday.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Four into one won't go in Mexico

2025 Mexico City Grand Prix: Piastri jumps ahead of Antonelli with super-quick pit stop

Max Verstappen came home in third in Mexico, as McLaren's Lando Norris sealed a dominant victory while also taking the lead in the Drivers' Championship.

Red Bull's recent flurry of form, which has brought Max Verstappen roaring back into championship contention, came up short in Mexico.

The RB21 had nothing like the pace of Lando Norris' dominant McLaren, in sharp contrast to recent races, and Verstappen had a tough battle on his hands just to finish third, around half-a-minute behind Norris. What was it about the Autodromo Hermanos Rodriguez circuit which brought the Red Bull up short?

Yes, yes, it might only be October, but awards season? It's here. Early out of the gate: the 2025 Gotham Film Award nominees, honoring “visionary talent in front of and behind the camera.” With the ceremony traditionally taking place the first week of December, the Gothams are the first major awards event of the season, and its nominees can provide some valuable insight into what films and talents are already rising to the top.

This year's nominees are led by Paul Thomas Anderson's “One Battle After Another,” which picked up six nominations. Other standouts include “Train Dreams,” “If I Had Legs I'd Kick You,” “Sorry, Baby,” “East of Wall,” “Familiar Touch,” “Hamnet,” “It Was Just an Accident,” and a number of other indies.

In announcing this year's nominations, Jeffrey Sharp, Executive Director of The Gotham Film & Media Institute, said: “This year's nominees celebrate an extraordinary year of cinematic achievement — one defined by bold, original storytelling, festival breakouts, and filmmakers whose independent vision extends across studios and streamers. This year's Gotham nominees, and our Gotham Tributes, reflect the year's most accomplished filmmakers and performers and embody the community that has defined The Gothams for 35 years.”

For the first time in its history, this year's batch of Gotham nominees includes 10 Best Feature picks. In previous years, the category only included five nominees, but the category was expanded for the 2025 season to include up to 10 nominees. Also of note, there are handful of films that didn't make the cut because they were not submitted for consideration, including two recent NYFF premieres, Josh Safdie's “Marty Supreme” and Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?,” which were not completed in time to share with the full nomination committee pool.

Nominees are chosen by committees of film critics, journalists, festival programmers, and film curators. Separate juries of writers, directors, actors, producers, editors, and other film industry professionals will determine the final Gothams recipients. (This year's nominating committees included IndieWire Editorial Director Kate Erbland and Chief Film Critic David Ehrlich.)

The Gothams have already announced a slew of special awards to be presented at this year's ceremony, including the Director Tribute for Noah Baumbach (in honor of his latest, “Jay Kelly”), a Spotlight Tribute for “Hedda” star and producer Tessa Thompson, the Vanguard Tribute for Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” and an Ensemble Tribute for the cast of “Sinners.”

Brian Ross Weitz, the Animal Collective musician better known as Geologist, has announced his debut solo studio album. The full-length, Can I Get a Pack of Camel Lights?, is out January 30 via Drag City. Below, watch director Molten Synapse's music video for lead single “Tonic.”

Geologist named his new single “Tonic” in honor of a Keiji Haino show he saw at the now-closed New York music venue of the same name. The song features contributions from drummer Alianna Kalaba and Geologist's Animal Collective bandmate David “Avey Tare” Portner.

“Most of the formative music in my teens was guitar based, and, at that age, you try to play like your favorites,” Geologist said in a statement. “But I was never very good at guitar myself. A couple years ago when trying to come up with a solo hurdy-gurdy drone set to take out on tour, I heard a story about Greg Ginn playing guitar solos over a drum machine. I was coming to accept that whatever drone I could make on the hurdy-gurdy would never live up to when I first heard Keiji Haino play one at Tonic in 1998. So I went the Ginn route instead and wrote this record. I still can't play or write like my favorites, but the hurdy-gurdy got me closer than guitar ever did.”

Geologist worked on Can I Get a Pack of Camel Lights? with Alianna Kalaba, Avey Tare, recording engineer Adam McDaniel, drummers Emma Garau and Ryan Oslance, clarinetist Shane McCord, cellist Mikey Powers, and vibraphonist Adam Lion. In addition, his son, Merrick Weitz, plays guitar on “Government Job.”

Earlier this year, Geologist released a collaborative album with Doug Shaw called A Shaw Deal. The latest Animal Collective album, Isn't It Now?, arrived in 2023.

	Paul Thomas Anderson's One Battle After Another leads all nominations for the Gotham Awards, the NYC event that opens the movie awards season, although star Leonardo DiCaprio was snubbed in the top acting category.


	The Warner Bros thriller saw a record six noms — for Best Feature, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Breakthrough Performer for Chase Infiniti, and Outstanding Supporting Performance for both Benicio Del Toro and Teyana Taylor.


	Mary Bronstein's If I Had Legs I'd Kick You from A24 garnered four nominations in Best Feature, Director, Original Screenplay and Outstanding Lead Performance for Rose Byrne.

	Neon's Cannes Palme d'Or winner It Was Just An Accident by Jafar Panahi landed three noms — for International Feature, Director and Original Screenplay. The distributor's No Other Choice by Park-Chan-wook also had a trifecta with noms in International Feature, Adapted Screenplay and Outstanding Lead Performance for Lee Byung-hun.




			Watch on Deadline		







Bugonia and Hamnet (both Focus Features), East of Wall (Sony Pictures Classics), Familiar Touch (Music Box Films), Lurker (Mubi), Sorry, Baby (A24), The Testament of Ann Lee (Searchlight Pictures) and Train Dreams (Netflix) also landed Best Feature nominations. The Gothams expanded its Best Feature category this year to include 10 nominees, up from five.


	Neon, A24, Mubi, Warner Bros. and Netflix topped the nominations, which were spread among 40 features and 25 performances in 10 categories.

	











	“This year's nominees celebrate an extraordinary year of cinematic achievement — one defined by bold, original storytelling, festival breakouts, and filmmakers whose independent vision extends across studios and streamers. This year's Gotham nominees, and our Gotham Tributes, reflect the year's most accomplished filmmakers and performers and embody the community that has defined The Gothams for 35 years,” said Jeffrey Sharp, Executive Director of the Gotham Film & Media Institute.


	The Gotham Awards aim to elevate independent film and it does spread the wealth among smaller films and distributors. But it eliminated a budget cap for eligibility in 2023 ahead of its 33rd edition, opening the door for big-budget fare from major studios to compete. Previously, budgets couldn't surpass $35 million.


	Nominees were selected by committees of film critics, journalists, festival programmers and film curators. Separate juries of writers, directors, actors, producers, editors and other industry professionals will determine the winners. They will be unveiled at an awards ceremony December 1 at Cipriani Wall Street in Lower Manhattan.


	As reported, the Gothams will also present Tribute Awards to Noah Baumbach, Tessa Thompson, the cast of Sinners and Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein.

no credibility

This is beyond ridiculous. OBAA ain't an indie. With its 150M+ budget it's actually far from it. All the true indies getting shut out for these big studio expensive movies. Yeah I'm kinda done with awards season. Harvey has destroyed it.

They are no longer recognizing independent film making. Sad day for Hollywood.

The Secret agent snubbed in international. So wrong.

Everything about ‘If I Had Legs I'd Kick You' irritates me. The premise, the title, the cast.

	In November 2021, a then-unknown college student named Camilla Araújo appeared in one of YouTube's most-watched stunt videos of all time: MrBeast's $456,000 Squid Game re-creation. Araújo is only in the video briefly, but her dark hair and stunning eyes make her stand out in a sea of contestants in matching green tracksuits. In one viral clip, MrBeast approaches Araújo and asks her if she even watched the original Squid Games show. She admits she didn't. 


	In the end, Araújo didn't win the cash prize, she wasn't even cast as a central star in the video. But when it dropped, fans were captivated by her.


	“I gained like 145,000 followers overnight,” she tells Rolling Stone. “I'm literally the only one that got that much fame from it, even the guy who won the video didn't blow up. It's fate.”


	Araújo has become one of the most well known Gen Z influencers online. She is an OnlyFans star and a former member of the Bop House, a mega viral content house in Florida that consisted of a half-dozen or so OnlyFans stars, including Araújo. On OnlyFans, she attracted fans with explicit content, everything from flirty selfies to full-on sexual acts, available for various rates. But she needed to figure out other ways to pull in new followers. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Over the past couple of years, OnlyFans and the viral fame ecosystem have become increasingly intertwined. Creators on mainstream social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are now making money by driving traffic to subscription-based content. An entirely new crop of Gen Z creators is skyrocketing to fame through the platform. And for Gen Z creators, OnlyFans is quickly becoming the next major social media app to make it big on.

	











	But becoming massive on the app isn't easy. Succeeding on OnlyFans in 2025 often means having a high tolerance for controversy, negative attention, the willingness to troll, and an ability to flip tsunamis of online haters into fans. 


	Amid the pandemic-era lockdowns, more and more people began paying for explicit content online. Soon, creators began to realize that the fastest way to transform online attention into cold, hard cash was to start an OnlyFans. Araújo is perhaps the best example of someone succeeding on this pipeline. She uses provocative and polarizing content on her public, mainstream feeds to generate outrage online, like including her teen brother in her podcast interview clips, or performing as a ditzy character aimed at triggering men. She teases her OnlyFans content with suggestive posts. This content gets views, which means exposure, which results in the growth of her OnlyFans subscription base. (Even her OnlyFans bio seems to lean into this mashing up of the safe and the edgy: “You might have seen me on MrBeasts ‘Squid Games' or maybe you've seen me in the BOP House, but one thing's for sure … You haven't seen me without my clothes on … Why don't we change that?”)

	While she and MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, have radically different business models, they are remarkably similar in their approach to the internet. They are both strategic architects of virality, hyper-aware of what content spreads, why people engage, and how to turn that engagement into revenue. Both spend an enormous time studying the internet and learning trends. They're both extremely data driven and obsessed with optimizing every single last aspect of their content. They're experts at engineering audience behavior, monetizing attention, and driving onlookers crazy. 


	Araújo didn't set out to become an OnlyFans star. Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Brazilian parents, she grew up in what she calls a “household of love, not money.” Her mother worked at Subway and a fish market and her father worked at Domino's. Growing up as the daughter of immigrant parents, Araújo learned how hard it was to get by without money and connections. She taught them English and would go to the grocery store for them as a child, helping out in any way she could. “When they had me they weren't really ready to have a kid at all,” she says. “We were living with my aunt and uncle. But my childhood was filled with so much love and unity.” Araújo kept her head down and graduated in the top 10 of her class in 2020 before enrolling at a nursing program at East Carolina University.

	Soon, like many students there, she began working for Donaldson, whose headquarters is in Greenville. She got the job through a friend and her role mostly consisted of running around grabbing coffee and assisting with production. But she absorbed everything she could. “Me and the Beast crew became really good friends, even Jimmy; to this day, he's such an incredible, incredible person,” Araújo says. 


	Donaldson often relies on staffers to function as extras or performers in his video. After just a few months on the job, Araújo was invited to participate in his massive re-creation of Squid Game. 


The Squid Game video was published at the end of November 2021 and amassed enormous online attention. People Araújo didn't know began to recognize her. Students across campus began discussing the video's success. As the video racked in over 883 million views, Araújo's social following skyrocketed. Within a month, she dropped out of college and quit her job at Beast Productions to pursue content creation full time. 


	But her initial attempts to capitalize on her fame weren't successful. For a year, she grinded on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. She posted lifestyle and comedy videos but struggled to find a niche or figure out a good genre to operate within. “I tried doing YouTube, I was collabing with people in L.A.,” she says. “I failed for like a year straight.” Finally, in the fall of 2022, she said “fuck it” and launched an OnlyFans. She left her family home and moved to Orlando and began to prepare to post risque photos online. 


	“I was so against doing OF,” she said. “There are clips of me being like, ‘I would never.'” She was concerned about the stigma and what people in North Carolina would think, and she didn't want to take what she thought was just an easy road to money. But she quickly realized how much it takes to succeed on the platform. “I've never worked harder my fucking life doing what I do now,” she said. “Yeah, it's easy to start, but getting people to buy [your OnlyFans] you have to promote it.”


	She says that her parents weren't initially supportive of her moving into OnlyFans. “We didn't speak for four or five months,” she recently said on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast, “which in Latin culture that's very, very rare.”


	It took Araújo about a year and a half to pop off. She paid her bills working bottle service at a nightclub and working for a real estate developer. “I would go from my nine to five job, and then I would leave my nine to five and then go straight to my bottle service job, get off at four o'clock in the morning and do it all over again,” she says. “And on top of that trying to make OF work.”

	











	Then came what she describes as her “canon event”: She exited her real estate development job with a $30,000 check, which she claims she received as a settlement for sexual harassment in the workplace. It was a big influx of money, and she decided to use it to move to Fort Lauderdale, where she could better focus on OnlyFans. She moved in with her boyfriend at the time and his best friend, and the three essentially formed a mini content house. 


	Every moment, from sunup to sundown, they strategized on how to go viral. They wrote their goals on the mirrors of their bathroom and developed a formula for getting views: rage bait. 


	Trolling people for attention has become the fastest way to OnlyFans stardom. Some creators, like Bonnie Blue, do it through extreme sex challenges, like sleeping with over 1,000 men in 12 hours. Others, like Ava Louise, do it through viral media stunts, like flashing the New York-Dublin Portal or licking a toilet seat in the beginning of the Covid pandemic. Araújo decided that her particular brand of rage bait would be to play into men's stereotypes about female creators. 


	She knew many men didn't take OnlyFans seriously as a career, so she decided to troll them about that. “When you do OnlyFans, no one likes to think of you as an entrepreneur, they think of you as a slut bimbo,” she says. “I was like, OK, I know how to make a man mad. They hate when a woman who does OnlyFans calls herself an entrepreneur. So I would drill that. I would be like, ‘I'm a CEO. You're working a nine to five, and if you think it's so easy to make money selling your body, why don't you whip it out and show them how it's done?' 


	“I knew how to trigger people by saying things, and it worked,” Araújo says. “It worked every single time, and it still works today.” 


	Like Donaldson, Araújo will also iterate endlessly on her content. If a concept is working, she'll make 10 more videos that are almost identical. “If something works, you never pivot,” she says. “You beat it into the fucking ground.” However, lately she's hoping to expand her content. She recently posted a video where she says that she feels she's outgrown the word “bop” and that she'd rather be known as an “intimate influencer,” noting it's that content that allowed her to afford her new $5 million home. “An absolute marketing GENIUS” reads a top comment on the post with over 28,000 likes. 


	But making people angry online for views comes with consequences. Araújo says that she's recently realized that part of why she's leaned into rage-bait content is as a defense mechanism. It helps her separate herself from her online persona. “When you don't truly put yourself out there on the internet you can't get hurt because they're not hating on the real you,” she says. “I know that it is easier to get someone to hate than it is to get someone to love you. And it's easier to make a check off of people hating you. So I was like, you know what, I'm going to purposely say things that piss people off because I know it'll get views and I know views get money. It's a formula. Anger plus engagement equals views equals money.”

	











	Araújo leveraged drama within the Bop House to grow her podcast, The Camilla Show, which she recently relaunched under the name The Clock It Podcast. (She left the collective in August to start a “new era.”) She invites other OnlyFans stars on to the pod to have raunchy, candid discussions. Clips from Araújo's podcast have racked up millions of views on Instagram. 


	Araújo's long-term goal, however, is to use OnlyFans as a launching pad. She sees OnlyFans today as many young people saw TikTok in 2020, or YouTube a decade ago: It's a platform that hasn't yet been saturated, and there's still room to generate a massive amount of money and fame. Eventually, with enough success online, a content creator will reach escape velocity and become accepted by the traditional entertainment and media world.

	Araújo acknowledged that it may be a rocky road, but she's determined to stay focused on her goals. “I'm 23, I'm going to continue to fuck up,” she said on the Impaulsive podcast, adding that as long as she doesn't “go fucking AWOL and have a Britney Spears moment in two years,” she should be good. 


	“My goal isn't to be confined to being an influencer,” Araújo says, “it's to break into the mainstream media and be a voice and be heard. I want to be everywhere. I want to be unavoidable.”

When Kim Kardashian has a style snafu, it's Naomi Watts to the rescue.

Well, Watts and her trusty lube, that is.

Kardashian has been posting vlogs to TikTok from her recent European press tour for Hulu's “All's Well,” and shared a “fashion emergency” she faced while in London on the platform Monday night.

Sitting in her glam chair, Kardashian FaceTimed Watts, who was getting her hair and makeup done at the same hotel.

“Fashion emergency! Oh my god, you look amazing …” Kardashian told her co-star. “Really quick, I need lube for my latex pants. Do you have any?”

“Oh my God, you've called the right person,” Watts replied.

Watts is the founder of beauty brand Stripes, a company focused on holistic menopause solutions, without the stigma.

One product in her lineup? Oh My Glide Intimate Play Oil, a lubricant formulated with squalane and natural coconut and avocado oils.

“I'm going to send it over!” offered Watts on the video. “Can I send it over with a man? Is that too weird?”

Added the actress, “It'll be on a tray. I am serving you.” (“Serving lube!” Kardashian quipped.)

The style star proceeded to sit on the floor and cover her legs in Watts' intimate play oil before pulling on her second-skin latex thigh-highs (with assistance).

Atop the latex, Kardashian was zipped into a leather bustier dress from Dilara Findikoglu with layered silver necklaces.

The “All's Fair” cast has been serving some serious style on the red carpet during their press tour this fall, but Kardashian's recent vlogs show that they're adorable friends off-screen, too, with relationships that we are living for.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: We're told by sources close to the project that Luca Guadagnino‘s American Psycho reinterpretation won't be gender-swapped. 


	Over the weekend, a report emerged out of the UK tabloids that the lead role of Patrick Bateman — played by Christian Bale in the original film — would be gender-swapped, with Margot Robbie in the frame for that role. Cue minor online frenzy. We're told that that's a non-starter, however.


	Interest has been high in Guadagnino and Lionsgate's reimagining ever since we revealed the package a year ago. Speculation has been rife over who will be cast in the film. Austin Butler and Jacob Elordi have both been rumored online in that time, but nothing has been set so far and casting discussions continue.

	











Chloë Sevigny revealed over the summer that she pitched Guadagnino to reprise her role as Jean but added that the suggestion didn't gain much traction with the filmmaker.

	The Mary Harron-helmed 2000 adaptation starred Bale as Bateman, Sevigny as Jean, and also included Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage, Samantha Mathis and Matt Ross.


Scott Z. Burns is adaptating Bret Easton Ellis' classic novel. Lionsgate is the studio for producer Frenesy Films. Sam Pressman, son of Edward R. Pressman, producer of the original movie, is exec producer through his company Pressman Film.


	The novel by Ellis was a groundbreaking and controversial work when it was published in 1991. The graphic violence of its Manhattan investment banker-turned-serial killer led to it being censored in several countries.


	In the story, “A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.”

	It has been rumored for months and now it has become reality.


Disney+ will be exiting the TARDIS and will no longer be involved with Doctor Who after partnering on two seasons with the BBC plus an upcoming spin-off titled The War Between The Land and the Sea. 


	The BBC just confirmed that the show will continue and will return with a Christmas special in 2026 penned by showrunner Russell T. Davies. Details of future seasons will be announced in due course along with more information on an animation for pre-school children.

	BBC drama director Lindsay Salt thanked Disney for “being terrific global partners and collaborators over the past two seasons, and for the upcoming The War Between the Land and the Sea.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“The BBC remains fully committed to Doctor Who, which continues to be one of our most loved dramas, and we are delighted that Russell T Davies has agreed to write us another spectacular Christmas special for 2026,” she added. “We can assure fans, the Doctor is not going anywhere, and we will be announcing plans for the next series in due course which will ensure the TARDIS remains at the heart of the BBC.”


	Rumors have been swirling for months that Disney+ would exit the deal, which initially ran for two seasons plus the spin-off, totaling 26 episodes once The War Between the Land and the Sea airs next year.


	Estimated to cost around £10M ($13.3M) per episode with Disney money, Davies' regenerated Doctor Who has returned with a bang over the past couple of years along with a bunch of big stars and splashy storylines. Yet it hasnt necessarily rated as well as the BBC might have hoped, and it didn't appear to be making such a big splash on the other side of the pond for Disney+. Deadline recently analyzed official seven-day viewing figures for Season 15 and it did not make easy reading for those involved.












	More than a year ago, our Doctor Who deep dive spoke with connected sources who said the show's future with Disney+ was hanging in the balance, and these rumors only ramped up as the months wore on and the initial deal neared completion. At the same time, Ncuti Gatwa, the 15th Doctor, exited the show under something of a cloud, seemingly handing over the keys to a familiar face in Billie Piper's Rose Tyler. Gatwa later blamed burnout for his exit, which didn't do much to ease the cloud. 


	In a production diary for the latest issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies said the BBC's iconic sci-fi series will never end, but he was less certain about its immediate future following Season 15. “We don't know what's happening yet, and while everyone works that out, I'll take a pause on this page … Hopefully, we'll have news soon,” the showrunner wrote. 


	But the BBC has always made clear that the show will go in with or without Disney. Last week, Jane Tranter, the show's EP and a close friend of Davies's, lambasted a “rude” former Doctor Who writer who had said it was “dead as we've ever known it.” Prior to Disney's involvement, Doctor Who had aired on and off for two decades without a big contribution from American co-producers.


	Tranter's Bad Wolf production outfit, which was given the keys to the Doctor Who contract when Davies took on showrunning duties for a second time, will produce the Christmas special. BBC Studios continues to sell the series around the world.

Whether Disney was going to renew Doctor Who was the only the thing keeping me from cancelling it. Time to start cutting subscriptions. It's amazing how much money flies from my account each month without ever pulling my card out.

I loved the last two seasons and the 4 Specials. Although all that matters to me is the show continues.

I didn't subscribe to Disney. Miss Dr. Who so much. Hope it goes back to streaming on HBO.

It's a shame RTD isn't going too. His return has been a disaster. Ben Wheatley wants a go. I say let him.

Partnership ended because no one is watching it and it made no money or subscribers

Dr. Who is finished, bbc has no money, bye

	Following her latest pic Christy bowing at AFI Fest last week, Sydney Sweeney is looking to deliver another knockout punch with an upcoming film, and partnering with an A-list director to help deliver the blow. Sources confirm to Deadline that Apple Original Films is developing That Man From Rio, a new adventure comedy feature that is set to star Sweeney, with Justin Lin set to direct.


	The film is a modern take on the 1964 French film of the same name, with Lin producing through his Perfect Storm Entertainment along with Oscar nominee Kevin Walsh, who will produce through The Walsh Company under his first-look deal with Apple TV. Chase Palmer penned the script. In addition to starring, Sweeney will serve as executive producer.

	The original pic starred Jean-Paul Belmondo and Françoise Dorléac and follows a young private on military leave who comes to the rescue of his girlfriend, who's been abducted by thieves and brought to Rio de Janeiro. An extravagant adventure ensues. The original was an inspiration to many directors who grew up in the era including Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, who would later credit it as one of the inspirations for the Indiana Jones character.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Sources say Walsh was also a massive fan of the film for years and had been pursuing rights for some time. After securing them, Lin and Sweeney were high on the project and said yes. The role of the title character can expect a lot of attention from plenty of A-listers across town.


	The film marks the latest collaboration for Apple Original Films and Sweeney, who stars in the dramatic thriller Echo Valley alongside Julianne Moore, now streaming globally on Apple TV. The project also reunites Sweeney with Walsh, who produced Echo Valley.


	Under his production banner, Walsh has produced Apple Original Films including upcoming Being Heumann from Oscar winner Siân Heder, as well as The Instigators and Ridley Scott's and multi-Oscar-nominated feature Napoleon.


	Sweeney is repped by Paradigm and Lin is repped by CAA.

What sort of a cinephile isn't a sucker for movies about movies? Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier seems to adhere to that same school of thought, and his latest film is both a wonderful movie on its own and an even better one about making the damn things.

“Sentimental Value,” Trier's follow-up to his beloved “The Worst Person in the World,” reunites Trier with his star Renate Reinsve, and adds in Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and one heck of a wonderful Oslo house to his coterie of major talents. In the film, Skarsgård plays lauded filmmaker Gustav Borg, who long ago abandoned his family (including daughters Nora, played by Reinsve, and Agnes, played by Lilleaas) in pursuit of his career. Turns out, that might have been the wrong choice.

After Nora and Agnes' mother passes away, Gustav returns to Oslo (and the gorgeous family house that has played home to some of their biggest tragedies) and tries to reestablish himself in his family's lives. This would be a tough enough ask without Gustav's other big project: making a film that's (maybe) about his family, definitely includes the casting of a rising American star (Fanning), and seems entirely designed to make Nora (who has become an actress herself) totally nuts.

 










As our own David Ehrlich wrote in his Critic's Pick review of the film out of Cannes, Gustav's “plan — like everything else in the transcendently moving ‘Sentimental Value,' a layered masterpiece that ‘The Worst Person in the World' director Joachim Trier has been working toward for his entire career — is layered with a delicate sense of personal history.” 

He added, “In the first of Trier's films to operate as a family portrait instead of a more focused individual profile, the Borg house will come to assume the gravity of a dying star that gives meaning to the constellation of people who are pulled ever closer towards its orbit. By the time Trier and Eskil Vogt's dazzling screenplay arrives at a final scene whose power is all the more immense because viewers will see it coming a mile away, we're so familiar with the house's energy and layout that any change to it lands with the force of a wrecking ball.”

The film premiered at Cannes in May, where it won the Grand Prix, and went on to play at Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF. Norway has already selected it as its official Oscar entry, and is considered a strong contender in a number of other categories, particularly in the acting categories.

Neon will release “Sentimental Value” in theaters on Friday, November 11. Check out the film's first trailer below.

	When Bad Bunny received the news that he would be headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show, the call came directly from Jay-Z. In the weeks since the history-making feat was announced, several right-wing figures and conservative commentators have slammed Roc Nation, the NFL, and Apple Music's decision to have one of the most successful artists of all time headline one of the most prestigious music events of all time. The fact that Bad Bunny will not be singing in English and has taken clear stances on his politics and on immigration issues only fueled the fire. But Jay-Z isn't buying the backlash.


	“They love him,” Jay-Z said in a video captured by TMZ while signing memorabilia in New York. “Don't let them fool you.” His brief response came after the woman behind the camera insisted that “we gotta talk Bad Bunny,” to which he responded, “I don't wanna talk about nothing.” He caved only when she asked more specifically, “Why are people hating on him?”


	Last week, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the backlash for the first time. “He's one of the most popular entertainers in the world,” he told The Atlantic. “That's what we try to achieve. It's an important element of the entertainment value. It's carefully thought through.”

	Goodell added, “I would say I'm not sure we've ever selected an artist where we didn't have some blowback or criticism. We have hundreds of millions of people watching, but I have full confidence it'll be a good show.” There's a petition floating around to have country singer George Strait replace Bad Bunny as the halftime show performer. Even if all 80,000 people who have signed it so far decide to boycott watching the performance, it's unlikely their lack of participation would make a dent in the Puerto Rican superstar's viewership. 

	











	He won't be there for them, anyway. “What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,” Bad Bunny said in a statement when news of his performance broke. “It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown … this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

"We're convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," the company told staff Tuesday.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Amazon, led by CEO Andy Jassy, is slashing its workforce by about 14,000 roles, the company told employees Tuesday morning.


	In a note to staff from Beth Galetti, senior vp of people experience and technology at Amazon, she said that while the company is doing well, it needs to get leaner and move faster in order to compete, given the rapid changes in technology.




	“What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” Galetti wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We're convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”

	She also noted however that while the company makes cuts, it will also be hiring in other areas, and is giving impacted employees 90 days to find another job within the company, with recruiters prioritizing internal candidates.


	The changes come a few months after Jassy outlined his thoughts on using generative AI at Amazon, telling employees that “it should change the way our work is done.


	“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he continued. “It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

	











	It is not immediately clear to what extent Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video will be impacted by the layoffs, though the note indicated that they would be across the company.

Taylor Swift was caught swooning over her fiancé, Travis Kelce, while attending his Kansas City Chiefs game against the Washington Commanders Monday night.

The singer, who watched from a VIP suite at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo., reacted dramatically as she witnessed Kelce trap a pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes before sprinting to the end zone, per a video shared on social media.

As the heart-racing moment played out, Swift hugged Brittany Mahomes before faking fainting and hugging herself in excitement.

During the game, which saw the Chiefs beat the Commanders 28-7, Kelce scored his 100th career touchdown, making him the fourth tight end in NFL history to hit the milestone.

The pop star tried — and failed — to maintain a fairly low profile as she was spotted in matching ensembles with Brittany.

As for Kelce, he made sure to let her know he appreciated her support by doing the “Fate of Opehlia” viral dance after scoring the touchdown. 

Following the release of “The Life of a Showgirl,” which contains plenty of nods to the podcast co-host, Swift has been spotted showing her support for Kelce's NFL career.

In September, she hid behind a large screen while entering the Chiefs' season home opener game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Then, earlier this month, Swift watched the Chiefs take on the Detroit Lions while joined by Caitlin Clark and Travis' dad, Ed Kelce, in her VIP suite.

After the game, Swift linked up with Travis and his teammates for a celebratory dinner at Kansas City hotspot Prime Social. 

Days later, the “Opalite” singer avoided cameras while cheering for the Chiefs as they beat the Las Vegas Raiders on Oct. 19.

Following the game, Swift emerged for a celebratory outing with Travis and some pals at his and Patrick's restaurant, 1587 Prime.

Swift has been a fixture at the “New Heights” podcast host's games since they started dating in 2023. 

In August, Travis, 36, got down on one knee and proposed to the songwriter, 35.

Page Six reported that the couple is eyeing a summer 2026 wedding date — with rumors swirling that they'll be saying “I do” in Rhode Island.

“They are getting married next summer in Rhode Island. She is in a hurry to have children,” our insider shared. 

Swift famously owns a $17.75 million vacation home in Rhode Island's Watch Hill. Last year, she started extensive renovations on the home — signaling that she and Travis were ready to expand their family.

It remains unclear if Travis will retire from his football career after this season.

	Oct. 30, 2025 will mark the 50th anniversary of the horrific murder of 15-year-old Martha Moxley in the ultra-wealthy enclave of Belle Haven in Greenwich, Connecticut. Found lying under a pine tree in her backyard the next morning, she had been repeatedly bludgeoned with a golf club — and stabbed with a broken piece of it — after a night out looking to cause some pre-Halloween mischief with friends who lived in the neighborhood. Her pants and underwear had been pulled down, though police found no evidence of sexual assault. The brutal slaying rocked the town, where such crimes were basically unheard of. 


	It would be 27 years before Michael Skakel, a childhood neighbor of Martha's and relative of the Kennedy dynasty, was convicted of the crime, but that verdict was thrown out in 2018, deepening a macabre mystery that has remained a source of fascination due to the gruesome details of the slaying and the powerful families involved. Now, half a century after Moxley's death, an explosive new podcast from NBC News Studios and Highly Replaceable Productions is questioning every conclusion that law enforcement, Greenwich residents, reporters, and true crime buffs have drawn about what transpired that cold October night in 1975.

	











	Over a dozen mesmerizing episodes of Dead Certain: The Martha Moxley Murder, veteran journalist Andrew Goldman unravels the narrative from the beginning, with unprecedented access to an archive of case materials as well as candid accounts from people close to the Moxley and Skakel households — and, in a first, revealing interviews with Michael himself. Rolling Stone has the exclusive trailer, offering a sneak peek into this gripping tale of a quiet community turned upside down and put under a microscope.

	It took more than a decade to bring Dead Certain to life, and it shows in the depth of Goldman's reporting. He had to work with the faded memories of certain sources and do without the perspectives of many players who have died since the Moxley murder first seized the national consciousness. It certainly wasn't an easy undertaking. “There have been incredibly low moments during this when I didn't think that I was going to continue,” Goldman says. “It feels a little like victory from the jaws of defeat.”

	At the outset of the series, Goldman explains how he, like many others, had long been convinced of Michael Skakel's guilt in Moxley's brutal slaying (hence the title of the podcast). A Connecticut native himself, and intrigued by stories that invoked the so-called “Kennedy Curse,” he had always maintained a keen personal interest in the case, and embarked on his own investigation after Skakel's cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., hired him in 2015 to ghostwrite a book arguing that Skakel had been wrongly accused. When Goldman did finally sit down with the man who had spent more than 10 years behind bars for the infamous Greenwich murder, the conversation didn't go the way he expected after the countless articles and TV news segments that portrayed him as the entitled, cold-blooded scion of a well-connected family.


	“I found Michael to be very much different than the character portrayed in the media,” Goldman says. “He's funny, and he's a little off the wall. He's ultimately a little damaged. But Michael is somebody who I think has desperately wanted to tell his story, and has become somewhat distrustful of the media in general, so it took a great deal of time to earn his trust. He is one of the most unvarnished, unrehearsed, honest subjects that I've dealt with before — honest to a fault. And I think that you'll probably see that his honesty plays a part in the story as well.” Goldman adds that listeners of Dead Certain will hear how his relationship with Skakel evolved in the course of their interviews, “and how my feelings have changed about him, mostly for better, sometimes for worse.”


	In the podcast's early episodes, Goldman recounts the ways that an investigation into the Moxley killing by local police was thwarted at almost every turn, with one theory after another yielding no viable suspect for arrest. But in time, two teen brothers who lived nearby, Thomas and Michael Skakel, were each considered as the possible killer, in part because the golf club used as the murder weapon belonged to a set owned by their family, and Thomas had been the last to see Moxley alive. That the Skakel boys became part of the story made it all the more sensational, as they were nephews of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, widow of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.

	Nevertheless, the case went ice cold after a few years, and was only revived in the 1990s by another Kennedy family scandal as well as two books from major figures in the O.J. Simpson trial: one was a fictionalized account of the Moxley murder published by the Vanity Fair crime writer Dominick Dunne in 1993, before the Simpson media circus, and the other was released afterward, in 1998, by former LAPD detective Mark Fuhrman. Both painted Michael as the likely killer, with Fuhrman's account relying on materials from a private investigation commissioned by Rushton Skakel, the brothers' father, which found that they had both changed their stories about the night of Moxley's murder. (Interviews with Fuhrman also feature prominently in Dead Certain.)


	A new law enforcement probe, launched in 1998, led to Michael Skakel finally being charged with the crime in 2000. He was convicted in 2002 and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison following a trial in which two of his former classmates at an abusive reformatory school in Maine testified that he had confessed to the murder. (One even claimed he had said, “I am going to get away with murder. I am a Kennedy.”) A lengthy appeals process began, with Skakel's new legal team eventually convincing a judge in 2013 that his original defense counsel had been inadequate, after which he was released on bond and granted a new trial. More legal challenges followed from the state, which at last relented in 2020, declining to retry Skakel.


	Goldman's advantage over commentators including Fuhrman and Dunne, he explains, is that with Skakel's conviction vacated, he could delve into “his entire case file,” including police reports, interview recordings, and other evidence used in the prosecution. “In high-profile murder cases like this, writers are going to be sort of constrained by their sources, and they're never going to have the full picture,” he says of the copious, often sensationalized media coverage leading up to and during Skakel's trial. “I had access to much, much more information. The information is so vast that I think it's impossible for one brain to handle it all.”


	“I think it's impossible not to become obsessed with this story,” says Alexa Danner, executive producer of Dead Certain, which premieres on Nov. 4, with new episodes available weekly. “Every time you uncover one piece of information, you're pulled in a different direction.” She notes that contrary to most true crime sagas, “the trial is almost the midpoint in the story,” which includes “sources of interest that span five decades and multiple generations,” making for endless rabbit holes and baffling twists, not to mention a daunting pool of potential suspects.

	











	While younger listeners unfamiliar with the case will find themselves utterly absorbed in its multiplying leads and maddening resistance to any kind of resolution, those who remember the events will find their impressions challenged, particularly those about Skakel. Though routinely depicted in the press as a rich, spoiled brat, Goldman successfully humanizes him as someone who survived a tough upbringing, addiction, and institutional abuse before he was charged with a crime he continues to insist he didn't commit.

	Whether you believe him about that depends, of course, on your own point of view, and Dead Certain wrestles mightily with the unknowable, questioning our ability to ever get to the truth. Goldman has studied the Moxley murder with an intensity that few if any have ever matched, and even he can't be sure what really happened back in 1975.


	“This one keeps me up,” Goldman says. “After 10 years of working on it, I'm still changing my mind about things.”

No one knows quite what to expect from Apple TV's Pluribus, and that's exactly what series creator Vince Gilligan wants. The psychological sci-fi thriller has had some curious marketing, and even the proper trailer raises questions about its plot. Is it about an apocalypse, an alien invasion, or a disease? All we know is that a virus of some sort has made the population supremely happy, with the exception of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), the only person on Earth burdened with rage, sorrow, and confusion. Gilligan, who reunites with the actor three years after Better Call Saul‘s end, claims he doesn't want viewers to know much more than that in advance of the premiere on November 7. But the Breaking Bad creator does admit that he's been thinking about Pluribus for almost a decade now and rewired the project so that Seehorn could star. The A.V. Club spoke to Gilligan about what drew him to this subject matter, sci-fi inspirations, and how audiences should prepare for Pluribus‘ twisted ride.   

The A.V. Club: How long has this idea been with you? I ask because almost 20 years ago, you co-created a show called A.M.P.E.D. with Frank Spotnitz about an epidemic affecting the planet. What inspired you to stick with the larger concept, and how did it turn into Pluribus? 

Vince Gilligan: Oh, yeah, that show with Frank. You're the first person to bring it up to me. We had created this pilot called A.M.P.E.D. in 2007, so way before COVID. It was about an epidemic that turned people into various things, so it was not like Pluribus per se. It was more of a cop show, and how a robbery homicide division dealt with it. It was like a Michael Mann show crossed with X-Files. That should've been picked up. Anyway, with Pluribus, it's more about a hive mind. For this, I was thinking about a character about eight or nine years ago. I was thinking about a guy who, suddenly, the world is very nice to him, and they love him. He hasn't done anything particularly to deserve it, but they just love this guy. They will do anything for him, anything. I found that very intriguing. I pondered that for weeks and months and then decided, because at the same time I was working with Peter Gould on Better Call Saul, I thought, “Wow, we got so many good actors on this show. But I tell you that Rhea Seehorn, I'd like to work with her again.” I just had the same feeling with her that I did when I worked with Bryan Cranston on his particular episode of X-Files. I had thought to myself that I liked the cut of the guy. Similarly, I thought I could write this show for Rhea. And now I can't wait for the world to see how wonderful she is in Pluribus. Our whole crew feels that way about her. We got a lot of the same folks who worked on Better Call Saul in Albuquerque, so they've known her for 10 years or more now, and they'd crawl across broken glass for her. 

AVC: What aspects of sci-fi did you want to bring to life here? 

VG: I love science fiction. I just grew up watching and inhaling it as a little kid—well into my teens and adulthood, too. I love all the old tropes. I love the wonderful, classic sci-fi stuff like Invasion Of The Body Snatchers and The Twilight Zone and all their twists. So I wanted to give a tip of the hat to those movies and TV shows, but I also wanted to subvert or turn them. And that's what we intended to do with Pluribus. We want people to think they know what's going to happen next—and then, invariably, they're wrong. 

AVC: Carol Sturka is single-handedly trying to fix this global problem. Loneliness is something your other leads, Walter White and Saul Goodman, go through as well. What about this feeling makes for good storytelling? 

VG: I relate to people who feel like outsiders. I think we all do. I often say, “Oh, I'm a lone wolf. I get what it's like to be an outsider.” Hell, everybody does. Everybody feels like that. There might be billionaires out there who feel like underdogs because everybody loves underdogs, everybody loves Rocky Balboa. Human beings like to see themselves like that. Sometimes I walk into a restaurant, and I get this feeling that everybody knows each other, and I'm the only one who's a stranger. That's a very human feeling. So I like a hero who is not fully equipped for the task. Carol Sturka wants to save the world, but it doesn't necessarily need to be done by her. She doesn't need the credit. She just assumes someone else will take the reins of this thing. She's not fully equipped to do it. In the show, it's not at all clear that she will be able to do it. It's not even necessarily clear that the world needs saving. Those are the kind of stories I like, where the audience can say, “You know, I don't know if she's even doing the right thing. I know her heart's in the right place, but is she even doing the right thing?” 

AVC: Is there any narrative reason you chose romance author as Carol's profession? 

VG: I just liked the idea of a writer trying to save the world a lot. I was thinking about different professions, like what if she were a florist or something instead? When you think of someone who saves the world, you'd want a Liam Neeson or a Tom Cruise. You don't want a writer. That's about the last person in the world you want tasked with saving humanity because we're all a bunch of inept idiots. Okay, we're not all idiots, but if you spend your whole life doing that, it means you don't want to be in charge of something of this scale. And then I started thinking about what kind of writer Carol should be. I can say from 30-plus years of experience that screenwriters are boring. And romance authors just seem more colorful, fun, and interesting. 



AVC: Did you choose to direct the two-part premiere to establish the show's specific visual language? 

VG: I just direct because I love it. I'm greedy. It's so much more fun than writing. Writing is probably more crucial and integral to what it is I do, but it's not as much fun. I love directing and being able to say, “I want to do this big thing or set piece.” I put out my hand, and someone puts a hot dog in there. I can say there's not enough mustard, and then I go away, and then the crew makes magic happen. When you're a director, I'm realizing now, it's not unlike Carol being treated so solicitously by the others. You get hooked on it. You're like, “Oh man, I'm looking around and I'm turning in a circle, and 300 people are standing around and me.” You get over the fear of that and realize they're all there to help you and to bring your vision to life. At the beginning, it's just raw fear though. Maybe I'm like dime-store Sigmund Freud here, and maybe that's part of where this idea came from for Pluribus. I wish I could've directed more, but I needed to be in the writers' room and look at the producing aspect of the show as well. 

AVC: How does setting the show in Albuquerque, where Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul also took place, affect the dystopic part of the story? Everything certainly looks deserted and vast. 

VG: The truth and the wonderful thing about Albuquerque is that I love the crew we worked with before. So shooting there is worth the strain and the fear of people wondering if it's set there because of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul and that there must be a connection. No, not really. It probably would have behooved us structurally to set the show somewhere else. But I didn't want to be putting Pennsylvania license plates on all the cars in Albuquerque. I just figured we should rip the Band-Aid off and shoot on location. 

AVC: Since there's limited information about the show and we can't reveal any spoilers, how do you want to set audience's expectations for Pluribus? 

VG: I almost don't want the audience to expect anything. I just want them to be along for the ride and wonder, “Oh, which way is the roller coaster going now?” My heart's desire is not to prepare them at all. The tagline that I used when I pitched to Apple was something like “The most miserable person on Earth tries to save the world from happiness.” But some of my favorite experiences ever of watching movies and TV shows were when I went into them cold. I knew nothing about them. And that was such a good experience. What I not so secretly hope for potential viewers of Pluribus is to relax and say, “All right, the guy didn't want to talk about it much, so I'm not going to go seek out information on it. Tell me when it airs. Tell me when I can watch it on streaming and when it hits Apple TV.” I want people to just [read this] and say, “All right, I'm going to follow his suggestion here and just watch it.” That's how I like watching things, when I don't know much about them.

It's no secret that Donald Trump hates this country and its people. Aside from siccing his underachieving shock troops on American cities, he's also posted AI-generated videos of himself dumping liquid shit on his electorate from a jet christened “King Trump.” As he spends his time stewing and whining that we aren't thankful enough for the president who made the country more violent, hateful, and expensive, he's also knocking down the White House to make way for a 90,000 square foot ballroom that our tech overlords are helping to fund. He's also begun talking much more openly about a third term—though some methods are “too cute” for his liking. On a new Daily Show, Jon Stewart argues that while the ballroom is a good indicator that Trump is gunning for a third term, the fact that he's already made merch is an even greater tell.

Look, these are not optimistic times. We've got a president who hates us, a Speaker of the House who, admittedly, doesn't seem to know anything (Stewart's Mike Johnson impression is an all-timer), and an actively hostile administration that's talking a lot about a third term. We're in the midst of a government shutdown, which the administration doesn't seem too keen to end, because why would they? Meanwhile, the most vulnerable Americans across the country will start feeling the effects of a month-long shutdown when food-assistance benefits run out this week. All of that would be bad enough if we weren't also facing the existential threat of climate change, which, we must say, isn't going to fix itself. Wouldn't you know it, we've missed another “catastrophic tipping point.” As many have said before, living in interesting times sucks.

﻿

But while there's not much to be hopeful about, Stewart did interview New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who has eight days left until the election. The whiplash of cutting from the pure misery of the Trump presidency to Mamdani's infectious optimism can be a salve for the near-constant news of Nazis in government, extrajudicial murders at sea, and listening to Mike Johnson searching for a new way to say, “I haven't read it.” The interview is the antithesis of everything from the opening segment, except for Stewart's Mike Johnson impression, which the host should elevate to a regular bit.

“After the presidential election, there were all these obituaries written about the Democratic Party's ability to motivate young people,” Mamdani said. “And I can tell you what we found in this campaign is that young people have been at the heart of the belief that something could be more than this. I would say throughout the primary, this quote from Ed Koch, ‘If you agree with me on 9 out of 12 issues, vote for me. 12 out of 12, see a psychiatrist.' I'm in Washington Square Park filming a video with David Hogg, and this young guy comes up to me and goes, '12 out of 12, baby, send me away!'”

Ten days after dropping new album Deadbeat, the Australian psychedelic rock band staged its first proper concert since March 2023.


													By
												

	Eric Renner Brown



Tame Impala returned earlier this month with its fifth studio album Deadbeat – and on Monday (Oct. 27) at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, the Australian psychedelic rock outfit returned to the stage with its first proper show since a headlining performance at Lollapalooza Brazil in March 2023.


	But Tame Impala and its creative mastermind, Kevin Parker, have remained busy. After the arena run in support of Tame's fourth album, February 2020's The Slow Rush, was put on ice a couple shows in due to the pandemic, Parker and company returned to the road in late 2021, kicking off two years of heavy touring. Last year, Parker produced much of Dua Lipa's third album, Radical Optimism, and he appeared on two Justice songs, one of which, “Neverender,” won a Grammy for best dance/electronic recording.


	And, with Deadbeat, which continues the evolution of Tame's original psych-rock sound toward more dance-oriented music, Parker notched another milestone: The set's single “Dracula” became his first entry as lead artist on the Hot 100, and currently sits at No. 59 on the tally.


	At Barclays Center on Monday, and backed by the colorful, elaborate production that has become Tame Impala's calling card, the group honored its psychedelic history while running through much of Deadbeat for a career-spanning set that reaffirmed its bona fides as one of modern rock music's biggest draws. To wit, the show was just the first of four Barclays Center gigs for Tame, before it moves on to gigs in Chicago, Austin and California in November.

	Charisma Madarang



Jennifer Lawrence opened up about being hesitant to speak to the press during an interview with The New Yorker published Monday.


	Lawrence, who has been been in the public spotlight since her teens, recalled a conversation with fellow-actor Viola Davis a few years prior. “Every time I do an interview, I think, ‘I can't do this to myself again,'” Lawrence told Davis at the time, adding, “I feel like I lose so much control over my craft when I have to do press for a movie.”


	The Oscar winner was 19 when she landed her breakthrough role in Debra Granik's film adaptation of Winter's Bone and would go on to feature in a series of successful films including her role as Katniss Everdeen in the blockbuster franchise, The Hunger Games, and David O. Russell's Silver Linings Playbook (for which she took home the Academy Award for Best Actress). She soon became just as known for her self-deprecating personality when speaking to the press, and when accepting her Oscar for Best Actress in 2013, Lawrence tripped while walking up the stairs toward the stage — a moment that seemed to cement her status as the forever relatable “cool girl.” Yet when she tripped while walking the red carpet at the ceremony a year later, many questioned if it was all an act, and the public's obsession over her candid demeanor began to sour.

	











	When looking back at this time in her life, Lawrence told The New Yorker, “Well, it is, or it was, my genuine personality, but it was also a defense mechanism,” she said. “I was young, I lived alone, I was being chased,” she said, referring to the rapid paparazzi that would document her every move, noting that at the time she felt “pissed.”

	“That person is annoying,” said Lawrence when referring to old interviews. “I get why seeing that person everywhere would be annoying. Ariana Grande's impression of me on S.N.L. was spot-on.” (In the bit, Grande does an impression of Lawrence during a Celebrity Family Feud sketch, and quips, “I mean, I love Pringles. If no one's looking, I'll eat, like, a whole can.”) Lawrence says the public turning on her made her life feel “uninhabitable.” She continued, “I felt—I didn't feel, I was, I think—rejected not for my movies, not for my politics, but for me, for my personality.”

	Lawrence has addressed her two-year break from Hollywood in the past, telling Vanity Fair in 2021: “I just think everybody had gotten sick of me. I'd gotten sick of me. It had just gotten to a point where I couldn't do anything right. If I walked a red carpet, it was, ‘Why didn't she run?'”

	She has since returned to the silver screen and co-stars in Lynne Ramsay's Die My Love alongside Robert Pattinson. The film, which is based on the 2012 novel by Ariana Harwicz of the same name and is produced by Martin Scorsese, debuts in theaters on Nov. 7.


	“It was one of the more divisive films to play at Cannes this year, to say the least — but everything you've heard about Lawrence's go-for-broke performance is indeed true,” Rolling Stone critic David Fear wrote about the upcoming film — one of the most anticipated movies of the fall. “Unhinged doesn't begin to cover it.”

Briana Culberson is taking fans back to one of the most shocking “Real Housewives of Orange County” moments — the night she married Ryan Culberson in Las Vegas for just $132. In a rare October 24 Instagram post, Briana shared one of only two photos from the spontaneous elopement, giving followers a behind-the-scenes look at the night that left her mom, Vicki Gunvalson, stunned.

A post shared by The Culbersons (@theculbersons)

Briana reflected on her 2011 drive-thru wedding with a heartfelt caption. “Our $132 Las Vegas midnight drive-thru window marriage is 14 years strong!!!” she wrote. “Love you [Ryan]. Thanks for our 4 amazing children and all the adventures so far! And thanks for being my best best friend… This is 1 of only 2 pics we have from our wedding night.”

The RHOC daughter went on to explain how spontaneous the decision was. Briana said she and Ryan were watching Sunday football at Dave & Buster's when they decided to drive six hours to Las Vegas to get married. Along the way, they stopped at Chipotle for dinner and even got a speeding ticket before making it to the courthouse just before midnight.

“Drove right back to Orange County and Ryan was on base at Camp Pendleton at 5 a.m. Monday morning for work,” Briana recalled. “Me: 8 days out from total thyroidectomy [and] Ryan: exactly 1 week home from Afghanistan deployment.”

The surprise wedding was later featured on “The Real Housewives of Orange County” season 7, when Briana broke the news to her mom during dinner. “We've just kind of realized that life is short and we just wanted to be spontaneous and we know what we want,” she said. “A couple of days ago, Ryan and I drove out to Vegas, it was just the two of us, and we decided to go to the courthouse and get a marriage license, then we found a chapel with a drive-thru window and we got married.”

Gunvalson was blindsided by her daughter's announcement and admitted she didn't know how to process it at the time. In a 2012 BravoTV.com blog, she wrote, “I didn't tell any of my family members or my friends because I didn't even know how to begin to discuss it. All of my dreams for my only daughter's BIG DAY were taken away from me in an instant (and for that matter taken away from HER).”

She added that she knew “very little about Ryan” and was shocked to suddenly have “an instant son-in-law.” Despite her initial disappointment, Gunvalson later came to appreciate her daughter's decision.

Just seven months after their Vegas elopement, Briana and Ryan held a formal wedding ceremony in Santa Barbara with their families present. “Briana was glowing and the most beautiful bride I had ever seen,” Vicki wrote. “I went ‘all out' for her… There wasn't a dry eye at the reception.”

Now, more than a decade later, Briana and Ryan are still going strong. They've built a life together in Oklahoma, where they raise their four children — Troy, Owen, Hank, and Cora — on their family farm.

I thought Brianna was leaving her husband due to abuse 🤷‍♀️

The Oscar winner also reflected on her past interviews, calling herself “annoying” and calling Ariana Grande's 2016 impersonation of herself on ‘SNL' “spot-on.” 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Jennifer Lawrence is peeling back the curtain on why she's grown to not be so fond of speaking with the press.


	During an interview with The New Yorker, the Die My Love star recalled telling Viola Davis, “Every time I do an interview, I think, ‘I can't do this to myself again.' I feel like I lose so much control over my craft when I have to do press for a movie.”




	The interviewee later brought up the topic of Lawrence's past articles, to which she responded, “Oh, no. So hyper. So embarrassing.” The Oscar winner was once loved by fans due to her quirky, authentic nature, though online sentiment somewhat turned on her, with some claiming her personality was faux.

	“Well, it is, or it was, my genuine personality, but it was also a defense mechanism,” Lawrence said. “And so it was a defense mechanism, to just be, like, ‘I'm not like that! I poop my pants every day!'”


	She cited Ariana Grande's 2016 impersonation of herself on Saturday Night Live as a time she found herself “annoying.”


	“I look at those interviews, and that person is annoying,” she added. “I get why seeing that person everywhere would be annoying. Ariana Grande's impression of me on SNL was spot-on.” 


	Still, Lawrence said the backlash made things feel “uninhabitable,” noting she felt “rejected” for her own “personality” at the time.

	











	“I felt—I didn't feel, I was, I think—rejected not for my movies, not for my politics, but for me, for my personality,” she explained. The Hunger Games actress has been candid in discussing the evolution of her career, and revealed that she parted ways with her former agency, CAA, as she felt she was viewed more as a “celebrity than an actor” and was “cut off from my creativity, my imagination.”


	“I found out that a lot of filmmakers that I really loved and admired had scripts that weren't even reaching me,” Lawrence told The New York Times in 2022. “I had let myself be hijacked.”


	During The Hollywood Reporter's 2022 actress roundtable, Lawrence addressed on feeling “hijacked” in her career, noting that she was with a “big agency” but also felt like she “was just losing touch with the world a little bit.”


	“I was working so much, and so much of what we do has to do with observing people. I felt like I couldn't really observe anyone because everybody was observing me,” she explained. “And so, taking a few years and getting back to life, I feel like I can be creative again in that sense.”

Kim Kardashian turned heads in a vintage medieval outfit while leaving the Whitby Hotel in New York City on Monday.

The Skims founder rocked a Dominique Sirop Haute Couture Corset ($6,468) from the designer's 1999 fall and winter campaign.

The archive fit featured a massive fur collar draped along the metallic leather corset and a leather tassel skirt. 

Kardashian, 45, sported black pants underneath, accessorizing with black stilettos. 

The “All's Fair” star let her chic fit do all the talking, as she opted out of wearing accessories.

She pinned her hair back in a sleek bun.

Kardashian stepped out in the daring outfit while heading to dinner with pal Simon Huck at the Surrey hotel.

Earlier in the day, the businesswoman stunned in a blue knit two-piece set, featuring a long-sleeved top with a keyhole cutout and maxi-length skirt.

She accessorized her elegant look with silver heels, cuff earrings and multiple rings.

The “Kardashians” star's recent outing comes after she celebrated her 45th birthday in London last week.

She put on a show-stopping display, wearing two sheer dresses designed by Dilara Findikoglu while attending a party at photographer Mert Alas's estate.

The reality star donned a mesh corset with a barely-there bra, and a see-through skirt with chains resting around her hips and a tassel hanging from the front.

Kardashian also wore a braided choker necklace and styled her hair in a braided updo.

Later in the night, she underwent an outfit change, wearing a nude-colored see-through corset with a champagne-colored mini skirt.

Additionally, the “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” alum sported chic mesh gloves and lace-up heels.

This former art world power couple could wind up in court.

Art curator and TV personality Racquel Chevremont has filed a lawsuit for more than $14 million against her ex, celebrated contemporary artist Mickalene Thomas.

The bombshell suit — filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York — comes after Chevremont lodged similar claims in August, and paints a picture of a creative and romantic partnership gone disastrously wrong with “The Real Housewives of New York City” star claiming “uncompensated labor and use of her image,” “damages for sexual harassment, retaliation” and “discrimination.”

“This case is about exploitation and betrayal,” begins the bombshell lawsuit.

Chevremont and Thomas began dating in 2011 and started working together 2012.

But, according to court papers, their romantic relationship ended in October 2020 after what the filing describes as a physical assault without providing any details.

“Thomas subjected Ms. Chevremont to escalating abuse — emotional, and ultimately physical,” claims the suit. “After Ms. Thomas assaulted her, Ms. Chevremont ended their romantic relationship.”

Chevremont — who worked in various capacities for Thomas from modeling for artwork to negotiating contracts — continued her employment. But, her suit claims, things “became increasingly hostile when Ms. Chevremont rejected her advances,” to rekindle the relationship.

According to the suit, Thomas was caught “searching through her purse and cell phone at the studio,” and, the papers say, “When Ms. Chevremont confronted her about this, Ms. Thomas told her that she saw ‘sexy photos' on Ms. Chevremont's phone, which Ms. Thomas claimed to have forwarded to herself,” leaving Chevremont feeling “violated and unsafe.”

The suit also claims that Thomas “went so far as to threaten Ms. Chevremont with physical violence if she were to date other women.”

“Ms. Chevremont was terrified, especially given Ms. Thomas' prior assault,” says the filing.

The suit also accuses Thomas of boasting that she had tapes of Chevremont from their time together.

“Ms. Thomas told Ms. Chevremont that she had had a video camera installed in her bedroom at the time she and Ms. Chevremont were in a romantic relationship and suggested that she would reveal embarrassing photos or videos if Ms. Chevremont did not respond to her questions or keep her informed about her dating life,” claims the suit.

Eventually, according to papers, Thomas “illegally fired” Chevremont and has, “since tried to blackball her in the art world.”

Chevremont is also claiming that she was not paid the correct amount for her work with Thomas, which included, “overseeing contract negotiations, liaising with galleries and collectors, managing commissions, and handling aspects of Ms. Thomas' professional career.”

Chevremont also claims she was not given an agreed upon amount for work Thomas created from her image.

Papers allege that Thomas promised her ex “extraordinary bonuses, including up to $2 million for renegotiating a multi-million art transaction,” with famed collector Jose Mugrabi.

A spokesperson for Thomas told ARTnews, “Mickalene is a world-renowned artist who is the sole author and architect of her decades-long success. The allegations made by her ex-girlfriend are completely false and a desperate attempt to remain relevant and profit off Mickalene's hard-earned reputation, career achievements, and legacy. We will deal with this frivolous and petty exploitation in court.”

Thomas is known for her portraits of black women using acrylic and rhinestones. Her work hangs in NYC's Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art. Her works have sold for seven figures, including one piece showing Cheveremont titled, “Racquel Reclining Wearing Purple Jumpsuit,” that went for $1.8 million at Christie's in 2021.

Chevremont has worked as an art consultant for shows like “Empire” on Fox and HBO's “And Just Like That.”  

Page Six exclusively reported in 2022 that the couple had been split for two years.

Reps for Chevremont did not respond to request for comment.

Catherine Corcoran, the actress whose brutal death scene in “Terrifier” (2016) helped make the smash-hit horror franchise a success, has sued filmmaker Damien Leone and producers for breach of contract. The case was filed in a California federal court on Sunday, beginning legal proceedings that will determine whether Corcoran has been wrongly denied her fair share of profits. 

The lawsuit also alleges extreme working conditions, a broken SAG-AFTRA agreement, and on-set sexual harassment — naming producer Phil Falcone in a reported incident that Corcoran says involved Falcone photographing her nude without her consent while she was trapped in a special effects rig.

“Were it not for Corcoran's willingness to take a risk on this production and receive her compensation on the back-end, the series would not exist as it could not have been made on a shoe-string budget otherwise,” the plaintiff's filing argued. “When it came time to pay what was owed, the producers chose to cheat her. This injustice must be rectified.” 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






An attorney for Leone told The Hollywood Reporter (which broke this story), “Damien and Phil deny the claims in the complaint and will vigorously defend this lawsuit.” Neither responded to IndieWire's request for comment.  

Corcoran claims she's entitled to 1 percent of proceeds from a backend deal that covers ticket sales for all three films in the series — as well as any money made from the licensing and use of “Terrifier” IP. To date, the actress says she's been paid less than $8,400 for her contribution to the killer clown icon.

“Terrifier 2” and “Terrifier 3” were distributed theatrically by Cineverse, and the franchise has a lifetime gross of more than $106 million at the box office. The suit lists major brand names in horror, including Spirit Halloween and Hot Topic, as proof of the artistic success Corcoran's scene helped spark. Dawn's death is currently featured as part of the walk-through “Terrifier” attraction at Halloween Horror Nights.

“The producers of the film paid Corcoran her royalties for a brief period of time several years after the release of the film, but when the film series' success started to grow exponentially and exceeded the producer's original expectations, the royalty payments became more and more sporadic and dwindled to amounts nowhere near commensurate with the revenues generated,” read the complaint, which also lists Dark Age Cinema, Fuzz on the Lens Productions, and the Art the Clown trademark as defendants. 

 










Among the first victims of Art the Clown (David Howard Thornton), Corcoran sys she played Dawn — notoriously vivisected from crotch to cranium, while the actress was suspended upside-down — for just $100 a day. Corcoran's performance reportedly fell under a special SAG contract for ultra low budget performers that, coupled with the terms of a mutual nondisclosure agreement Corcoran's team has submitted as evidence, lead her to believe she would be compensated more robustly if the $35,000 film became a success. The suit claims Corcoran was later told Falcone “didn't keep records.”

“The low-budget nature of the production carried over into the working conditions on set, including long hours in below freezing temperatures in condemned buildings, all without heat and some without bathrooms,” continued the complaint. “The so-called ‘practical effects' that made ‘Terrifier' so compelling on screen involved the director placing prosthetics with actual rat feces on Corcoran's skin and real duct tape over her mouth.” 

“Further, when creating the silicone mold for Corcoran's body cast, the producers of the film required Corcoran to lie nude on a piece of plywood while she was covered with a quick-drying liquid silicone agent,” the court document said. “However, the process was done incorrectly and the silicone dried and essentially glued Corcoran to the plywood, requiring a long, painful process to remove the dried silicone from her body. To make matters worse, Falcone took numerous still photographs of Corcoran's nude body while she was glued to the plywood sheet without her consent.”

 










The case further challenges the terms of Corcoran's employment on “Terrifer,” arguing that Leone and producers never got her written approval for the nude scene as required by SAG. The actress claims that Leone, Falcone, and more “Terrifier” contributors have continued to profit off the unauthorized use of her nude image by using it to sell products. Corcoran says the sawing scene for “Terrifier” took ten hours to shoot and caused blood to pool in her head, resulting in reported cranial swelling and eardrum damage. 

The public disagreement comes on the heels of more “Terrifier” controversy, involving the treatment of sequel stars Lauren LaVera and David Howard Thornton earlier this year. Neither actor has commented on the case. Production on “Terrifier 4” has not yet started and the film does not have a distributor.

A new theological debate is unfolding in the Vatican after the pope's chief astronomer said he would be ready to welcome extraterrestrial beings into the faith.

The remarks have reignited discussion about how religion might adapt if life beyond Earth is ever confirmed.

Father Richard D'Souza, newly appointed head of the Vatican Observatory in Castel Gandolfo near Rome, told the Daily Star that he believes any intelligent life elsewhere in the universe would still belong to God's creation.

“They are all part of God's creation. They would be children of God. I believe in a benevolent Creator. He is behind everything,” he said.

The astronomer-priest explained that theology would have to evolve. “Theology would have to redefine itself and take into account these other beings,” he said.

When asked whether he would baptize an alien, Father D'Souza replied without hesitation: “Yes, yes.” 

He added that all beings capable of faith would be eligible for the sacrament.

“We believe baptism must be performed,” he said. 

“The question is how to reach them, or how they will reach us. These are practical problems to solve before we even start talking about baptism.”

Although no contact with extraterrestrials has occurred, the Vatican scientist remains optimistic. He believes researchers may prove the existence of alien life “within the next 30 years.”

Father D'Souza now works under Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Prevost, who has revived papal summers at Castel Gandolfo, the traditional retreat that also houses the Vatican Observatory.

The observatory, founded centuries ago, has long served as the Catholic Church's bridge between science and faith. 

Under Leo XIV, that dialogue may extend beyond Earth itself, as Vatican scholars explore how spirituality might embrace life from other worlds.

They're everyone's favorite haunts.

This Halloween, scream-seeking globe-trotters are traveling the world in search of the scariest hotspots. To expedite their pilgrimages, online casino SpinBlitz surveyed travel sites to narrow down the most bone-chilling meccas worldwide, finding that Salem, Massachusetts, came in at number one when it came to haunted hubs.

There's never been a better time to visit spooky locales. According to the gambling platform, Ghost tours, eerie overnights, and “haunted experience” packages now generate up to 20% of local tourism revenue in some destinations.

And many of the Halloween pilgrims likely aren't just seeking surface-level screams — a staggering 41% of adults believe in ghosts, and one in five (20%) say they've experienced something paranormal, per the gambling site.

To narrow down the spookiest spots around the globe, SpinBlitz initially created a seed list of the most frightening destinations using multiple travel sources, including Lonely Planet, Trip.com, and Condé Nast Traveller. 

They then rated them according to their TripAdvisor ratings, including only those with 1,000 or more reviews in the final ranking

SpinBlitz then made sure all the places were Halloween-appropriate by ensuring they had a “paranormal reputation, factoring in folklore, historical legends, and documented ghost reports alongside visitor reviews.”

“This approach allowed us to highlight destinations that combine both high traveller satisfaction and authentic spooky appeal,” they wrote.

Number one on the countdown was Salem, Massachusetts, with a score of 4.9 out of 5.  According to the site, the city's haunting legacy from the 1692 Witch Trials scares up over 1 million visitors each October, with 87,500 people crowding its streets on Halloween night in 2024– a record breaking 37% increase from the previous year (2023).

“Despite its small population of about 44,000 residents, Salem braces for up to 100,000 tourists per weekend, as ghost tours, psychic fairs, and costumed parades flood its narrow colonial streets,” the site writes. “Sites like the Witch House and the Salem Witch Trials Memorial buzz with eerie energy, while flickering lanterns and fog rolling off the harbor create a movie-perfect backdrop.”

Also known as Hyundai Castle, the eerily Gothic Corvin Castle (4.9/5) in Hunedoara, Romania is where they imprisoned Vlad the Impaler, the real-life inspiration for Dracula who was known for shishkebabing his victims on wooden stakes.

Each year, the stronghold is visited by 275,000 visitors annually, with a “noticeable spike every October as Dracula fans and paranormal seekers descend on its dungeons,” SpinBlitz writes. Ghost hunters have reportedly documented “temperature drops of 5°C in sealed chambers and recorded unexplained whispers in the dungeon of the tower.”

Clocking a score of 4.85 of 5, the Lizzie Borden House in Fall River Massachusetts is known as “America's Most Haunted House.” It is reportedly best known for being the site of one of America's most notorious unsolved murders: On August 4th, 1892, Andrew and Abby Borden were found murdered in their Fall River, Massachusetts home after reportedly being hacked to death by an axe.

As their daughter Lizzie was never found guilty, rumors have swirled regarding the real culprit. Today, ghost-hunting groups “claim over 70% of overnight EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena) sessions capture unexplained noises.”  

“Each October, the Borden House's grim authenticity and chilling silence make it an unnerving overnight, especially for those brave enough to sleep in the ‘murder room,'” they wrote.

More than 200,000 crosses, crucifixes, and rosaries adorn this hill in Šiauliai, the culmination of mementos left by pilgrims since the 19th century. 

A haunting monument to faith, defiance, and mystery, the hillock draws around 100,000 visitors a year with “many arriving in autumn to witness the eerie beauty in October.” 

“Locals report ghostly figures and glowing lights among the crosses at night, a reminder that this sacred site also carries centuries of resistance, death, and devotion,” SpinBlitz writes.

It's no secret that number five on the countdown is the Tower Of London, best known as the site where over 125 people were executed and countless others tortured in various barbaric ways over the course of a millennium.

The site draws 3 million people annuall,y while “October tours sell out weeks in advance, as guests hope to glimpse Anne Boleyn's spectral figure or the ‘White Lady' seen waving from the tower windows.”

“Paranormal logs from UK ghost societies note over 200 separate ghost sightings on record since the 19th century, making it statistically one of the most haunted places in Europe,” SpinBlitz writes.

For the first time, a team of scientists has found a “statistically significant” correlation between historical UAP reports and nuclear weapons tests.

The researchers analyzed historical photographs taken by the Palomar Observatory in California, and they uncovered a number of mysterious bright spots in the night sky. 

They observed these transient objects in images captured between 1949 and 1957, before any satellites were ever launched into Earth's orbit. 

Fascinatingly, the new findings lend weight to popular notions regarding UFOs. Historically, UFO – or UAP – sightings have been linked to nuclear weapons tests. The team's study has also gone through the peer review process, lending weight to the statistical findings.

For decades, anecdotal reports and pop fiction have linked UFO sightings to nuclear weapons tests. Conspiracy theorists claim intelligent aliens might be observing humanity's weapons capabilities. Anecdotal news reports, dating back to 1947, meanwhile, have linked the sightings to secretive nuclear technology tests.

Now, the new study provides a compelling statistical link between nuclear weapons tests and UFO reports. The peer-reviewed paper, published in the journal Scientific Reports, details a study performed by the Vanishing and Appearing Sources during a Century of Observations (VASCO) project.

The initiative analyzes archives of historical images for objects that have either disappeared in the present day or flashed only briefly (transient) in the night sky. Transients are star-like objects that appear in one photo and are gone by the time another image is captured of the same region of the sky. 

Though the origin of transients is unknown, scientists have proposed several theories. They could be small pieces of asteroids, for example, imaging artifacts caused by plate defects in cameras, or unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). UAP is the new official name for UFOs.

For their study, the researchers compiled a dataset of images spanning 2,718 days. They compared the image dates to those of transient sightings, above-ground nuclear tests, and UAP reports.

They found that transients were 45 percent more likely to be observed within a day of a nuclear weapons test. The number of transients also increased significantly on days where there were UAP reports. To be precise, transient activity increased by 8.5 percent for every reported UAP sighting.

“Our findings provide additional empirical support for the validity of the UAP phenomenon and its potential connection to nuclear weapons activity, contributing data beyond eyewitness reports,” the researchers wrote in their paper.

While the scientists don't know what the transients are, they do claim their study practically rules out the camera plate defect theory. This is due to the extreme improbability that camera errors would correlate with specific historical dates.

The transients are also unlikely to be caused by nuclear bomb debris, as they often occurred a day after nuclear tests. Debris would likely fall from the sky a short time after detonation. 

The new study is the first time a statistical link has been documented between UAP reports and nuclear weapons tests. The statistically significant association between UAP reports, nuclear weapons tests, and UAP reports suggests we may not be alone in the universe.

Although the original show is over, Supernatural lives on with a brand-new sequel. Running for fifteen seasons between 2005 and 2020, Supernatural is probably one of the most beloved genre series of all time. Its blend of Americana mythology and character-driven drama earned it a level of success and devotion few long-running TV shows manage to maintain for so long. 

Now, five years after Supernatural's series finale, the franchise refuses to stay buried. Supernatural lives on through its passionate fans and its ever-expanding mythology. In 2025, Dynamite Entertainment will honor that enduring legacy with a brand-new comic continuation, taking readers back to the Winchesters' early days and the roots of their story. 

Supernatural is officially returning in 2025 in comic book form. On October 29, Dynamite Entertainment's Supernatural #1 continues Sam and Dean Winchester's story from the pen of Star Wars: Darth Vader and Planet Hulk writer Greg Pak, with art by Spider-Man: The Lost Hunt artist Eder Messias. The series features covers by Clayton Crain, David Cuosens, and Eder Messias, plus a photo variant of the original cast for each issue. New issues will be released monthly, keeping fans hooked all through the fall and beyond.

Set between the first and second seasons of the hit TV series, Dynamite's Supernatural comic series will take readers back to the early days of Sam and Dean Winchester's journey. The brothers find themselves investigating a wave of mysterious fires in a crumbling town, where a factory explosion at Windler Industries leads to a mystery surrounding the company's own employees. As usual, the Winchesters must uncover the malevolent force behind the fires.

The following month, the second issue takes a tonal shift toward the playful, as Sam and Dean attempt to raise funds by gambling their last few dollars at a casino. There, Sam befriends a mysterious woman who turns out to be a siren. What begins as a night of fortune quickly spirals into chaos, with the brothers forced to decide whether this sympathetic monster can truly be trusted.

The third issue adds an undead twist to the series. This time, the Winchesters travel to Massachusetts, where they team up with a group of LARPers who have survived a paranormal attack. While details about future issues remain secret, each chapter follows the same self-contained, episodic format as the original TV show.

The Supernatural comic series slots neatly between season 1 and season 2, a crucial and emotionally raw period for the Winchester brothers. At this point, Sam and Dean have just survived the catastrophic car crash that ended Supernatural season 1 and are still reeling from the loss of their father, John Winchester, who sacrificed himself to save Dean's life. The brothers are burdened by grief, but they're ready to face the destiny they've inherited as hunters of the supernatural.

Dynamite Entertainment's Supernatural comic interquel takes place before the Winchesters uncover the full truth about Azazel and Sam's mysterious psychic connections, meaning they're still operating in the relatively grounded phase of their journey. The world hasn't yet expanded into Heaven, Hell, or the Apocalypse, It's still the early, gritty Supernatural where the brothers rely on instinct and their battered Impala.

Dynamite's new Supernatural comic series continues the legacy of the franchise's earlier comic runs. Either explicitly or implicitly, they're all canon to the television series. The first of these, 2007's Supernatural: Origins from WildStorm, follows John Winchester's transformation into a hunter after the death of his wife Mary, with a look at Sam and Dean's childhood. 

Following Origins, 2008's Supernatural: Rising Son gives readers a closer look at Dean's growth as a hunter. Rising Son bridges the gap between John's early crusade and Dean's development into the skilled, world-weary brother seen in the show. It highlights the unique relationship between the two brothers and their father's relentless mission, themes that Dynamite's comic series will revisit, though now from the perspective of the brothers carrying the same weight alone for the first time.

The timeline continues with 2010's Supernatural: Beginning's End and 2011's Supernatural: Caledonia from DC Comics, which follow Sam's departure for Stanford and his solo experiences in the United Kingdom. The upcoming Dynamite series returns the focus to the brothers working together.

Even after fifteen seasons, multiple spinoffs, and several comic book tie-ins, Supernatural's world remains full of untapped stories and unexplored corners of its mythology. The Winchesters' hunt revealed only a fraction of the strange creatures and haunted towns lurking across America. Comics offer the perfect medium to expand this lore, bringing back obscure monsters and revisiting past characters.

Future comics could easily expand the Supernatural universe beyond the brothers themselves. New stories could follow new hunters and creatures, or offer fresh perspectives on familiar supernatural entities. Supernatural's mythos is an endless source of potential stories for future sequels, prequels, and spinoffs to explore. Just like Sam and Dean's journey, the Supernatural franchise is far from over despite receiving a definitive conclusion.

The ocean has always been a source of mystery, fuelling conspiracy theories and igniting both fear and fascination. As a result, the belief that extraterrestrial activity takes place in the vast waters is nothing new, but now, new sightings suggest these speculations might be a dangerous reality.

Thousands of sightings of Unidentified Submersible Objects (USOs) have been recorded by Enigma, a popular UFO-reporting app. The worrying observations have consequently sparked worries of invasion, with senior US Navy officials warning there may threats to national security.

As of August, Enigma has recorded over 9,000 unexplained sightings occurring within 10 miles of US coastlines or major bodies of water, 500 of which were within just five miles.

More than 150 reports described objects either hovering above or entering the water, the New York Post reported. California, with 389 reports, and Florida, with 306, topped the list of states with the most USO sightings, both ranking among the three states with the longest ocean coastlines.

Among the most unusual incidents is a phone camera video reportedly capturing mysterious green lights moving beneath the ocean's surface. The app has also published maps showing clusters of reported sightings, marked as orange dots stretching along both the east and west coasts.

Enigma, which describes itself as the “largest queryable historical sighting database for global UFO sightings,” says it has collected reports of more than 30,000 Unidentified Flying Objects and Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP) since its launch in late 2022. UAPs are observations of events or objects in the air, sea, or space that cannot be immediately identified as conventional aircraft or natural phenomena.

However, these sightings are not confined to the skies. As showcased by the recent observations shared on Enigma, there are also many accounts of mysterious objects emerging from the ocean depths or diving into the water “without so much as a splash”.

Concerns were sparked in July 2019 when the USS Omaha documented a UFO/UAP that disappeared into the ocean without a trace after flying near a Navy fleet off the coast of San Diego. This incident was just one of several unexplained encounters reported during that period, as US Navy vessels, including the USS Omaha, were reportedly encircled by up to 100 UFOs over a one-month span, according to a filmmaker who has unveiled several astonishing videos of the enigmatic crafts.

Investigative filmmaker Jeremy Corbell previously shared radar footage on his Instagram, showing nine unidentified objects appearing on the USS Omaha's radar on July 15, 2019. This followed a video of a spherical craft vanishing into the ocean near the same US Navy ship.

Corbell had also released footage of pyramid-shaped UFOs swarming the guided missile destroyer USS Russell during the same period in summer 2019. Despite the numerous releases, there is a general consensus that this was just the tip of the iceberg, amid the release of the Pentagon UFO report.

Speaking to Daily Star, Corbell revealed that dozens of unidentified objects swarmed nine warships within a 100-mile radius in July 2019. He said: "It was reported to me that there were 50 to 100 unidentified that were swarming many of the ships.

“Over radio they were talking back and forth and experiencing similar types of contacts. One was hovering above, optically the same as the others.

"But it was stationary above each ship that was experiencing this and then there were a number of other UFOs performing figures of eights and circles swarming around these ships.” UFO sightings are nothing new, and are often dismissed as nonsense by much of the scientific community or relegated to the realm of science fiction.

However, retired Navy Rear Admiral Tim Gallaudet warned that UFOs capable of seamlessly transitioning from air to sea could have “world-changing” implications, The Post reported. He wrote in a report last year: “The fact that unidentified objects with unexplainable characteristics are entering US water space and the DOD is not raising a giant red flag is a sign that the government is not sharing all it knows about all-domain anomalous phenomena.”

The DOD is the Department of Defense, the federal agency responsible for national security and the US military,

                            Oscar Piastri has made his feelings about McLaren's approach to racing clear.                        

Oscar Piastri says he and McLaren need to “analyse” the changes made to his driving style in Mexico after he lost the lead in the championship to his teammate Lando Norris.

Piastri's recent struggles, with the Australian unable to keep pace with Norris in Austin and again in Mexico City, have led to conspiracies that McLaren is favouring the Briton, with fans on social media going as far as to call it sabotage.

⦁ Australian racer ready to ‘analyse' after ‘difficult' Mexico City weekend
⦁ Piastri defiant after losing the lead in the Drivers' standings
⦁ All to play for in final four race weekends with 116 points up for grabs

It led to Norris being booed on the podium after winning the Mexico City Grand Prix, where the lead in the championship changed hands between the McLaren teammates as Norris took 15 points more than Piastri to move ahead by one.

While Norris led from lights to flag in Mexico, Piastri had a more difficult afternoon, as starting P8 and losing three places on the opening lap, he spent much of the grand prix in dirty air. He finished in fifth place, but a whopping 40 seconds down on Norris.

Rather than cry foul, Piastri wants to “analyse” after McLaren put his struggles in Mexico, and also in Austin, down to his driving style in hot conditions when cars are sliding.

But given he was in traffic for much of the race, even at the very end when a VSC prevented him from chasing down Oliver Bearman for fourth, he cannot say whether the changes he made to his driving style on Sunday actually worked.

“It's difficult to say ultimately,” Piastri told PlanetF1.com and other media outlets after the grand prix.

“I think we certainly tried a lot of different things, but at the back with cars as well, so it was difficult to kind of get a read on whether what I was changing with my driving was working that well or not.

“But ultimately, yeah, we'll have to analyse it and see if it looks good and in terms of the numbers and stuff, because, from a feeling point of view, when you're behind that many cars, it's very difficult to tell.

“It wasn't so much the pace of the car, because the car was pretty quick this weekend. It was more just trying to unlock it, and I felt like I potentially made some steps in doing that.

“But yeah, ultimately, when you're behind so many cars and trying to fight for so long, it's difficult to measure that a little bit. So hopefully we'll get a bit more indication from some of the data.”

Piastri put it down to a learning experience, saying: “For some reason the last couple of weekends has required a very different way of driving.

“What's worked well for me in the last 19 races has needed something very different the last couple of weekends, and trying to wrap my head around why has been a bit of a struggle.

“But ultimately, today was about trying to experiment with some of those things because, I would agree, I think driving the way I've had to drive these last couple of weekends is not particularly natural for me.

“So it's been about trying to exploit as much as I can.”

👉 McLaren issues final four-race prediction in wake of conspiracy theories 

The 24-year-old believes he will have a lot more to exploit in the final four races of the championship.

Brazil and Qatar will both hold Sprints, meaning there's also the opportunity for an extra eight points.

Asked how he was feeling ahead of the run-in to Abu Dhabi, Piastri admitted: “Difficult to know what to expect. I think clearly the pace in the car has been strong this weekend, just have not really been able to unlock it that much.

“I think we'll clearly learn, if there was some things to learn, if we changed some things today and made progress with that, and yeah, I think if I have then that'll leave me relatively happy.

“If there's still some things to learn, then back to the drawing board.”

Pressed on how he can regain the lead in the standings, he simply replied: “Find some more pace and win some more races.”

With a solitary point separating the McLaren teammates, and 116 still up for grabs in the final four race weekends, it's all to play for in this year's title race.

And McLaren appears ready to play.

Having won the Constructors' Championship, Norris predicted that the gloves would be a little looser in the run to the title, and while they briefly tightened on his wrists after he clobbered into Piastri in Singapore, any repercussions were erased when Piastri returned the favour – although in different circumstances – in the Sprint in Austin.

McLaren called it a “clean slate”.

It's now about pace, and to an extent, elbows. Ideally McLaren would like to avoid the latter as a collision between the two would open the door for Max Verstappen, it's now all about Norris v Piastri, Piastri v Norris.

May the quickest driver win.

	The Augenschein-produced movie stars Sandra Guldberg Kampp, Helena Zengel, Lucie Zhang, Lily Taieb, Tracy Gotoas, Elina Löwensohn and Zlatko Burić

The Playmaker has taken international sales rights to Nikias Chryssos' English-language debut, the supernatural body-horror pic “Bloody Tennis.” The Playmaker will launch international sales on the film at the American Film Market in Los Angeles.


	The film, which is produced by Augenschein, was written by Chryssos. The Greek-German filmmaker broke out with his 2015 feature “Der Bunker,” which debuted at Berlinale and won the Next Wave Award for best feature at Fantastic Fest in Austin. His second feature film “A Pure Place” was developed in the Résidence du Festival de Cannes and premiered at the Munich Film Festival, where it won the award for best director.

	“Bloody Tennis” stars Sandra Guldberg Kampp (“Foundation”), Golden Globe nominee Helena Zengel (“News of the World,” “The Legend of Ochi”), Lucie Zhang (“Paris, 13th District”), Lily Taieb (“The French Dispatch,” “Bergman Island”), Tracy Gotoas, Elina Löwensohn (“Schindler's List”), and Zlatko Burić (“Triangle of Sadness”), with an original score from Jim Williams (“Titane,” “Raw,” “Possessor”).




			Popular on Variety		







	The horror film takes the world of elite sports to disturbing new extremes, filled with brutal ambition, blood-sucking leeches, and hard-hitting serves. After being admitted to an elite tennis academy hidden deep in the south of Europe, Sophie (Guldberg Kampp) must contend not only with the fierce brutality of her teammates but with the school's increasingly sinister undercurrents, where competitive sports are taken to their extreme and only the hungriest survive.

	











	The film is a German production, produced by Jonas Katzenstein and Maximilian Leo (“The Assessment,” “Mother Mary”) of Augenschein in co-production with Port au Prince Film & Kultur Produktion, which also acts as the German distributor, and ZDF. It is supported by Film-und Medienstiftung and German Federal Film Fund (DFFF).


	Moritz Hemminger, head of sales and acquisitions at The Playmaker, said, “We are delighted to be working with the prestigious Augenschein team. In ‘Bloody Tennis,' Nikias Chryssos once again demonstrates his original style as a director, which is why our international distributors can look forward to a wild, bloody, and highly entertaining horror film.”


	Jonas Katzenstein, producer at Augenschein, added, “Nikias Chryssos' films are unmistakable in their visual style—intoxicating, absurd, and darkly comic. He consistently confronts audiences with bold, disturbing visions that challenge and reward in equal measure. We are thrilled to continue working with such a singular talent, and to partner with The Playmaker and the extraordinary filmmaking team who brought this wild ride to life.”

Unraveling the mysteries of how the world might end is fascinating and terrifying. It's a topic that sparks our imagination, challenges our understanding, and forces us to confront our own mortality. While some theories seem like pages ripped from a science fiction novel, they often have roots in genuine scientific inquiry.

The Big Freeze, or heat death of the universe, suggests that one day, the universe might cool off to the point where it can no longer sustain processes that increase entropy. This theory relies on the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or disorder, will continue to increase in an isolated system. As the universe expands, stars will burn out, galaxies will drift apart, and eventually, no new stars will form — leading to a cold, dark universe. It's a slow, quiet demise that's the exact opposite of a fiery apocalypse.

According to a paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters, understanding dark energy is crucial to predicting the universe's fate. Dark energy's role in accelerating the universe's expansion could mean it's expanding faster than anything we currently understand. If this expansion continues unchecked, the Big Freeze might be inevitable. It's a reminder that while the universe seems constant, it's anything but.

In stark contrast to the Big Freeze, the Big Crunch envisions a universe that ultimately collapses in on itself. Imagine gravity overpowering the universe's expansion, pulling everything back into a super-dense point, similar to how the universe began. This theory is a cosmic reversal, where galaxies coalesce, stars collide, and space itself contracts. It's a dramatic, albeit hypothetical, return to the primordial state of a singularity.

The Big Crunch concept stems from Einstein's equations of general relativity, which allow for a closed universe model. In this scenario, the universe isn't infinite but instead has a finite volume. If the density of the universe is high enough, gravitational forces could eventually halt the expansion and reverse it. Whether this will happen depends on the universe's current density and the mysterious properties of dark energy.

The Big Rip theory paints an even more chaotic picture, where the universe is torn apart down to its atomic components. This scenario occurs if dark energy's influence grows over time, causing expansion to accelerate to catastrophic speeds. Galaxies, solar systems, planets, and eventually atoms themselves could be ripped apart as the fabric of space itself disintegrates. It's a violent, tumultuous end that underscores the power and mystery of dark energy.

A study published in Physical Review D explored the dynamics of the Big Rip, focusing on the equation of state for dark energy. If this energy is truly phantom energy, with a state parameter less than -1, the Big Rip becomes a genuine possibility. Researchers continue to probe the nature of dark energy to better understand these potential future scenarios. While unsettling, the Big Rip theory challenges our perception of cosmic stability.

Among the more familiar doomsday scenarios is the asteroid impact theory, reminiscent of the fate believed to have befallen the dinosaurs. Earth is susceptible to impacts from asteroids and comets, some of which could have catastrophic effects on the planet's climate and life. While NASA and other space agencies track near-Earth objects to mitigate this risk, the threat remains a possibility that captures the public's imagination. It's an example of how external cosmic events can dramatically alter life on Earth.

The Chicxulub impactor, which struck Earth approximately 66 million years ago, serves as a stark reminder of the devastation such an impact can cause. It created a crater over 150 kilometers wide and is believed to have led to mass extinctions. Modern-day efforts like NASA's DART mission aim to test our ability to deflect potentially hazardous asteroids. These proactive measures reflect how seriously the scientific community takes the threat of asteroid impacts.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the universe's most powerful events, capable of unleashing more energy in seconds than the sun will in its entire lifetime. If a GRB were to strike Earth, it could strip away our planet's ozone layer, exposing life to harmful solar radiation. These bursts are typically the result of collapsing stars or neutron star collisions, events that occur billions of light-years away. However, a closer occurrence could have dire implications for life.

Research in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters discusses the potential for GRBs originating within our galaxy, though they are exceedingly rare. Scientists estimate the probability of a nearby GRB affecting Earth is low, but not zero. This rarity makes GRBs a lesser-known but scientifically intriguing end-of-world scenario. As we learn more about the cosmos, understanding phenomena like GRBs remains a priority for astrophysicists.

The eruption of a supervolcano could be a planet-altering event, producing enough ash and sulfur dioxide to block sunlight and trigger a "volcanic winter." This reduction in sunlight could lead to global cooling, crop failures, and mass extinctions. Earth is home to several supervolcanoes, such as Yellowstone, which scientists monitor closely for signs of increased activity. While the odds of an imminent eruption are low, the potential impact is substantial.

The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 provides a historical example of a volcanic event affecting global climate. Known as the "Year Without a Summer," it led to widespread agricultural problems and food shortages. Understanding supervolcano dynamics helps scientists predict and potentially mitigate the consequences of future eruptions. It's a stark reminder of Earth's powerful geological forces and their capacity to shape life.

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, some scientists and thinkers propose a scenario where AI surpasses human intelligence and gains control. This hypothetical point is known as the technological singularity, where AI capabilities grow beyond our ability to manage or contain them. The fear is that a superintelligent AI might prioritize its goals over humanity's welfare, leading to unforeseen consequences. It's a modern twist on age-old fears of technology outpacing human control.

A report from Stanford University's One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence highlights both the potential and the risks associated with AI development. While AI can improve lives and drive innovation, unchecked advancements could pose risks if ethical considerations are not prioritized. This balance between innovation and safety is a key focus of AI research communities worldwide. Navigating this future requires careful planning and robust ethical guidelines.

Arguably the most pressing issue facing humanity today is the threat of climate change and its potential to create severe environmental and societal disruptions. As greenhouse gases accumulate, global temperatures rise, leading to extreme weather events, sea level rise, and ecological shifts. If left unchecked, these changes could make parts of the planet uninhabitable, trigger widespread food and water shortages, and drive mass migrations. It's a slow-moving crisis that demands immediate action.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regularly releases assessments detailing the potential impacts of climate change. Their reports emphasize the need for global cooperation to reduce emissions and transition to sustainable energy. The science is clear: without significant intervention, climate change could trigger cascading effects that challenge the resilience of human societies. Addressing this existential threat requires a unified global effort and long-term commitment.

The global experience with COVID-19 has underscored the vulnerability of human societies to pandemic outbreaks. A highly contagious and lethal virus could potentially wipe out large portions of the global population. The interconnectedness of today's world facilitates the rapid spread of diseases, while factors like urbanization and encroachment on wildlife habitats increase the likelihood of zoonotic diseases. It's a stark reminder of the delicate balance between humans and nature.

Experts emphasize the importance of investing in public health infrastructure, research, and global cooperation to prepare for future pandemics. Vaccination programs, surveillance systems, and rapid response teams are crucial components of pandemic preparedness. The lessons learned from past outbreaks, including COVID-19, highlight the need for vigilance and adaptability. Addressing the threat of pandemics requires a comprehensive and proactive approach.

Nuclear war remains one of the most immediate and devastating threats to humanity, with the potential to cause immense destruction and loss of life. Beyond the initial devastation, the aftermath could include a "nuclear winter," where soot and debris block sunlight, leading to global cooling and agricultural collapse. Despite the end of the Cold War, the existence of nuclear arsenals continues to pose a significant risk. It's a grim reminder of humanity's capacity for self-destruction.

Efforts to reduce nuclear arsenals and prevent proliferation are ongoing, but geopolitical tensions can complicate disarmament. Treaties like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) aim to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, while advocating for peaceful nuclear energy use. Maintaining peace and preventing nuclear conflict requires constant diplomatic engagement and international cooperation. The threat of nuclear war continues to underscore the need for global stability.

The idea of a robot uprising may seem like science fiction, but as technology advances, the line between fiction and reality blurs. Concerns about robotics and AI extend beyond technical malfunctions to include ethical considerations and human dependency. Could robots become self-aware and decide that humans are unnecessary or even a threat? It's a scenario that prompts reflection on our reliance on technology and the potential consequences of ceding too much control.

Discussions about robotics ethics focus on ensuring that machines are designed with safety, transparency, and human well-being in mind. The development of autonomous weapons and surveillance systems raises additional concerns about control and accountability. Ensuring technology serves humanity, rather than the other way around, is an ongoing challenge. It's a reminder of the importance of integrating ethical considerations into technological advancement.

An alien invasion is a staple of science fiction, but it also raises genuine questions about the possibility of extraterrestrial life and its intentions. While there's no evidence of hostile aliens, the discovery of intelligent life elsewhere could have profound implications for humanity. Would they come in peace or view us as a resource to exploit? This scenario highlights the uncertainty and curiosity surrounding the search for life beyond Earth.

The SETI Institute focuses on seeking evidence of extraterrestrial life, emphasizing the importance of preparing for potential contact. Discussions often revolve around the protocols that would guide humanity's response to alien contact. The discovery of microbial life within our solar system could change our understanding of life's uniqueness. While an invasion seems unlikely, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to expand human horizons.

Solar flares, or massive bursts of solar energy, have the potential to disrupt Earth's magnetic field and technological systems. A particularly strong solar storm could knock out power grids, disable satellites, and disrupt communication networks on a global scale. While life on Earth wouldn't end, the resulting chaos could lead to economic and social upheaval. It's a reminder of our reliance on technology and the vulnerabilities inherent in our interconnected world.

The Carrington Event of 1859 was the most powerful solar storm on record, causing widespread telegraph system failures. Modern societies are even more dependent on electronic infrastructure, making us more vulnerable to similar events. NASA and other space agencies monitor solar activity to provide early warnings of potential solar storms. These efforts aim to mitigate impacts and ensure that critical systems have safeguards against solar disturbances.

The prospect of Earth encountering a rogue black hole is both terrifying and captivating. Black holes are regions of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. If a black hole passed close to our solar system, it could potentially disrupt planetary orbits or even draw Earth into its inescapable grasp. While this scenario is highly unlikely, it fascinates scientists and underscores the unpredictable nature of the cosmos.

Astrophysicists study black holes to understand their properties and the forces at play in and around them. Observations from instruments like the Event Horizon Telescope provide insights into these mysterious objects. While the likelihood of a black hole encounter is minimal, ongoing research helps demystify these cosmic giants. They remain one of the universe's most intriguing phenomena, inspiring awe and curiosity in equal measure.

Mankind's desire to see into the murky future has been reflected in literature for centuries.

No Greek hero worth their salt would venture forth on a quest without first consulting an oracle. Soothsayers and witches provided foreshadowing in Shakespeare's plays, and the literature of the nineteenth century was rife with supernatural references to card readings, palmistry, crystal gazing, and scrying.

The interest in fortune-telling shifted a bit in the twentieth century, and while many books on the subject were published as parlor game guides, some novelists used mysticism as social commentary. Including a female character who was also a mystic was a way of illuminating the limited roles for working-class women, for example.

Our fascination with what fate has in store gave rise to plenty of frauds and charlatans. The hope and doubt behind every psychic reading or fortune cookie slip is what makes the topic both layered in complexity and vastly entertaining. It's the stirring of emotions—evoking ghosts of the past while trying to determine what lies ahead in the future—that make fortune telling a perfect theme for a mystery novel.

My interest in the topic began in New Orleans sometime in the mid 1980s. I was vacationing with my family when I noticed a man sitting on the sidewalk outside the restaurant we were bound for. It wasn't in my nature to talk to strangers, but I was oddly drawn to this person.

I couldn't tell you what he looked like, but I can remember his finger tracing the lines of my palm. He told me I would not follow my passion right away. I would spend years doing other things first. Eventually, however, I would have a career as a storyteller.

He told me my husband's name would start with “T,” and that I would have two children. He was right about all of this and more. Some of his predictions were positive. But some hinted at grief and specific disappointments I'd yet to experience.

Inspired by this stranger from my past, I added a psychic medium-turned memoir author to my upcoming novel, The Tattered Cover. I wanted readers to question the veracity of Lara Luz's abilities while also being captivated by her personal history. Whether she can hear messages from the dead is less important than her relationship to the living. After all, only those existing on this side of the veil are capable of committing murder.

As the days grow shorter, and readers find themselves cradling mugs of hot tea or adding another log to the fire, the question of what to read next might rise up the chimney to mingle with the autumnal air:

There's no need for consult a Magic 8 Ball or look under the couch cushions for quarters for Zoltar's machine. I can answer that question for you here and now with a list of mysteries and thrillers you'll want to add to your TBR pile.

No list of fictional psychics would be complete without mentioning one of my favorite Stephen King novels, The Dead Zone. When Johnny Smith wakes after a long coma, he's surprised to find that he has clairvoyant abilities that are activated by touch. Johnny brings warmth and sensitivity to some very dark situations.

It's no wonder this novel was adapted for film (starring Christopher Walken) and for television (starring Anthony Michael Hall). Some stories age well, and this is one of them.

King isn't the only author to create a protagonist with a life-changing brain injury. In Lisa Unger's collection of short stories, The Whispering Hollows, Eloise Montgomery survives the terrifying accident that claimed the lives of her husband and eldest daughter.

Though injured and grief-stricken, Eloise is determined to heal and lend strength, love, and support to her youngest daughter. However, it's hard to Eloise to find firm footing in the face of her new and unsettling psychic abilities. As Eloise's tale unfolds, it is unclear whether these abilities are a gift or a curse.

Unger's fictional town in upstate New York is so vibrant that it's practically its own character, and each investigation will have readers becoming more and more invested in the people and mysteries of The Hollow.

Agatha Christie was also fond of fortune telling themes as evidenced by the following short stories: “The Séance,” “The King of Clubs,” and “The Blue Geranium.” In the novel Dead Man's Folly, Poirot attends a village fête where he receives a reading from a fortune teller named Madame Zuleika. The prediction is rather chilling considering the hosts of the fête, Sir Goerge and Lady Stubbs, intend to stage a mock murder mystery. It's all fun and games until someone ends up dead.

Moving from a village fête to a literary festival on the island of Alderney, one of Anthony Horowitz's prime suspects in A Line to Kill is a blind psychic named Mrs. Abbott. Abbott claims to hear voices from the spirit world and is just one of several rather eccentric suspects who confound ex-detective Daniel Hawthorne and long-suffering crime writer, Anthony Horowitz, in this quick-paced locked-room mystery.

Cozy readers will revel in Victoria Laurie's Psychic Eye Mysteries featuring amateur sleuth, Abby Cooper. This long-standing series currently boasts seventeen entries, a testament to Laurie's ability to infuse Abby's character with charm and vulnerability and to entrance fans with clever puzzles, a dash or romance, and the fascination of Abby's intuitive readings.

Not only is Laurie a prolific novelist, but she is also a practicing psychic medium. To learn more about her services, visit https://www.victorialaurie.com.

Finally, no list about fictional psychics would be complete without the Harper Connelly series by Charlaine Harris. After being struck by lightning, Harper can sense things about the dead.

And while she may know how these poor souls met their end, she cannot identify their killers. Luckily, she and her stepbrother, Tolliver, make it their business to solve crimes and bring closure to the living (for a modest fee).

I hope this list guides you toward a future of suspenseful and thought-provoking reads.
