If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Paxton, who is running for U.S. Senate next year, issued a press release alongside the lawsuit claiming that his litigation is in line with President Donald Trump's “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) initiative, which many critics have blasted for ignoring research and having a generally anti-science approach. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. “These corporations lied for decades, knowingly endangering millions to line their pockets,” Paxton said in a press release. One analysis of the lawsuit noted that it echoes claims from plaintiffs in a previous federal lawsuit that was dismissed last year due to witnesses' assertions being deemed unreliable. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has supported Trump's actions to relabel Tylenol and other products containing acetaminophen, has contradicted the president's claims that the drug is dangerous, noting that “a causal relationship” between acetaminophen and post-birth autism rates “has not been established.” Although Paxton's lawsuit cites studies that suggest an association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism may exist, these studies do not conclude any causal links and call for more investigations into the matter. Medical experts have said that higher rates are likely due to more effective screening processes and an expanded definition of autism. Multiple studies suggest the connection between acetaminophen and autism is not a causal one. A recent analysis examining 46 separate studies, for example, advised against broad limitations of acetaminophen use during pregnancy, calling for a “balanced approach” for pregnant people to treat pain and fevers, and noting that leaving those symptoms untreated can lead to additional — and sometimes dangerous — complications. Focusing on addressing structural factors, strengthening public assistance, and addressing environmental health and climate change would improve the health of everyone, especially autistic people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USDA could continue funding food stamps during the shutdown by using an available contingency fund, Democrats said. If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation. Several other government websites, which are managed by the executive branch, feature similar messages blaming Democrats. The USDA's site, however, is unique in that it includes disparaging language and misinformation regarding immigrants and trans people in its blame game tactics. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” the USDA site reads. USDA further states that Democrats are holding out “for healthcare for illegal aliens” — a misleading claim that Republicans have continuously pushed since the start of the shutdown that is false, given that undocumented immigrants are legally barred from enrolling in federally funded health programs — and “gender mutilation procedures” for transgender people, a derogatory way of describing some gender-affirming care procedures that some trans people (though certainly not all) may undergo. Democrats are refusing to support a continuing resolution to fund the government with hopes that they can negotiate the restoration of at least some of the health care funding that was cut by President Donald Trump's “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act earlier this year. Political experts have noted that the messages on these sites are likely in violation of the Hatch Act, a federal law that bars certain federal employees and government agencies from partisan activity. A recent memo from USDA says it will not use those funds, claiming they are strictly for emergency situations such as natural disasters. “Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people,” reads a letter sent to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins by all 214 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Critics are also blasting the Trump administration's decision to use transphobic messaging on its websites. It's one thing to scapegoat transgender people while out of power; it's another to keep doing so when your party controls every branch of government, and voters are watching their groceries — and their patience — run out. … This administration and all that champion of it should be ashamed,” Cotter said. Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power and cut against the mainstream narrative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Avalos allegedly posted a video with crosshairs over Bondi's face and a $45,000 reward for her death, FBI says A man from Minnesota with a history of past convictions has been arrested and faces federal charges for allegedly using social media to threaten the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, by suggesting he would pay $45,000 for her death. According to an FBI affidavit viewed by the Guardian, Tyler Maxon Avalos posted a TikTok video featuring a photo of Bondi with a “sniper scope red dot” on her forehead, with text reading: “WANTED: Pam Bondi. The caption on the post also reportedly read: “*cough cough* when they don't serve us then what?”. The affidavit alleges that Avalos's TikTok username included a “symbol for anarchy” and that his TikTok page linked to an “anarchist FAQ book”. Court records show that the current charges in this case were filed on 16 October and Avalos made his initial court appearance the following day. He was granted release from custody under several conditions, including GPS monitoring, a curfew, no travel outside Minnesota, no possession of a firearm or alcohol consumption, continued mental health treatment, and restrictions on his internet access. Daniel Gerdts, the attorney representing Avalos, said in a statement that his client “is not guilty of any crime”. “He has not yet been indicted, moreover, and our hope is that the grand jury rejects the frivolous charge,” he said. Last week a man who was pardoned by Donald Trump for his conviction in the US Capitol attack was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill the Democratic House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries.</p>

The four boats were hit on Sunday in three different strikes, Hegseth said in a social media post announcing the matter. His said the boats were “known by our intelligence apparatus, transiting along known narco-trafficking routes, and carrying narcotics”. He also acknowledged there was a survivor. In perhaps an effort to avoid the legally thorny questions that could come with detaining that person, Hegseth said the US enlisted Mexico to take on search and rescue responsibilities – which Mexico accepted. Hegseth sought to justify the attacks by comparing the US strikes against alleged drug traffickers to conducting strikes on al-Qaida targets during the global war on terror. “The Department has spent over TWO DECADES defending other homelands. These narco-terrorists have killed more Americans than Al-Qaeda, and they will be treated the same. For one, when the US killed al-Qaida members, Congress had authorized the use of force. In targeting drug cartel members, the administration has relied on Trump's article II powers to defend the US against an imminent threat. Sign up to This Week in Trumpland The supercarrier has dozens of F-18 Super Hornet jets that increase the offensive firepower and ability for the US to hit air-defense systems in Venezuela. That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said. “The land drugs are much more dangerous for them. It's going to be much more dangerous. Asked whether he would declare war against the cartels, Trump suggested he would continue with individual strikes. “I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” he said.</p>

Arrest of criminal justice council's Linsey LaMontagne comes as 277 people have died on Nevada roads in 2025

The director of a committee in Nevada tasked with solving criminal justice issues including aspects of DUI arrests now faces a charge of driving under the influence herself.

Linsey LaMontagne, the director of the Clark County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council (CJCC), which covers the area encompassing Las Vegas, was arrested by a Nevada state police highway patrol trooper last April, the investigations team at the local TV news station KLAS revealed on Monday.

The CJCC describes itself as a body of police, judges and other community leaders that wants to provide “a voice for those [affected] by the criminal justice system, to include at-risk communities, families, and victims”.

However, KLAS reported that LaMontagne was arrested after another driver called police after spotting a swerving car swerving, including driving off the road approximately five times.

Documents obtained by 8 News Now said the trooper stopped LaMontagne, and she told him she was a county employee and “had two [shots] of Tito's vodka while downtown” at a casino.

LaMontagne was then arrested and told the trooper he had “ruined her life”.

LaMontagne later pleaded not guilty to DUI and reckless driving charges.

“The county is aware of the criminal charges against this employee; however, there is an adjudication process that needs to be completed prior to the county taking any adverse employment action, should that occur,” a county spokesperson told KLAS.

LaMontagne's arrest came as 277 people had died on Nevada roads in 2025 through September, mainly from impairment and speeding, according to information attributed to the state's traffic safety office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia outnumbers Ukrainian troops eight-to-one in their offensive to capture the semi-surrounded city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Oct. 27. "(Russian troops) have devoted such forces to the Pokrovsk (sector) that Ukraine cannot devote to one direction (of the front) — one to eight people," Zelensky told journalists in a briefing, Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne reported. After capturing Avdiivka, a long-time Ukrainian stronghold located over 40 kilometers (about 25 miles) southeast of Pokrovsk, in February 2024, Russian troops have gradually advanced toward Pokrovsk, once a key Ukrainian logistics hub tucked away in a relatively safe part of Donetsk Oblast. Russian troops have surrounded Pokrovsk from three sides, leaving about a 15-kilometer (about nine miles) gap for the Ukrainian military to bring in troops and supplies, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. Stoiko said that the Ukrainian military lacks "everything," from engineering equipment to engineers themselves who could build temporary wooden bridges to allow evacuations. Western military experts who previously spoke to the Kyiv Independent said it would be crucial for Ukraine to withdraw timely when it stops tactically making sense for its troops to hold onto the city despite the crippled logistic routes. Despite lacking manpower, the Ukrainian military has repeatedly held onto cities that Russia was about to occupy, resulting in a chaotic last-minute withdrawal where the wounded were often left behind. Pasi Paroinen at the Finland-based open-source analytical organization Black Bird Group, said that his group believes that Ukraine should have withdrawn from Pokrovsk by around mid-Summer, especially after Russian forces approached towns such as Rodynske just north of the city. Paroinen assessed that it could be "weeks" till Russia occupies most of Pokrovsk, but the timeframe is difficult to predict because it depends on how long the Ukrainian military command would insist on holding onto it, and whether there would be Ukrainian counterattacks. "But in practical terms like the situation is that the Russians are really now pushing into Pokrovsk in force," Paroinen said, stressing that they are now starting to gain a like a substantial hold over the city. He elaborated that the long heavy fogs days with suitable wind conditions that help provide coverage from drones have likely allowed Russian forces to use mechanized assaults and to push "more aggressively" into Pokrovsk with infantry. The Ukrainian military admitted on Oct. 26 that Russia has accumulated about 200 servicemen in Pokrovsk, infiltrating small infantry groups, reporting shooting and drone battles in the city. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify his claim. Asami Terajima is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent covering Ukrainian military issues, front-line developments, and politics. She previously worked as a business reporter for the Kyiv Post focusing on international trade, infrastructure, investment, and energy. Originally from Japan, Terajima moved to Ukraine during childhood and completed her bachelor's degree in Business Administration in the U.S. She is the winner of the Thomson Reuters Foundation's Kurt Schork Award in International Journalism 2023 (Local Reporter category) and the George Weidenfeld Prize, awarded as part of Germany's Axel Springer Prize 2023. The incident occurred on Oct. 17 near Camp Reedo, which plays an important role in the rotation of U.S. forces stationed in Estonia. 76 in St. Petersburg after a new case was opened against her for holding an "unauthorized" public event, according to independent Russian outlet Mediazona. German newspaper Die Welt's chief reporter Ibrahim Naber and his team came under a Russian Lancet drone attack while working in eastern Ukraine on Oct. 13, injuring him and two other crew members. Attaching drone footage of the claimed attacks, HUR said in a Telegram post that its "Ghost" special forces unit "systematically" targeted Russian air defense systems. Russian forces have used drones to hunt and displace civilians from their homes near the front line in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 27, citing a new UN inquiry presented to the General Assembly. Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil producers, announced Oct. 27 that it plans to sell its foreign assets after new U.S. sanctions targeted the company and its subsidiaries. The pair allegedly gathered intelligence on Polish military personnel and infrastructure, including transport hubs used to supply Ukraine with foreign military aid. Seventeen children and teenagers were rescued from temporarily occupied territories as part of the president's Bring Kids Back UA initiative, Andriy Yermak said in a Telegram post on Oct. 7. Russian missile attacks on Kyiv over the weekend destroyed the warehouse of one of Ukraine's largest pharmaceutical distributors and a production facility of a popular coffee chain, reportedly causing at least $100 million in damage and losses.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian soldiers walk past a vehicle recently struck by a Russian FPV kamikaze drone near Kostiantynivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine, on Oct. 16, 2025. After two and a half months of intense fighting, the red rabbit-ear-looking shape on the battlefield map of Donetsk Oblast is gone for good. Compared to the dramatic alarm of mid-August, when hundreds of Russian troops pierced through a porous and chaotic defense and advanced over 15 kilometers beyond Ukrainian lines, Kyiv can now let out a final sigh of relief as the situation in the sector has been decisively stabilized. But, despite efforts by President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Ukrainian military leadership to portray it as one, this operation was not a successful counter-offensive, but rather a costly and high-stakes, rapid-reaction operation of the type often described in Ukraine as "fire-fighting." Meanwhile, though they weren't able to dig in and advance further this time, the circumstances and conditions on the front line that allowed Russian forces to push so far, so quickly — despite the drone-saturated battlefield — raise major concerns for the viability of Ukraine's defensive fight going forward. Having pushed Ukrainian troops out of Russia's Kursk Oblast for good, Moscow returned in spring 2025 to its immediate strategic aim in the full-scale war against Ukraine: to overrun the remainder of Ukrainian-held Donetsk Oblast. Two major Ukrainian cities stood in Russia's way, as they continue to do so now. Over spring and summer, having failed in frontal assaults on both cities, Moscow concentrated forces to drive a great wedge right between the two, looking to outflank and compromise the defenses of both. By June, Russian forces had decisively crossed the highway between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and were increasingly tightening their grip on logistics routes into both Ukrainian cities. Over 2025, the ever-increasing domination of drones on both sides of the battlefield has meant that, despite Ukraine's chronic manpower shortage, particularly in the infantry, Russian forces have failed in almost all attempts to mass either vehicles or even infantry in large numbers for a breakthrough. Albeit slowly, the Russian army has adapted to these changes, instead favoring infiltration tactics, sending infantry forward in groups of two or three, or sometimes alone, to seep between Ukrainian positions while relying mainly on stealth and concealment. These new tactics have caused problems for Ukraine's defense all across the front line this year. Perhaps the most important factor in Russia's initial success was its choice of where to make such a daring move. With numerous ravines and tree lines running from north to south, the area immediately east of Dobropillia provided natural corridors of concealment where advancing Russian infantrymen could move up the battlefield through thick summer foliage, largely undetectable to Ukraine's dense network of reconnaissance drones. Unlike most standard Russian small-group attacks, where the assault groups try to bypass Ukraine's kill zone of drones and overrun Ukrainian infantry lines, these Russian soldiers instead looked to bypass enemy positions and push deeper and deeper at every opportunity. As commanders fighting in the area explained to me, Russian troops also showed a more deliberate, more sophisticated use of drones — both for resupplying their assault groups and for providing immediate tactical reconnaissance in the form of drone pilots attached to pairs of infantrymen. This, of course, was all backed by overwhelming, debilitating Russian firepower, particularly the use of longer-range strike drones and fiber-optic FPVs to strangle Ukrainian logistics, as well as heavy glide bombs launched in their hundreds at Ukrainian positions in the area in the lead-up to the attack. On top of that, Russia identified a weak point in the Ukrainian defense, where two usually competent but exhausted brigades of the National Guard struggled to coordinate combat operations among a disjointed mix of other assigned units. These tactics, together with where they were directed at, are what allowed Russian forces not only to push several kilometers beyond the Ukrainian first line of defense, but to advance so much deeper. Once the first Russian infiltration groups broke through, Ukraine's defenses were quickly thrown into disarray. Not only were the infiltrating Russian infantrymen difficult to spot in the first place, but once spotted — often deep in a unit's rear — the situation was often not reported truthfully by commanders, neither higher up, nor to neighboring units, as commanders told me. Relied upon by observers both inside Ukraine and abroad, the DeepState mapping project, led by a small Ukrainian team in close contact with commanders across the front line, saw that what they were hearing from the Dobropillia sector was vastly different from how events were being portrayed through official channels. Two red prongs — those same infamous north-facing "rabbit ears" — appeared on the map, all the way up to the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz and the main road between Dobropillia and Kramatorsk, which had been used daily by Ukrainian logistics as little as a month earlier. In turn, together with the new drone control of logistics routes that would come if such gains were consolidated, this could have meant a rapid decline in Ukraine's prospects of holding on to any of Donetsk Oblast. With the breach occurring just as U.S. President Donald Trump hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a showy and fruitless attempt to talk peace, a collapsing front line in Donetsk Oblast would have been the strongest possible card Moscow could take to any future negotiations. Elite Ukrainian units of all shapes and sizes — from the powerful 93rd Mechanized Brigade, boosted by a strong prisoner component, to brigades of the Air Assault Forces, Special Forces, and newly organized assault regiments — Kyiv threw almost everything it had available, and the kitchen sink, at the problem. By August 16, the General Staff reported 910 Russian soldiers killed in action in the area, while photos of those who had surrendered to Ukrainian forces emerged on social media. In a couple of settlements, including Kucheriv Yar, Russian soldiers held out for months longer, but by then they had long been cut off from the Russian rear, without any hope of relief. On one hand, despite the manpower shortage and an almost complete lack of strategic reserves in the fourth year of Russia's full-scale war, Kyiv is clearly still able to throw serious weight around to respond to the most urgent crises on the front line. But with no immediate end in sight to hostilities, and with Russian infiltration and drone tactics only improving, the story of Dobropillia is an advanced warning sign of the consequences of Ukraine's land forces being as overstretched as they are. Since August, while Dobropillia has stabilized, Russian gains have picked up speed in almost every other key sector of the front line — from once-liberated Kupiansk and Lyman in the north to Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in the south, and of course in Pokrovsk itself, where over the past week hundreds of Russian troops have broken into the city limits. It remains to be seen if, when, and where the next Dobropillia-style breach could happen. For Ukraine, the task is clear: to make sure that such a crisis does not become a larger collapse next time — they will have to be ready. Francis Farrell is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moscow is ready to discuss European security issues with the EU; Russia offers new opportunities for cooperation with ASEAN nations; and Russia-North Korea cooperation remains at a high pace. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia. However, the West needs to change its confrontational approach. Meanwhile, some Western countries appear to share Russia's position. In particular, Hungary's foreign minister is expected to take part in the Minsk International Conference on Eurasian Security. Russia and Belarus plan to engage as many countries as possible in the development of a future Eurasian Charter of Diversity and Multipolarity in the 21st century. Russia is ready to work together with Europe to build a system of Eurasian security, the Foreign Ministry's Ambassador-at-Large Alexander Trofimov told the newspaper. According to him, some European countries have shown an interest in the initiative. He emphasized that it's impossible to ensure stability around Ukraine without building Eurasian security. Brussels believes that it is strengthening its security by confronting Moscow, yet in reality, Europe can stay safe only through dialogue with Russia. Earlier, Russia sent an invitation to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to join the future Eurasian Charter. Work is also underway to coordinate positions with China. "We believe that the situation will inevitably change. The Minsk meeting will undoubtedly be very important in this regard. Cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) states is one of Russia's foreign policy priorities, Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told Izvestia. Meanwhile, the West may try to undermine any initiative, an informed source says. Vietnam, in particular, has promised to reduce China's participation in its exports to the US, political scientist Viktor Pirozhenko pointed out. On the other hand, in his words, Chinese manufacturers know how to circumvent US restrictions. Still, Vietnam and other nations are interested in attracting capital not only from China and the US but also from Russia, the expert added. That said, the current international situation is opening new opportunities for Moscow. This is not accidental because the region, which has a population of over 650 million, is a major market for Russian goods. The region is an important buyer of fertilizers and agricultural goods because Southeast Asian countries face certain food security issues. The Eurasian Economic Union and Russia can be key suppliers here, strengthening both food and energy security of these nations, Alexander Korolyov, deputy director of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at the Higher School of Economics, emphasized. Russia is gradually abandoning the US dollar, turning to the Chinese yuan in trade not only with China but also with other Southeast Asian nations, Rudenko told Izvestia. What makes the yuan strong is China's expanding trade with many countries, said Nikolay Marchenko, director of the non-profit organization "Eurasian Youth Projects.” “China's rising investment activity in various parts of the world is another reason. The foreign ministers of Russia and North Korea, Sergey Lavrov and Choe Son Hui, have held talks in Moscow. North Korea's top diplomat was also received by President Vladimir Putin, who asked her to pass his greetings to her country's leader Kim Jong Un, Vedomosti reports. After that, she held talks with Lavrov in the summer of 2025, when he made a trip to North Korea. The Russian foreign minister also met with Kim then, describing bilateral relations as an "unbreakable brotherhood," and saying that Moscow would take Pyongyang's interests into account when expanding relations with North Korea's neighbors. Apart from ties in the field of defense and security, which culminated in Korean People's Army troops participating in the liberation of Russia's Kursk Region, the two countries are also increasing cultural, educational and economic relations, along with cooperation in agriculture and the energy sector. When it comes to bilateral relations, Russia and North Korea don't factor in the events taking place in third countries, Ilya Dyachkov, associate professor with the Department of Oriental Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations, believes. "We have our own agenda and work plans; we are developing bilateral ties in various areas, which have grown a lot in recent years," he pointed out. This comes as no surprise because allied relations between Russia and North Korea have reached a level where direct military assistance is provided, Dyachkov stressed. Recently, she also welcomed the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee's approval of three anti-Russian bills, which particularly make it possible to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism. However, the US president will apparently focus on new sanctions against Russia's financial sector for now, while Congress will save the above-mentioned bills for later, said experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta. "It seems US President Donald Trump intends to keep the negotiation process with Russia under his own control. Besides, according to her, there is much talk about expanding restrictions on Russia's financial sector, so such sanctions are likely to be introduced. Donald Trump has clearly entered a new stage where he is beginning to apply sanctions instruments, while until recently, he confined himself to verbal statements against Moscow. As for the congressional bills, primarily the initiative to add Russia to the list of state sponsors of terrorism, Congress has been discussing it in one form or another since 2014. Washington is also unlikely to use it until it decides that nothing matters anymore: after us, the deluge. Still, I hope this time will never come," the expert concluded. Just a few years ago, analysts included it in the top three worst developing currencies due to a sharp weakening, but this year, it has been recognized as the world's most successful currency with a prolonged period of strengthening, Nezavisiamya Gazeta writes. However, there are also strong factors playing against the ruble. According to the expert, foreign capital flows to Russia have been blocked almost completely, major exporters have reduced foreign currency sales and inflation is increasing. Marina Nikishova, chief economist at Zenit Bank, expects that declining currency sales by the Central Bank will increase pressure on the ruble in 2026, along with a drop in export revenues stemming from a potential fall in oil prices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A plane crash killed 11 people, mostly foreign tourists, in Kenya's coastal region of Kwale early Tuesday while en route to the Maasai Mara National Reserve. The airline, Mombasa Air Safari, said in a statement eight Hungarian and two German passengers were onboard, and that the Kenyan pilot was also killed. The plane crashed in a hilly and forested area about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Diani airstrip, authorities said. The airline did not confirm what time the aircraft departed Diani airstrip, saying the pilot failed to communicate upon departure and the airport control tower tried to reach him for 30 minutes before the plane was located. Investigating agencies were looking into the cause of the crash that happened at 05:30 a.m. local time, Kwale County Commissioner Stephen Orinde told The Associated Press. There was heavy rain in coastal Kenya at the time. The aircraft burst into flames, leaving charred wreckage at the scene, officials said. Witnesses told the AP that they heard a loud bang, and upon arriving at the scene, they found unrecognizable human remains. The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority had earlier said that 12 people were onboard the Cessna Caravan-type aircraft. The Maasai Mara National Reserve is located west of the coastline and is a two-hour direct flight from Diani, a popular coastal town known for its sandy beaches. According to the most recent safety oversight audit for Kenya posted on the International Civil Aviation Organization website, from 2018, the country fell below the global average in accident investigation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Los Angeles Dodgers' Teoscar Hernández throws water on Freddie Freeman after his walk off home run during the 18th inning Monday.David J. Phillip/The Associated Press In a marathon game that stretched nearly seven hours and also featured two Shohei Ohtani homers and an injury departure by George Springer, the Dodgers pulled ahead 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. “The Dodgers didn't win the World Series today; they won a game,” said Jays manager John Schneider. Meanwhile the Jays clubhouse was sombre afterward. “We grinded, battled our tails off, tired as hell,” said Toronto's Ernie Clement afterward. “They outlasted and made the big play...I expect us to come out firing tomorrow.” Monday was a Dodgers party, as this World Series finally arrived in L.A., and inside one of baseball's oldest, most storied buildings. The stadium was spotted with celebrities from Jason Bateman to Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe and Magic Johnson. George Springer removed from Game 3 of World Series with injury When the game began, the Dodger faithful booed Springer mercilessly every time Toronto's leadoff man came to bat. He exited Monday's game after suffering an apparent back or side injury while swinging the bat, and they booed him then too. Their own leadoff man though – Ohtani – got booming cheers as he repeatedly strolled to bat with the swinging horns of his familiar walkup song blaring, Michael Bublé's cover version of Feeling Good. Ohtani and Teoscar Hernandez both slugged homers off Scherzer for an early Los Angeles lead. The Jays pulled ahead in a big fourth inning. Alejandro Kirk hit a three-run shot, and then Andrés Giménez poked a sacrifice fly to score Addison Barger. Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow left in the fifth inning after allowing five hits, three walks and four runs – two earned – while punching out five batters. With his start Monday, Max Scherzer appeared for a fourth team in the World Series. The Jays roared ahead again in the seventh, as Bichette singled on a ground ball to score Guerrero. He became the first ever player with three multi-homer games in a single post-season. Having called in four pinch runners, the Jays had limited choices left to do that job, and some valuable bats – like Barger – were now gone from the lineup. Nathan Lukes doubled in the 10th and Davis Schneider was sent home, but he was called out in a close encounter at the plate. The Dodgers called in veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, and he kept them from scoring. The Jays used nine pitchers, including four scoreless innings by Eric Lauer in relief. Even the Game 4 starter, Shane Bieber, was starting to warm up. But they couldn't get one over the plate. After all of that, Ohtani will start on the mound in Tuesday's Game 4. He was on base eight, nine times tonight, running the bases. He's elated,” said Dodgers manager Dave Roberts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian forces have used drones to hunt and displace civilians from their homes near the front line in Ukraine, Reuters reported on Oct. 27, citing a new UN inquiry presented to the General Assembly. Investigators said Russian troops intentionally targeted civilians and civilian structures across a 300-kilometer area spanning the Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, and Mykolaiv regions, forcing people to flee. The report drew on 226 interviews with victims, witnesses, aid workers, and local officials, as well as verified videos showing civilians being “hunted” by drones. UN investigators said the attacks also struck first responders, including ambulances and firefighters, despite clear humanitarian markings. Russia denies deliberately targeting civilians and refuses to cooperate with the UN commission, which has previously accused Russia of war crimes such as the deportation of Ukrainian children.
