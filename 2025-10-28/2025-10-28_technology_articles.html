                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. Inside that building is a vault built from concrete blocks up to 5 feet thick with an additional layer of radiation-absorbing plastic. The company recently invited a small group of journalists to visit its headquarters and see Polaris, which is the seventh iteration of its fusion generator and the prototype for a commercial facility called Orion that broke ground this summer in Malaga in Central Washington. Few people outside of Helion have been provided such access; photographs were not allowed. Polaris and its vault occupy a relative small footprint inside of Ursa. They're configured into 4-foot-by-4-foot pallets, lined up in rows and stacked seven high. The units are packed with capacitors that are charged from the grid to provide super high intensity pulses of electricity — 100 gigawatts of peak power — that create the temperatures and pressure needed for fusion reactions. All of that energy is carried through miles and miles of coaxial cables filled with copper, aluminum and custom-metal alloys. End-to-end, the cables would stretch across Washington state and back again — roughly 720 miles. The ultimate goal is for the generator to force lightweight ions to fuse, creating a super hot plasma that expands, pushing on a magnetic field that surrounds it. No one so far has been able to make and capture enough energy from fusion to commercialize the process, but dozens of companies — including three other competitors in the Pacific Northwest — are trying. If it hits this extremely ambitious target — and many are highly skeptical — it could be the world's first company to do so. Some in the sector worry that Helion will miss the mark and cast doubt on a sector that is working hard to prove itself. At a June event, the head of R&D for fusion competitor Zap Energy questioned Helion's deadline. “I don't see a commercial application in the next few years happening,” said Ben Levitt. Helion has raised more than $1 billion from investors that include SoftBank, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sam Altman, who is OpenAI's CEO and co-founder, as well as Helion's longtime chair of its board of directors. The company is able to unlock an additional $1.8 billion if it hits Polaris milestones. The generator has been operating since December, running all day, five days a week, creating fusion, Kirtley said. Helion officials say they must hold their tech close to the vest as Chinese competitors have stolen pieces of their intellectual property; critics say the secrecy makes it difficult for the scientific community to verify their likelihood of success in a very risky, highly technical field. In August, Kirtley shared an online post about Helion's power-producing strategy, which upends the conventional approach. Most efforts are trying to achieve ignition in their fusion generators, which is a condition where the reactions produce more power than is required for fusion to occur. This feat was first accomplished at a national lab in California in 2022 — but it still wasn't enough energy that one could put electricity on the grid. Helion is not aiming for ignition but rather for a system that is so efficient it can capture enough energy from fusion without reaching that state. Kirtley compares the strategy for producing power to regenerative braking in electric vehicles. “We can recover electricity at high efficiency,” Kirtley said. My goal, ironically, is to do the minimum amount of fusion that we can deliver a product to the customer and generate electricity.” AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On stage, panels offered a healthy dose of optimism about building the AI future. The double-edged nature of this shift is not lost on Washington Gov. He touted Washington's concentration of AI jobs, saying his goal is to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its downsides. Seattle AI Week, led by the Washington Technology Industry Association, was started last year after a Forbes list of the nation's top 50 AI startups included none from Seattle, said the WTIA's Nick Ellingson, opening this year's event. “A bunch of us got together and said, let's talk about all the cool things happening around AI in Seattle, and let's expand the tent beyond just tech things that are happening,” Ellingson explained. So maybe that's the best measuring stick: how many startups will this latest shakeout spark, and how can the Seattle region's startup and tech leaders make it happen? It's one of the few capitals of AI in the world,” said WTIA's Arry Yu in her opening remarks. “People talk about China, people talk about Silicon Valley — there are a few contenders, but really, it's here in Seattle. And yet, “AI is a sleepy scene in Seattle, where people work at their companies, but there's very little activity and cross-pollinating outside of this,” said Nathan Lambert, senior research scientist with the Allen Institute for AI, during the opening panel discussion. No, we don't want to become San Francisco or Silicon Valley, Lambert added. But that doesn't mean the region can't cherry-pick some of the ingredients that put Bay Area tech on top. Whether laid-off tech workers will start their own companies is a common question after layoffs like this. In the Seattle region at least, that outcome has been more fantasy than reality. This is where AI could change things, if not with the fabled one-person unicorn then with a bigger wave of new companies born of this employment downturn. Who knows, maybe one will even land on that elusive Forbes AI 50 list. AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've been on TikTok in the past couple of weeks, you've probably noticed people posting about belonging to “Group 7.” The trend is actually an experiment by indie singer Sophia James, who released a series of videos set to her song “So Unfair” in an effort to manipulate TikTok's algorithm and get more people listening to her music. After trying a few different tactics, following typical TikTok formats, James started placing people into exclusive groups. And it has worked—Group 7, the final video in James' TikTok “science experiment,” has garnered over 76 million views and spawned legions of comments and reaction videos, with even Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai repping her elite status as a member. It's not until the fourth video that she introduces the categories, telling TikTokers: “If you're seeing this you are in Group 4.” “I am posting a bunch of videos and seeing which ones reach the most viewers,” the text reads as her song blares. But sometimes the best is left for last. After her Group 7 video went massively viral, James says, “‘So Unfair' has definitely seen an uptick in listeners all across the board, and it's kind of spread through a lot of my other music, too, which is really fantastic.” Still, even James seems confused that she managed to hack the algorithm. WIRED asked James about why she decided on this experiment and the double-edged sword of using social media as an indie artist. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. WIRED: How did you get started in the industry? And my father is a touring drummer, and so it was kind of, I mean, audibly passed down to me and also, I guess, encoded in my DNA in a way. I had a quick sort of experience with [a] boutique record label who provided me with a few producers … but [with] my third EP, the label experience didn't end up being very fruitful for me. Somewhere down the line, they lost funding, and I was left in the dark about a lot of it. Somewhere along that line, I met producer and platinum hit songwriter Alex Bilowitz. And he reached out to me because he had found a video on social media of me playing one of my original songs. Which brings us to the Group 7 of it all. I mean, the primary reason that I'm on TikTok, and on social media in general, is to promote my music and get it heard and get it out to the people that resonate with it and want to listen to it. I care too much about this batch of music specifically, and I'm too excited about it to not put my best foot forward, just swallow my pride and start playing the social media game and taking it very seriously in order to try and cut through the noise. And yeah, along with that, I've been putting every effort into chasing whatever trends or trying different methods of hacking this algorithm, this mysterious algorithm, to just try and like, get the word out about my music so that I can continue to make a living off of what I love to do. I don't really have many other skills. So it wasn't really an option for me. I really wanted to also just dive into the types of “Group” videos you made, because they were all different. The first video wasn't even labeled as a Group 1. I have not really had a moment to sit and think about it all. But I mean, I put my song “So Unfair” in the background of each of these videos or at the forefront, and so there was no difference with sound or no sound, or “So Unfair” or no “So Unfair.” It's a puzzle to me. I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that, like, numerically, the seventh video in a batch has a higher chance of hitting the algorithm? What I do know is that when I started seeing comments flooding on the Group 7 video, there were a lot of … silly camaraderie-based things and like putting really funny reaction memes in it and stuff. Like, this is very silly, and I think it was definitely driven by the people commenting on the video. I don't know how, or how the video got to the For You pages of those commenters, but I'm really glad [it] did. Who was the most unexpected person for you to hop on this trend? Sorry, I'm just having a little bit of an out-of-body experience. I think it was two days ago or yesterday, just saying Malala is in Group 7. And she was using it to promote her new book, which, you know, is fantastic. And I hope it's fruitful for her, and I hope that it drives people to read her new book. And today I have decided that I'm winning.” How have social media algorithms affected artists in the age of music discovery? The algorithm really does not favor artists, especially independent artists, because there is no machine behind them pushing their content out. I come from a large network of truly DIY independent artists, and across the board, I'm hearing all the time just that TikTok hates musicians; TikTok hates independent artists and songwriters and stuff. If you really scroll or take the time to search for independent artists promoting their songs, there are millions on millions on millions of videos of independent artists trying their hardest and their best to do what I'm trying to do to get their music out there and find find their audience, and it just is really disheartening that it hardly ever seems to work. There was this kind of, I guess, “golden age” of music discovery on TikTok in the Covid era because everyone was in their homes, and there was this like mass signing of “TikTok artists” to major labels. But five years later, that trend or that movement or whatever you call it has completely flipped, and it's really, really frustrating. Has your music had more reach since the video popped off? But “So Unfair” has definitely seen an uptick in listeners, all across the board, and it's kind of spread through a lot of my other music, too, which is really fantastic. After the explosion of the Group 7 video, do you think what you said in your Group 2 video happened? But I guess this Group 7 video has, at least in this moment, proved that the algorithm can be broken through. So long answer short, I'm taking it as a win for the time being. And I'm taking it as a win for the independent artist.

His comments were enough to draw tech support from Framework and even AMD, with the offer of an AMD-driven Strix Halo-powered alternative. In a post on X, Carmack said that the DGX Spark appears to max out at 100 watts of power draw, which is less than half of its 240-watt rating. While Nvidia advertises one petaflop of sparse FP4 compute, Carmack assumes the dense equivalent should be closer to 125 teraflops, and says he's getting far less than that. DGX Spark appears to be maxing out at only 100 watts power draw, less than half of the rated 240 watts, and it only seems to be delivering about half the quoted performance (assuming 1 PF sparse FP4 = 125 TF dense BF16) . It gets quite hot even at this level, and I saw a report…October 27, 2025 Similarly, independent testing by ServeTheHome found that a retail Spark unit pulled just under 200 watts under combined CPU+GPU load, and couldn't hit the full 240W ceiling in any workload they ran. Drawn in by the claims, Framework dropped by Carmack's thread to offer an AMD Strix Halo-powered box for him to try instead, and AMD's Anush Elangovan, the company's Vice President of AI Software and the public face of its CUDA-challenging ROCm software, even joined the pile-on, adding "Will be on standby for anything to support your exploration on Strix Halo." Carmack's post has kicked off a broader re-examination of what Nvidia actually promised. This is a technique that can double effective throughput but only applies to certain matrix operations. When evaluated in denser formats like FP8 or BF16, the theoretical ceiling drops sharply. Spark is meant to host large models in-memory rather than race through tokens per second. But the growing number of users citing reboot issues and apparent power ceilings suggests Nvidia's tight thermal and power envelope within a 150mm chassis may be starting to bite, especially when most users would have been more than happy for the Spark to ship in a larger footprint if that meant better performance and sufficient cooling. What's causing this suboptimal performance, such as a firmware-level cap or thermal throttling, is not clear. Meanwhile, several threads on Nvidia's developer forums now include reports of GPU crashes and unexpected shutdowns under sustained load. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. It's still very early days for DGX Spark, but with expectations for GB10 sky-high among users, Nvidia will need to explain why its flagship developer kit might be leaving so much performance potential on the table.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Cascadia region, which includes Seattle, Portland and Vancouver, B.C., is described as a proven, promising player in the sphere — but with significant risks that threaten its success. “We created companies that transformed global commerce,” writes former Gov. “Now we have the chance to add another chapter — one where Cascadia becomes the world's standard-bearer for innovation that uplifts both people and planet.” The economic advocacy group's eighth annual event is being held in Seattle. The study is built on an analysis by the Boston Consulting Group that ranks Cascadia's three metro areas against 15 comparable regions in the U.S. and Canada for their economic competitiveness, including livability, workforce, and business and innovation climate. Cascadia's strengths, the report explains, include tech engines such as cloud giants Microsoft and Amazon in Washington, silicon chip manufacturing in Oregon, and quantum innovation in Vancouver, as well as academic excellence from the University of Washington, University of British Columbia and Oregon State University. But as time goes on and as business and civic leaders aim for the prize of AI dominance, cracks in the system are increasingly troubling. “For Cascadia, the lesson is clear: without a coordinated strategy that links our strengths in cloud computing, semiconductors, and research, we risk falling behind,” states the Cascadia Innovation Corridor report.

If you're looking for one place to find all of our top vacuum recommendations, this is it. From our favorite stick vacuums, the Bissell PowerClean FurFinder ($180) and Dyson V15 Detect ($668), to some of our favorite robot vacuums like the Ecovacs Deebot X11 Omnicyclone ($1,260) and handheld vacuums including the Ryobi 18V One+ Performance Hand Vacuum ($99), there's a vacuum here for every kind of cleaning task. Check out all of our favorite vacuum cleaner for every cleaning style below. Looking for our guides that dive into each category? If you're looking for a reliable, powerful, but not extremely expensive cordless vacuum, the Bissell PowerClean FurFinder is the one for you. The PowerClean FurFinder has everything you want in a good stick vacuum: three power levels you can easily control, a big headlight to spot dust, and a nice set of attachments, plus it stands up by itself. This vacuum's name comes from the included 6-inch FurFinder head, which is a small head that's designed for vacuuming up pet hair. It worked great on my cat tree and left the upholstery looking new. It has a HEPA filter to keep debris from just recirculating into the air. I love this affordable stick vacuum from Ryobi. It has powerful suction of up to 89 IOW with cyclonic filtration, an easily removable roller bar for cleaning, and lights on the vacuum head to better see the debris. It has both plush and brush rolls for hard and carpet flooring, where they move together to suck up pet hair without getting tangled. Plus, its easily removable and rechargeable battery makes it easy to charge separately (without having to lug the whole vacuum to an outlet), and the battery is compatible with Ryobi's line of various other tools. It gets a deeper clean in my carpet than cheaper vacuums, and the sensor in the vacuum can actually tell you how many particles it's picking up if you want to get into the data. There's a nice range of attachments, including the Fluffy Optic cleaner head that has a green laser to find dust and debris on hard floors. That can be annoying if you know you want to use it on a lot of carpet or hard floors, but it's handy for target-cleaning areas like staircases. It's an all-around great vacuum and noticeably more powerful than cheaper options if you have the budget to splurge. It also has a fast-charging system that will frequently top up the battery, so the vacuum won't have to take a break to recharge for a while in the middle of cleaning larger homes. There's also Matter compatibility, a climbing driving wheel for tricky flooring spots, and AI-enabled smarts to switch cleaning modes. There's also both a regular cleaning fluid and a heavy-duty fluid you can put into the vacuum and switch between, but the heavy-duty solution is harder to find. It's not perfect, however: WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has found that the lid can fall of and be annoying to replace when she checks the roller, and the driving wheels can be confused on different surfaces in her home, forcing her to tap the wheels to get them working again. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So has been testing gear for over a decade, and the Matic robot vacuum is the only 10/10 review she's ever given. First off, its six RGB infrared cameras create a seamless, detailed 3D model of your home, allowing the vacuum to see above itself and in the dark. Its map isn't relative, so it doesn't get confused when you move the vacuum or a single piece of furniture like a chair. The waste bag will contain wet and dry debris, so no more emptying the dirty brown water after every cleaning session. It can actually clean the toe kicks under your kitchen counters, and is quiet enough that you can run it while still being able to watch TV. For all those features, it's also a compact vacuum that also doesn't need a massive docking station. Plus, it's cute, too, with a more unique design than the sea of round robot discs. It does have lower suction power than other vacuums we recommend, but this vacuum is thorough enough that So hasn't noticed a difference. She has, however, noticed that she can fill a waste bag in three days (Matic says one bag lasts one to four weeks, though). Still, it's worth noting that the waste bags are fantastic, with absorbent crystals, charcoal, and a HEPA filter in the bag itself. This powerful, lightweight hand vacuum comes with brush and crevice tool attachments, and although the vacuum is powerful on its own, the dust brush worked well for cleaning fabrics and effectively brushed up pet hair, and the crevice tool was small enough to fit between upholstery and hard-to-reach places in my car. Emptying the vacuum's debris was simple, with a button to eject the dust cup, and the vac has a dual HEPA filter system that untwists when it's time to be cleaned. Plus, like other Ryobi tools, it attaches to a rechargeable 18-volt lithium-ion battery pack for power (which also helps to conserve space), and the battery works with other Ryobi tools. This multifunctional tool boasts 37-inch sealed suction IOW (inches of water) suction power, holds almost three cups, and has a three-year warranty. I consider it a great value at less than $100. My favorite by far is the cube-shaped Worx vacuum, which proves something can be both adorable and incredibly useful. The handle on top of its boxy form is comfortable to hold, and the hose wraps around that handle when it's in storage. It has a small dustbin, but was plenty for the sand and Cheerio debris that haunts our vehicles. Black and Decker Dustbuster Flex for $89: This is another cool handheld vacuum that's great for cars, or even indoor areas like staircases. It has a 4-foot hose, longer than most compact vacuums, and has a handy little charging mount that the accessories clip into. in mind, so if you have a vehicle to clean, this is made for it. It's got a fantastic battery life compared to other handheld vacuums. Dyson Gen5 Detect Cordless Vacuum for $935: This is Dyson's current top of the line stick vacuum, and it's fantastic, especially for homes with a lot of pet hair. But it's expensive and rarely on sale, making it a hard upgrade when you'll still get a great experience with the Dyson V15 Detect. Roborock Qrevo S for $800 (used): This is technically our top robot vacuum pick, but Roborock recently updated the Qrevo line with new models that aren't shipping to the United States, and the model we like best is only available secondhand. Tineco Pure One Station 5 for $459: If you want a cordless stick vacuum but don't want to deal with emptying it all the time, this Tineco vacuum comes with a self-emptying docking station. You'll eventually have to empty the station, but it's a great bonus feature and keeps the vacuum from falling over around your home since it's stored safely in the docking station. An upright vacuum is the classic, original vacuum style that sits straight up on its own and is much heavier than cordless stick vacuums, and requires an outlet connection to work. We currently don't have an upright vacuum we recommend, since cordless stick vacuums have become the main focus for most shoppers (and as frequent vacuumers ourselves, we usually reach for cordless and robot vacuums anyways). We're considering upright vacuums to test in the future, however, and feel free to comment on this guide with models we should consider. Likely no, because most stick vacuums can transform into a handheld vacuum already. Stick or cordless vacuums usually allow you to remove the stick part from between the vacuum head and canister base and instead connect those two pieces directly, making it into a handheld vacuum. It'll be much heavier than a vacuum designed to always be handheld, and might be irritating if you have a specific use case you want it for, but you don't need both unless there's a specific reason. A handheld is a good add-on if you already have an upright vacuum you love that doesn't need replacing. Vacuums last about five years, depending on the use frequency and build quality.

According to DigiTimes, major U.S. and Chinese hyperscalers are now receiving just 70% of the server DRAM they order. That's despite agreeing to contract price increases of up to 50% for Q4, well above the 30% hike many buyers had budgeted for earlier this year. While it's HBM that gets the headlines, demand for conventional DDR5 RDIMMs is also outpacing supply, particularly at advanced nodes where Samsung and SK hynix have diverted capacity toward parts bound for AI acceleration. Samsung's recent pricing adjustments confirm the reprioritization, with the company having raised server SSD prices by up to 35% and RDIMM contract rates by as much as 50%, citing sustained demand from enterprise and cloud customers. What's left is a market where even the largest buyers can't secure enough memory. Spot prices have surged since late September, and several top-tier suppliers are reportedly refusing to quote for October allocations. DDR5 16 GB modules that traded at $7 to $8 last month are now hovering around $13, with availability tightening further into November. With hyperscalers locking in fixed allocations, lower-priority customers are pushed to the spot market or told to wait until capacity opens up in 2026. Micron warned of this in its most recent earnings call, telling investors that DRAM is a “tight industry” and that bit supply growth will lag demand through the end of next year. TrendForce also flagged a potential quote freeze across certain modules, as suppliers shift to day-to-day pricing in China and avoid locking themselves into bad deals. This is causing retail DDR5 prices to creep upward, with no sign of stabilization before year's end. China's Nanya Technology recently said standard DDR4 makes up just 20% of the total DRAM market, and it's no longer being prioritized for volume production. Unless demand unexpectedly cools or yields improve sharply, DRAM allocation for everyone outside the top buyers will be constrained into 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Image 5 can now work at native resolutions of up to 4 megapixels, a massive increase from the previous-gen model, which could natively generate images at 1 megapixel but then would upscale them to 4 megapixels. Adobe's Firefly site has supported third-party models from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, Runway, Topaz, and Flux to augment its appeal to its creative customer base, and now the company is taking that a step further by letting users create custom models based on their art style. Currently in a closed beta, this feature lets users drag and drop assets, such as images, illustrations and sketches, to create a custom image model based on their style. The company is also adding some new features to its Firefly website, which was redesigned earlier this year. The site now lets you use the prompt box to switch between generating images or videos, choose which AI model you want to work with, change aspect ratios, and more. The site's home page now features your files and recent generation history, and you also get shortcuts to other Adobe apps (these were previously housed in a menu). This design change is currently only available in a private beta, and will be rolled out to users eventually. Firefly is also getting two new audio features: Users can now employ AI prompts to generate entire soundtracks and speech — using models from ElevenLabs — for videos. There's also a new way to easily come up with prompts: just add keywords and sections by selecting words from a word cloud.

The viability of Linux as a gaming platform has come on leaps and bounds in recent years due to the sterling work of WINE and Proton developers, among others, and interest in hardware like the Steam Deck. However, the most recent stats from ProtonDB (via Boiling Steam) highlight that we are edging towards a magnificent milestone. The latest distilled data shows that almost 90% of Windows games now run on Linux. There are different degrees of compatibility gamers must consider when checking if their favorite Windows games work on Linux distros like Mint, Zorin, Bazzite, or even SteamOS. The above chart relies on Boiling Steam's five definitions of playability, but these aren't a million miles from the Steam Deck ratings Valve dishes out. The main difference seems to be that Boiling Steam doesn't seem to care whether Steam Deck performance is a gaming-limiting factor. So, in a way, its ratings are perhaps more useful to desktop and laptop PC users who typically have systems that easily outpace a Steam Deck. Boiling Steam platinum (green) rank denotes games that run perfectly, out of the box. Lastly, Bronze (red) titles exist in the murky water between silver and borked. Developers will, of course, benefit from more hardware being able to play their games with few if any wrinkles, so there must be an incentive to spend at least a little time checking a new Windows game on Linux, or the Steam Deck specifically. On the flip side, there are some popular titles that don't look like they will be becoming Linux-friendly anytime soon. The well-known compatibility issues with various anti-cheat technology platforms look set to persist, for now. There is quite a bit that can be done with those non-intentionally stubborn games, though. We'd recommend researching community-driven Linux compatibility tips and tweaks for your favorite games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You may have noticed some big changes to our consumer tech coverage this year. We reviewed a tremendous amount of gadgets this calendar year—several from new categories like smart glasses with displays—and we're going to expand into even more categories in 2026. Across over a dozen categories, every winner is a product that Gizmodo's consumer tech team has either reviewed or tested extensively—so you can trust we've done our jobs. We didn't just hand out awards willy-nilly. We've also got a few additional winners to award in the coming weeks; some products are releasing after this list publishes, so it's only fair that we wait to include them for consideration. Not everyone will agree with our picks, but don't worry, dear reader, you'll get a chance to vote for your favorite tech of the year in a separate Reader's Choice Awards. Most importantly, thank you for reading consumer tech stories. Our North Star is to provide authoritative, fair, and entertaining coverage. We hope you enjoy going through our Best Tech of 2025 Awards! You don't need to spend $1,000, or even $800, to get a solid smartphone these days, and Google's Pixel 9a is proof of that. It even runs Gemini and AI features fairly well thanks to its Tensor G4 chip. Everything about these models is there for the sake of function. Nearly every feature—folding screen, performance, battery life, and cameras—outguns those of similar flip-style phones. It was great to see the iconic phone brand return with such a strong showing. It's everything a foldable should be: super thin unfolded, about as thick as a regular phone when closed, and super light. It's not cheap, but overall, this is the best book-style foldable that's widely available for purchase globally. Not only do you get a beautiful tandem OLED display, but the M5 chip can also output laptop-level performance for all your creative apps. There are versions with 11-inch and 13-inch screens available as well. The OnePlus came out of left field, and we're glad it did, because there's a lot to like about this 13-inch tablet. A more pocketable version of the beloved Paper Pro, the Paper Pro Move is easier to reach for when you need to jot down notes or fleeting ideas. It has the same color E Ink screen as its bigger sibling, comes bundled with a stylus, and includes an assortment of practical AI features for lovers of notetaking and reading. If you're looking for a laptop with “everything,” Acer's Predator Triton 14 AI has even more. The notebook includes an RTX 5070 GPU and a higher-end Intel Core Ultra 288V CPU. For a laptop that has a little of everything and can still run all day, you don't need to look further than the Asus Zenbook S16. It feels good on your fingertips, is light enough that it slips into a backpack with ease, and still has adequate performance for all but the most hardcore tasks. The best bang-for-buck graphics card of 2025 is AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT. It not only achieves impressive metrics for 1440p and 4K gaming, but also costs less than competing cards at a similar price point. When it comes to gaming, there's simply no match for the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D desktop CPU. AMD's special 3D cache, which adds extra memory just below the CPU's main processing cores, is still proving itself to be the thing you want for any desktop gaming rig. There's nothing quite like the Framework Desktop; it's the most customizable, modular, and performative small-form desktop PC out there. It features an AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 CPU, which delivers exceptional performance for both work and gaming on a single chip, and includes swappable USB-C-based I/O ports, as well as interchangeable decorative tiles, on the front. The Nintendo Switch 2 continues to surprise us months after launch. Of course, you buy a Nintendo console for the games, and there are also plenty of great titles to keep you occupied. Microsoft and Asus pushed the ROG Xbox Ally X as an enhanced PC, with its new UI dubbed the “full screen experience.” It performs very well, especially at lower wattages, and you still have access to all your favorite PC games across the most popular launchers. Lenovo's Legion Pro 7i has the performance and amenities of an 18-inch gaming laptop in a 16-inch shell. You'll want a version of this laptop with at least an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 GPU to really push frame rates in games. If you want to use a single controller with both a Switch 2 and PC, you need look no further than the 8BitDo Pro 3. Improving on the AirPods Pro 2 was no easy feat, but Apple has done just that with the AirPods Pro 3. Extra features, like an accurate, built-in heart rate sensor and live translation, only cement them as best-in-class. This subbrand of Nothing puts out quality audio in an affordable price range, and while you won't get the best in any category (ANC or sound), these wireless earbuds are incredibly well-rounded. A wide range of colors and solid ANC don't hurt, either. Sony is no stranger to being king of the castle when it comes to headphones, and with its WH-1000XM6, it takes the crown again. The XM6 improve on the XM5 in pretty much every way, delivering great sound, excellent ANC, and solid battery life—the most important qualities in a pair of wireless headphones. There are gaming headphones that may help you pick out footsteps or gunshots to trounce noobs in multiplayer, but the Sony Inzone H9 II simply have the best audio of any headset this year. They're comfortable and include a quality microphone, so you're not missing out on much for the sake of feeling truly immersed. Bose is known for its pricey audio products, and while the SoundLink Plus doesn't shirk that trend, the bass, sound, and overall look make it worth every penny. Canon's PowerShot V1 may be the best vlogging camera ever. With excellent image quality from its 22-megapixel sensor, a versatile 16-50mm zoom lens, and superfast autofocus, this compact point-and-shoot and its flip-out display are perfect for amateur creators looking to level up their content. There's no better option among instant cameras, offering such classic-looking prints, than the Fujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay+. Along with the camera's usual sensor, you can take selfie photos or connect a phone or SD card to print personal photos as well. It's got the greatest hits features from the last 10 years of Apple smartwatches, and even some from its pricier Series 11 sibling, like the S10 chip, double tap and wrist flick gestures, a more durable glass screen, and optional 5G cellular support. Google crept up from last to first place in the Android smartwatch rankings this year. For those who don't want to wear a smartwatch or tracker, the Oura 4 Ceramic includes robust physiological data, including heart rate variability, sleep analysis, shifts in body temperature, and blood oxygen rates, as well as new features like reproductive health and smart sensing. The newest ceramic model is also less prone to scratching and color fading. The Polar Loop is the serious athlete's ideal tech companion: a comfortable, no-screen, no-subscription wearable that gives athletes exactly what they need and want and nothing more. The Loop provides 24/7 activity tracking and insights into fitness progression—all from a company known for first-class heart-rate technology. The screenless Whoop 5.0 provides more data than almost any other wearable. It tracks everything from step count to heart rate variability, to sleep metrics, and more, and spins out a daily strain score, all of which are displayed cleanly in its accompanying app. The subscription-based, tiered model is an added cost, but it allows for plenty of customization. There's no shortage of Wi-Fi 7 routers to choose from. But if you want a mesh network that's simple, stable, delivers fast downloads, and won't clash with your home decor, the Eero Pro 7 is our go-to. The Matic isn't your typical disc-shaped robot vacuum; it's full of personality like a Pixar character. Reolink's Altas captures high-quality video and includes a solar panel for sun-fueled power, but the best thing is that it works without an internet connection, with recordings saved to a microSD card. Maybe every gadget doesn't need to be “smart.” The cylindrical device can project a 1080p screen at up to 200 inches in size, doubles as a Bluetooth speaker with its 6W Harmon Kardon drivers, and is fully portable thanks to its built-in battery. But what truly makes it unique is the attachable magnetic filters that can spray a pattern like a sunset, water ripple, or dreamy effect onto walls or ceilings, just to set a mood. Meta was first to popularize AI glasses, and its lead is showing. With a bright display and “Neural Band” for controlling the UI with precise finger pinches and gestures, these are the AR smart glasses that will make you feel like you're actually living in the future. They plug directly into any compatible device, such as a phone, laptop, or tablet, via USB-C and let you see a 171-inch virtual display that's bright and sharp. Incredible doesn't even begin to describe this portable battery bank. It's got three USB ports (2x USB-C and 1x USB-A) capable of supplying 300W of combined power to charge two laptops and a phone, or pretty much any modern device. It feels comfortable, has a free-spinning and side-scrolling wheel, and now supports haptics to add a little rumbly in your thumbly. Laifen's P3 Pro is the kind of product that Apple would make if it designed grooming products. Its aluminum body and satisfying, reversible magnetic razor attachment system scream Apple-inspired. Almost every power brick that comes with a laptop is huge and heavy. Using the latest gallium nitride (GaN) technology, Anker's Prime Charger (160W, 3 Ports, Smart Display) is barely larger than an AirPods Pro 3 case and can charge one device at up to 140W (perfect for even a 16-inch MacBook Pro) or three devices totaling up to 160W.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Located in Shanghai's Lin-gang Special Area with a price tag of roughly RMB 1.6 billion ($226 million), it's a significant milestone in the quest for sustainable solutions to the growing energy demands of China's computing infrastructure. Powered entirely by wind energy, the initiative has a total power capacity of 24 megawatts. According to the Lin-gang management committee, its completion represents a key breakthrough in incorporating renewable energy into data storage, processing, and distribution. Traditional land-based data centers run hot and must be kept cool to operate efficiently. Air conditioning systems alone can account for up to 50 percent of total energy consumption. This reduces the energy demand for cooling to less than 10 percent. The underwater data center uses seawater as a natural cooling system. More than 95 percent of its electricity comes from offshore wind turbines. Overall, the designers estimate that this reduces energy consumption by 22.8 percent. Land usage is reduced by more than 90 percent, a major factor in densely populated coastal cities like Shanghai, and the need for fresh water is eliminated entirely. As part of a broader national strategy in China, Shanghai aims to become a global center of scientific and technological innovation by growing its cloud computing industry to more than RMB 200 billion (approximately $28.25 billion) by 2027. This initiative also complements—and perhaps offers an alternative to—the “East Data, West Computing” megaproject, which launched in 2022. Lin-gang's UDC, on the other hand, processes data close to where it is generated, while using marine resources to mitigate negative environmental impacts. However, the transition from proof-of-concept projects to large-scale application presents significant challenges. “UDC construction is still in its early stage,” cautioned Wang Shifeng, president of Third Harbor Engineering, another company involved in the current project.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PayPal said on Tuesday that it is adopting a protocol in combination with OpenAI's “Instant Checkout” feature to let users pay for their shopping directly within ChatGPT, starting in 2026. PayPal is adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP), an open source specification developed by OpenAI that lets merchants make their products available within AI apps, consequently enabling users to shop using AI agents. And next year, merchants using PayPal products will have their products be discoverable on ChatGPT, starting with categories like apparel, fashion, beauty, home improvement, and electronics. The company said it is also launching an agentic commerce suite that would let merchants feature their catalogs within AI apps, accept payments on different AI apps, and get insights about consumer behavior. PayPal has been working to insert itself as a payments partner within various companies' AI-enabled shopping experiences, particularly as people increasingly use AI apps to do their daily tasks. In May, the company teamed up with Perplexity to let users check out within the AI search tool, and in September, PayPal said it was adopting Google's Agent Payments Protocol to integrate its products within various Google products. “By partnering with OpenAI and adopting the Agentic Commerce Protocol, PayPal will power payments and commerce experiences that help people go from chat to checkout in just a few taps for our joint customer bases,” he added.

Shunt mods on mobile devices are always exciting because they seem to push the boundaries of what's possible in a more practical way. Laptops are thermally constrained and, thus, power-limited compared to their desktop counterparts. Even a fully specced-out mobile GPU can't compete against its desktop variant, so when someone tries to break through the manufactured barriers to unlock its full potential, well, we let the results speak for themselves. On the r/GamingLaptops subreddit, user u/thatavidreadertrue (we'll call him Avid) details their experience shunt-modding an Asus ROG Zephyrus M16 gaming laptop with an RTX 4090, and they come with the benchmarks to back it all up. In Avid's case, they took a 1 mΩ resistor and placed it in parallel with the GPU's existing 5 mΩ shunt resistor on the motherboard. Through Ohm's law, that comes out to an 83% reduction in resistance, meaning the GPU is now underreporting its wattage by roughly 6x (down to just 0.83mΩ). This allows for a pretty incredible bump in performance, so much so that this 4090 starts to match or even outperform the RTX 5090 mobile in a multitude of scenarios. Avid didn't test any games, but the synthetic benchmarks are enough to give us an idea. Compared to the average 5090 laptop that can achieve 22,877 points, our 4090 with wings was still 7.6% ahead. While thermal details were scarce, Avid did mention in a comment that the 4090 gets up to 80-84°C but "doesn't thermal throttle" while the CPU can get a bit toasty at around 90°C. Overall, this config can strike a nice balance between power, performance, temps, and noise. That's before we even factor in the price, because Avid actually got this Zephyrus M16 from the secondhand market for only $1600, which is a good deal in and of itself.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta plans to lay off more than 100 employees in Washington state as part of a broader round of cuts within its artificial intelligence division. Meta product managers, privacy specialists, and compliance analysts were also affected. Meta is cutting around 600 positions in its AI unit, Axios reported last week. Meta has just under 3,000 roles within its superintelligence lab, CNBC reported. However, it was Facebook's decision to open its own outpost across from Pike Place Market in 2010 that really got the attention of their Silicon Valley tech brethren. However, more recently Meta has made moves to trim its Seattle-area footprint. Apple earlier this year took over a building previously occupied by Meta in Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood, near Amazon's headquarters. CoStar reported in April that Meta listed its other Arbor Blocks building for sublease. But it has subleased some of the space since then to companies such as Snowflake, which recently took an entire building from Meta at the Spring District. Meta's office in Redmond, near Microsoft's headquarters, is focused on its mixed reality development. GeekWire has reached out to the company for an updated Seattle-area headcount. Meta's cuts come amid reported layoffs at Amazon that could impact up to 30,000 workers. Tech companies have laid off more than 128,000 employees this year, according to Layoffs.fyi.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In terms of style, it looks like Wikipedia with its optional dark mode turned on. Based on a very brief review, it contains articles on most topics one would most easily expect in an encyclopedia, professing to have just under 900,000 in total. The website Wikicount says there are about 7 million English Wikipedia articles. Musk announced that his AI company, xAI, was building an online encyclopedia late last month, saying it would be a “massive improvement over Wikipedia.” The idea for Grokipedia was born during an appearance by Musk on the All-In Podcast. Host and fellow high net worth individual David Sacks asked Musk point blank to create it, noting that Wikipedia was “hyper-partisan” and full of “activists.” Nicholas Joseph Fuentes (born August 18, 1998) is an American far-right political commentator, activist and live streamer. He identifies as a Christian nationalist and part of the incel subculture. His views have been described as racist, white supremacist, misogynistic, homophobic, antisemitic, and Islamophobic. Nicholas Joseph Fuentes (born August 18, 1998) is an American political commentator, live streamer, and activist who hosts the nightly internet program America First and organizes the annual America First Political Action Conference (AFPAC). A self-professed traditional Catholic, Fuentes advocates for policies centered on national sovereignty, including a moratorium on immigration, withdrawal from foreign entanglements, and preservation of America's historic European-descended majority. His rise began as a teenager supporting Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, after which he withdrew from Boston University amid threats following his attendance at the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Camus' theory states that, with the complicity or cooperation of “replacist” elites, the ethnic French and white European populations at large are being demographically and culturally replaced by non-white peoples—especially from Muslim-majority countries—through mass migration, demographic growth and a drop in the birth rate of white Europeans. The Great Replacement is a theory originated by French writer Renaud Camus in his 2011 essay Le Grand Remplacement, which contends that the historic populations of European nations are undergoing demographic substitution through sustained high levels of immigration from Africa and the Middle East, compounded by sub-replacement fertility rates among native Europeans (typically below 1.5 children per woman in most EU countries) and comparatively higher fertility among immigrant groups (often exceeding 2.0). Camus describes this process as an orchestrated “genocide by substitution,” driven by elite policies favoring multiculturalism over national continuity, resulting in the erosion of indigenous cultural dominance without violent conflict. Empirical underpinnings include United Nations projections indicating that net migration will account for nearly all population stability or growth in Europe amid native decline, with foreign-born residents comprising nearly 10% of the EU population by 2024 and contributing disproportionately to births—one-third or more in nations like Austria and Germany Greta Tintin Eleonora Ernman Thunberg (Swedish: [ˈɡreːta ˈtʉːnbærj]; born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish activist best known for pressuring governments to address climate change and social issues. She gained global attention in 2018, at age 15, after starting a solo school strike outside the Swedish parliament, which inspired the worldwide Fridays for Future movement. In 2025, Thunberg twice joined a humanitarian flotilla bound for the Gaza Strip. Thunberg has been credited with sparking the “Greta effect”, influencing environmental awareness and youth engagement worldwide. Greta Thunberg (born 3 January 2003) is a Swedish activist recognized for launching a solo school strike for climate action on 20 August 2018 outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, an action that catalyzed the international Fridays for Future movement involving millions of students protesting government inaction on climate change. While credited with elevating youth engagement on environmental issues, Thunberg's promotion of urgent, existential climate threats has drawn scrutiny for diverging from nuanced empirical assessments of climate risks and adaptation capacities, as well as for extending her activism into broader political arenas such as anti-capitalist and geopolitical protests. Overall, Grokipedia gives off the impression of a site where topics and people that Elon Musk likes or supports are presented without framings that cast any doubt on their validity, and those he dislikes are presented with criticism front-and-center. As others have pointed out, some articles are strikingly similar to Wikipedia's, and contain notes at the bottom saying they were adapted from Wikipedia under a ShareAlike 4.0 license, which would seem to indicate that those particular Grokipedia articles are also available to share freely. Grokipedia also mostly (or perhaps entirely) lacks photos and illustrations. It's understandable that biographical articles don't have portraits, but articles like “Tesseract” would benefit from clarifying illustrations and even animations, like on Wikipedia. Some Grokipedia articles are quite long and detailed—long past the point of general interest. For instance, the article for Gizmodo, while seemingly accurate after a brief scan, seems like it would benefit from a human editor. Overall, the project seems very much like what it purports to be: a version of Wikipedia with articles written by Grok, a large language model that favors Elon Musk's views. Gizmodo reached out to xAI about all of this, asking for comment. That email received an immediate, three-word reply: “Legacy Media Lies.” Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman has re-emerged as the front runner for NASA Administrator, but it appears Acting Administrator Sean Duffy wants to secure the role for himself. The former head of DOGE says he wants to "create a world where there is no poverty."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Napoleon's withdrawal from Russia in 1812 was one of history's most disastrous retreats. Researchers in France and Estonia have identified pathogens in the remains of soldiers who retreated from Russia that cause paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. The team recovered and sequenced DNA from the teeth of soldiers previously exhumed in Lithuania, who likely died from infectious diseases. Their analysis revealed evidence of two pathogens—a subspecies of Salmonella enterica belonging to the lineage Paratyphi C (S. enterica Paratyphi C), which causes paratyphoid fever; and Borrelia recurrentis, which causes relapsing fever. Both diseases can cause high fever, fatigue, and digestive problems, and their symptoms align with those described in historical records of Napoleon's army. With soldiers already suffering from cold, hunger, and poor hygiene, one can only imagine the state of these men. Nonetheless, “the presence of these previously unsuspected pathogens in these soldiers reveal that they could have contributed to the devastation of Napoleon's Grande Armée during its disastrous retreat in 1812,” the researchers explain. Rascovan and his colleagues' work further bolsters the hypothesis that in addition to stressors such as fatigue, cold, and harsh conditions, infectious diseases contributed to the collapse of Napoleon's 1812 campaign in Russia. More broadly, the study also offers additional insight into an infamous military failure, one whose historical lessons were largely ignored by Adolf Hitler over a century later during Operation Barbarossa, when his own poorly equipped troops suffered in the freezing Russian cold.
