                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As November approaches, the Hologic WTA Tour reaches its season finale. 2025 WTA Finals Riyadh: Draws | Order of Play | Scores Road to the WTA Finals: Sabalenka | Swiatek | Gauff | Anisimova | Pegula | Rybakina The year-end tournament, held on indoor hard courts and using the Wilson US Open Regular Duty ball, begins on Saturday, Nov. 1 with group round-robin play. Both draws are split into two groups of four, and each player will play the other three members of their group once. ‚Ä¢    In a three-way tie, the tiebreaker is determined by matches played, total sets won and total games won. An undefeated singles champion would receive $5.235 million, while a singles champion with just one round-robin loss will take home $4.88 million. In doubles, a perfect 5-0 record will result in $1.139 million, and a one round-robin loss campaign returns $1.067 million. Ranking points per win (both draws)‚Ä¢    Round-robin = 200‚Ä¢    Semifinal = 400‚Ä¢    Final = 500 An undefeated tournament results in 1,500 ranking points. Here's a full breakdown of the prize money and ranking points: Stefanie Graf group: Aryna Sabalenka (1), Coco Gauff (3), Jessica Pegula (5), Jasmine Paolini (8)Serena Williams group: Iga Swiatek (2), Amanda Anisimova (4), Elena Rybakina (6), Madison Keys (7) Andreeva will also compete in doubles after qualifying alongside partner Diana Shnaider. üìùWho will be crowned the WTA Finals champion this year? Martina Navratilova group: Sara Errani/Jasmine Paolini (1), Veronika Kudermetova/Elise Mertens (4), Hsieh Su-Wei/Jelena Ostapenko (6), Asia Muhammad/Demi Schuurs (8)Liezel Huber group: Katerina Siniakova/Taylor Townsend (2), Gabriela Dabrowski/Erin Routliffe (3), Mirra Andreeva/Diana Shnaider (5), Timea Babos/Luisa Stefani (7) Three doubles teams return from the 2024 field -- Errani/Paolini, Townsend/Siniakova and Dabrowski/Routliffe. Three new teams are also here to shake things up, including Andreeva and Shnaider, the youngest duo to qualify for the doubles year-end finale in 25 years. Gauff took home the 2024 WTA Finals title after outlasting China's Zheng Qinwen in a three-set thriller. Canada's Dabrowski and New Zealand's Routliffe are back to defend their doubles title. 8 seed Siniakova and Townsend 7-5, 6-3 in the final, part of an undefeated campaign. Sabalenka's success is often defined by her Grand Slams. She began her season winning 11 consecutive matches, taking the Brisbane International title, before Keys ended her streak in the Australian Open final. Bouncing back with 1000-level wins in Miami and Madrid, Sabalenka fell short again in the final at Roland Garros, this time to Gauff, followed by a semifinal exit at Wimbledon a month later. A post shared by WTA Finals Riyadh (@wtafinalsriyadh) Sabalenka played just one tournament after New York, reaching the semifinals in Wuhan. 1 ranking, one that she's held since October 2024, has remained intact, and Sabalenka has a chance to finally lift the Billie Jean King trophy in her fifth consecutive WTA Finals appearance. ‚Ä¢    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 4‚Ä¢    Best finish: Champion (2023)‚Ä¢    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage‚Ä¢    2025 hard-court record: 40-10 (.800)‚Ä¢    2025 titles: 3 -- Wimbledon (Grand Slam), Cincinnati Open (1000), Korea Open (500) Despite losing her bid for four straight French Open titles after a semifinal loss to Sabalenka, Swiatek bounced back and dominated grass-court season, historically her most challenging surface. But she one-upped herself in her next tournament, winning her first Wimbledon singles title with a dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory over Anisimova in just under an hour. To close out the summer, she racked up hard-court wins in Cincinnati and Seoul, part of a stretch where she won 14 of 15 matches. She enters Riyadh seeking her second career WTA Finals title, joining Gauff as the only players in this field who have won WTA Finals titles. ‚Ä¢    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 3‚Ä¢    Best finish: Champion (2024)‚Ä¢    2024 WTA Finals finish: Champion‚Ä¢    2025 hard-court record: 29-9 (.763)‚Ä¢    2025 titles: 2 -- French Open (Grand Slam), Wuhan Open (1000) The high of Gauff's year came in Paris, where the 21-year-old won her second career Grand Slam at Roland Garros, defeating Sabalenka in three sets after dropping the first. To follow, however, would be a difficult summer. Early exits in Berlin and Wimbledon, followed by a coaching change to address her serve struggles, culminated in a fourth-round loss to Naomi Osaka at the US Open. Gauff won 9-of-10 matches across Beijing and Wuhan, claiming her third WTA 1000 title in the latter, with the lone defeat coming to compatriot Anisimova in the semifinals in Beijing. The lone debutant at this year's WTA Finals, Anisimova had a stellar 2025 campaign, claiming two WTA 1000 titles in Doha and Beijing. En route to the Wimbledon singles final, her first Grand Slam final appearance, she knocked off Sabalenka in three sets in the semifinals before falling to Swiatek. Anisimova ultimately reached the singles final in New York, falling to Sabalenka 6-3, 7-6. In 2024, she withdrew after two matches because of a left-knee injury, and was replaced by Daria Kasatkina. ‚Ä¢    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 2‚Ä¢    Best finish: Group stage (2023, 2024)‚Ä¢    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage‚Ä¢    2025 hard-court record: 38-13‚Ä¢    2025 titles: 2 -- Strasbourg (500), Ningbo Open (500) Rybakina recently qualified for her third consecutive WTA Finals by reaching the semifinals of the Toray Pan Pacific Open. However, Rybakina withdrew ahead of her semifinal match, citing a back injury, which could play a factor in Riyadh. ‚Ä¢    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 1‚Ä¢    Best finish: Group stage (2016)‚Ä¢    2024 WTA Finals finish: Did not qualify‚Ä¢    2025 hard-court record: 24-6 (.800)‚Ä¢    2025 titles: 2 -- Adelaide International (500), Australian Open (Grand Slam) Keys started 2025 hotter than any player on tour. But since Indian Wells, Keys has reached only one semifinal. ‚Ä¢    Previous WTA Finals appearances: 1‚Ä¢    Best finish: Group stage (2024)‚Ä¢    2024 WTA Finals finish: Group stage‚Ä¢    2025 hard-court record: 25-12 (.676)‚Ä¢    2025 titles: 1 -- Internazionali BNL d'Italia (1000) The semifinal finish was one of five this season, in addition to Miami, Stuttgart, Bad Homburg and Wuhan. Paolini became the first Italian woman to win her nation's biggest tournament since Raffaella Reggi in 1985. The victory marked her second WTA 1000 singles title and first on clay. She also won the doubles tournament in Rome alongside Errani.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across 25 years on the ATP Tour, Nicolas Mahut crafted a career that any player would envy. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings, and a Davis Cup victory for France. Among the countless memories, one match still stands out ‚Äî not for a trophy, but for its place in tennis history. Fifteen years on, Mahut can still smile when people ask if he beat John Isner in their record-breaking 2010 Wimbledon epic, which stretched over three days and lasted 11 hours and five minutes. ‚ÄúIt will stay somehow in both categories and that's not a bad thing. ‚ÄúIt is one of my biggest memories, inevitably. The Frenchman's 70-68 fifth-set loss to Isner once felt like a burden. But time and perspective have given Mahut peace. ‚ÄúI now enjoy talking about that match because it was a crazy experience,‚Äù Mahut said. Mahut went on to capture 37 tour-level doubles titles, including two Nitto ATP Finals crowns and five major titles with longtime partner Pierre-Hugues Herbert, ascending to No. I perhaps wasn't strong enough to leave my mark on the tennis world through my record, but I found a way to be associated, for eternity, with Wimbledon, which for me is the greatest [tournament] in the world,‚Äù Mahut, who won Wimbledon in 2016, humbly said. ‚ÄúWhen I went this year with my son, walking through the aisles, he saw his name after all, because it's also his. That sense of pride and completion surrounded Mahut's farewell this week at the Rolex Paris Masters, where he played his final match alongside good friend Grigor Dimitrov ‚Äî a 6-4, 5-7, 10-4 defeat to Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin on Tuesday afternoon. Nicolas Mahut bids farewell at the Rolex Paris Masters. ‚ÄúWe always wanted to do a few double sessions together throughout the last years, but I was honestly never really able to commit,‚Äù Dimitrov said of Mahut. I have a very sentimental relationship with him. ‚ÄúFor so many years, we played against each other. We competed more than once on such a big occasion. Although his doubles achievements stand tall, Mahut was also a formidable singles player. He earned 181 tour-level wins and lifted four ATP Tour trophies, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, triumphing in ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch (2013, ‚Äò15, ‚Äò16) and Newport (2013). That translated seamlessly to his later doubles success. Alongside Herbert, he built one of the most accomplished partnerships of the modern era, becoming one of only eight teams to complete the career Grand Slam in men's doubles. Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert triumph at the Nitto ATP Finals in 2021. ‚ÄúBeing able to win Grand Slams was for me one of the best memories,‚Äù Mahut said. Beyond the titles, the trophies that I may have, it's also ultimately everything that happened in order for me to achieve those trophies and victories. This richness was celebrated in moving fashion in Paris, when his longtime sponsor, Lacoste, surprised him at dawn on the new centre court at La D√©fense Arena. I came in the morning, and on the centre court at 6 a.m. there was no one there,‚Äù Mahut said. Already the fact of experiencing this, to see again some polos that I wore during certain victories, reminded me of memories.‚Äù Mahut's love affair with tennis began long before his first ATP Tour match. More than two decades later, his dream of replicating that feat became a reality. In 2017, Mahut won all three of his doubles rubbers during France's title run and finally held the Davis Cup trophy in his hands. ‚ÄúIt has guided my entire career,‚Äù Mahut said of the Davis Cup. ‚ÄúThat's why I wanted to play, because it made me dream. I wanted to be a tennis player after watching the Davis Cup in 1991. That's what made me want to do it, and I didn't know what I would have to do. As the curtain falls at the Rolex Paris Masters, Mahut bids farewell not defined by any scoreline, but by a lifetime of grace, grit, and the quiet satisfaction of a dream fulfilled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Felix Auger-Aliassime kept alive his Nitto ATP Finals qualification hopes on Tuesday at the Rolex Paris Masters, where he battled from a set down to defeat Argentine qualifier Francisco Comesana 6-7(2), 6-3, 6-3. The Canadian won the title at the ATP 250 event in Brussels nine days ago but was forced to retire during his quarter-final clash in Basel last week. Following his first-round win in Paris, Auger-Aliassime moved to within 440 points of eighth-placed Lorenzo Musetti in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. In a hard-fought battle against Comesana, Auger-Aliassime did not drop a point behind his first serve in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and then overpowered the World No. 68 in the decider to triumph after two hours and 20 minutes in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Auger-Aliassime will next meet Frenchman Alexandre Muller in Paris. Joao Fonseca won his second ATP Tour title on Sunday when he triumphed at the ATP 500 event in Basel. On Tuesday in Paris, the Brazilian backed up that victory with a 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 comeback win against Denis Shapovalov to reach the second round on his tournament debut. Fonseca moved past the Canadian en route to becoming the third-youngest ATP 500 champion in series history (since 2009) last week in Switzerland and once again had the better of proceedings. I am very happy to change the mindset and be ready for this match. I wasn't playing my best in the beginning, I felt my hip a bit, but it is all good, nothing we can't adjust for the next round and we keep going." 28 in the PIF ATP Rankings, hit with clean power off both wings and overcame a physical issue in the third set, during which he received a medical timeout, to improve to 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Fonseca will next meet 10th seed Karen Khachanov. The 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion is the first Brazilian player to win a match at the Masters 1000 event in Paris since Tomaz Bellucci in 2015. Daniil Medvedev earned his first victory at the Rolex Paris Masters since 2021, when he reached the final. The 11th seed beat Jaume Munar 6-1, 6-3 to snap a three-match losing streak at the indoor hard-court event. Medvedev has now earned 40 tour-level wins in 2025 and has looked much improved in recent weeks. He reached the semi-finals in Shanghai earlier this month and then won the title in Almaty. In other early action, Shanghai champion Valentin Vacherot moved past Jiri Lehecka 6-1, 6-3 to set a rematch against his cousin Arthur Rinderknech.
