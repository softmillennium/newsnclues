Amazon announced Tuesday that it plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs as part of a broader effort to become leaner in an era shaped by AI.Employees in the US, Canada, and Europe have been receiving notifications about the cuts, according to internal Slack posts viewed by Business Insider. A notification to affected workers, sent by Amazon's HR chief, Beth Galetti, and posted to Amazon's internal Slack, suggested that laid-off employees would receive full pay and benefits for the next 90 days, plus a severance offer. According to internal Slack messages seen by Business Insider, some of the Amazon employees affected by the cuts work in advertising, recruitment, payments, devices, Fire TV, and customer behavior analytics.Amazon's mass job cuts extend to its audiobook and podcast division, Audible. CEO Bob Carrigan told employees in an email Tuesday, which was seen by Business Insider, that affected workers have been notified and additional organizational changes would follow "to add focus and speed" to the business's most critical growth areas. Carrigan said that Audible is "laser-focused on making sure we are organized and resourced for continued strength in the years ahead." Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI." Some employees in Germany received a security alert on their work devices indicating that their access to company systems had been placed in "reduced functionality mode," according to an internal Slack message reviewed by Business Insider. The message explained that this status typically appears when an employee's role is being closed or transferred.</p>

Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services, emailed the organization saying the company cut roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to "lean in on AI." It is unclear how many devices employees were impacted by the layoffs. "Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products," Roy wrote in a memo posted by an employee to Amazon's internal Slack. "In support of this mission, I encourage you all to: Focus on the work that most directly impacts our customers, lean in on Al to enhance your effectiveness, [and] raise your hand when you see opportunities to simplify or eliminate unnecessary processes." Amazon's HR chief Beth Galetti announced the broader cuts on Tuesday, saying the company is becoming leaner because AI is allowing companies to innovate faster than ever before. As with other teams across Amazon, we've taken a hard look at our level of investment for various programs, which is resulting in some roles being eliminated within the OS & Services org. Notifications to impacted colleagues in our organization have now been completed for the U.S. and Canada. In other regions, we are following local processes, which may include time for consultation with employee representative bodies and possibly result in longer timelines to communicate with impacted employees. Moving forward, we remain focused on our mission to help product teams launch delightful products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to maintain funding of so-called SNAP benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown. The suit was filed four days after the Trump administration said it would not use emergency funding to maintain benefits during the shutdown from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has said that SNAP benefits will cease Saturday, the lawsuit noted. "Because of USDA's actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program's inception." "Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act," the states said in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts. "Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide," said New York State Attorney General Letitia James in a statement on the suit. "SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running," James said. "There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families." "Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program," the page says. "Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01," the department said. "We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats," the site said. "They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance." There is no current end in sight for the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1. Nearly all Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the Republican bill because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft's GitHub unit on Tuesday announced Agent HQ, a new "mission control" interface that will allow software developers to manage coding agents from multiple vendors on a single platform. Several companies, including GitHub, have built and released popular agents that are specifically designed for programming. Developers will now be able to manage agents from GitHub, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI and Cognition in one place with Agent HQ. "We want to bring a little bit of order to the chaos of innovation," Daigle told CNBC in an interview. "With so many different agents, there's so many different ways of kicking off these asynchronous tasks, and so our big opportunity here is to bring this all together." Agent HQ users will be able to access a command center where they can assign, steer and monitor the work of multiple agents. That means they'll be able to see what their agents are working on and course correct in real time if they get off track. The third-party agents will begin rolling out to GitHub Copilot subscribers in the coming months, but Copilot Pro+ users will be able to access OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders this week, the company said. Its platform now supports more than 180 million developers, and the company said it is growing at its fastest rate ever. "This is an era of abundance for AI and we just want to make sure that that abundance doesn't turn to chaos," Daigle said. "We can allow you to have a great experience using all of these tools via a very open GitHub platform."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio on Tuesday warned that a bubble could be forming around megacap technology in the U.S. amid the artificial intelligence boom, but said that it may not end until the Federal Reserve reverses its current easy policies. "There's a lot of bubble stuff going on," Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from the Future Investment Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. "But bubbles don't pop, really, until they are popped by tightness of monetary policy and so on." The hedge fund titan said he uses a personal "bubble indicator" that's relatively high right now. Dalio joins a growing chorus of well-known market participants that have cautioned about the potential for a bubble tied to AI spending in recent months. The Fed is set to cut rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and many investors expect the central bank it will do so again at its final meeting of the year in December. The billionaire investor also pointed out that outside of AI-linked names, the market as a whole has done "relatively poorly" and there's a "concentrated environment." He noted that 80% of gains are concentrated within Big Tech. The three major indexes on Monday rallied to all-time closing highs, led higher by technology stocks with more good AI news expected from a series of Big Tech earnings this week. Dalio said there's a "two-part economy," with the easing of interest rates because of weakening in some places while a bubble develops elsewhere. He said monetary policy cannot aid both ends of this spectrum given the divergence, making it more likely that the bubble will continue. "Whether or not it's a bubble and when that bubble is going to burst, maybe we don't know exactly," Dalio said. "But what we can say is there's a lot of risk."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nokia shares soared 26% higher following the news. Nokia will issue over 166 million new shares and will use the proceeds to fund its plans for AI and other general corporate purposes. The two companies also struck a strategic partnership to work together to develop next-generation 6G cellular technology. Nokia said that it would adapt its 5G and 6G software to run on Nvidia's chips, and will collaborate on networking technology for AI. Nokia, a Finnish company, is best known for its early cell phones, but in recent years, it has primarily been a supplier of 5G cellular equipment to telecom providers. The announcement comes as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang prepares to address an audience of policymakers and government leaders in Washington DC to keynote the company's developer conference. Nokia and Nvidia are expected to discuss some of their collaborations and plans at the conference. Nvidia has taken several equity stakes in strategic partners in recent months as the company has found itself at the center of the AI world. In September, it committed a $5 billion investment to one-time rival Intel, and said it would invest $100 billion in OpenAI. It also committed $500 million in self-driving car startup Wayve and a $667 million investment in to U.K. cloud provider Nscale. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The artificial intelligence startup said its nonprofit is now called the OpenAI Foundation, and it holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm. OpenAI said its for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC. Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company as early as 2019, said it supports OpenAI's recapitalization and now holds an investment in the PBC that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis. The company said it held a 32.5% stake in the for-profit on an as-converted basis, excluding OpenAI's recent funding rounds. OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion. In 2024, the company announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. But after facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said in May that its nonprofit would retain control. As part of the announcement, Microsoft said OpenAI has agreed to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, though Microsoft will no longer have a first right of refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider. The companies also outlined several additional changes to their partnership. When OpenAI says it has reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a term for an AI system that rivals or exceeds human intelligence, that claim will have to be verified by an independent expert panel, Microsoft said. The revenue share agreement between the two companies will remain until that panel verifies AGI. Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties. Microsoft said its IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032, and include models post-AGI. OpenAI's consumer hardware is excluded from Microsoft's IP rights. "As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business," Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 results after market close on Wednesday.

"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones)," Galetti wrote. The cuts would represent about 4% of Amazon's roughly 350,000 corporate employees. The latest move is part of Jassy's effort to create a leaner and more disciplined company. In recent years, Amazon cut management layers, slashed bureaucracy, tightened costs, overhauled performance and pay systems, and ordered most corporate employees back to the office five days a week. The company moved to rein in costs by axing unprofitable projects and cutting a bloated workforce. Jassy said in June that AI-driven efficiency gains would shrink Amazon's workforce. Earlier this year, the company froze the hiring budget in its massive retail division, and in July, its cloud arm, Amazon Web Services, also faced layoffs. Big Tech firms have cut thousands of jobs this year, even as their businesses continue to perform well, as they double down on investments in AI. Microsoft announced plans to eliminate around 15,000 positions this year, with CEO Satya Nadella telling employees in a June memo that the company must remain focused on its three core priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation. Meta has also made AI-driven layoffs, informing staff in its risk organization last week that their roles are being replaced by automation technology.</p>

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Claudio Fuentes, 31, who is the cofounder and COO of CompAI, which develops AI software for corporate compliance. Fuentes recently posted on X that his startup will no longer hire people who can't work in-person five days a week at its New York office. This story has been edited for length and clarity. I've been in tech for the last 10 years. We've had a pretty explosive growth curve. Our goal has always been: How do we actually get people in the same office? I'm getting absolutely roasted by most of the remote tech worker community for my post in favor of the office. In the four years I spent in the Bay Area, I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a lot of companies that I saw grow from nothing to Series A, Series B, Series C — absolutely crush it. The culture in San Francisco is hire your best friends, get them in the same room, and let's build great software. Before moving to the Bay Area, I spent six years in New York. So, you can imagine, peak Adam Neumann — hyper growth. I look back very fondly on what he was able to create around culture. The economics and business strategy aside, if you think about the workplace and employee loyalty and productivity that they were able to extract from their workforce, it was bigger than life. I spent a year remote in Miami and one year remote in the Bay Area before I went the full entrepreneurship route. If you spend two years locked in a room, barely seeing sunlight, there's something not natural about that experience. At the end of the day, we're not just building a workplace, we're building a life that's centered around our work. People used to actually meet their spouse at work. With others, we'll try to make it work, but we are definitely prioritizing that every hire from here on is in New York. Aside from all the extracurricular activities we do as a team that build trust and rapport, which then help productivity, one instance stands out. It was about 8:30 in the morning, and one of our guys showed up early to the office, walked up to my cofounder, and said, "What if we implement an AI agent for our customer support? About 20 minutes later, he had already spun up an automation in our Slack that auto-replies to customers when they ask a question by searching our knowledge base. That has cut down our customer-support requests by 95%. That came through this very casual conversation, where the alternative is typically, "Oh, let's hop on a call because it's kind of hard to explain." It's not something you send in a single message. It's like, let me riff with you on this in an unstructured way. Therefore, you prioritize the ideas that are more well-formed, as opposed to riffing. That's what innovation is: It's ill-formed ideas that, through this organic communication, become fully formed and then flourish. I completely get it if your job is working out of a cubicle, and it's just depressing and you hate your life. Workers get more value out of that.We're trying to build the opposite. We're trying to make the statement that having everyone together is important right now. We probably will lose on some people who are maybe more qualified. Do you have a story to share about your workplace?</p>

This comes shortly after the billionaire said on X last month that his team at xAI was building something that would be a "massive improvement over Wikipedia." Grokipedia.com went live on Monday afternoon, but some users said they experienced errors with the site, according to the Washington Post. Business Insider was able to access Grokipedia.com shortly before 7:30 p.m. The website's landing page says Grokipedia is in "version v0.1" and has logged 885,279 articles. The project marks Musk's latest attempt to challenge mainstream platforms he deems politically biased. Once an admirer of Wikipedia, Musk has accused it of harboring liberal viewpoints over the past few years and urged followers in January to "defund Wikipedia until balance is restored." In 2019, he criticized his own Wikipedia page on X, which was then Twitter, saying it was a "war zone with a zillion edits." "Just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years. In December 2022, he posted on X that Wikipedia had a "non-trivial left-wing bias." Musk and Wikipedia's cofounder, Jimmy Wales, also have a long-running online feud. Responding to Wales' comment saying Wikipedia was not for sale, Musk wrote in October 2023 that he would give the platform $1 billion  if it changed its name to "Dickipedia." Wales told the Washington Post in an interview last week that he didn't have high expectations for Grokipedia because AI language models aren't sophisticated enough and "there will be a lot of errors." At press time, Grokipedia's entry on Musk says that the former presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, took up a prominent role in DOGE after Musk's departure. Grok, the AI chatbot developed by Musk's xAI, has drawn criticism in the past for a series of high-profile mistakes. In one instance, the bot promoted a baseless conspiracy theory about "white genocide" in South Africa after being asked unrelated questions. In a June X post, Musk said he would use Grok to "rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge, adding missing information and deleting errors."</p>
