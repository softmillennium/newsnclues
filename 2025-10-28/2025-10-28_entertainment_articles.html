The full-length, Can I Get a Pack of Camel Lights?, is out January 30 via Drag City. Below, watch director Molten Synapse's music video for lead single “Tonic.” Geologist named his new single “Tonic” in honor of a Keiji Haino show he saw at the now-closed New York music venue of the same name. The song features contributions from drummer Alianna Kalaba and Geologist's Animal Collective bandmate David “Avey Tare” Portner. So I went the Ginn route instead and wrote this record. I still can't play or write like my favorites, but the hurdy-gurdy got me closer than guitar ever did.” Geologist worked on Can I Get a Pack of Camel Lights? In addition, his son, Merrick Weitz, plays guitar on “Government Job.” The latest Animal Collective album, Isn't It Now?, arrived in 2023.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In November 2021, a then-unknown college student named Camilla Araújo appeared in one of YouTube's most-watched stunt videos of all time: MrBeast's $456,000 Squid Game re-creation. In one viral clip, MrBeast approaches Araújo and asks her if she even watched the original Squid Games show. But when it dropped, fans were captivated by her. “I gained like 145,000 followers overnight,” she tells Rolling Stone. Araújo has become one of the most well known Gen Z influencers online. On OnlyFans, she attracted fans with explicit content, everything from flirty selfies to full-on sexual acts, available for various rates. Creators on mainstream social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube are now making money by driving traffic to subscription-based content. An entirely new crop of Gen Z creators is skyrocketing to fame through the platform. And for Gen Z creators, OnlyFans is quickly becoming the next major social media app to make it big on. But becoming massive on the app isn't easy. Succeeding on OnlyFans in 2025 often means having a high tolerance for controversy, negative attention, the willingness to troll, and an ability to flip tsunamis of online haters into fans. Araújo is perhaps the best example of someone succeeding on this pipeline. She uses provocative and polarizing content on her public, mainstream feeds to generate outrage online, like including her teen brother in her podcast interview clips, or performing as a ditzy character aimed at triggering men. She teases her OnlyFans content with suggestive posts. (Even her OnlyFans bio seems to lean into this mashing up of the safe and the edgy: “You might have seen me on MrBeasts ‘Squid Games' or maybe you've seen me in the BOP House, but one thing's for sure … You haven't seen me without my clothes on … Why don't we change that?”) While she and MrBeast, real name Jimmy Donaldson, have radically different business models, they are remarkably similar in their approach to the internet. They are both strategic architects of virality, hyper-aware of what content spreads, why people engage, and how to turn that engagement into revenue. Both spend an enormous time studying the internet and learning trends. They're both extremely data driven and obsessed with optimizing every single last aspect of their content. They're experts at engineering audience behavior, monetizing attention, and driving onlookers crazy. Araújo didn't set out to become an OnlyFans star. Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Brazilian parents, she grew up in what she calls a “household of love, not money.” Her mother worked at Subway and a fish market and her father worked at Domino's. Growing up as the daughter of immigrant parents, Araújo learned how hard it was to get by without money and connections. She taught them English and would go to the grocery store for them as a child, helping out in any way she could. But my childhood was filled with so much love and unity.” Araújo kept her head down and graduated in the top 10 of her class in 2020 before enrolling at a nursing program at East Carolina University. IShowSpeed Rocketed Into His Next Era of Celebrity at L.A. Emilie Kiser Blocks Three-Year-Old's Death Records From Going Public — For Now Soon, like many students there, she began working for Donaldson, whose headquarters is in Greenville. She got the job through a friend and her role mostly consisted of running around grabbing coffee and assisting with production. “Me and the Beast crew became really good friends, even Jimmy; to this day, he's such an incredible, incredible person,” Araújo says. Donaldson often relies on staffers to function as extras or performers in his video. After just a few months on the job, Araújo was invited to participate in his massive re-creation of Squid Game. People Araújo didn't know began to recognize her. As the video racked in over 883 million views, Araújo's social following skyrocketed. Within a month, she dropped out of college and quit her job at Beast Productions to pursue content creation full time. For a year, she grinded on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. She posted lifestyle and comedy videos but struggled to find a niche or figure out a good genre to operate within. “I failed for like a year straight.” Finally, in the fall of 2022, she said “fuck it” and launched an OnlyFans. “There are clips of me being like, ‘I would never. '” She was concerned about the stigma and what people in North Carolina would think, and she didn't want to take what she thought was just an easy road to money. But she quickly realized how much it takes to succeed on the platform. “We didn't speak for four or five months,” she recently said on Logan Paul's Impaulsive podcast, “which in Latin culture that's very, very rare.” “I would go from my nine to five job, and then I would leave my nine to five and then go straight to my bottle service job, get off at four o'clock in the morning and do it all over again,” she says. She moved in with her boyfriend at the time and his best friend, and the three essentially formed a mini content house. Trolling people for attention has become the fastest way to OnlyFans stardom. Araújo decided that her particular brand of rage bait would be to play into men's stereotypes about female creators. She knew many men didn't take OnlyFans seriously as a career, so she decided to troll them about that. They hate when a woman who does OnlyFans calls herself an entrepreneur. You're working a nine to five, and if you think it's so easy to make money selling your body, why don't you whip it out and show them how it's done?' “I knew how to trigger people by saying things, and it worked,” Araújo says. Like Donaldson, Araújo will also iterate endlessly on her content. If a concept is working, she'll make 10 more videos that are almost identical. “You beat it into the fucking ground.” However, lately she's hoping to expand her content. “An absolute marketing GENIUS” reads a top comment on the post with over 28,000 likes. But making people angry online for views comes with consequences. Araújo says that she's recently realized that part of why she's leaned into rage-bait content is as a defense mechanism. And it's easier to make a check off of people hating you. Clips from Araújo's podcast have racked up millions of views on Instagram. Araújo's long-term goal, however, is to use OnlyFans as a launching pad. She sees OnlyFans today as many young people saw TikTok in 2020, or YouTube a decade ago: It's a platform that hasn't yet been saturated, and there's still room to generate a massive amount of money and fame. Eventually, with enough success online, a content creator will reach escape velocity and become accepted by the traditional entertainment and media world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Kim Kardashian has a style snafu, it's Naomi Watts to the rescue. Kardashian has been posting vlogs to TikTok from her recent European press tour for Hulu's “All's Well,” and shared a “fashion emergency” she faced while in London on the platform Monday night. Sitting in her glam chair, Kardashian FaceTimed Watts, who was getting her hair and makeup done at the same hotel. Oh my god, you look amazing …” Kardashian told her co-star. “Really quick, I need lube for my latex pants. “Oh my God, you've called the right person,” Watts replied. “I'm going to send it over!” offered Watts on the video. Added the actress, “It'll be on a tray. The style star proceeded to sit on the floor and cover her legs in Watts' intimate play oil before pulling on her second-skin latex thigh-highs (with assistance). Atop the latex, Kardashian was zipped into a leather bustier dress from Dilara Findikoglu with layered silver necklaces. The “All's Fair” cast has been serving some serious style on the red carpet during their press tour this fall, but Kardashian's recent vlogs show that they're adorable friends off-screen, too, with relationships that we are living for.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: We're told by sources close to the project that Luca Guadagnino‘s American Psycho reinterpretation won't be gender-swapped. Interest has been high in Guadagnino and Lionsgate's reimagining ever since we revealed the package a year ago. Speculation has been rife over who will be cast in the film. Austin Butler and Jacob Elordi have both been rumored online in that time, but nothing has been set so far and casting discussions continue. Chloë Sevigny revealed over the summer that she pitched Guadagnino to reprise her role as Jean but added that the suggestion didn't gain much traction with the filmmaker. The Mary Harron-helmed 2000 adaptation starred Bale as Bateman, Sevigny as Jean, and also included Reese Witherspoon, Justin Theroux, Jared Leto, Willem Dafoe, Josh Lucas, Bill Sage, Samantha Mathis and Matt Ross. Scott Z. Burns is adaptating Bret Easton Ellis' classic novel. Lionsgate is the studio for producer Frenesy Films. The graphic violence of its Manhattan investment banker-turned-serial killer led to it being censored in several countries. In the story, “A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman, hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Norwegian auteur Joachim Trier seems to adhere to that same school of thought, and his latest film is both a wonderful movie on its own and an even better one about making the damn things. “Sentimental Value,” Trier's follow-up to his beloved “The Worst Person in the World,” reunites Trier with his star Renate Reinsve, and adds in Stellan Skarsgård, Elle Fanning, Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas, and one heck of a wonderful Oslo house to his coterie of major talents. In the film, Skarsgård plays lauded filmmaker Gustav Borg, who long ago abandoned his family (including daughters Nora, played by Reinsve, and Agnes, played by Lilleaas) in pursuit of his career. Related Stories ‘One Battle After Another' Leads 2025 Gotham Film Awards Nominees Bruce Springsteen Spent Years Saying No to Movies — Until the ‘Deliver Me from Nowhere' Team Got Him to Say Yes This would be a tough enough ask without Gustav's other big project: making a film that's (maybe) about his family, definitely includes the casting of a rising American star (Fanning), and seems entirely designed to make Nora (who has become an actress herself) totally nuts. As our own David Ehrlich wrote in his Critic's Pick review of the film out of Cannes, Gustav's “plan — like everything else in the transcendently moving ‘Sentimental Value,' a layered masterpiece that ‘The Worst Person in the World' director Joachim Trier has been working toward for his entire career — is layered with a delicate sense of personal history.” By the time Trier and Eskil Vogt's dazzling screenplay arrives at a final scene whose power is all the more immense because viewers will see it coming a mile away, we're so familiar with the house's energy and layout that any change to it lands with the force of a wrecking ball.” The film premiered at Cannes in May, where it won the Grand Prix, and went on to play at Telluride, TIFF, and NYFF. Norway has already selected it as its official Oscar entry, and is considered a strong contender in a number of other categories, particularly in the acting categories. Neon will release “Sentimental Value” in theaters on Friday, November 11. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

"We're convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business," the company told staff Tuesday.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


Amazon, led by CEO Andy Jassy, is slashing its workforce by about 14,000 roles, the company told employees Tuesday morning.


	In a note to staff from Beth Galetti, senior vp of people experience and technology at Amazon, she said that while the company is doing well, it needs to get leaner and move faster in order to compete, given the rapid changes in technology.




	“What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly,” Galetti wrote. “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We're convicted that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”

	She also noted however that while the company makes cuts, it will also be hiring in other areas, and is giving impacted employees 90 days to find another job within the company, with recruiters prioritizing internal candidates.


	The changes come a few months after Jassy outlined his thoughts on using generative AI at Amazon, telling employees that “it should change the way our work is done.


	“We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” he continued. “It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.”

	











	It is not immediately clear to what extent Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video will be impacted by the layoffs, though the note indicated that they would be across the company.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No one knows quite what to expect from Apple TV's Pluribus, and that's exactly what series creator Vince Gilligan wants. The psychological sci-fi thriller has had some curious marketing, and even the proper trailer raises questions about its plot. All we know is that a virus of some sort has made the population supremely happy, with the exception of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), the only person on Earth burdened with rage, sorrow, and confusion. Gilligan, who reunites with the actor three years after Better Call Saul‘s end, claims he doesn't want viewers to know much more than that in advance of the premiere on November 7. But the Breaking Bad creator does admit that he's been thinking about Pluribus for almost a decade now and rewired the project so that Seehorn could star. Club spoke to Gilligan about what drew him to this subject matter, sci-fi inspirations, and how audiences should prepare for Pluribus‘ twisted ride. Club: How long has this idea been with you? I ask because almost 20 years ago, you co-created a show called A.M.P.E.D. with Frank Spotnitz about an epidemic affecting the planet. What inspired you to stick with the larger concept, and how did it turn into Pluribus? Vince Gilligan: Oh, yeah, that show with Frank. It was about an epidemic that turned people into various things, so it was not like Pluribus per se. It was like a Michael Mann show crossed with X-Files. Anyway, with Pluribus, it's more about a hive mind. I was thinking about a guy who, suddenly, the world is very nice to him, and they love him. He hasn't done anything particularly to deserve it, but they just love this guy. I pondered that for weeks and months and then decided, because at the same time I was working with Peter Gould on Better Call Saul, I thought, “Wow, we got so many good actors on this show. And now I can't wait for the world to see how wonderful she is in Pluribus. Our whole crew feels that way about her. We got a lot of the same folks who worked on Better Call Saul in Albuquerque, so they've known her for 10 years or more now, and they'd crawl across broken glass for her. I just grew up watching and inhaling it as a little kid—well into my teens and adulthood, too. And that's what we intended to do with Pluribus. AVC: Carol Sturka is single-handedly trying to fix this global problem. Loneliness is something your other leads, Walter White and Saul Goodman, go through as well. What about this feeling makes for good storytelling? VG: I relate to people who feel like outsiders. I get what it's like to be an outsider.” Hell, everybody does. There might be billionaires out there who feel like underdogs because everybody loves underdogs, everybody loves Rocky Balboa. So I like a hero who is not fully equipped for the task. Carol Sturka wants to save the world, but it doesn't necessarily need to be done by her. She just assumes someone else will take the reins of this thing. She's not fully equipped to do it. It's not even necessarily clear that the world needs saving. AVC: Is there any narrative reason you chose romance author as Carol's profession? I was thinking about different professions, like what if she were a florist or something instead? When you think of someone who saves the world, you'd want a Liam Neeson or a Tom Cruise. That's about the last person in the world you want tasked with saving humanity because we're all a bunch of inept idiots. Okay, we're not all idiots, but if you spend your whole life doing that, it means you don't want to be in charge of something of this scale. And then I started thinking about what kind of writer Carol should be. I can say from 30-plus years of experience that screenwriters are boring. It's so much more fun than writing. Writing is probably more crucial and integral to what it is I do, but it's not as much fun. I love directing and being able to say, “I want to do this big thing or set piece.” I put out my hand, and someone puts a hot dog in there. I can say there's not enough mustard, and then I go away, and then the crew makes magic happen. When you're a director, I'm realizing now, it's not unlike Carol being treated so solicitously by the others. At the beginning, it's just raw fear though. Maybe I'm like dime-store Sigmund Freud here, and maybe that's part of where this idea came from for Pluribus. So shooting there is worth the strain and the fear of people wondering if it's set there because of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul and that there must be a connection. It probably would have behooved us structurally to set the show somewhere else. But I didn't want to be putting Pennsylvania license plates on all the cars in Albuquerque. I just figured we should rip the Band-Aid off and shoot on location. AVC: Since there's limited information about the show and we can't reveal any spoilers, how do you want to set audience's expectations for Pluribus? VG: I almost don't want the audience to expect anything. I just want them to be along for the ride and wonder, “Oh, which way is the roller coaster going now?” My heart's desire is not to prepare them at all. The tagline that I used when I pitched to Apple was something like “The most miserable person on Earth tries to save the world from happiness.” But some of my favorite experiences ever of watching movies and TV shows were when I went into them cold. And that was such a good experience. What I not so secretly hope for potential viewers of Pluribus is to relax and say, “All right, the guy didn't want to talk about it much, so I'm not going to go seek out information on it. Tell me when I can watch it on streaming and when it hits Apple TV.” I want people to just [read this] and say, “All right, I'm going to follow his suggestion here and just watch it.” That's how I like watching things, when I don't know much about them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's no secret that Donald Trump hates this country and its people. Aside from siccing his underachieving shock troops on American cities, he's also posted AI-generated videos of himself dumping liquid shit on his electorate from a jet christened “King Trump.” As he spends his time stewing and whining that we aren't thankful enough for the president who made the country more violent, hateful, and expensive, he's also knocking down the White House to make way for a 90,000 square foot ballroom that our tech overlords are helping to fund. He's also begun talking much more openly about a third term—though some methods are “too cute” for his liking. All of that would be bad enough if we weren't also facing the existential threat of climate change, which, we must say, isn't going to fix itself. Wouldn't you know it, we've missed another “catastrophic tipping point.” As many have said before, living in interesting times sucks. But while there's not much to be hopeful about, Stewart did interview New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who has eight days left until the election. “And I can tell you what we found in this campaign is that young people have been at the heart of the belief that something could be more than this.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ten days after dropping new album Deadbeat, the Australian psychedelic rock band staged its first proper concert since March 2023. Tame Impala returned earlier this month with its fifth studio album Deadbeat – and on Monday (Oct. 27) at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, the Australian psychedelic rock outfit returned to the stage with its first proper show since a headlining performance at Lollapalooza Brazil in March 2023. But Tame Impala and its creative mastermind, Kevin Parker, have remained busy. Last year, Parker produced much of Dua Lipa's third album, Radical Optimism, and he appeared on two Justice songs, one of which, “Neverender,” won a Grammy for best dance/electronic recording. And, with Deadbeat, which continues the evolution of Tame's original psych-rock sound toward more dance-oriented music, Parker notched another milestone: The set's single “Dracula” became his first entry as lead artist on the Hot 100, and currently sits at No. At Barclays Center on Monday, and backed by the colorful, elaborate production that has become Tame Impala's calling card, the group honored its psychedelic history while running through much of Deadbeat for a career-spanning set that reaffirmed its bona fides as one of modern rock music's biggest draws. To wit, the show was just the first of four Barclays Center gigs for Tame, before it moves on to gigs in Chicago, Austin and California in November.

In a rare October 24 Instagram post, Briana shared one of only two photos from the spontaneous elopement, giving followers a behind-the-scenes look at the night that left her mom, Vicki Gunvalson, stunned. Briana reflected on her 2011 drive-thru wedding with a heartfelt caption. “Our $132 Las Vegas midnight drive-thru window marriage is 14 years strong!! Thanks for our 4 amazing children and all the adventures so far! Gunvalson was blindsided by her daughter's announcement and admitted she didn't know how to process it at the time. In a 2012 BravoTV.com blog, she wrote, “I didn't tell any of my family members or my friends because I didn't even know how to begin to discuss it. All of my dreams for my only daughter's BIG DAY were taken away from me in an instant (and for that matter taken away from HER).” She added that she knew “very little about Ryan” and was shocked to suddenly have “an instant son-in-law.” Despite her initial disappointment, Gunvalson later came to appreciate her daughter's decision. “Briana was glowing and the most beautiful bride I had ever seen,” Vicki wrote. “I went ‘all out' for her… There wasn't a dry eye at the reception.” Now, more than a decade later, Briana and Ryan are still going strong. I thought Brianna was leaving her husband due to abuse 🤷‍♀️ Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

Ariana Grande's impression of me on SNL was spot-on.” The Hunger Games actress has been candid in discussing the evolution of her career, and revealed that she parted ways with her former agency, CAA, as she felt she was viewed more as a “celebrity than an actor” and was “cut off from my creativity, my imagination.” During The Hollywood Reporter's 2022 actress roundtable, Lawrence addressed on feeling “hijacked” in her career, noting that she was with a “big agency” but also felt like she “was just losing touch with the world a little bit.” “And so, taking a few years and getting back to life, I feel like I can be creative again in that sense.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
