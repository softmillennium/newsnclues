                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a study of more than 100,000 screening mammograms, researchers demonstrated the potential of an AI tool to help identify women at higher risk of developing interval breast cancers, breast cancer that is diagnosed between regular screening mammograms. Interval cancers generally have a worse prognosis compared with screen-detected cancers, because they tend to be either larger or more aggressive. That's why it's important to minimize the number of interval cancers that you have in any screening program." Using a large retrospective dataset from the U.K.'s triennial screening program, Dr. Gilbert and lead researcher Joshua W. D. Rothwell, an M.B.B.S./Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge, employed AI to identify women for supplemental imaging to find interval cancers. "Personalized breast cancer screening depends on accurately assessing an individual's risk of developing breast cancer within a specific timeframe," Dr. Gilbert said. "We can use supplemental imaging and adjust screening frequency based on a woman's breast density and likelihood of developing breast cancer within a short timeframe." The exams were performed between 2014 and 2016 at two U.K. triennial Breast Screening Program centers using two different mammography systems. Negative (no cancer found) digital screening mammograms were processed by Mirai, a deep learning-based algorithm, producing a generalized risk score for developing an interval breast cancer. The AI tool primarily uses information from the mammogram, including tumor features and breast density, to make a risk prediction. "Our results suggest that further workup of mammograms within the top 20% of scores could yield 42.4% of interval cancers, meaning that Mirai could be used to identify women for supplemental imaging or a shortened screening interval, instead of or in addition to breast density," Rothwell said. The AI tool performed better at predicting interval cancers within a year of the screening examination versus 12 to 24 months or 24 to 36 months later. While the tool was less effective in women with extremely dense breast tissue, it showed superior performance compared to conventional risk prediction tools. In the U.K., 2.2 million women are screened for breast cancer every year. According to Dr. Gilbert, AI could help optimize the country's triennial breast cancer screening program by improving the selection criteria for women who could benefit from supplemental imaging, such as MRI or contrast-enhanced mammography, or by shortening the screening interval. Next steps for the researchers include comparing commercially available predictive AI tools, conducting economic modeling and a cost-effective analysis, and conducting a trial utilizing predictive AI to identify women most likely to benefit from supplemental breast imaging following screening mammography. "Identifying women at an increased risk of developing breast cancer is a complex, multifactorial problem," Dr. Gilbert said.

Williams, PhD, Morrissey College of Arts and Sciences, Biology Department, Boston College, explains, "In a monkey model of HIV, we injected two different colored nanoparticles directly into the cerebrospinal fluid—the protective liquid of the brain and spinal cord. These particles effectively labeled the CNS macrophages upon absorption. By using distinct colors, we could mark macrophages at different stages of infection—early versus late—and subsequently determine the specific routes these tagged cells used to exit the CNS." Not only did we discover that the macrophages can leave under noninfection conditions, but we also found that they exit via cranial and peripheral nerves." Robert V.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As modern lifestyles increasingly challenge the body's natural circadian rhythm, the American Heart Association is spotlighting the potential health consequences of regular disruptions to our body's internal clock with a new scientific statement published today in its flagship journal Circulation. The statement, "Role of Circadian Health in Cardiometabolic Health and Disease Risk," outlines how disruptions to circadian rhythm may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and health risk factors including obesity, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Additionally, circadian disruption may be particularly relevant to cardiovascular–kidney–metabolic health, which is associated with cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality risk. Circadian rhythms are produced by the body's natural 24-hour internal clock that regulates a multitude of biological processes like sleep, wakefulness, hormone release, digestion and body temperature. Regular interruptions to the body clock are much more than simple inconveniences like staying up too late or waking up too early. These disruptions may trigger adverse health effects in several different ways. Aligning our daily behaviors, when we sleep, eat and move, with our internal clock is important to support optimal cardiometabolic health." Circadian rhythms are approximately 24-hour cycles in physiological processes that regulate key functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, metabolism and hormone secretion such as cortisol, important for stress response and metabolism. The timing of when an individual sleeps, eats and engages in physical activity are among the behaviors that can influence this alignment. Circadian disruption can occur if a person's internal body clock does not align with their behavior. For example, if an evening person must wake earlier than their body clock expects, perhaps on an overseas trip or for an early morning job, they will be awake during their biologic night, which could disrupt circadian rhythms. Knutson, who specializes in sleep and circadian research specifically focused on associations with cardiometabolic and cognitive health, noted, "Although circadian rhythms play an important role in keeping us healthy, they are often overlooked in everyday medical care. Currently, researchers can only measure circadian rhythms accurately in small, highly controlled lab settings. In everyday health care, doctors often rely on simple clues, such as what time a person says they go to bed, which aren't always precise. Tools like wearable devices, advanced lab tests and artificial intelligence could help track patterns in things like skin temperature and heart rate over 24 hours, giving a clearer picture of an individual's natural body clock rhythm. "Simple changes, like going to bed and waking up at the same time every day, eating meals earlier and getting morning sunlight, may make a meaningful difference in your heart and metabolic health. Ideally, such research may help scientists figure out the best times for healthy habits like sleeping, exercising and eating, and create personalized strategies that match people's natural body clocks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every day, 17 Americans die while waiting for an organ transplant. Opt-out organ donation policies, which enroll everyone into post-mortem donation programs by default unless people choose to opt out, have been touted as a way to increase the supply of desperately needed organs. Pascal Güntürkün and colleagues analyzed epidemiological data from 24 countries between 2000–2023 and conducted four experimental studies with over 5,000 participants to examine how switching from opt-in to opt-out organ donation policies affects both deceased and living donor rates. The authors found that while opt-out policies led to a non-significant increase in deceased donors of 1.21 people per million population, the policies significantly decreased living donors by 4.59 people per million population-a 29% reduction. Through experimental and comparisons between Germany (opt-in) and Austria (opt-out), the authors demonstrated that this crowding-out effect primarily affects so-called "altruistic donations" to acquaintances and strangers, rather than donations to family members. People living in countries with opt-out systems perceive organ supply as sufficient, and are consequently less willing to become living donors. According to the authors, the findings reveal the unintended consequences of a public policy nudge and suggest that policymakers should consider potential crowding-out effects when implementing opt-out organ donation systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ultrasonic sensors measure the distance between a target and the sensor using high-frequency sound waves that are inaudible to humans. Beyond distance measurement, ultrasonic fluid level sensors can also be adapted for other applications such as monitoring depth, temperature, velocity, pressure, and acceleration. In these cases, the emitted waves are detected and interpreted by the appropriate type of sensor. Due to their small size and low power consumption, ultrasonic level sensors are widely used in different industrial use cases. They are predominantly utilized in the machinery, medical, aerospace, agriculture, security, and automotive industries. Ultrasonic sensors are important for automating the factory floor. The sensor is utilized to figure out an object's position by transmitting ultrasonic waves to identify objects within a detection zone. They are also utilized for sorting items, high-speed counting, robotic machine sensing, and liquid level controls. The supply chain and warehousing industry uses ultrasonic sensors for counting, sorting items, high-speed counting, robotic machine sensing, and liquid level controls. Ultrasonic sensors quantify the pieces per second as they pass along a conveyor line or via a port. They may be utilized for sorting and classifying objects and keeping track of a conveyor line's flow rate. Ultrasonic level sensors oversee levels in storage tanks or bins. Using an array sensor, various ultrasonic sensors enable automatic control of bin levels without opening bins' tops or doors. Ultrasonic level sensors are also utilized for waste management and recycling programs. For waste management, they monitor levels in dumpsters, compactors, and trash trucks to ensure the proper amounts are being disposed of. Ultrasonic sensors are especially useful for compacted trash, as users do not need to open the truck or bin to know whether it is full. This time is utilized to calculate the liquid level. The Ultrasonic Liquid Level Meter gives users a reliable leak detection solution by utilizing these devices to detect leaks Introtek sensors utilize a patented pulse-type ultrasonic technology that detects air bubbles, air-in-line, and liquid levels with the highest degree of accuracy and reliability, thereby maintaining an extremely high MTBF. Introtek sensors are not susceptible to the limitations exhibited by continuous wave, capacitive, or load-cell sensors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cancer immunotherapy, especially using T cells, is showing a lot of promise in treating blood cancers. But while they've delivered impressive results against certain blood cancers, they've struggled to make an impact in solid tumors, such as those in the breast, lung, and prostate. A major problem is the tumor microenvironment (TME), which is a mix of cells and molecules that can dampen immune responses. In most solid tumors, inhibitory signals dominate while helpful ones (that tell T cells to keep going) are weak or entirely absent. Since engineered T cells rely on these environmental cues to stay active and functional, they often fall short. This has led scientists to explore ways of building extra receptors into the T cells, so they can pick up tumor-specific signals and respond with added strength. Researchers have tried to create receptors that can sense and react to the TME, but designing them has been difficult because building custom signaling proteins is a complex endeavor. Meanwhile, most current methods for doing so rely heavily on trial-and-error, which eventually makes it hard to control how these synthetic receptors will eventually behave when deployed against a tumor. Now, a team led by Patrick Barth at EPFL and Caroline Arber at UNIL-CHUV has developed a computational platform for designing synthetic protein receptors from scratch. These receptors, called T-SenSERs (tumor microenvironment-sensing switch receptors), are engineered to detect soluble signals found in tumors and convert them into co-stimulatory or cytokine-like signals that boost T cell activity. When combined with conventional CAR-T cells, the synthetic receptors enhanced their anti-tumor effects in models of lung cancer and multiple myeloma. The computational platform can put together artificial receptors by designing and combining different protein domains, like building with molecular Legos. What sets this approach apart from current protein design approaches is that it doesn't treat proteins as rigid structures. Instead, it models them as dynamic, shape-shifting machines-allowing researchers to see, for the first time, how signals travel through these synthetic receptors to control cell behavior." Using the platform, the team created two families of T-SenSERs: one that responds to VEGF, a protein that promotes blood vessel growth and is common in tumors, and another that responds to CSF1, a protein that negatively influences the behavior of immune cells in tumors. When tested, T cells equipped with both a CAR and a T-SenSER responded more strongly to tumors than CAR-T cells alone and showed ligand-specific activities faithfully reflecting the signaling programs encoded by the design method. In mouse models of lung cancer and myeloma, T cells with these synthetic receptors showed improved tumor control and longer survival. Importantly, the team found that their design method allowed them to fine-tune the receptors' behavior, choosing whether it should be always-on, ligand-dependent, or somewhere in between. Computational design of synthetic receptors with programmable signalling activity for enhanced cancer T cell therapy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international clinical study led by the Medical University of Vienna shows that the drug patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) can have a promising effect in patients with active brain metastases of various tumor types. The study was conducted at centres in Austria and Spain, including the Clinical Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna. Brain metastases are a common and difficult-to-treat problem in advanced cancer. Previous research by the Department of Oncology has already indicated that HER3 is particularly frequently expressed in brain metastases. This observation suggests that HER3 could be a promising therapeutic target. In cohort 1 of the TUXEDO-3 study, 21 patients with metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases were treated. Regardless of tumor subtype (hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive, triple-negative), 23.8% achieved a response in the brain. Side effects were mostly manageable; serious adverse events occurred in 28.6% of patients, with no treatment-related deaths. In about a quarter of patients with metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases, HER3-DXd showed clear signs of activity in the brain. These were heavily pretreated patients, many of whom had no remaining effective treatment options  -  so a response rate of around 25% is a notable achievement. Just as important is the ability to maintain, or even improve, quality of life during therapy." Rupert Bartsch, lead author, oncologist at the Clinical Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine I at MedUni Vienna and University Hospital Vienna An objective intracranial response was observed in six patients (30%), thereby meeting the predefined study endpoint. Remarkably, responses also occurred in patients without oncogenic driver mutations, suggesting that HER3-targeted antibody-drug conjugates may have broader therapeutic applicability beyond molecularly defined subgroups. The observed intracranial responses constitute a meaningful advance for this particularly hard-to-treat population." "Our results suggest that HER3-DXd may be a potential treatment option not only for genetically defined subgroups, but also for broader patient groups with active brain metastases from breast and lung cancer. Further larger studies are needed to confirm its clinical benefit. DeNovix discusses how customer demand inspired the development of specialized CellDrop applications for hepatocytes and organoids.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new report from the SingHealth Duke-NUS Global Health Institute (SDGHI), supported by the Octava Foundation, has mapped Singapore's programs supporting children's mental health. Mental health disorders currently account for 28.2% of the disease burden among children, adolescents, and young adults. The report identifies a dynamic and committed landscape of mental health support for children in Singapore. Building on this, the study points to an opportunity to enhance coordination and create more seamless support pathways between these valuable services: Reflecting on the report's findings, the authors and their partners emphasise that turning these insights into lasting impact will require a whole-of-society effort: "Overcoming hurdles like stigma and limited access requires a unified, collaborative effort," said Professor Anne-Claire Stona, lead of the Global Mental Health Program at SDGHI. "This report provides a data-driven roadmap for our partners to strengthen Singapore's children's mental health ecosystem and ensure every child can flourish." Raman Sidhu, CEO of Octava Foundation, noted: "This landscape map shows strong intent in Singapore to secure the mental wellbeing of our children and young people - even as sustained funding and delivery capacity are still developing. We need sustained investment in prevention and promotion efforts, alongside capacity-building for locally designed, evidence-informed solutions. At Octava Foundation, we are committed to supporting preventive and promotive approaches that strengthen mental wellbeing through the formative years."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Medical educators and health professionals warn that new federal student loan caps in President Donald Trump's tax cut law could make it more expensive for many people to become doctors and could exacerbate physician shortages nationwide. And, they warn, the economic burden will steer many medical students to lucrative specialties in more affluent, urban areas rather than lower-paying primary care jobs in underserved and rural communities, where doctors are in shortest supply. "The growing financial barriers may deter some individuals from pursuing a career in medicine, particularly those from low-income backgrounds," said Deena McRae, a psychiatrist and associate vice president for academic health sciences at University of California Health. For students who graduated this year with an MD degree from a four-year medical school in the United States, the median cost of attendance was $318,825, according to Kristen Earle, director of student financial services at the Association of American Medical Colleges. Health care experts and politicians on both sides of the aisle agree that medical schools must find ways to lower their costs, but critics of the loan caps say limiting federal lending isn't the answer. "Uncapped loan limits gave no incentives for schools to reduce any of their costs, recognizing that taxpayers, students, or students' families would eventually foot the bill," said Sara Robertson, a spokesperson for the GOP-controlled House Committee on Education and Workforce. "Our reforms and loan limits will put downward pressure on costs to provide better outcomes and lower debt for all students." The budget law brings back caps for graduate and professional education that Congress eliminated in 2006. Since then, students have been able to get federal loans that cover the total cost of their degree programs. Whether the new federal loan policy will push down tuition costs remains to be seen. Robertson pointed to a 2023 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research showing that the more generous federal lending policy since 2006 has led to "significantly higher program prices" in graduate education. However, data provided by the Association of American Medical Colleges shows that cost-of-living increases, not tuition, drove up the expense of studying medicine in recent years. Students already in medical school who have taken out federal loans before the new rules take effect on July 1 will be exempted from the cap. But students whose loans are capped under the new law will need to make up the difference, in many cases by taking out private sector loans, which typically have less flexible repayment terms and require a strong credit rating — a heavy lift for students from low-income communities. For instance, federal loans can include monthly repayments calibrated to income, and they offer two debt forgiveness paths, including the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which erases the balance for those who work in a government or nonprofit organization and make their monthly payments for 10 years. Critics and proponents agree on at least one thing: Now is the time for medical schools to think creatively about lowering costs for students. This might include reduced tuition, more chances for debt forgiveness, and accelerated programs that allow students to graduate in three years rather than four, reducing costs by 25% and getting them more quickly into paid jobs. "I hope that coming out of this, medical schools and others find a way to seize the moment and help us figure out how to reduce the total cost of medical school," said Martha Santana-Chin, CEO of L.A. Care. A data analysis of eight medical schools led by the NYU Grossman School of Medicine, whose core MD curriculum is three years, shows that students in three-year programs derive a lifetime financial gain totaling over $240,000 due to the cost savings of less time in medical school, interest not paid on the corresponding amount not borrowed, and faster progression to a salaried position. And with the new loan caps about to make it more difficult for many students to finance their medical education, these programs suddenly have a new timeliness. UNC offers a three-year track for students who want to be primary care doctors and work in rural areas of the state, where doctor shortages are a major problem. Zoe Priddy, who is in her second year of UNC's three-year program, said that if the federal loan limits had been in place at the time she was making plans to attend medical school, she would have needed a job that paid better than the research lab where she worked after completing her undergraduate degree.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April, Thomas Sanford, a medical student who regularly listens to "An Arm and a Leg," set out to create a resource he could easily share with patients to help them deal with unaffordable medical bills. In this mini-episode, host Dan Weissmann talks with Sanford about how handing out charity care information on tiny cards snowballed into an ever-growing list of resources to erase medical debt. They discuss the inspiration behind his project, the role "An Arm and a Leg" listeners played in building it, and how others can contribute. Previously, Dan was a staff reporter for Marketplace and Chicago's WBEZ. His work also appears on All Things Considered, Marketplace, the BBC, 99 Percent Invisible, and Reveal, from the Center for Investigative Reporting. Note: "An Arm and a Leg" uses speech-recognition software to generate transcripts, which may contain errors. So here's a story — a project — that's given me more encouragement than anything I can think of lately. One of my big dreams for An Arm and a Leg, from almost the beginning, has been to connect people, to help folks learn to help each other. It started with one listener, trying to do what he could for people right around him. He asked us for advice, we asked folks who get our First Aid Kit newsletter to pitch in. It seems like the start of a virtuous cycle. Thomas Sanford goes to medical school in Brooklyn. He says he's listened to this show for years, but some of the things we talk about here got more vivid for him last fall, as he started his third year. Thomas Sanford: …where I go out of the classroom and I start spending my days in the hospital interacting with patients and and appreciating that for especially folks in my area — which is one of the poorest parts of Brooklyn- that can be a financial death sentence. And I listened to your episode about Dollar For, the nonprofit that helps people apply for charity care. Dan: We've talked about Dollar For a lot over the last few years. Their founder, Jared Walker, has helped a lot of people, including me, understand how powerful hospital charity care can be. Eliminating more than 100 million dollars in hospital bills, over just a few years. These programs reduce or eliminate hospital bills for people within certain income requirements. Dan: Now, working in a hospital himself, Thomas Sanford decided to help spread the word. And then, there's a web address in big type, and a QR code to scan — and on the back of the card, the whole thing in Spanish. Thomas says he also left boxes of cards in the break room, so residents could grab as many as they wanted. Thomas Sanford: A lot of little hospitals or community clinics that have like little like business card holders, on the counter in the waiting room, and I just bring a stack and just dump them in. Dan: And all of this is already extremely cool. Because over the course of months,as he'd been passing out these cards, Thomas had found: Charity care didn't necessarily cover everybody's needs — like paying for prescription drugs. Thomas Sanford: And just very frankly, I was busy doing the whole medicine thing, trying to take care of people, and I wish I had the time to sit with them and, you know, search for what would help them specifically, and I just didn't. So I was looking for, really hoping for, very selfishly, a resource where I could just say, here's your one-stop shop. It'll almost certainly cover what you need. In our First Aid Kit newsletter, we told Thomas's story, we added a link to that PDF from Dollar For — because that seemed worth passing around — and we did two more things: First, we made our own first draft — basically, an annotated list of the resources we would put on a one-page handout. Including: Has anybody actually already made a version of this? As it turned out, a couple of you had worked on some great online projects. We wrote about them in First Aid Kit, with links. Other folks had tipped us off to resources that hadn't been on our original lists — we added those.. Meaning: He started printing up a rough draft to hand out. Thomas Sanford: I keep a little stack of them in my backpack, as it's become somewhat complete and vaguely presentable, and at times I've just be like, hold on, leave, come back and be like, here you go. He told me about this especially dramatic example. Thomas Sanford: I was in the emergency department and someone come in having a heart attack — very serious. And it's a difficult time to be having that conversation, but being able to say, look, here's a crummy first draft of something I've been working on. I hope this gives you a little relief, but please, right now, let me focus on what's a little more important, which is keeping you alive Can I get more help making it better? We went back to you — published Thomas's draft in First Aid Kit, asked if anybody could pitch in, created a sign-up form. Thomas Sanford: Just little type things about, you know, me not having to use a period correctly. Big things like maybe you name this document a little more correctly. Call it help with your medical expenses. Thomas Sanford: If you know how to copy edit, and you can take my terrible descriptions and make them great. If you know graphic design and can make my, very basic, PDF into something that's a little more presentable, that would be amazing. instead of a link for dollar four, put in a link to your hospital's charity care policy. Dan: This is actually one of the coolest things. Thomas is using what's called a "Creative Commons" license. Thomas Sanford: You can make your own version of it. The only thing you have to do is share it under the same license and share it freely Dan: And give credit to the original creator, so people know where it started. But Thomas wants people to make it their own. Thomas Sanford: I think that that's really the ideal: when people start taking it, just make their own version, put it out there and it sort of just evolves on its own, becomes the best thing it can be. ?And at Thomas's suggestion: We're posting a PDF of the current version. Print it out, make copies, tell us how you're using them. We're also posting a google doc that ANYONE can comment on. And we're posting that sign-up form again, so you can volunteer to pitch in. And especially: if anyone has a talent for organizing groups of volunteers on a project like this, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH. And the place where we're really gonna keep digging in on this project is where it started — in our First Aid Kit newsletter. I'd love for you to sign up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metagenomics is the study of all organisms present in a particular environment, such as soil, water, or the human body. Real-time metagenomics - the immediate analysis of data while sequencing is in progress - holds the potential to speed up the detection, monitoring, and response to microbial threats in a multitude of settings, including agricultural, environmental, and biosecurity. MARTi, published today in Genome Research, is an open-source software tool that powers real-time analysis and visualization of metagenomic data. Dr Ned Peel, first-author and postdoctoral research scientist at the Earlham Institute said: "It's operationally very lightweight, you can use it in-field for taxonomic classification on a standard laptop, or undertake larger, complex analysis using high-performance computing." Dr. Ned Peel, Study First-Author and Postdoctoral Research Scientist, Earlham Institute In clinical environments this could allow clinicians to rapidly speed up the identification and targeted treatments of pathogen infection. "MARTi is now our first line analysis tool for any metagenomic project and we're using MARTi in several current collaborations. Through testing both simulated and real data we have demonstrated the robustness of results." AirSeq - a technology developed by the Earlham Institute and the Natural History Museum, London, takes in samples of air and extracts and purifies the tiny amounts of DNA present. This is then sequenced and analyzed using the MARTi software. "One end-goal in agricultural settings would be to have a box in a farmer's field that could continually sample the air, analyzing the data onboard with MARTi and then providing the farmer with an alert in real time." MARTi has two components: the MARTi Engine, which analyses the sequencing data and can be installed on either a local machine, such as a desktop or laptop, or a high-performance compute (HPC) system; and the MARTi GUI (graphical user interface), a web-based tool allowing users to view and compare results, as well as generate graphs and figures for scientific publications and presentations. MARTi is highly customizable and users can tune parameters and databases to the needs of their particular research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international study led by experts at the University of Sydney and the Universidad Europea in Spain has found that longer periods of continuous walking are more beneficial to cardiovascular health than walking the same number of steps in shorter, more sporadic bouts. The results showed that among those who took fewer than 8000 steps per day, those who accumulate most of their steps across one or two walks lasting at least 10-15 minutes or longer have a lower risk of mortality and cardiovascular events (such as a heart attack or stroke) compared to those who take their steps in very short bouts of less than five minutes. Co-lead author Dr Matthew Ahmadi, Deputy Director of the Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub and member of the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney said: "For the most inactive people, switching from brief walks here and there to longer continuous walks may come with some health benefits. Simply adding one or two longer walks per day, each lasting at least 10-15 minutes at a comfortable but steady pace, may have significant benefits – especially for people who don't walk much." Dr. Matthew Ahmadi, Deputy Director, Mackenzie Wearables Research Hub The study analyzed 33,560 adults aged between 40-79 years who walked less than 8000 steps a day and had no cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. Participants wore a research wristband for a week which measured not only how many steps they took but also how their step count was accumulated. People who walked continuously for 10-15 minutes per day had a 4 percent chance of having a cardiovascular related event such as heart attack or stroke. The health benefits of continuous bouts of walking were most pronounced among the least active, for example those who walked 5000 steps a day or less. Among this group, the risk of developing cardiovascular disease halved from 15 percent for those who walked up to 5 minutes a day, to 7 percent for those who walked up to 15 minutes a day. Among the most sedentary group (5000 steps a day or less) the risk of death dropped from 5 percent for those who walked in 5 minutes stretches during the day, to less than 1 percent for those who walked up to 15 minutes a day. "This study shows that even people who are very physically inactive can maximize their heart health benefit by tweaking their walking patterns to walk for longer at a time, ideally for at least 10-15 minutes, when possible." Co-lead author Dr Borja del Pozo from the Universidad Europea said: "Our research shows that simple changes can make all the difference to your health. Such small changes can have a big impact."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women living in parts of the United States with lower air quality, especially neighborhoods with heavy emissions from motor vehicles, are more likely to develop breast cancer, according to a multiyear analysis involving more than 400,000 women and 28,000 breast cancer cases. The project combined data from five large breast cancer studies conducted over multiple decades that tracked individuals even as they changed addresses and followed them for as long as 10 years prior to their diagnosis. The researchers overlaid outdoor air quality information from more than 2,600 monitors to look for an association between air pollution and breast cancer. The scientists found that a 10-parts-per-billion increase in nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the air equated to a 3% increase in overall breast cancer incidence; nitrogen dioxide is a proxy for pollution from car traffic, Irvin said, and based on the estimated 316,950 cases of female breast cancer expected to be diagnosed in the United States this year, a 3% reduction would mean 9,500 fewer cases. Irvin and collaborators also found that a 5-microgram-per-cubic-meter rise in the concentration of fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, was associated with a higher incidence of hormone receptor-negative breast cancer. Cancer cells lacking receptors for the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone are generally harder to treat and more deadly. "It's often not realistic for people to leave their homes and relocate in areas with better air quality in search of less health risk, so we need more effective clean air laws to help those who are most in need," said Irvin, noting that the average nitrogen dioxide concentrations observed in the research were below current Environmental Protection Agency guidelines. We also need policies that help to reduce car traffic and promote alternative forms of transportation." Veronica Irvin, College of Health, Oregon State University About one woman in eight in the U.S. will develop breast cancer during her lifetime, and the nation's population includes more than 4 million breast cancer survivors. Irvin is the Celia Strickland Austin and G. Kenneth Austin III Endowed Professor in Public Health in the OSU College of Health, which will host a free online panel discussion, "Our Health & Breast Cancer," at noon Pacific time on Thursday, Oct. 30. Irvin will be one of the panelists for the discussion, which will look at screening and survivorship, early detection, research, and support and mentorship for those affected by breast cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A global research team has pinpointed the enzyme fueling hydrogen production in healthy guts and shown how its depletion rewires microbial energy networks in Crohn's disease, reshaping our understanding of gut metabolism. Study: A widespread hydrogenase supports fermentative growth of gut bacteria in healthy people. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Microbiology, an international team of researchers leveraged a multifaceted study combining genomic, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses to identify the primary driver of fermentative molecular hydrogen (H₂) production in healthy individuals. Molecular H₂ cycling is a vital metabolic process in the human gut, but the specific microbes and enzymes responsible for it remain unresolved. Decades of research have established that the human gut microbiome is a bustling metabolic reactor, comprising trillions of microbes that ferment consumed carbohydrates. This process results in the production of energy, beneficial short-chain fatty acids, and vast quantities of gases, including molecular hydrogen (H₂). Conventionally considered a simple waste product, more recent research has revealed that molecular H₂ is a crucial food source for other microbes (known as “hydrogenotrophs”), thereby making fermentation thermodynamically more favourable. Dysbiosis or imbalances in H₂ production and consumption are increasingly associated with serious health issues, from the gas buildup in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to infections and even gastrointestinal cancers. The study comprised several sequential steps: First, a large-scale computational analysis of 300 stool metagenomes and 78 metatranscriptomes was carried out to elucidate the full spectrum of hydrogen-related genes present and active in the healthy human gut. These findings were validated using 102 mucosal biopsy-enriched metagenomes from 42 donors. Furthermore, analyses focused on samples from the terminal ileum, caecum, and rectum to confirm consistency across gut regions. Next, to demonstrate that these genes were functional, the study selected 19 diverse bacterial species from the human gut and grew them under anaerobic (oxygen-free) conditions to simulate gut conditions. Gas chromatography assays were used to precisely measure the amount of H₂ gas produced by each bacterial isolate over time. Finally, biochemical assays (on bacterial cell extracts) were carried out to elucidate the link between H₂ production and pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) reaction, a core part of fermentation. Abundance estimates found that group B genes were on average 0.75 ± 0.25 copies per genome, about 7.5 times more abundant than the group A1 enzyme (0.10 ± 0.09 copies), which was previously thought to be the leading H₂ producer. Activity assays supported these findings, showing that group B genes were also the most highly transcribed (active) in the metatranscriptome. Unexpectedly, however, activity assays revealed Bacteroides, one of the most common genera in the gut, as a primary user of group B enzymes and thus a major H₂ producer, a previously under-recognized association. Analyses of the 19 bacterial isolates confirmed these findings, demonstrating that species encoding the group B gene, including seven different Bacteroides isolates, produced high levels of H₂ gas. In contrast, Bacteroides stercoris, a species that naturally lacks any hydrogenase genes, was observed to produce no H₂, consistent with the absence of detectable hydrogenase genes. Most significantly, comparing healthy individuals to 46 patients with CD revealed that the “healthy” group B hydrogenase was significantly depleted (P = 0.0023) and notably replaced by other enzymes: the group A1 hydrogenase increased 2.8-fold (P = 6.6 × 10⁻⁷), the group 4a formate hydrogenlyase (often found in E. coli) increased 5.2-fold (P = 6.8 × 10⁻⁶), and the group 1d [NiFe]-hydrogenase increased 2.6-fold (P = 3.8 × 10⁻⁵). Genes for respiratory H₂ oxidation, particularly group 1d [NiFe]-hydrogenases, also increased, supporting a restructured hydrogen economy in the inflamed gut of CD patients. Respiratory hydrogenotrophs likely dominate gut H₂ consumption, based on gene abundance and transcription data, though activity-level validation is still needed. This discovery opens new avenues for understanding, diagnosing, and potentially treating complex inflammatory gut disorders by leveraging interventions targeting the gut microbiome. It also suggests that respiratory hydrogenotrophs are major consumers of H₂, underscoring the complexity of microbial energy flow in the gut ecosystem.
