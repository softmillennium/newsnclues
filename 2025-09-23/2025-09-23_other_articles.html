                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural is known for inventive, well-written, and brilliant episodes, and this list proves that even episodes that were technically 'filler' were some of the show's best. Particularly in the first five seasons of Supernatural, there was a very clear story arc involving Sam Winchester, Dean Winchester, Lucifer, and Michael. Throughout the show's many seasons, there were always episodes that fell outside that core storyline, be they monster-of-the-week episodes or simply hilarious one-offs. However, season 5, episode 9, "The Real Ghostbusters," was not necessarily one of them. In this episode, Sam and Dean encounter Chuck, the author who has been writing their life story, once again, this time at a Supernatural-themed convention (the Supernatural books, that is). Humorously, this episode sees Sam and Dean needing to team up with another 'Sam and Dean,' who are really cosplayers, to stop some terrifying ghost children from killing convention-goers. This episode is absolutely one of the best fillers, especially because it was a risk that totally paid off. When this episode debuted in 2009, Supernatural was very new to the convention circuit, and this was the show's first time really poking fun at fans. Thankfully, it came across as affectionate, not mean-spirited, and remains a fan-favorite episode. In this (much more pleasant) reality, he and his family members never became hunters. Instead, Dean's mother is alive and well, as is Sam's girlfriend, Jessica, who reveals that she and Sam are engaged. Even Dean is married, to a woman named Carmen who doesn't seem to have a real-life equivalent. Although it would be easy for this episode to come off as funny or a bit goofy, it actually packs an emotional punch. In fact, Dean's realization that he's willing to sacrifice this life he's craved for so long in order to return to the real world and continue the 'family business' of hunting is a profound moment for his character. Although this episode isn't technically essential to the larger story arc of the show, it is nevertheless one of Supernatural's best. Another season 5 filler episode, "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester" takes its name from a short story (and eventually movie) of a similar title, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Just as that story is about a character who ages unconventionally, in "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester," Dean rapidly ages after playing a poker game with a witch. Somehow, Everett perfectly captures Dean's mannerisms, intonations, and attitude, so much so that it's easy to forget he isn't actually an older Jensen Ackles. This episode is also a poignant one, as it deals with Bobby's frustrations around aging and his wheelchair. Likewise, one of the characters in the episode is confronting her own feelings about age and immortality, all of which make this episode an affecting one, yet it still manages to have the Supernatural sense of humor and charm. There are several episodes of Supernatural that deviate significantly from the show's typical style, one of which is season 4, episode 5, "Monster Movie." The entire episode is done in black-and-white, and, as the title of the episode suggests, it plays with a number of monster movie tropes, especially those pertaining to vampires. Given that this was season 4 of 15, this is a relatively early example of Supernatural being willing to play with genre and take certain episodes in an entirely different direction, which was quite a risk at the time, particularly considering this was still network television. Nevertheless, this episode proves that Supernatural had the ability to create solid episodes in myriad genres and styles, including when those episodes weren't necessarily essential to the larger plot. In fact, "Monster Movie" is perhaps the most separate from that larger narrative on this list, yet it is also hailed as one of Supernatural's best episodes. Like "Monster Movie," this episode was a filler as well as a significant departure from the typical style and structure of Supernatural episodes. The team comprises paranormal investigators who are certainly not cut out for the actually dangerous monster hunting that Sam and Dean do. Similar to several episodes on this list, "Ghostfacers" has an unconventional approach in that it is filmed in a handheld camera/found footage style, no doubt poking a bit of fun at paranormal shows and movies that are similarly filmed. Although filler episodes tend to be spaced out in Supernatural seasons, "Yellow Fever" actually follows directly on the heels of "Monster Movie." In this episode, Dean gets infected with "ghost sickness," a disease that causes him to experience intense fear—so much so that he could literally be scared to death. The stakes are therefore high, but this ends up being one of Supernatural's funniest episodes, especially because Dean becomes afraid of things like tiny dogs chasing him. Many of the inclusions on this list take place in season 5 or earlier, which are generally considered Supernatural's best seasons, but season 11, episode 4, "Baby," is an exception. This episode is artistically beautiful, and it centers on one of the most iconic aspects of the show: Dean's Impala, 'Baby.' Despite being a filler and coming much later in the show, this episode is therefore very meaningful, as it highlights both a major part of the show and proves just how stunning the artistry of Supernatural could be. Season 3, episode 11, "Mystery Spot," is among the most well-known, beloved episodes of Supernatural for a reason. In the episode, Sam is subjected to watching Dean die over and over again, and each time he does, Sam wakes up, stuck in the same day on loop. "Mystery Spot" certainly is hilarious, and moments from the show, such as Sam's alarm playing "Heat of the Moment" every morning only to be followed immediately by Dean saying, "Rise and shine, Sammy," have become favorite moments within the fanbase. However, "Mystery Spot" is also full of emotional moments, and both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki deliver stellar performances, particularly in light of the fact that this couldn't have been easy to film. In this episode, Dean and Sam enter a new alternate reality, this one turning them into actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. As dizzying as that sentence is, having to act in this episode was undoubtedly much more so, yet it's pulled off brilliantly. At no point does the episode feel overdone or goofy. line that Scooby typically yells in the real show. Because of these little details and the overall genius of "Scoobynatural," this really is Supernatural's best filler episode.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, I asked, “In what sense is origin of life a scientific question?” I'd been reading an informative paper by Prof. Robert Endres of Imperial College London. He also asks whether intelligent extraterrestrials might have seeded Earth with life: While the idea of Earth being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor from within mainstream science, directed panspermia — originally proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel — remains a speculative but logically open alternative. Yes, genome mapper Francis Crick (1916–2004) and origin of life theorist Leslie Orgel (1927–2007) did propose that in 1973: “In their scenario, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, facing extinction or perhaps scientific curiosity, dispatches microbial “starter kits” to habitable planets like ours.” Mathematician and astronomer Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) considered it plausible that life originated elsewhere in space (whether or not it was delivered here by ET): At first this theory, known as “panspermia”, was regarded as heretical, but new evidence from many directions appears be moving towards a vindication of this point of view… This work has raised fierce hostility in some circles. It might be more accurate to say that, of twenty terrestrial origin of life theories, none is more persuasive on the evidence. A sense, perhaps, that the life from space theorists must be put down. But, frustratingly, they can't be put down on the evidence. In my post last week, I did not say directly whether I thought terrestrial origin of life (OOL) was a scientific question. That's because it depends on where you stand on a prior question: Can OOL be a scientific question even if the answer can never be known? It's not clear that a terrestrial OOL can ever be determined by scientific means. So the best that researchers can do is this: Now let's look at panspermia: Life from space As I noted last week, we're allowed to consider that intelligent design may have got life going provided we locate it somewhere between Star Wars and Star Trek. Some versions of panspermia assume that life originated spontaneously elsewhere in the universe and randomly traveled to Earth on friendly comets or asteroids. We can never know for sure what happened in the remote past. But future discoveries could, in principle, either strengthen or confirm the life from space claim. Researchers scan the skies constantly and something could turn up any day. Or even intelligent life that admits, regretfully, that it is the culprit in creating life on Earth, thus kicking off the current chaos… One thing emerges clearly from the life from space approach: Intelligent design is a viable hypothesis for the origin of life. Mind Matters is published by the Walter Bradley Center for Natural and Artificial Intelligence.</p>

Humans have a sixth sense for common knowledge, and we create it with signals like laughter, tears, blushing, eye contact, and blunt speech. But people also go to great lengths to avoid common knowledge—to ensure that even if everyone knows something, they can't know that everyone else knows they know it. Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, and one of Time's “100 Most Influential People in the World Today.” He has won many prizes for his teaching, his research on language, cognition, and social relations, and his twelve books.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - "A Cordial Invitation," "Little Visitor," and "Frolicker" - into one creepy package. Check it out in the slideshow gallery below: Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding. Little Visitor & Other Abductions is available in bookstores and comic shops now. In other comic book news, DC has finally answered the burning question of whether Batman wears socks, and we've got the full scoop on what it means that Norman Osborn has become the new Spider-Man. Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article has been reviewed according to Science X's editorial process and policies. Is life possible—or has it ever been possible—on other planets? UT researcher Jurriaan Huskens and his team are going to make the optical sensor selective for the required biomarkers. Over the coming years, he will work with around thirty colleagues from various Dutch companies and knowledge institutes on the (Origin of) Life Marker Chip (LMCOOL). The invention is best described as a tiny yet complete laboratory in the form of a computer chip. It is "pre-programmed" to identify specific molecules in liquids; molecules that could point to life, such as amino acids. "You can best compare our chip to a keyhole, with the molecule we are searching for as the key," explains Ligterink, "Because only one key fits in the keyhole, we can be almost 100% certain that we have captured the molecule we are looking for when we detect something with our chip. UT researcher Huskens adds, "An important step forward is that we are going to selectively recognize a mirror image of an amino acid. After all, living organisms make only one of the mirror images, and so this recognition is essential to determine whether the amino acid comes from a life process or not." The idea for the Life Marker Chip (LMC) was first proposed more than twenty years ago for ESA's ExoMars mission. With financial support from the NSO Instruments Program, the instrument is now being further developed so that it can be used on a range of future planetary missions. Current life-detection instruments on Mars are the size of a microwave oven and weigh between ten and twenty kilos. By contrast, LMCOOL will be about the size of a soft drink can and weighs only 700 grams. In space exploration, where every kilogram of launch mass matters, the Dutch chip offers a lightweight yet high-performance alternative. At the heart of LMCOOL lies integrated photonic chip technology. The Netherlands already has extensive experience with this technology in medical applications, but it has never before flown in space. In Delft, researchers are investigating under what circumstances—such as extreme temperatures, radiation and vacuum—the chip can function reliably, and what measures are needed to keep the system operational during a mission to Enceladus. Here, the expertise of Space Systems Engineer Vidhya Pallichadath MSc, who has worked on several space missions, is of great value: "Through prototyping, test campaigns and refining the design, we are increasing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the instrument." "Thanks to the Instruments Program, we can continue developing LMCOOL, enabling us to qualify as a supplier for both small and large European space missions, for example, a future mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus." Around thirty engineers and scientists from TU Delft, Lionix, TNO, and the universities of Twente, Utrecht, Cranfield (UK), Leicester (UK), Colorado Boulder (U.S.) and the Open University (UK) are contributing to LMCOOL over the coming years. They are turning promising ideas into concrete blueprints for building a fully functioning prototype. Meanwhile, the chip is being tested extensively to develop the most stable receptors (keyholes) and to validate them under a wide variety of extreme conditions. Discover the latest in science, tech, and space with over 100,000 subscribers who rely on Phys.org for daily insights. If LMCOOL does make its way to Saturn, it will not be for at least another 25 years. Analyzing the scientific results will then take a further decade. "By that time, my colleagues and I will be approaching retirement age," says Ligterink, "But that does not stop us from devoting ourselves fully to this instrument. The LMCOOL is a compact, integrated photonic chip designed to detect specific biomarkers, such as amino acids, in extraterrestrial environments. Its selectivity for molecular mirror images enables discrimination between biological and non-biological origins. The chip's small size and low weight make it suitable for future planetary missions, including potential deployment on Saturn's moon Enceladus.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>French titans Phoenix have long been tight with the dance music world, and their new project depends on that connection. The band's most recent album was Alpha Zulu, which came out in 2022. Since then, they've collaborated with people like Beck, Pusha T, and Kavinsky, and they gave a triumphant performance at the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics. Now, Phoenix have joined forces with Alan Braxe and DJ Falcon, the veteran French dance producers known collectively as Braxe + Falcon, to launch a new project called UFOs. Braxe + Falcon, two cousins who have deep roots in the world of French Touch dance music, officially joined forces to release the Step By Step EP in 2022. They also remixed Phoenix's Alpha Zulu single “Winter Solstice.” For all we know, UFOs might exist only to release one single: the new song “UFO,” which they describe as “six friends, one song, infinite memories.” If that is the case — if the group is fated to only release one song ever, like Stardust with “Music Sounds Better With You” — then they've made sure that one song is a good one. On “UFO,” Thomas Mars sings about love and flying saucers — “I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in UFOs” — over a percolating haze of keyboards. “UFO” is out now on Domino/Smugglers Way, with a limited edition 12″ version only available at some independent record stores.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Sheppard was the devious demon Crowley (who was born a Scottish lad named Fergus MacLeod) who eventually ascended to the crown of Hell, while sometime allying with Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). Though the British actor left the show under less-than-happy circumstances, Crowley went out in the 12th season's finale with a final satisfying grand gesture: sacrificing himself to seal Lucifer in Hell. Nevertheless, the veteran actor happily appears at numerous SPN conventions in the States and abroad with his longtime colleagues. TV Insider spent time with the generously talkative Sheppard at Creation Entertainment's New Jersey event in May. Why did you get involved in the Supernatural convention world? Mark Sheppard: What's fascinating is that sci-f and genre shows tend to get canceled or they atrophy on their own. What is interesting about Supernatural is it has grown bigger through what we lovingly call the Supernatural Family that shows up at conventions. I learned one year at San Diego Comic-Con that these fans raised $2.5 million dollars for a children's charity! These themes in a time like this are rather special. I've been on shows that have a lot of meaning, like Battlestar Galactica and Firefly and Trek series, that had meaning. Jack Rowand / © The CW / Courtesy Everett Collection I make fun of Misha [Collins] on a regular basis because it's easy to do. That side of him is unbelievably worthy. So, we put forward those causes which we invest our time and our effort into, and the Supernatural Family makes it a million times bigger. My son is a type 1 diabetic, who went to Camp Conrad Chinnock that was for diabetic kids, and a person who used to come to Creation's Supernatural events had discretionary budget for charitable donations from a trust that she had. She literally bought the entire camp's wish list for the year my son attended, and not just bought it, but shipped it! How did you first come to fan conventions? I showed up at a few conventions starting with The X Files‘s first season. I saw the power of how it brought people together. My dad [the late actor William Morgan Sheppard] was in several Star Treks and there was a massive amount of attention for those cons, so I saw the positivity there. I saw people that maybe didn't have a lot of friends or were a stranger in a new city or people with serious disabilities that precluded them from some social agenda. But then conventions became places where everyone was totally accepted. Beyond conventions, the Supernatural set always had a reputation for kindness. I think what's really fascinating, not many people talk about this, is that Jensen and Jared made a decision very, very early on, when [the late] Kim Manners was running the show, what their behavior was going to be when they worked. They knew that this series was a phenomenon and could be something that had longevity and meant something. And they made a decision to behave. I mean, that's who they are, but they made a decision to outwardly behave in a manner that was so appealing for people to come and work. Actors were treated in a manner that was absolutely superb. We truly operated as a very large, wonderfully dysfunctional family. But that tone they created also affects the way we behave here. We take care of each other in order that we can take care of our audience. We have the concert on Saturday night, which is something I thought was vital to do because we've got so many great musicians — not amateur musicians, professionals. It's always been a high spot in that way. There's money involved, and that's why we want to give them a wonderful experience. There's a statement we use if someone is new to the fan community: “You are going to make friends.” And they do, often traveling all over the world together to visit the cons. What's at the heart of this special status Supernatural has? Supernatural never deviated from themes that tend to unite people in an altruistic form of life. It's not brain surgery, but it is good for the heart and good for the head. “No, you did that, but we were happy to help.” I can't go anywhere in the world without somebody going, “Crowley!” Even when I was entering the hospital [when he was suffering heart attacks]. The entire TSA is a demographic that seems to watch Supernatural. I'm going through international customs like the King of Hell. He absolutely killed less people than the Winchesters! [Laughs] I will have to check that. [Note: We may have seen Sam and Dean kill more, but Crowley was, after all, a murderous demon for 300 years.] Crowley ran Hell, and he hated it! Well, considering his mother, the Scottish witch Rowena turned Queen of Hell (Ruth Connell), he didn't have much of a chance. Fergus MacLeod was a 4'6” Scottish crofter [who sold his soul] who had no bearing on this meat suit. Ruth, however, was fantastic in the role. I'm so happy to be part of it; my life would not be the same without Supernatural. I refused to be a series regular for about four years. I was busy doing other wonderful things, and it would limit me to be in there. I went back for one episode and ended up staying there eight years. There were about 20-30 writers who loved the character but basically would say, “Let's throw this to Mark” — like spaghetti against the wall — “and see what the hell he does with it.” So I'd be, “How do I get to navigate this?” It really was a fantastic endeavor for about six or seven of those eight years. Was there a favorite episode where everything worked? I'd say “Sacrifice,” the episode ending Season 8, is my favorite. It's when I was having the human blood injected into me and we were in a church. That was a great episode; so much happened, including to Crowley, then the King of Hell. We then moved inside to the stage, and we shot all of that in sequence, which is quite rare to do. The working crew who were allowed to talk between set-ups didn't make a sound for two days. I sat chained to that chair for two days. I wouldn't even get up most of the time. And Jared will say the same thing. We all put a lot of love into it. And it seems into the entire show. And that's what's most important to me.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet behind the glamour of red carpets and the gravity of political speeches lies a truth not many talk about: when leaders and stars face crossroads, they often turn to spiritual guidance.

This is the story of how famous akashic reader Psychic Medium Daksh became the name whispered in India's elite circles. But behind the curtains, their lives are filled with uncertainty, pressure, and unseen challenges. A wrong move in politics can end decades of work. In a world overflowing with astrologers, tarot readers, and so-called fortune tellers, why do India's top stars and leaders specifically turn to Psychic Medium Daksh? The answer lies in three things: trust, discretion, and accuracy. As one Bollywood insider shared (without revealing identity): Within minutes, Daksh described events from my life no one knew about.

The answer lies in his unique methodology and spiritual ethics. Daksh's clients don't need to share their names, birth details, or problems in advance. He begins readings without context—and yet delivers information so precise that even skeptics are left speechless. His connection to the Akashic Records allows him to see beyond timelines, beyond illusions, and into the soul's true path. Many of his high-profile clients not only ask for readings but also request healing rituals, ancestral healing, or karmic release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Utah musician accused by a Michigan State University professor of being an insider in the QAnon conspiracy theory and political movement has sued the professor and other MSU faculty and officials, alleging the professor has continually defamed him with her allegations. Thomas Schoenberger also claims he received death threats and online harassment after MSU Communicative Sciencesprofessor Laura Dilley made comments on social media suggesting he may be to blame for the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University. Schoenberger's lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court, filed Aug. 7, alleges Dilley has been harassing him on social media, repeatedly defaming him online and in research papers, saying he is behind QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory that originated in 2017. Schoenberger does not ask for any particular damages in the lawsuit. This lawsuit stems from a paper Dilley wrote titled “QAnon Propaganda on Twitter as Information Warfare: Influencers, Networks and Narratives." Schoenberger's lawsuit alleges Dilley's paper contained “false and outlandish allegations of and concerning Thomas Schoenberger, such as that he was the mastermind behind QAnon, that the Cicada 3301 alternate reality game (puzzle) is a direct link with QAnon, and that Thomas belongs to the IAM Cult.” The theory that Schoenberger is involved with QAnon stems from his organization, Cicada 3301, and the complicated puzzles it has published, according to Barry Powers, Schoenberger's attorney. People began theorizing that it was a way to identify and recruit highly intelligent people into the CIA, Powers said. Schoenberger created the Cicada 3301 puzzles, but denies any link to QAnon, Powers said. Powers called Dilley's paper "yellow journalism" and "sensationalism." "If you boil down 100 pages into two words, it's 'yellow journalism.' "On a basic level, my client is being attacked to this very day by officers and professors at the university, and that's not tolerable." Dilley called Schoenberger's lawsuit "very weak" and said her defense is strong. "The purpose of the paper was to give an entry point to further study on networks that might be involved in spreading QAnon, and Thomas Schoenberger's account was selected as one to query for further study," Dilley said. Schoenberger, of Utah, is a 64-year-old composer and musician. He created Cicada 3301 to bring together creative individuals and inspire people interested in history, music and culture, according to the lawsuit. It is not a political group, the suit says. Both Dilley and Schoenberger have accused the other of harassing them, but only Schoenberger has taken legal action on it. Dilley's paper, published in 2021, described what she called evidence of large-scale coordination among accounts promoting "QAnon propaganda," which may have led to Russia and corporate entities' use of social media to undermine the U.S.'s democratic process. Her paper looks at five studies of QAnon's spread through social media. The first mention of Schoenberger in the paper is in a paragraph about connections between QAnon and "so-called 'alternative reality games'" and live action role play. She said people who promoted Cicada 3301 were involved in the early promotion of QAnon narratives. Dilley wrote that Schoenberger was a person "identified to be central to the history of QAnon" and that he is a "QAnon insider." Dilley said she chose the topic because she wanted to do something within her skill set that was relevant to what was going on in the world in 2020. She came across Schoenberger's name from several YouTubers and media reports that mentioned him in connection to QAnon, alleging he was involved in spreading the conspiracy theories, she said. "I think this case is significant for academic freedom, and I hope that not just my university but others will renew their commitment to standing up for faculty's freedom of speech," Dilley said. Three students — Arielle Anderson, Alexandria Verner and Brian Fraser — were killed and five others were injured in the Feb. 13, 2023, shooting. Dilley denied making that post, and it does not currently appear on her X feed. In later replies to her initial post, she said if there is any connection between her research and the shooting, it should be investigated. "I literally had folks from across the country and around the world contact me to ask if these things were connected," she wrote on X. There is ample evidence that goes well beyond me. This was initiated by and/or with Thomas Schoenberger, who is the Dilleys_Willy account. She tweeted about Cicada 3301 and QAnon about half a dozen times in that time period, according to a News review. Dilley said Schoenberger misrepresented her tweet, and like many other areas of the lawsuit, it is misinformation. McRae opened fire at three locations at the university, killing three and wounding five others, before taking his own life when he was confronted by police. Michigan State University Police said in April 2023 they found "no conclusive motive" for McRae's actions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EERIE footage shows the moment a mysterious V-shaped UFO "bigger than the stars" hovered over a Los Angeles neighbourhood. The V-shaped UFO appeared to be black, with extremely bright lights fitted along what appeared to be the hull. The footage was submitted to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), a volunteer-operated nonprofit group that's been collecting UFO reports since 1974. They added: "While sitting on my balcony, I saw a light in the sky bigger than stars usually appear. "It moved around a little bit but didn't go too far. At the end, it just flew off in the south direction until I couldn't see it anymore." While some conspiracy theorists believe it could be an alien craft, others say the object could have been a secret aircraft, a drone, or an ultralight plane. The boomerang-shaped object also appeared to have a small body at its centre, making it look similar to an F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter. However, that plane, built by the US Air Force, is a stealth jet meant to be almost invisible to escape flight radars. There have been several reports this year which specifically mention seeing a V-shaped wedge or triangle with multiple lights along its surface flying over the US, according to NUFORC. It comes after the first-ever bombshell footage of the infamous "Mosul orb" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq was released. The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul. The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell. Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled. The footage showed a mystery "metal orb" as it hovered and flew across open airspace. Americans are curious and fascinated about aliens more than ever. US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard vowed to "share the truth" on UFOs after saying she believes in aliens and that extraterrestrials are real. The Director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's administration hinted that she has a lot of classified information on aliens, but is forced to remain tight-lipped due to her job. Speaking with Pod Force One podcast host Miranda Devine, Gabbard was asked if "there could be aliens". The US intel chief replied: "I have my own views and opinions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lancashire based tech business Universal Atmosphere Processing (UAP), which has developed a pioneering carbon reduction and gas recovery system, has closed a significant funding round. As part of the raise — which involved institutional, public, and private investors — UAP utilised the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), a government-backed initiative offering tax relief to early-stage startup investors. By leveraging SEIS, UAP successfully secured a six-figure sum in funding from angel syndicates, including Lancashire County Council's Fhunded Angels network. With the new investment, UAP will accelerate production of its Mk1 Atmospheric Processor — a proprietary unit capable of capturing high-value noble gases and CO₂ directly from ambient air. Founded by Brendan Cornthwaite in 2022 and headquartered at LCC's Fraser House innovation hub, UAP has attracted attention from global scientific institutions. Its patented technology recently secured a research grant through CERN's Venture Connect programme, supporting the co-development of sensor components which are integral to UAP's system. The company will present at the event in November, joining an exclusive cohort of startups considered to have significant global impact potential. “But for me, this round isn't about celebration. It's about finally building the hardware that's been in my head for over two years — and proving that atmospheric separation can be done differently. And I want to thank Fraser House for being the foundation — it's where UAP started, and where I found the belief to keep going.” “It's a great story of local entrepreneurship gaining international traction — and being selected for SLUSH 100 this year underlines just how much global interest there is in what Brendan is building.” Coun Brian Moore, cabinet member for economic development and growth at Lancashire County Council, said: “Brendan embodies everything that Fraser House and the Fhunded programme were set up to support - an ambitious, resilient entrepreneur building high-value technology with global relevance. In addition to its funding success, UAP will join the UK government's upcoming trade mission to South Korea and Japan, followed by attendance at COP30 in Brazil.</p>

With the new investment, UAP will accelerate production of its Mk1 Atmospheric Processor – a proprietary unit capable of capturing high-value noble gases and CO₂ directly from ambient air. Founded by Brendan Cornthwaite in 2022 and based at LCC's Fraser House innovation hub, UAP has attracted attention from global scientific institutions. Its patented technology recently secured a research grant through CERN's Venture Connect programme, supporting the co-development of sensor components which are integral to UAP's system. It's about finally building the hardware that's been in my head for over two years – and proving that atmospheric separation can be done differently.” And I want to thank Fraser House for being the foundation – it's where UAP started, and where I found the belief to keep going.” “It's a great story of local entrepreneurship gaining international traction – and being selected for SLUSH 100 this year underlines just how much global interest there is in what Brendan is building.” Cllr Brian Moore, cabinet member for economic development and growth at Lancashire County Council, said: “Brendan embodies everything that Fraser House and the Fhunded programme were set up to support – an ambitious, resilient entrepreneur building high value technology with global relevance. In addition to its funding success, UAP will join the Government's upcoming trade mission to South Korea and Japan, followed by attendance at COP30 in Brazil.</p>
