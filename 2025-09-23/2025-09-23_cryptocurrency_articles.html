                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea, detailed in a new preprint study titled Swarm Oracle: Trustless Blockchain Agreements through Robot Swarms, builds on earlier peer-reviewed research where researchers demonstrated that mobile robots could reach reliable consensus, even in times of disruption, cyberattack, or in hostile environments. The new study applies that approach to a persistent problem in blockchain design: how to get verified real-world data into smart contracts without introducing new points of trust. Blockchains like Ethereum are built to be trustless—each node independently verifies transactions. But that same design prevents smart contracts from accessing external information, such as weather reports, price feeds, or sensor readings, without third-party input. Today's blockchain oracles, like Chainlink, aggregate data from multiple sources to reduce reliance on any one feed. But they can still reintroduce centralized risks, either through opaque aggregation methods or single points of failure. The system uses a collective of simple, low-cost mobile robots—each equipped with basic sensors and communication hardware—to gather environmental data and reach consensus through a Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol. Once a consensus is reached, the swarm can publish its findings to a blockchain, where the data becomes available to smart contracts. In a 2023 Nature study, researchers showed how swarms could maintain consensus accuracy even when up to one-third of robots were compromised, misreporting data, abstaining from voting, or physically interfering with other robots. In the new system, the robots host a permissioned blockchain locally, allowing them to store and verify data without needing continuous internet access. When appropriate, they can upload finalized agreements to public blockchains like Ethereum. This provides a mechanism for “self-healing,” with faulty or malicious robots excluded from future consensus rounds. Use cases for Swarm Oracle include verifying disaster damage for insurance claims, monitoring air or water quality, or supporting decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). By operating independently and across varied terrain, the robots can reach areas that are inaccessible or too costly to monitor. While robots can recover from temporary disconnections, long distances may strain communication. The idea of robots as blockchain participants isn't new—projects like Helium have explored decentralized hardware oracles for specific tasks such as network connectivity. The concept is a part of a growing interest in using autonomous agents to make economic decisions, such as routing deliveries or managing grid loads. Robotics developers are also embedding cryptocurrency wallets into autonomous systems to carry out transactions for their users. Whether Swarm Oracle can move from simulation to real-world deployment remains to be seen, with cost, availability of the robots, and a general mistrust of AI slowing adoption.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The underlying technology has been proven and blockchain-based infrastructure is obviously here to stay,” Jed Finn, Morgan Stanley's head of wealth management, told Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley has been among a number of traditional finance firms aiming to bolster their crypto offerings in recent years. In January, the firm's CEO and Chairman Ted Pick told CNBC  that the bank would work with regulators to see how they could offer crypto services safely. Last year, Morgan Stanley greenlit financial advisors promoting the then-fledgling spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and in 2021 offered wealthy clients access to Bitcoin investment funds. In its second quarter this year, online trading platform Robinhood generated $160 million in crypto trading revenue during the second quarter, a 98% increase from a year ago, despite headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war. Last year, brokerage and advisory Charles Schwab's then incoming CEO Rick Wurster said that the firm planned to enter the spot crypto market once U.S. regulations provided clearer pathways. Schwab currently offers exposure to crypto via ETFs and mutual funds. "This partnership represents a major step forward in bringing digital asset technology into the mainstream, and we're proud to unlock its potential for institutions and their clients around the world,” Woodford said. In a statement, Zerohash CFO Adam Berg said that financial giants are lining up to dive into crypto. “I've recently met with multiple large bank CEOs and financial services executives, many of whom said that they are spending more than 50% of their time driving on-chain innovation at their firms." Separately, Morgan Stanley was among multiple investors to participate in a $104 million Series D venture capital round for Hashdex, according to a press release. Hashdex has raised a total of $275 million over multiple rounds.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stellar blockchain advances significantly by using Hyperledger Cacti to connect with Hyperledger Besu, opening pathways to SWIFT's CBDC sandbox and DTCC's tokenized collateral platform. Stellar has traditionally been known for cross-border payments and retail money transfers, but recent developments show the network is expanding into much bigger territory. The blockchain is now positioning itself as serious infrastructure for institutional finance and enterprise-level tokenization systems. As noted by DoubleAgent-XLM, these connections transform Stellar from a niche blockchain into potential backbone infrastructure for institutional tokenization and settlement systems. This isn't just a technical upgrade - it fundamentally changes where Stellar fits in the financial world. Integration with SWIFT and DTCC gives it credibility in regulated markets and positions it for long-term growth as tokenization expands into trillion-dollar markets. This connection, developed by Cheesecake Labs and the Hyperledger Foundation, allows assets to move between Stellar's Soroban and Besu networks. Cacti simplifies the technical complexity, letting developers build applications without worrying about each blockchain's unique architecture. For Stellar, this means it can now work with enterprise Ethereum systems where Besu is already widely used. SWIFT CBDC Sandbox Access - Through the Cacti bridge, Stellar can now tap into SWIFT's central bank digital currency (CBDC) testing environment. With Stellar connected, XLM could potentially serve as a neutral bridge currency for cross-border CBDC transactions. DTCC Tokenized Collateral Platform - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation recently launched a real-time tokenized collateral management system built on Hyperledger Besu. This platform is designed to increase liquidity, speed up collateral movement, and bridge traditional finance with digital assets for high-value institutional flows. Stellar's new connection to Besu creates a direct pathway into this institutional-grade tokenization infrastructure. Disclaimer: TheTradable content is for informational purposes only.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A digital euro could be rolled out in the middle of 2029, European Central Bank Executive Board Member Piero Cipollone reportedly said Tuesday (Sept. 23). Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins. The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish. In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins. Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness. A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said. “In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase Derivatives has unveiled a groundbreaking financial product, the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,' marking a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. The introduction of this product is set to reshape investment strategies, providing diversified opportunities within a single, regulated instrument and accelerating the institutional adoption of digital assets. On September 22, Coinbase Derivatives officially launched its 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,' a product meticulously designed to bridge the gap between established tech giants and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. This new index future is composed of ten equally weighted components, which are rebalanced quarterly to maintain balanced exposure. This launch is not merely an expansion of product offerings but a strategic move that addresses a growing demand from institutional investors for regulated, capital-efficient avenues into the digital asset space without the operational complexities of holding individual assets. By combining the stability and growth potential of leading tech stocks with the dynamic, high-growth characteristics of cryptocurrencies, Coinbase Derivatives is providing a streamlined investment vehicle that offers enhanced market diversification. This is the first U.S.-listed futures product to merge such distinct asset classes, signifying a maturation of the digital asset market and its increasing integration into mainstream financial products. Tech stocks are often influenced by economic cycles, interest rates, and earnings reports, while crypto assets respond to a different set of drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and network adoption. The integrated approach of the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' allows for more sophisticated risk management and portfolio construction strategies, appealing to a broad spectrum of institutional and sophisticated retail investors seeking to capitalize on innovation across both traditional and digital economies. The introduction of Coinbase Derivatives' 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' is poised to create significant shifts in market dynamics, producing clear winners and potentially challenging existing players. This product not only diversifies its revenue streams but also reinforces its strategic importance as a regulated gateway for institutional capital into the crypto market. By facilitating a more accessible and familiar investment vehicle, Coinbase is likely to attract increased trading volumes and solidify its reputation as an innovator in the financial derivatives space. The inclusion of their ETFs in such a prominent, diversified futures product enhances their visibility and legitimacy within both traditional and digital asset communities. Investors seeking diversified exposure and capital efficiency will also benefit, as the product simplifies portfolio management and risk allocation across previously disparate asset classes. The "Magnificent 7" stocks, while already widely held, could see ancillary benefits from increased trading interest from investors leveraging this new index for broader market exposure. Similarly, highly specialized, niche crypto funds that focus solely on digital assets might face increased competition from a product that offers regulated crypto exposure alongside established tech equities, potentially siphoning off some institutional capital. Purely traditional equity funds might also experience a subtle shift in capital allocation as some investors opt for the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' to achieve diversification that spans both traditional and digital growth sectors. This event fits squarely within the broader trend of financial institutions seeking to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering regulated pathways for institutional capital to flow into cryptocurrencies. This competitive response could accelerate innovation in derivatives markets, leading to a wider array of cross-asset investment vehicles. The product's success could also set a precedent for future regulatory approaches, demonstrating that complex combinations of traditional and digital assets can be structured and offered within existing regulatory frameworks, thereby fostering greater clarity and confidence for institutional participation. Historically, the introduction of new derivatives products has often served as a catalyst for market expansion and increased liquidity. This product validates the notion that digital assets, when packaged appropriately, can appeal to a broader investor base, moving beyond early adopters to attract mainstream institutional interest and capital. High trading activity and tight bid-ask spreads would signal strong market acceptance and institutional uptake, indicating that the product is effectively meeting investor demand for diversified exposure. Initial reactions from major institutional players and how they integrate this product into their existing portfolios will also provide valuable insights into its immediate impact. Investors will be keen to assess whether the combined exposure truly offers enhanced diversification and risk-adjusted returns compared to investing in the "Magnificent 7" stocks and crypto ETFs separately. The development of similar products by competitors, particularly from other major exchanges or financial powerhouses, will also be a key area to watch, as it could signal a broader industry shift towards hybrid financial instruments. Furthermore, any evolving regulatory responses or guidance related to these combined asset class products could significantly shape the market's trajectory. From a strategic perspective, this new futures product opens up fresh market opportunities and challenges. It enables new arbitrage strategies between the futures and underlying spot markets, as well as more sophisticated portfolio construction techniques for managing exposure across traditional tech and digital assets. It also presents opportunities for enhanced risk management, allowing investors to hedge against volatility in either segment through a single instrument. Potential scenarios include a rapid increase in institutional capital flow into crypto, driving further innovation in the digital asset space, or a more gradual integration that steadily reshapes traditional investment paradigms. By packaging exposure to the "Magnificent 7" tech leaders, Coinbase's own stock, and leading crypto ETFs into a single futures contract, Coinbase has created a compelling offering for investors seeking both growth and diversification in an increasingly interconnected global economy. It serves as a powerful testament to the growing maturity and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, moving them from niche investments to mainstream financial instruments. Its success could not only pave the way for further innovation in hybrid financial products but also influence regulatory frameworks and long-term asset allocation strategies across the industry. The future of investment is increasingly diversified and technologically driven, and Coinbase Derivatives has just provided a powerful new tool to navigate this evolving landscape.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin-focused Latin American company OranjeBTC is set to go public on Brazil's B3 exchange in early October with more than $400 million in BTC reserves, making it Brazil's largest publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firm. The move, confirmed by local news outlet Brazil Journal and at Mercado Bitcoin's DAC 2025 conference, will see it go public via a reverse merger with Intergraus, a prep-course provider already listed on the exchange. Once the transaction closes, Oranje will assume Intergraus' public listing with a roughly 85% free float. Backing the venture are high-profile crypto investors including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, trading platform FalconX, and Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. Alongside its treasury play, Oranje plans to launch a financial education platform focused on bitcoin and crypto, using Intergraus' existing infrastructure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Policymakers and commentators increasingly propose central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to address shortcomings in the payments system. Advocates argue that CBDCs would address several issues with the traditional monetary system, especially financial exclusion and delayed settlement. The shortfalls of modern payments closely resemble issues often noted with social media. Social media platforms exclude users and throttle content—delaying “settlement” with the public. Despite these parallels between payments and posting, calls for state-run payment infrastructure far exceed those for state-run social media. The asymmetry, I suspect, springs from an uneven sensitivity to risk and potential abuse. But such a platform for spending—what could go wrong? Digital Currency or Digital Control, Nicholas Anthony's new volume, offers a needed corrective to idealistic CBDC proposals that overpromise and would likely under-deliver. Anthony is perhaps uniquely situated to evaluate the rise of CBDC technology, in all its forms and guises. He maintains the Human Rights Foundation's CBDC Tracker, which “documents CBDC development and civil liberties concerns around the world.” In Digital Currency or Digital Control, Anthony subjects CBDCs to sustained scrutiny. The result is fair, rigorously argued, exhaustively researched, and highly readable. The book offers an overall introduction to and evaluation of CBDCs. He then argues that CBDCs would fail to make good on their promises of improved financial inclusion, faster payment settlement, and more effective monetary policy (Chapter 3). He concludes cynically, but plausibly, that “the only ‘benefit' of CBDCs accrues to governments seeking to solidify their control over money and finance” (87). The final chapter ends with a call to raise awareness and pass legislation that prohibits CBDCs. Sample legislative language appears in one of the three informative appendices. Against the pro-CBDC argument from financial inclusion, Anthony correctly notes that CBDCs would not “bank the unbanked” since CBDCs exist to facilitate payments, not banking services (17). Anthony also cites FDIC survey data to argue that few of the unbanked would find a CBDC attractive. For example, many cite a lack of trust in private banks as a reason for self-exclusion from banking services. Overall people tend to trust the government even less than private banks (18 ff. On whether CBDCs would improve transaction settlement, existing infrastructures already enable near-instant payments for retail users, leaving little for CBDCs to improve. Stablecoins, in particular, provide near-instant settlement over global, permissionless payment networks that operate 24/7/365 with low fees. It's not clear that the government could build an equally performant system without substantial cost or repealing current rules that require customer documentation. In 2023, the UK's HM Treasury advertised a listing for the Head of Central Bank Digital Currency with a salary range between £61,260-£66,500. Proponents of CBDCs often claim that central banks could use them to spur spending through negative interest rates and fine-tune the economy at the level of individuals. But we now have access to alternative savings vehicles like foreign currencies, stablecoins, and Bitcoin. Moreover, using CBDCs for targeted interventions would require collecting user-level financial data. This would threaten financial privacy and alienate many of the unbanked, who cite “financial privacy” as their second-most common reason for avoiding private banks (FDIC). To appreciate the threat CBDCs pose to financial privacy, consider how uneasy we already feel about the separate buckets of personal data harvested by social media and AI companies. Now imagine consolidating all that data into a single honeypot on government servers—exploitable by malicious hackers, rogue bureaucrats, and authoritarian politicians. CBDCs would expose citizens in similarly dangerous ways. As Anthony argues, our payments data tell detailed stories about the whats, whos, wheres, whens, and whys of our economic lives. Cypherpunk Nick Szabo famously says that trusted parties are security holes. But they are nonetheless also security buffers, as Anthony argues in Chapter 7. By consolidating several trusted parties into one—the central bank—CBDCs consolidate potential points of failure. Many CBDC proposals also include built-in programmability for restricting locations, times, and types of transactions. This centralization of power also exposes citizens to government abuse. Even if today's officials act responsibly, the historical record offers no assurance that tomorrow's will. A single-tier CBDC would also compete with private banks and payments providers. Any CBDC that survives Congress would likely emerge limping, scorched, and missing a few parts. Perhaps, then, governments should integrate the existing banking system into CBDCs. Some scholars, such as Easwar Prasad, have proposed such a two-tiered model where the currency remains a direct liability of the central bank while private entities serve customers and collect their data (“Central Bank Digital Currencies and the Future of Central Banking,” Cato Journal 41, no. Such a system might sound like the best of all worlds, with banks serving as safeguards for financial privacy and a buffer against government attempts to control and censor. Like Anthony, however, I'm skeptical whether governments would invest in a system that does not ultimately expand their surveillance and control over retail transactions. I'm also not convinced that a proposal like Prasad's would improve enough on leading stablecoins to justify the costs of developing a new payments system. Even if it did in the abstract, governments recently have a poor track record when they try to bring plans into reality. Or consider FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payments network. Anthony suggests that Bitcoin users could fork the Bitcoin software to create a new network, leaving the old, vulnerable network behind. I disagree with little else in the book. Anthony's analysis is especially timely, as governments around the world continue to advance their own designs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While experts forecast that Ethereum could surge to $33,000, Buterin draws parallels between the cryptocurrency's future role in finance and Google's dominance in search. As a result, the ETH founder has suggested that low-risk Decentralized Finance (DeFi) may become Ethereum's breakthrough “Google Moment.” A recent chart analysis by prominent market expert Egrag Crypto paints an optimistic picture for Ethereum's long-term price trajectory. This trend has been visible across previous market cycles, lending weight to his previous projection that the next ETH rally could be monumental. In Ethereum's earlier cycles, key formations, such as the Bull Flag and the Rectangle Continuation Pattern, produced extraordinary gains that exceeded expectations. Now, ETH is forming what Egrag Crypto identifies as a Descending Broadening Wedge, a setup that typically signals bullish continuation once the breakout is confirmed. However, when factoring in Ethereum's historical tendency to overshoot by an average of 163%, he sees the cryptocurrency skyrocketing as high as $33,000. In a report published on September 21, Buterin describes what he sees as Ethereum's upcoming Google moment. Just as Google secured long-term dominance by finding its core economic driver in search and ads, the crypto founder argues that Ethereum now has the opportunity to anchor its ecosystem with low-risk DeFi and unlock comparable growth. Historically, ETH has struggled to balance two distinct categories of applications—those that generated significant revenue like NFTs and meme coins, and those that aligned with Ethereum's broader vision, such as decentralized identity and privacy protocols. By enabling global, permissionless access to stable wealth-building mechanisms such as interest-bearing assets, bonds, and currencies, the crypto founder highlighted that Ethereum could achieve economic sustainability. He also expressed hope that Ethereum could potentially surpass Google's legacy. Buterin mentioned that Google was often criticized for straying from its core mission and becoming an antisocial, profit-maximizing corporation. However, ETH is fundamentally different, with decentralization embedded deeply at both technical and social levels. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>E*Trade will let clients trade Bitcoin, Ether and Solana in 2026, marking Morgan Stanley's entry into crypto with Zerohash support. Morgan Stanley's E*Trade will launch cryptocurrency trading in 2026 through a partnership with digital asset infrastructure provider Zerohash — underscoring Wall Street's deepening push into digital assets amid a wave of supportive legislation from the Trump administration. E*Trade clients will be able to buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in the first half of 2026, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Reuters. At the time, Cointelegraph reported that the initiative was still in early stages as E*Trade sought partnerships with infrastructure providers. E*Trade was acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020 for $13 billion. Morgan Stanley also participated in the funding round. As Bloomberg noted, Zerohash will build a full wallet solution for E*Trade clients. Perhaps E*Trade's biggest rival in the discount brokerage crypto space is Robinhood, which has rapidly expanded its footprint by offering crypto trading and, more recently, acquiring exchange Bitstamp in a $200 million deal. Related: Crypto Biz: Wall Street giants bet on stablecoins While E*Trade's crypto rollout represents one of Morgan Stanley's first direct retail forays into digital assets, the bank has already been deepening its presence in the space. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley was not among the Wall Street companies reported in May as weighing a joint stablecoin initiative. Nevertheless, a 2024 paper by Andrew Peel, Morgan Stanley's head of digital asset markets, argued that stablecoins could reinforce the US dollar's global dominance — a view that aligns with recent regulatory efforts to establish clear stablecoin legislation. That perspective gained traction with the passage of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by US President Donald Trump, which established a comprehensive framework for stablecoin issuers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum Founder Vitalik Buterin Says L2 Base Is ‘Doing Things the Right Way' Buterin argued the network has been using its centralized aspects to provide better UX for users while still relying on Ethereum's decentralized base layer for security. “I feel like many people have been confused by recent cynicism and think that things like L2Beat are a weird sort of nerd-sharia compliance authority,” Buterin added. An L2, or layer-2, is a network built on top of another blockchain—in this case, Ethereum. After debuting in August 2023, the network has grown to hold $15 billion worth of assets. One of the common narratives has been that because it's centralized, Base could theoretically steal all user funds. Base is doing things the right way: an L2 on top of Ethereum, that uses its centralized features to provide stronger UX features, while still being tied into Ethereum's decentralized base layer for security. “Base CAN instantly steal ALL user funds,” wrote CyberCapital founder and CIO Justin Bons in response to Buterin's praise on X. Buterin highlighted the popular L2 analytics project, L2Beat, which tracks security, throughput, and active users on L2 networks. “This is what we mean when we say that L2s are non-custodial,” Buterin said, “they are extensions of Ethereum, not glorified servers that happen to submit hashes.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neal Stephenson's Lamina1 teamed up with Consensys' Linea to launch Spaces, a platform for creator-owned IP and interactive storytelling on Ethereum. Lamina1, the blockchain content platform co-founded by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson and tech and creative leader Rebecca Barkin, has partnered with Consensys' layer-2 network Linea to bring creator-owned media to Ethereum. “Neal Stephenson is one of the leading figures in cyberpunk,” Lubin said. Launched in 2022, Lamina1 aims to enable artists, writers and developers to maintain control of their intellectual property while involving fans in the creative process. The platform has seen over 150,000 active addresses since its launch. Related: Linea resolves sequencer bug as massive token airdrop set to kick off The debut product on Linea is called Spaces, which will serve as a home for interactive story-driven worlds and creator-controlled IP. Described as a role-playing experience in a post-AI world, Artefact will allow players to join competing factions, collect data fragments and shape the unfolding narrative. “Linea's zkEVM offers an ideal environment for creator-driven platforms like Lamina1's Spaces due to fast, inexpensive, and secure blockspace that leverages Ethereum's decentralization, with fully EVM-compatible development, ZK-proofs for fast finality between Ethereum and Linea, and a flourishing onchain economy as the largest ZK-rollup,” said Declan Fox, vice president and head of Linea. Fox added that user data, digital assets and creative IP on Linea are protected by Verax, an attestation platform that allows creators to attach verifiable credentials to their works. Linea's zkEVM technology is designed to handle scalable Ethereum applications with low fees and fast performance. Related: Linea airdrop: 85% to users, builders as L2 seeks Ethereum alignment Earlier this month, Lubin hinted that long-term holders of the new LINEA token may receive future rewards.
