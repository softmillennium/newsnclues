                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gucci is delving further into the filmmaking world as the venerable house premieres a short film starring Demi Moore and a cast of Hollywood stars. Gucci also launched a digital lookbook for his spring 2026 ready-to-wear line, called La Famiglia. Star-Studded Kering Foundation Dinner Raises More Than $4.5M to Combat Violence Against Women Naked Dressing Hits New Peak as Margot Robbie Bares Her Butt and Dakota Johnson Strips Down Since my first show will be in February, I felt like the story of La Famiglia should be told through a short film. I shared it with Spike and Halina, whose work I've long admired, and they created their film, ‘The Tiger,' inspired by these characters.” The film, which also stars Ed Harris, Alia Shawkat, Heather Lawless, Ronny Chieng and Alex Consani, sees Moore gather her children and a special guest at the family home to celebrate her birthday. Gucci also previously premiered a series of short films with filmmaker Gus Van Sant in 2020, as live fashion shows were suspended by the pandemic. So Gucci was probably the first major fashion brand that I ever knew about.” “I had to have like three people fit me into the dress, and had massive bling on my fingers,” she said of being on set. It felt like we had stumbled into a Fellini film-like dream.” “It felt like a real mashup of filmmaking and fashion, which are two very different worlds, actually, but it felt like they forged together beautifully,” she added.

Nexstar and Sinclair Won't Air Jimmy Kimmel's Return, Impacting 66 ABC Stations Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers React to Jimmy Kimmel Returning After ABC Lifts Suspension: "Late Nightmare Is Over" Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host. Carr's threat was followed by affiliate owners Nexstar and Sinclair says they would preempt the show, which spurred ABC to suspend Kimmel “indefinitely.” “We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country. Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power — because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The comedian and podcast host also says he was booted from a warm-up gig in Dubai after mixing it up with Abu Dhabi — and reveals how much money he lost. Tim Dillon will not be traveling to the Riyadh Comedy Festival next month. Besides losing a $375,000 payday (an amount Dillon confirmed to Rogan), he also lost a nearby warm-up gig in Dubai two nights before his Riyadh appearance after mixing up the Arab emirate with Abu Dhabi  (the rival cities are both part of the United Arab Emirates). “I mixed them up — apparently this is a big deal over there. The Riyadh Comedy Festival — which mostly takes place at the Bakr Al-Sheddi Theatre and ANB Arena from Sept. 25 to Oct. 9, features a number of top tier comedians including Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Gabriel Iglesias, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Jeff Ross, Chris Distefano, Tom Segura, Jo Koy, Sam Morril, Hannibal Buress, Andrew Schultz, Sebastian Maniscalco, Whitney Cummings, Jimmy Carr, Louis CK, Pete Davidson, Russell Peters and Chris Tucker. “Supposedly, MBS is a fan of mine,” Dillon said two weeks ago on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, referring to Saudi head of state Mohammed Bin Salman. Dillon was reportedly fired from the festival for claiming that Saudi Arabia relies on slave labor — a controversial take on the country's foreign laborers laws that some groups, including Human Rights Watch, have criticized as “slavery-like.” Legally, slavery was abolished in the Kingdom in the 1960s. Dillon said the slavery jokes were a misunderstanding with his Saudi hosts, saying on his podcast, “I was defending them for having slaves. I literally said, ‘Slaves are hard workers and for the most part agreeable.' “You can literally support somebody too much,” he added. The Riyadh Comedy Festival opens Sept. 25 with performances by Burr, Maz Jobrani and Andrew Santino and Bobby Lee from the Bad Friends podcast.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Disney will soon be parting ways with the union nurses on its Burbank studio lot in favor of subcontracting, less than a year after negotiating a new contract with IATSE. Deadline understands the company first notified IATSE Local 80, which represents studio nurses among others, in July that it would be invoking a provision in the union's Basic Agreement to make the switch to hiring subcontracted nurses through a medical staffing company instead. Michele Mulroney Officially Elected President Of WGA West; Travis Donnelly Seals VP Win & Peter Murrieta Takes Secretary-Treasurer Disney Tells Streaming Customers It Is Raising Prices In Move Planned Prior To Jimmy Kimmel Controversy A studio source tells Deadline this decision will only impact the Burbank studio lot, and medical services available to employees will not change. The reasoning, they tell us, is to streamline backend processes, staffing and reporting. So far, there is no timeline for when Disney will make the move, though it has already created a bit of a firestorm among local crew. “This, to me, is an assault on unionism and and a weaponization of the language [of the contract],” Ellis insisted. “This is just a principled attack, if you will, in my opinion, on the union workers. It's just one less headache for that [labor relations] department.” Ellis also says that the local is planning some coordinated action to protest Disney's decision, including an informational picket to let the public know about its concerns, though nothing is set in stone quite yet. IATSE's Basic Agreement with the Hollywood studios only prohibits subcontracting work “which has not heretofore been subcontracted in the multi-employer bargaining unit,” which opens the door for Disney to make a move like this. Studio nurses were previously subcontracted at Universal Studios in 1989. This line in the contract was a source of great contention during last year's bargaining cycle between IATSE and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Ellis says, adding that leadership spent “hours” trying to get the provision removed altogether. Disney's Burbank studio lot has employed union nurses for 85 years. In fact, Walt Disney himself famously tapped one of the lot's union nurses, Hazel George, to tend to him personally after a neck injury sustained in a polo accident. She would go on to become one of Walt Disney's most trusted confidantes and, in 1952, she is said to have helped him shore up money from studio employees as a show of support for his ambitious theme park plans that would eventually become Disneyland. She eventually became a songwriter for Disney, as well, before returning to be Walt Disney's personal caretaker until his death in 1966. Studio lot nurses typically provide immediate care to cast, crew, executives and other employees as well as monitor health and wellness protocols on set.

Related Stories One Volcano After Another: Designing a Legendary Battle Sequence for the ‘Chief of War' Finale When ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' Returns to the Air Tonight, It Will Not Be Available Everywhere “The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good. “The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>from filmmaker Nico Ballesteros, who was granted unvarnished access to Kanye West — now known as just Ye — in the six tumultuous years following his public embrace of conservative politics. The film opened to a limited release, screening at around 494 theaters nationwide. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $776,000, a strong domestic box office performance for a documentary without significant marketing behind it. For comparison, the Oscar-winning doc No Other Land logged a cumulative $420,000 a month after opening in January, on its way to earning $2.4 million to date. Becoming Led Zeppelin, released in February, is 2025's top-earning doc opening to over $2 million, though it screened internationally. Clips from In Whose Name?, including one in which Ye explosively lashes out at Kris Jenner, have been circulating around social media for several days, as the film's unfettered level of access presents a view of Ye that many fans have never seen. comes short of offering any explanations as to how Ye went from a beloved musical icon to effectively a social pariah, it does provide a clear view into the world of celebrity in our highly digitized and politicized age. Its strong first-week performance suggests there is, in fact, an audience hoping to decipher the mind of Ye all these years later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“No question,” Dr. Phil said under his breath, answering his own query in a dispute that has become its own level of legal Hell. Amidst gentle reprimands from the judge over how “Yes” or “No” questions work, bickering attorneys, a “trial mantra,” verbal salvos and short fuses, a frequently irritated McGraw Tuesday testified in federal court in Texas on the potential Chapter 11 and various lawsuits surrounding his much hyped and now-diminished Merit Street Media. Or, as Dr. Phil suggested at one point, “if we are going to open that can, let's eat the whole thing.” “We're here because they ignored the fact that the time that it takes for a startup network to get to a point of fruition, and turnaround is four to five years, and they were explained this from the jump,” a bellicose McGraw told Judge Scott W. Everet's courtroom. “We discussed it on numerous occasions, and they just didn't stay the course long enough for it to get to that point. This was a four-to-five year journey, and if they had just stayed in long enough, I think this would have been the best investment they had ever made.” “It was so much fun,” the onetime CBS talk show host muttered, with obvious sarcasm, of all the time he spent with attorneys and accountants in the past year as various schemes were discussed on how to dismantle the TBN deal. A deal that Dr. Phil acknowledges saw TBN make “significant capital contributions” along the way. Having recently launched a new company Envoy out of the remains of MSM, Peteski Productions owner McGraw moved in July to put MSM in bankruptcy and suing TBN for breach of contract. With a summary judgement hearing looming for later this year, the Matthew Crouch run faith-based company countersued in August, accusing Dr. Phil of “reprehensible conduct,” trying to play them for millions and tying to pull a fast one to get out of the deal. Earlier this week, Crouch took to the stand and told the court that Dr. Phil and Merit Street Media were a bust for TBN and never made them any serious money. With notions of a settlement once floated, and debtor loan plans of around $10 million in the mix to make sure lawyers are paid, the lawsuits seemed to have turned into a very un-Christian grudge match. The hearing is in recess right now, with lawyers for the TKO Group Holdings-owned Professional Bull Riders set to question the witness for “an hour, maybe more” this afternoon. As he was during the TBN questioning, Peteski (and long time Oprah) lawyer Charles Babcock is in court and raising objections for his client. Having had knee surgery a while back, the 6′ 3″ McGraw appeared to have an issue with his chair being too low. Several members of his team came over to help, trying to adjust the rest and eventually rolling a new chair over for the rest of the day's testimony — which seemed to at least go fine on that level.

Last Sunday, I found myself inside YouTube's suite above the 50-yard line at Levi's Stadium in San Jose. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan had gathered some of his platform's biggest creators, along with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodall, to celebrate YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket partnership. I wasn't there to cheer for football rights. I wanted to know more about the parallel studio system that's connecting creators, platforms, and audiences. It moves faster, costs less, and connects more directly than Hollywood while serving an audience at a scale no studio or streamer can match. Related Stories What Hollywood Really Wants: The Audience You Already Built Inside the Unconventional Format of ‘Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake),' One of This Year's Best Filmmaking Debuts Here's my theory: For now, independent filmmakers and content creators operate in parallel universes. However, Hollywood is watching closely and I think those worlds are beginning to converge. Over four hours, I managed to pull Dhar Mann, AdamW (aka Adam Waheed), and Mohan away from the deafening suite (rookie observation: NFL games are loud) to hear how they see this future taking shape. Dhar Mann, who has 26 million subscribers and owns Dhar Mann Studios in Burbank (“the size of two football fields”), specializes in high-drama stories with uplifting messages. Imagine after-school specials as vertical dramas: “Girl KEPT IN ATTIC From EVIL STEPMOM” (860K views in two weeks) or “Kids MAKE FUN OF Boy With AUTISM, They Instantly Regret It” (68M views in 4 years). For him, this is personal storytelling that stems from memories of his “immigrant upbringing as a 10-year-old wearing a turban in elementary school and feeling like an outcast.” And he tells another personal story. “He's like, ‘Dhar, I really want to enter the space.' I'm going to start my own scripted series on YouTube. “YouTube does not operate that way,” Mann said. “If I spent my life savings on one episode, or even 10 episodes, I would've blew my whole life savings because you never succeed on your first time. Mann's videos have a rapid-fire production schedule and work with less-experienced talent. “[Hollywood] can put out much bigger, ambitious projects, but I don't think it takes $100 million to bring an amazing story to life,” he said. So much of our community says they see themselves in our content because it isn't overproduced, it isn't with big-time Hollywood actors. It's with everyday people that look just like us.” Adam Waheed, best known under his channel name AdamW, has over 20 million subscribers for his comedy shorts that lean into real-world scenarios like overweight luggage or paying for grocery bags. He said relatability drives virality, with the comments section a constant barometer. “The greatest thing about being a content creator is you get feedback in real time,” he said. You can't do that on Netflix or Disney. You get to figure out, ‘What are the things that stuck with people? “It's awesome that you can, in real time, change things,” he said. However, that's what Waheed is about to do. He's prepping his first feature, a romantic comedy set to begin production in Italy and Chicago this fall. Range Media and CAA are handing financing for the $4 million-$5 million budget. “Some people say, ‘You can't release something on YouTube. You can't make money that way' — until a few people start doing it,” he said. “And then a lot of people start doing it. With or without me, I believe it's going to happen. In theory, Waheed has a built-in audience of 20 million but he estimates a small percentage of his subscribers would be guaranteed to follow him everywhere. “I don't want to go anywhere else,” he said. “I think it's very hard for any streamer to become YouTube and I think it's very easy for YouTube to become any streamer,” Waheed said. “Netflix can't make a social media platform.” Neal Mohan, who doesn't have a YouTube channel but presides over the platform's over 2.5 billion monthly active users, believes features can be as native to YouTube as its 15-second shorts or 15-hour live streams. “If you have a creative vision and an idea, then YouTube should be the place to connect with the audience, whatever that format is,” he said. Mohan cites a deal with Bollywood star Aamir Khan, who released his blockbuster “Sitaare Zameen Par” (Stars on Earth) on YouTube immediately after its theatrical run. “He had the rights, it was his capital upfront. What place to put it other than YouTube?' To me, it was the glimpse of innovation from a distribution standpoint. But to me it was a little bit of oh wow, that's interesting. Khan makes his money via $6.99 rentals, but Mohan noted he could just as easily use ads, memberships, sponsorships, or commerce integrations. “And in many cases [creators] may come up with sponsorship ideas. Just like we want to provide multiple creative canvases, we also want to provide multiple different business models for creators.” Certainly, an idea that would make Christopher Nolan break out in hives; will other filmmakers feel differently? It also means operating in a world where they not only seek out but act on audience response, but Mohan said he believes that's wholly compatible with artistic intent. Yeah, what you hear from your audience is your input, but it's not the thing that's telling you exactly what to do.” Hollywood still measures success in opening weekends and festival launches, while creator-led studios measure it in fan engagement and iteration speed. At Levi's Stadium, YouTube showed off its football muscle. But the bigger play may be what its creators are building on the platform itself: a new studio system that doesn't move on Hollywood time, but at the speed of culture.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in June, a South African YouTube show about religious prophecies and visions featured an interview with a guest named Joshua Mhlakela. “The rapture is upon us, whether you are ready or not,” he said. “God took me to see the future, and then he brought me back.” He recounted meeting Jesus Christ, whom he claimed told him, “I am coming soon.” Mhlakela further revealed that the Christian messiah had given him the date of his return: Sept. 23-24, 2025. For whatever reason, some of these have captured the public imagination in a major way. In one famous example, the Baptist lay preacher William Miller declared that by his scriptural calculations, the Second Advent of Christ would occur at some point in 1843 or 1844 — a belief that exploded in popularity across the U.S. as those years drew near. But no matter: Judgment Day can always be postponed until tomorrow. And so, Mhlakela's promise of a rapture this week — coinciding with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year — was seized upon by Christian TikTokers who began to spread the good news to their own followers and friends. “Six days, almost five days till rapture time,” said one such user in a clip posted last week that has been viewed more than 2 million times across social media platforms. “I'm so excited, who else is excited?” She went on to say that it was her birthday, and she was secretly hoping the rapture would have happened early for the occasion. Another woman appeared to be concerned that her husband would be left behind as she and other true believers entered the kingdom of God. She shared a TikTok that showed how she was storing preserved foods for him as well as planting a Bible stuffed with cash in his dresser drawers, and even providing an off-the-grid survivalist guide so that he would be able to weather the presumable hellscape of post-rapture Earth. A caption on the video reads, “He doesn't know it yet: But I have been fighting a battle for him.” Other Christian influencers attacked skeptics as they meanwhile speculated on the possibility of Donald Trump being the Antichrist; some shared apocalyptic dreams and alleged “confirmations” of an impending mass ascent into heaven. In one TikTok, posted on Sept. 1, a self-described “rapture watcher” danced happily while holding a calendar, elated that the month of reckoning had finally arrived. “Jesus please use my account and the remaining videos for YOUR glory and YOUR will,” wrote a TikToker in a caption for one such video. A few began watching for signs that the rapture had begun, such as a woman filming the sky outside her home in North Carolina shortly after dawn. “I haven't seen anybody floating upwards,” she said. Thousands tuned in to a YouTuber's livestream for “The Great Exodus 2025,” featuring a virtual panel of believers, including Mhlakela himself, discussing the end-times.

As the hours ticked by, however, the silence from most prominent rapture influencers grew more noticeable, and the comments on their earlier videos filled up with mockery: “See you on Wednesday” was an especially popular reply. Elsewhere, nonbelievers jokingly complained about having to work during the rapture, noted how it curiously fell on Celebrate Bisexuality Day. TV and internet personality Desus Nice advised on X that “greeting your rapture believing coworkers on wednesday with ‘goddamn you're still here?' is not appropriate but totally worth the zoom meeting with HR.” Will they return to their accounts with some kind of convoluted excuse for the canceled event? Make no mistake, though — they'll set a new date before long. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star sparked buzz at Page Six's inaugural “Virtual Reali-Tea” Awards when she revealed her interest in a younger reality star — and hinted at burying a long-running feud with one of her castmates. At the New York City ceremony, co-hosts Danny Murphy and Evan Real teased Parks about her red carpet behavior at the 2025 Primetime Emmys. “I kind of love that you treated the red carpet almost as a dating app,” Murphy said, to which Parks, 51, laughed, “I did.” The crowd cheered when Real called out her flirty exchanges. Jason Isaacs, Harry Jowsey, Walton Goggins,” he joked. The attorney and former “Married to Medicine” star revealed she told the “Too Hot to Handle” and DWTS alum, 28, not to “count a cougar out.” Jowsey's cheeky reply? The couple split after Nida was sentenced to eight years in prison for fraud charges. The exes continue to co-parent their sons, Ayden, 15, and Dylan, 12. Since then, Parks has been linked to Medina Islam and radio host Tone Kapone, while Jowsey has famously dated Francesca Farago, Jessica Vestal, and actress Lucy Hale. The Bravo star's night wasn't all about flirty fun. Parks also hinted that her feud with Angela Oakley, which dominated “Real Housewives of Atlanta” season 16, may finally be cooling down. At the reunion, Oakley doubled down on the claim, saying, “First and foremost, he told me it was Phaedra. The two failed to resolve their differences at the reunion, but Oakley has since suggested she's open to reconciliation. Now, Parks says they're in “a different place.” She told Page Six she believes Oakley's attacks stemmed from her status on the show. “I think people sometimes come on the show and [they] just come for people at the top,” Parks explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant are still going strong, but they haven't said “I do.” The “Matrix” star addressed fresh marriage rumors this week, with his representative confirming that the couple has not tied the knot despite recent speculation. Though wedding bells haven't rung, the couple's relationship is still going strong. Earlier this month, Grant celebrated Reeves' 61st birthday on Instagram with a heart-shaped cake and the caption: “To Keanu—who saw this post as a draft!—I am so grateful for your love and partnership.” They co-founded the publishing house X Artists' Books in 2017 and appeared at art events together long before making headlines. Grant later admitted to Vogue that she was surprised by the media frenzy that followed, saying, “I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November.” “He's such an inspiration to me,” Grant told People in 2023. She added that their later-in-life romance allowed her to step into the relationship with confidence. “The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun. Reeves has been candid in rare moments about their connection. In 2020, he told Parade, “It's been really wonderful to be with Alexandra. We enjoy each other's company, whatever that may be.” He also revealed their last moment of bliss during a People interview: “A couple of days ago with my honey. Most recently, the couple shared a kiss at the 2023 MOCA Gala in Los Angeles and appeared side-by-side at the screening of Reeves' film “Ballerina,” showing that even without marriage, their love remains strong.

Yaeji has enlisted the hyperpop artist Underscores and rapper Aliyah's Interlude for a new song. “Booboo2” is the sequel to—and reinvention of—Yaeji's 2024 single “Booboo,” and her first song since March's “Pondeggi.” (“A year ago today, I wrote a banger that goes like: ‘Booboo, don't touch me,'” the song begins.) Watch a lyric video, animated by Caroline Waxse, below, and scroll down to see the single artwork.

Yaeji has released a string of loosies and collaborations since With a Hammer, starting with “Easy Breezy” and including recent collaborations with Bambii and Girl Talk, as well as a Teddy Geiger collaboration, “Pink Ponies,” for the Red Hot compilation Transa. She also remixed the South Korean boy band Ateez's song “In Your Fantasy” in July.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It wasn't a question of who put up the cash for the wild-eyed passion project of Roman politics, modern sins, and sci-fi ideals. It also wasn't a question of how the unwieldy behemoth was made in a practical sense—how exactly the famously long-gestating film, which had been rattling around Coppola's brain since 1983, finally got recorded, edited, drenched in inconsistent visual effects, and pushed into movie theaters. Those interested could find plenty of leering production coverage from trade outlets eager to luxuriate in what was seemingly predetermined to be Coppola's financial and critical failure. Late in MegaDoc, Figgis (whose features include the Oscar-winning Leaving Las Vegas) notes that, “All the really good documentaries about filmmaking have actually been films about disasters.” This at least applies to the one documentary closest in proximity to MegaDoc: Eleanor Coppola's Hearts Of Darkness, about her husband's Apocalypse Now. MegaDoc‘s simple titles and bad Seinfeld bass licks puncture the expensive, obtuse audacity in front of it with cheap, honest fascination. Shooting with a little Nikon Z8 rig and with no plan other than to see what happened as a living legend poured $120 million of his own money into a film, Figgis sits through oddball acting exercises, contentious filming, and the growing sense that everyone's imbibed at least some of Coppola's Kool-Aid. After being initially drawn in by Coppola's name, money, or enthusiasm—mostly the latter, it seems—cast and crew seem to accept their shared fate. Figgis juxtaposes his behind-the-scenes view of moments that made it into the finished movie with those same moments in table reads that took place years, even decades prior. Robert De Niro is there as a favor; Uma Thurman and Billy Crudup go through the motions; footage from 2003 observes Ryan Gosling smirk through a role taken over by Shia LaBeouf 20 years later. Giancarlo Esposito, who somehow stuck around since those initial table reads, is one of the infectious true believers ready to preach the gospel of Coppola. Actually seeing the time investment, that continuity of care by Coppola—well, even if it's in service of something completely ridiculous, the dedication is hard not to admire. It's one thing to simply read about something being stuck in production hell, but another to watch a piece of art claw its way out of the pit. There are plenty of enjoyably loopy evangelists on set, but the people who most bring out Coppola's magnetism are those butting heads with him. Among these are assistant directors (who note that Coppola will yell and storm off, then apologize after), department heads (some of whom are admonished for being too slow during the massive production, then fired), and cinematographer Mihai Mălaimare Jr., who argues with the director about maintaining lighting continuity. “Your job is to get beautiful images of the scenes that we have.” He bought up an entire hotel for the shoot, knocked down the walls, and put in a full-sized screening room, turning it into his own mini-studio for just one film. But, as Coppola reiterates, he isn't interested in best practices. “Play gives you everything.” Fittingly, he's inspired by Jacques Tati, who went bankrupt making his masterpiece Playtime: “Who cares if you die broke if you made something that you think is beautiful?” That's all that matters to Coppola, and this charming ethos is as clear throughout the production as it is in the final product. Coppola really is that earnestly interested in pushing the form forward while having a good time. As I wrote a year ago when it was released, where many modern movies are imaginatively stingy, misers trying to capitalize on the lowest common denominators, Megalopolis is a gluttonous hedonist, aimed at pleasing exactly one person. Francis Ford Coppola is doing that on a $120 million scale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After playing nice with the administration on Thursday, Jon Stewart returned to The Daily Show to do what he does best: Make fun of Ted Cruz. After Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel, Donald Trump held a press conference about the unproven dangers of curing headaches. For the most part, though, Stewart focused on how flagrant the president has become and how bad Ted Cruz's Princess Bride impressions are. This isn't exactly news, but Trump 2.0 is a mask-off presidency—unless you're a federal agent looking to snatch people off the street, then it's mask on. It's become so bad that even Cruz called FCC Chair Brendan Carr's now-infamous “we can do this easy way or we can do this hard way” comment “dangerous.” Not that anyone can count on a sitting member of Congress to do anything about it. “You don't have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump's authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law,” Stewart said. Trump is saying, ‘I'll use the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal. So, without further ado, here's that video of Ted Cruz's Simpsons impression from, Jesus, a decade ago.
