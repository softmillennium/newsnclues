                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UCLA and UC Davis will co-lead a newly funded, multi-institutional clinical trial to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help support radiologists in interpreting mammograms more accurately, with the goal of improving breast cancer screening and reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients. The study will involve hundreds of thousands of mammograms interpreted at academic medical centers and breast imaging facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. Expert radiologists remain in the driver's seat for all interpretations." While routine mammography screening reduces mortality through early detection, it also has drawbacks - including false positives that can lead to unnecessary testing, anxiety and costs, and missed cancers. "AI has great promise, but it also raises real questions," said Elmore, who is also an investigator at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and serves as director of the UCLA National Clinician Scholars Program. "We want to know whether AI helps radiologists find more cancers, or just flags more exams that ultimately turn out to be normal." What makes PRISM different is its emphasis on patient-centered research. The trial was developed in close partnership with patient advocates, clinicians, health system leaders and policymakers. Each participating facility will continue routine screening as usual, with no changes to the patient experience. Mammograms will be randomly assigned to be interpreted either by a radiologist on their own or with assistance from an FDA-cleared AI support tool. The results will help inform not just clinical practice, but also insurance coverage, technology adoption, and patient communication." "There is a lot of hope that AI will make care better, but very few rigorous trials have actually evaluated its real-world effects," said Elmore. "This is our opportunity to generate trustworthy evidence, with the patient perspective front and center." The PRISM trial brings together seven leading academic medical centers: "Our expert radiologists will continue to make the final call. The trial is expected to inform future policy decisions, best practices in screening, and how to most effectively integrate emerging technologies into patient care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team at the Terasaki Institute, led by Dr. Vadim Jucaud in collaboration with Dr. Jing Yong Ye from the University of Texas San Antonio, has developed a new microfluidic-based biosensing platform that allows monitoring cellular secretion of monoclonal antibody in real time. This approach can make monoclonal antibody production more efficient, ultimately lowering manufacturing costs so these important biotherapeutics become more accessible to patients. The global demand for monoclonal antibodies, with over $240 billion in sales in 2024 alone, requires large-scale manufacturing with efficient, precise, and cost-effective monitoring of their production processes. Currently, monoclonal antibody production monitoring relies on end-point assays that fail to capture the real-time cellular secretion. Dr. Jucaud's team has developed the first biosensing platform to rapidly and cost-effectively track live antibody secretion dynamics. The microfluidic design minimizes culture volume, concentrates antibodies, and positions hybridoma cell lines directly above a PC-TIR biosensor-originally developed by Dr. Ye's group at the University of Texas San Antonio. This setup enables characterization of antibody secretion within one hour, providing a powerful tool for comparing cell lines, optimizing production methods, and selecting high-secreting clones to advance monoclonal antibody manufacturing while lowering costs. This work exemplifies how advanced biosensor technologies can revolutionize biomanufacturing." "Because antibody secretion rate is directly tied to manufacturing efficiency, selecting these powerhouse cells could transform how we scale up monoclonal antibody production, ultimately driving down costs and making life-saving immunotherapies more affordable for patients." Overall, this new platform provides a way to streamline production, reduce unnecessary costs, and expand the availability of these therapies to more patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ovarian cancer (OC), one of the three most common gynecological malignancies, is characterized by low early detection rates and poor prognosis. Patients with OC face a high risk of developing transcoelomic metastasis—the spread of cancer cells within the abdominal cavity—during the early stages of the disease, a process strongly linked to poor survival outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms of how OC cells spread from the primary tumor to distant sites have remained elusive. In a recent study published in Genes & Diseases, researchers from Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics, and Nankai University, employed CRISPR-based large-scale genetic screening alongside an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model with gene knockout cells to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying OC. Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach combined with patient-derived transcriptomic datasets, researchers identified neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1) as one of the most critical genes promoting transcoelomic metastasis. NBL1 was found to be significantly overexpressed in metastatic ovarian tumors, with expression levels strongly correlating with advanced clinical stage and poor survival outcomes. Further experiments by the team revealed that NBL1 promotes OC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis through dual mechanisms: i) direct activation of Jak/Stat3 signaling via physical interaction and ii) suppression of anti-tumor immunity by limiting T cell infiltration. Its strong association with poor prognosis, combined with reversibility by Stat3 inhibitors, positions NBL1 as both a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target. A systematic CRISPR screen reveals an NBL1-mediated Jak/Stat3 crosstalk to promote ovarian cancer metastasis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While most cases resolve without complication, the condition carries a risk for sudden cardiac death that can strike even healthy, athletic individuals, Cooper told Medscape Medical News. Among young athletes, myocarditis has been called a “silent killer.” Recommendations in the new ESC guidelines are largely consistent with those of the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on managing myocarditis, and a 2025 joint ACC/American Heart Association scientific statement on return to participation for athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities. “We recommend endomyocardial biopsy mainly for high-risk or treatment-refractory cases,” said Gianfranco Sinagra, MD, head of cardiothoracovascular medicine at the University of Trieste in Trieste, Italy, and a task force member for the ESC guidelines. “Our guidelines also introduce a new diagnostic paradigm for classifying myocarditis as definite, possible, or unlikely/rejected. This shift may facilitate earlier diagnosis and risk stratification for routine clinical practice,” Sinagra told Medscape Medical News. “We need to address the pericardial inflammatory component while surveilling for complications suggesting myocardial injury, such as ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias.” For a first episode of acute myopericarditis, European and US guidelines affirm the use of colchicine in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In acute myocarditis, data show that omitting colchicine and failing to taper high-dose steroids are risk factors for recurrence or a chronic course of disease. However, prolonged inactivity also has implications for mental health and quality of life. “In my practice I often see young athletes who are paralyzed with fear when faced with a potentially life-threatening cardiac diagnosis,” Cooper said. While the decision should be individualized, current evidence supports a minimum rest period of 4 weeks, according to both US and European guidelines, after which patients with a mild course and low risk for complications can gradually return to activity. Monitoring should include assessment of symptoms, laboratory analysis for prognostic biomarkers, and imaging. A key difference between US and European guidelines is in how they classify myocarditis. The ACC consensus statement offers similar definitions for acute and chronic myocarditis but adds a letter system to characterize severity: Stage A: At risk based on exposure or genetic predisposition Stage B: Subclinical: the presence of inflammation or injury without symptoms This population includes an expanding number of patients receiving cardiotoxic drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. Monitoring troponin levels in the second and third week of clozapine therapy is indicated to prevent this highly fatal form of myocarditis, Cooper said. Many cases of myocarditis probably slip through the cracks, due to socioeconomic gaps in access to care and availability of advanced diagnostic technology, Cooper added. However, clear, updated guidelines for diagnosis and management can ideally help to prevent sudden cardiac death and long-term complications like heart failure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While many families found comfort and companionship in their lockdown puppies, new research shows that the joy often came with safety risks, added stress, and uneven benefits across children and caregivers. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple families got puppies, mainly to help them with their mental health. A recent study in PLOS ONE examines how children and dogs interact in these families, using a three-phase online survey. About 1.6 million UK homes have one or more dogs. Dogs are part of the family in these homes, and multiple family members consider themselves the dog's owner. A prior study showed that 38% of people in the UK who currently own a dog acquired it during the pandemic, resulting in “pandemic puppies.” The pandemic years were marked by lockdowns, periods of severely restricted physical social interactions, and widespread fear of severe illness and death. Very little is known about the benefits of pet ownership for children or adults, which has prompted this current study. The researchers conducted an online survey in three parts. They compared households that got a dog in 2019 with those that got a dog during 2020-21. Since few people responded in the 2019 group, statistical comparisons were underpowered, and the qualitative analysis pooled both groups rather than treating them separately. The responses came from 382 caregivers and 216 children. In most cases, dog care appeared to be women's work, with half the women being 45-54 years old. For just under half, this was their first dog. Two-thirds said they researched their decision before acquiring a puppy. More than half the families got a dog to boost their spirits and bring joy back into the house. Slightly less than a quarter of caregivers had children with a mental health diagnosis, with 82% of these blaming the pandemic, in part. A third of caregivers found living with a puppy more challenging than expected, especially when it was their first dog. Some mothers felt their children were less involved in dog walking and feeding,  though others noted more involvement than anticipated. First-time dog owners were more likely to find their children less involved in care than expected. Many caregivers reported stress involved in ensuring safe dog-child interactions. Concerningly, over half of the children were permitted to engage in multiple activities known to increase bite risk (17/25 listed interactions). For instance, children not only patted their dogs but hugged and kissed them in 90% or more families. Over a third of families allowed children to play with the dog during its mealtimes, a known risk for biting behavior. Obvious misbehavior, like pulling the dog's ears or tail, was allowed in <7% of families. Both children and adults found that having a dog had multiple positive aspects, especially the close physical interactions between children and the dog. In almost all families, at least one member has benefited from the dog's positive effects as a playmate, confidant, friend, comforter, and safeguard. The lockdown was associated with very bad memories, which many caregivers and children recalled being eased by the presence of a dog. Not only did the children enjoy cuddling, hugging, or sharing a bed with their dogs as an expression of their affection, but this also provided an emotional boost when they were sad, lonely, or anxious. The family was often bonded by caring for a dog, keeping it physically engaged, and by the companionship and humor the dog brought into their lives. Dog walking also separated the children from virtual interactions and brought them out of their bedrooms to engage with the family. Conversely, children sometimes resent taking care of the family pet, are jealous when the dog appears to prefer others or receives more attention, and dislike the dog's asking for attention when they are otherwise engaged. The caregivers are often unaware that their children do not like these behaviors or do not appreciate having to give up much of their free time to look after the dog. It should be taught wherever possible, even via literature or other media, if not physically. Children often love having a dog as a companion and playmate, but they should be trained to avoid behaviors that increase dog bite risk. Families need access to resources to help them safely settle in the new puppy, especially considering the additional caregiver mental burden placed on the woman who typically undertakes dog care and maintains safe dog-child boundaries, in addition to her other responsibilities in the home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Science has confirmed what sports lovers have always known from experience: exercise is good for the brain. It increases blood flow, inhibits stress hormones, and stimulates the release of 'feel good' endorphins. One way by which exercise is thought to yield these benefits on the brain is through a chain of processes that ultimately results in the release of the hormone BDNF. Produced by the liver, brain, skeletal muscle, and fat tissue, BDNF is known to promote the growth, survival, and maintenance of nerve cells. Now, a study in Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience has found that the physiological benefits of exercise may be partly mimicked by a simple IV infusion of lactate. Here we show for the first time that such an infusion leads to levels of lactate in the blood which are characteristic of medium to intense exercise. Dr. Marcus Moberg, lead author, senior lecturer at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, Stockholm The authors did a so-called 'randomized crossover study' on 12 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 40 years old. After fasting overnight, these were invited to lie down while either receiving a one-hour long IV infusion of sodium lactate and then, seven to 30 days later, a one-hour long infusion of saline solution; or receiving these treatments in the reverse order. A leg muscle biopsy was taken before and immediately after each infusion with lactate, as well as 60 and 120 minutes later. A control group of six additional volunteers exclusively underwent a treatment with saline solution, and likewise donated blood samples and four muscle biopsies. They further quantified the levels of pro-BDNF, a biologically active precursor molecule of BDNF, in addition to its mature molecular form mBDNF, in blood plasma, serum, and platelet-poor plasma – that is, plasma from which most platelets have been removed. As expected, the concentration of lactate in blood increased during infusion, peaking at values similar to those normally obtained after high-intensity exercise. In other words, lactate infusion alone is enough to mimic some, but not all, of the physiological effects of high-intensity exercise. It is expected that such an increase of pro-BDNF will have similar beneficial effects on brain health, irrespective of the mechanism behind it. Is this good news for those among us who loathe exercise? Possibly one day, but for now the authors strongly caution against skipping the exercise step and relying on lactate infusion alone. High-intensity exercise a couple of times per week, thus exposing the brain to high levels of lactate, should be recommended for healthy neurological aging," said Moberg. This would require additional research to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which lactate controls BDNF metabolism in humans."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background and goal: A recurrent barrier to Medicare annual wellness visits, which provide preventative medicine guidance for older and disabled patients, occurs when patients introduce medical concerns to physicians during these preventative visits. In this study, researchers scheduled combined visits in a single, longer slot with patients' regularly seen clinicians and used allowed billing rules so both visits could count to see if they could increase the percentage of annual wellness visits completed and the quality measures captured. Study approach: A family medicine department with five clinics ran a nine-month quality improvement effort for patients aged 65 and older on Medicare. The department team started booking longer 40-minute "combined" appointments so patients could complete the Medicare annual wellness visit and, if needed, have regular medical issues handled in the same visit with their regularly seen physician. The team then tracked, month by month, how many eligible patients got a wellness visit, how often people missed appointments, and how many screenings, tests, and vaccines were ordered, comparing results with the nine months before the change to see what improved. Medicare wellness visits increased from 8.4% to 50.8% over nine months. Patients had lower no-show rates for annual wellness visits with their regular physician than a different clinician. Orders and screenings increased across many measures, including depression, falls, pain, breast/cervical/colorectal/lung cancer, DEXA, A1c, urine microalbumin, Hep C, HIV and pneumococcal. Why it matters: The findings suggest scheduling longer, combined visits with patients' usual physicians may help increase the completion of annual wellness visits, reduce no shows, and close screening gaps, while still fitting within existing Medicare billing rules.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For undergraduates, a trip to the dentist can reflect more than oral health. Those who kept up with dental exams were also more likely to schedule eye and physical exams, carry health insurance, and rate their overall health more positively, according to new study. We can think of primary care as a kind of gateway to other preventive care and specialized services. When students maintain the habit of seeing one type of provider regularly, it seems to spill over into how they approach their health more broadly." Vanessa Alvarez, study's lead author and second-year MPH Epidemiology student at George Mason University's College of Public Health Alvarez conducted the study with renowned obesity researcher Lawrence Cheskin, professor of nutrition at George Mason. Cheskin is co-principal investigator of Mason: Health Starts Here, the university's landmark cohort study following students across their four undergraduate years. Students who had a dental exam before college were much more likely to keep up the habit two years later. Health insurance predicted dental visits at baseline, and students who got one type of preventive exam (dental, eye, or physical) were more likely to get the others. Students who had dental exams, more parental financial support, and higher levels of hope also rated their overall health more positively. Researchers also noted a complex relationship with anxiety. Students reporting mild anxiety were sometimes more likely to seek dental care, but higher anxiety correlated with avoiding preventive exams. Since 2019, more than a thousand George Mason students have enrolled and completed detailed surveys, with some taking physical exams. Researchers monitor everything from diet and exercise to sleep, mental health, and substance use, returning health feedback to participants along the way. As a companion to the dental research, Alvarez is now leading a study on eye exams, while other researchers are looking into gynecological care among female students. Cheskin says future work will also focus on how diet and exercise habits changed from pre- to post-pandemic, and on mental health trends such as depression and hopefulness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Routine blood samples, such as those taken daily at any hospital and tracked over time, could help predict the severity of an injury and even provide insights into mortality after spinal cord damage, according to a recent University of Waterloo study. The research team utilized advanced analytics and machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to assess whether routine blood tests could serve as early warning signs for spinal cord injury patient outcomes. More than 20 million people worldwide were affected by spinal cord injury in 2019, with 930,000 new cases each year, according to the World Health Organization. Routine blood tests could offer doctors important and affordable information to help predict risk of death, the presence of an injury and how severe it might be." They used machine learning to analyze millions of data points and discover hidden patterns in common blood measurements, such as electrolytes and immune cells, taken during the first three weeks after a spinal cord injury. They found that these patterns could help forecast recovery and injury severity, even without early neurological exams, which are not always reliable as they depend on a patient's responsiveness. "While a single biomarker measured at a single time point can have predictive power, the broader story lies in multiple biomarkers and the changes they show over time," said Dr. Marzieh Mussavi Rizi, a postdoctoral scholar in Torres Espín's lab at Waterloo. The research also found that accuracy increased over time as more blood tests became available. Although other measures, such as MRI and fluid omics-based biomarkers, can also provide objective data, they are not always readily accessible across medical settings. Routine blood tests, on the other hand, are economical, easy to obtain, and available in every hospital. "Prediction of injury severity in the first days is clinically relevant for decision-making, yet it is a challenging task through neurological assessment alone," Torres Espín said. "We show the potential to predict whether an injury is motor complete or incomplete with routine blood data early after injury, and an increase in prediction performance as time progresses. "This foundational work can open new possibilities in clinical practice, allowing for better-informed decisions about treatment priorities and resource allocation in critical care settings for many physical injuries."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Study approach: Researchers conducted a retrospective, mixed-methods study one year after deploying five primary care pharmacy technicians across 11 clinics in a large urban safety-net network. They analyzed electronic health records (EHR) from June 2023 to May 2024 to track the number and type of medication tasks the technicians handled. The survey included a 0 to 10 "pain point" rating of medication access work before and after technician deployment; estimated hours saved per month; perceived impact on work experience, quality of care and patient access, and open-ended responses. Average ratings of "medication access work as a pain point" (0 to 10 scale) decreased from 8.3 before to 3.6 after pharmacy technician deployment. Themes from open-ended questions described pharmacy technicians dealing with prior authorizations, communicating with pharmacies, timely medication access for patients, expertise of pharmacy technicians, and reduced task burden/ greater efficiency. Why it matters: The findings from this study suggest pharmacy technicians can be an asset for team- based primary care, bringing expertise in efficiently managing medication access processes that benefits clinician and nurse work experience and patient access to medications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study found that families experienced greater difficulty affording adequate food and household expenses after states began to lift emergency SNAP benefits that were provided to families at the start of the pandemic. As these changes begin to unfold, a new study builds upon a growing body of data that capture the detrimental consequences of reducing SNAP assistance. SNAP benefit reductions were associated with increased difficulty affording both food and household expenses among SNAP-participant families, particularly among those with children. The risk of food insufficiency-a narrow measure that indicates that a household has not had enough food to eat within the past seven days-increased by five percentage points after several states ended their emergency allotments in 2021, compared to states that ended this assistance later. Our study found that states choosing to end the SNAP emergency allotments early created more pressure on family budgets, not just for affording food but also spillovers to difficulty affording other expenses. Households with children faced a greater increase in food insufficiency than those without, foreshadowing what we may expect with SNAP cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act." Dr. Paul Shafer, study senior author, associate professor of health law, policy & management Food insufficiency was assessed with questions about the type of food households consumed within the last seven days, as well as how often families had enough to eat. Beyond physical health and development, even brief disruptions in access to food can affect mental and emotional health, particularly among children, the researchers emphasize. "Being food insecure is associated with higher rates of stress and depression. In addition to funding cuts, the OBBB implements several changes to SNAP eligibility, including expanded work reporting requirements for older adults, parents of children over age 14, parents, veterans, and the unhoused, as well as significant shifting of benefit and administrative costs from the federal government to the states. How states choose to respond will be key, says Dr. Shafer. "States could cut eligibility or opt out altogether, or have to cut other state programs to offset the cost," he says. More people being subject to work reporting requirements, including 55-64 year olds, veterans, and unhoused people, will yield an estimated 2.4 million Americans falling through the cracks. Furthermore, food pantries-which are already overburdened-won't be able to absorb the additional need, which means even more people will face food insecurity and hunger." Tracking how these major changes to SNAP benefits and to the structure of the program affect families' health and their ability to make ends meet will be essential going forward, says study coauthor Dr. Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, research associate professor of health law, policy & management. "Tariffs, inflation, and growing unemployment are additional stressors on the purchasing power of SNAP that will be important to evaluate in real time," Dr. Ettinger de Cuba says. "Given what we already know from past changes to the program, I am concerned that SNAP will not be able to respond as it was designed-to grow during hard times and shrink in good times-ultimately increasing hardship for everyday people."
