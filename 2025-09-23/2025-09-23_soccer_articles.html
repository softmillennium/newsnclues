Following Gianni Infantino‘s tenure as FIFA president, soccer has seen transformative changes worldwide, particularly with the integration of technology. This era has ushered in a revamped FIFA Club World Cup and introduced a series of updates for the 2026 World Cup. According to Diario Ole, CONMEBOL is pushing for a major shift in the 2030 FIFA World Cup by proposing an expansion from 48 to 64 teams. “We came here to work and had an extremely important meeting. Though FIFA has not officially announced it, sources like Diario Ole report that President Gianni Infantino is lobbying for support across various regions ahead of a Council meeting next week. However, this change would only take effect starting with the 2030 edition, establishing a new precedent for future World Cups, while the 2026 event remains unaffected.

Alexander Isak's first goal for Liverpool should have been the story after Tuesday night's 2-1 win over Southampton at Anfield. Instead, it was Hugo Ekitike getting himself stupidly sent off after netting the winner.

Isak opened the scoring in the Carabao Cup third-round clash on Merseyside with a characteristically cool finish just before the interval - and only 58 seconds after Leo Scienza had headed wide with the Liverpool goal at his mercy.

However, Arne Slot's side failed to killed the game and Southampton sensationally drew level with 14 minutes to go when Shea Charles punished a dreadful attempted clearance from Wataru Endo. Unfortunately for the Championship side, Liverpool weren't done and, for the sixth time this season, they scored a late winner, with Ekitike tapping home a pass from Chiesa.

The drama wasn't over, though, as Ekitike clearly forgot that he was already on a booking, meaning the French forward saw red for foolishly removing his shirt to show the crowd the name on the back of his shirt and will, thus, be suspended for Saturday's Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're less than nine months away from the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will see AT&T Stadium (which will temporarily be renamed Dallas Stadium) host nine games across 31 days, beginning with a group stage match on June 14, and concluding with a semifinal match on July 14. Anette Landeros, the chief strategy officer for Trinity Metro, which manages Fort Worth's public transportation, said FIFA officials expect 100,000 visitors across Dallas-Fort Worth each day. Not all of them, of course, will stay in Fort Worth, but enough will that Landeros and her team are preparing for a significant uptick in train and bus ridership next summer. As for what the exact number will be, Landeros said, it largely depends on which countries' teams play in Arlington. That won't be decided until Dec. 5 when FIFA holds its final draw, where the 48 nations competing in the World Cup are placed into groups and venues are assigned. One of the first steps was establishing a dedicated website, fortworth.com/soccer2026, to welcome and educate soccer fans. To carve out a sizable portion of that, Visit Fort Worth is teaming with business partners from the Stockyards, the Near Southside, Sundance Square, TCU and Downtown Fort Worth, Inc., to give fans that quintessentially Texas experience. Additionally, with more than 4,000 media members expected at the International Broadcast Center in Dallas during the tournament, Whitten said his team is developing a strategy to attract coverage of Fort Worth, ostensibly introducing Cowtown to a worldwide audience that may be unfamiliar. Three months later, in March, teams will announce the locations of their base camps, and it's expected that TCU will host one of the national teams playing in Arlington. “It's also an opportunity for our residents, business owners and community partners to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation event. As we deliberately look to include the region as a whole in our planning and preparation, having the Official Draw Party in Fort Worth was a perfect fit.” “Right now, we're planning for, at the very least, being able to move 5,800 people via the TRE (Trinity Railway Express) on game days,” Landeros said. To handle the increased ridership, Trinity Metro has acquired additional passenger cars and locomotives. Finding enough seats for riders was one hurdle, Landeros said. Another was the fact that there's no train station in Arlington. But it has certainly posed a challenge, she said, figuring out how to establish routes in areas not traditionally served by public transportation. When asked if this could be the catalyst for a permanent transportation link between downtown Fort Worth and Arlington's entertainment district, Landeros said she's always open to having those discussions. “In terms of desire, I can confidently state that Trinity Metro would love to service Arlington,” she said. But perhaps witnessing how transit is so important to the international sports fan during the World Cup might give a different perspective, perhaps, for Arlington leaders. And we stand by ready to have that conversation whenever it presents itself as an opportunity.” Landeros expects heavy ridership on Trinity Metro's Orange Line, which connects downtown and the Stockyards, and the Blue Line, which circulates passengers on a loop through downtown. “In terms of way finding, those are improvements that we're really excited about because there are things that we've wanted to do, but now the World Cup has given us the urgency to get it done. And we're going to be a better system for it after,” said Landeros. Sonny Saxton, Fort Worth's director of emergency communications and management, said the city has established work groups to address a variety of concerns around the upcoming World Cup, from infrastructure necessities to beautification efforts to safety and security. Michael Crum, director of Fort Worth's public events department, added to that, saying the city will be well prepared by next summer to handle a large number of visitors while ensuring everyday services are not affected.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA — We got our first look in March at the poster that will attract fans to Atlanta for the FIFA World Cup 2026. Channel 2's Jorge Estevez got a closer look at the poster with the artist, Jose Hadathy, who is also Atlanta United's design manager. The Somos Atlanta collection continues to foster a sense of community and cultural pride among Atlanta United fans, offering them a way to celebrate their heritage and the city's diversity through fashion. HHM Artist Atlanta United Channel 2's Jorge Estevez got a closer look at the poster with the artist, Jose Hadathy, who is also Atlanta United's design manager. “Making clothing has always been a passion of mine as well, making something that fans can not only see, but hold, wear, kind of represent in their daily lives. And so I get to do that now for the club,“ Hadathy said. The collection's highlight piece, which is debuting this month, incorporates indigenous symbols and geometric patterns. Hadathy explained that he was inspired by these patterns and thought, “Could I make letters out of this?” which resulted in a unique design. You know, we wanna celebrate the whole city,” he said. “What you wear is the ultimate representation of who you are initially, and so for people to wear your designs is a huge compliment.” Atlanta is one of 11 North American cities that will host the World Cup next year.

This Tuesday (23), the African Champions League winner defeated the Saudi Al-Ahli, the current Asian Champions League winner, by 3 x 1 at King Abdullah Sports City in Saudi Arabia. Al-Ahli managed to equalize with Toney, from a penalty, but could not overcome a competent rival when they had the ball. They had Brazilians Ibañez and Galeno among the starters. Matheus Gonçalves was brought on at 84', after Mayele's third goal. This match will take place on December 10, three days after the end of the Brasileirão. It will be on the 17th.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is once again calling for cheaper tickets to the World Cup. "What we're seeing is that FIFA's approach to the ticket process of the World Cup is both without precedent in their own administration of previous World Cups and is also an approach that will price out so many New Yorkers from actually being able to be in the stands," he said. Democrat mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a rally at the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council headquarters in New York, Wednesday, July 2, 2025. "We are now, at face value, seeing tickets for more than $6,000," he said. Mamdani recently called for 15% of tickets to be set aside at discounted prices for residents and asked FIFA, soccer's governing body, to reverse a plan to set ticket prices based on demand. New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a press conference at St. James Park on Sept. 10, 2025, in the Bronx to announce his campaign's petition urging FIFA to drop dynamic ticket pricing for next summer's World Cup. Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA for comment but did not immediately hear back. Eight matches, including the final, will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York. FIFA's plan to adopt a dynamic pricing model has sparked backlash among some fans, The Associated Press previously reported. A 2026 FIFA World Cup promotion is displayed at MetLife Stadium after an announcement by FIFA on Feb. 5, 2024, in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Tickets will start at $60 for group-stage matches and increase to $6,730 for the final, officials said earlier this month. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Izzy Engle netted a hat trick in her second collegiate game. She scored two more times in her third. The next four games all featured at least one goal or assist too. By the time Notre Dame's 2024 regular season ended, Engle had produced 15 goals. She opened the scoring last week against No. 1 in the nation for Top Drawer Soccer and No. 2 in the most recent United Soccer Coaches poll. Her parents, aunt and uncle all went to Notre Dame, so she grew up attending Fighting Irish football games. Playing soccer for the school was always the goal, but she was determined to keep an open mind during her college recruiting process. But in the end, they just weren't Notre Dame. “My high school and club experience coming into Notre Dame for sure prepared me very well,” she said in a recent appearance on Sports Spectrum's “What's Up” podcast. Having those experiences, I knew the season was not going to be easy and nothing's going to be given.” “I knew it was not on my own. When things didn't go well … I knew that those valleys, they're temporary. Jesus has always been part of her life, and she specifically prayed that she would find ways to grow in her faith at Notre Dame. When you're going into something so new and so unfamiliar, knowing that everything else might be changing but He is unchanging, that was for sure something that I leaned on,” she said. Engle was immediately invited to church by teammates and is part of a team Bible study. She is also part of an organization called Notre Dame Christian Athletes and is taking on more of a leadership role now as a sophomore. The U-20 World Cup will take place in Poland next September. As hectic as her life is, Engle still manages to find little moments to reflect and think about how grateful she is to be playing the sport she loves at her dream school in an environment that helps her grow closer to the Lord.

Watch our brand new I ONCE WAS story with pro soccer player Tijana Duricek pic.twitter.com/TLt70sKU3s – Tobi Sho-Silva, Professional Soccer Player – Leah Amico – Author, Speaker & Former Olympian The Orlando Pride averaged 1.12 points per game in their first seven seasons as a National Women's Soccer League franchise (2016-2022). They made the playoffs once and never won a postseason game. Since Sams arrived, they are averaging a league-high 1.93 points per game. Sams was well aware of Orlando's history as she went through the draft process, and wanted to be picked by a team that had a better track record of success. “I was trying to talk to my agents and see if there was something we could do, but Orlando said, ‘No, we're drafting you and you are coming here,'” she said in a recent interview for the Summer 2025 edition of Sports Spectrum Magazine. “So at first I thought, ‘All right, just gotta make the best of it.' Sams started every regular-season game as a rookie and led the Pride in minutes played. Yet no one could have predicted what was coming next. She officially made her U.S. women's national team debut on Oct. 27, 2024, in a friendly against Iceland, and has earned three more caps since. Orlando is off to another strong start this year, sitting in second place as the season approaches its halfway point. The strong bond between players has played an important role in the team's success, and an active Bible study has helped build a strong foundation of faith in the locker room. Sams is a regular participant in the Bible study, and teammates who have played for other teams have emphasized to her how special the present culture of faith in Orlando is. “So I definitely feel very blessed to be a part of this group. I would just say we're all very committed to meeting.” Sams grew up going to church and was involved in Bible studies while in college at Florida State, but does not feel like she truly took ownership of her faith until last year. The defining moment came during a team Bible study when they were reading an introduction to a book that discussed spiritual warfare. “I can't remember the specific moment, but we were reading that, and for whatever reason it just clicked in my head, and I would say that is the moment I got saved. God just revealed Himself to me in a way that I had never experienced before.” A post shared by Emily Sams (Madril) (@emilysams) Orlando (8-3-1) is back in action against Racing Louisville (5-5-2) at 8 p.m. Sams was also included on the U.S. women's national team roster for its upcoming games against Ireland (June 26 and 29) and Canada (July 2).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » Libertarian Think Tank Backs Dynamic Pricing in FIFA World Cup Ticket Debate The libertarian think tank argued that allowing ticket prices to rise and fall with demand is an efficient way to allocate scarce seats for one of the world's most in-demand sporting events. | READ: From $60 to More Than $6K: FIFA's Dynamic Pricing Plan for 2026 World Cup Tickets | FIFA confirmed that while some tickets will remain at set prices, most will vary based on demand, similar to pricing systems used in concerts and major U.S. sports leagues. Critics, including New York City mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani, have denounced the policy as “greed,” launching petitions to impose caps. In its piece, CATO countered that fixed pricing would lead to shortages and misallocation, while dynamic pricing allows fans who value the experience most to secure seats — and noted that prices can decrease for less popular matchups. While consumer groups have long warned that dynamic pricing can push events out of reach for average fans, CATO maintained that market-based pricing combined with FIFA's official resale platform offers a “sensible” solution to distribute tickets fairly. The Cato Institute, grounded in free-market philosophy, frames FIFA's dynamic pricing strategy for the 2026 World Cup as a legitimate, even laudable move — one that reflects economic realities and promises to shift more surplus value back toward organizers rather than resellers. But whether fans and local regulators will see it as “fair play” depends largely on how openly FIFA communicates its pricing methodology, how steep the demand-based price increases are, and whether protections (for lower-income or local fans) are baked in. Yes, I would like to receive emails from TicketNews.</p>

A group of United Nations experts called upon FIFA and UEFA on Tuesday to suspend Israel from international competition, arguing the action is a "necessary response to address the ongoing genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory" amid the Israel-Hamas War. The experts said the suspension should target state teams rather than individual athletes to avoid discrimination based on nationality. Currently, Israel's men's national team is taking part in UEFA's World Cup qualification tournament ahead of the 2026 World Cup hosted in North America, while Maccabi Tel Aviv qualified for this season's edition of the UEFA Europa League and begin playing league phase games on Wednesday. "Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual," the experts said in a statement. "Sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalize injustices." The experts are advocating for a ban upon the conclusion of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, which wrapped up ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York. FIFA and UEFA have both a moral and legal obligation to act, the experts argued, because of international human rights law that is in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. "They must fulfill their obligations not to provide aid or assistance that would help maintain the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory," the experts said. Eight United Nations experts are cited in Tuesday's call to action: Alexandra Xanthaki, the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights; K.P. Ashwini, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; Francesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967; and Pichamon Yeophantong (Chairperson), Damilola Olawuyi (Vice-Chairperson), Fernanda Hopenhaym, Lyra Jakulevičienė and Robert McCorquodale, Working Group on business and human rights. Both FIFA and UEFA suspended Russia in February 2022 following the country's invasion of Ukraine, with Russian teams still ineligible for international competition. In February of this year, meanwhile, FIFA banned the Congolese Football Federation for third-party interference in its operations and the Pakistan Football Federation for its inability to adopt a revision to its constitution that would enable "truly fair and democratic elections." UEFA's executive council next meets on Dec. 3 in Nyon, Switzerland, while the next meeting of the FIFA Congress will be on April 30, 2026 in Vancouver, Canada., The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 65,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to CBS News, though did not say how many were civilians or combatants.

FIFA received 145 reports relating to “human rights concerns” at the Club World Cup in the U.S., “many of which were complaints submitted by supporters through the governing body's own grievance mechanism portal,” according to Adam Crafton of THE ATHLETIC. 

The highest number related to fans “expressing concerns about U.S. government policies or their enforcement,” with the second-most coming from fans who “suffered from extreme heat during the tournament.” Crafton notes the grievance mechanism is in place for supporters who wish to express concerns about the organization or the experience at FIFA-led events. Some reports were “received via the portal, some fans used FIFA's human rights email address, and others were made on-site by venue teams reporting into FIFA.” These included 37 complaints categorized as being “related to federal policies or enforcement.” 

Among the other complaints submitted by supporters were “concerns about extreme heat -- a repeated controversy during the tournament.” FIFA opened 25 investigations following reports about “conditions deemed unsafe by fans due to the heat.” Other investigations included “20 or more complaints about accessibility issues and discrimination.” FIFA also opened a dozen complaints “relating to workers' rights, as well as just under 10 safeguarding issues.” There were five investigations into “harassment,” as well as four in the “freedom of speech category and alleged excessive use of force.” Three complaints were made about an “alleged failure to provide for freedom of religion” (THE ATHLETIC, 9/23). </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the United States Men's National Team moves closer to next summer's World Cup, individual performances will receive more and more attention as players jockey for a place in Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino's final squad. Last Friday, midfielder Tanner Tessmann scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his club team, Lyon, in their Ligue 1 match against Angers. While the goal can only help Tessmann's prospects of catching Pochettino's eye, it's equally as possible that the 23-year-old midfielder's chances of landing a spot on the World Cup squad may have already come and gone. “Pochettino was so high on [Tessmann] at first and then over the summer, he didn't get called in [to the Gold Cup] and it feels like other guys are just moving ahead of him” said former U.S. Men's National Team star Landon Donovan on the latest edition of Unfiltered Soccer. He was then also passed over for the USMNT's recent September camp including two friendlies against South Korea and Japan. Donovan cited that September absence as the one that could spell doom for Tessmann's chances of securing a spot at the World Cup. “From what I heard internally and a little bit externally, that September camp, the Japan-South Korea games, were the last time Pochettino was ‘looking and evaluating players.' “It feels like the ship has sailed a little with [Tessmann]. “He'll continue to smash that record,” said former U.S. Goalkeeper and Unfiltered Soccer co-host, Tim Howard.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arsenal forward becomes latest player to have played in Fifa's summer competition and get injured weeks into the season The Club World Cup has already seemingly taken its toll on winners Chelsea and Manchester City, with seven players who appeared in the tournament for both clubs currently out injured and Cole Palmer managing a groin problem that has reduced his minutes. Arsenal now also have a a Club World Cup casualty in Madueke, despite not taking part in the competition, and the injuries suffered by English clubs – as well as those at Paris St-Germain, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid – will only increase the fears of Tuchel, Enzo Maresca, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp. Stephen Smith is the CEO and founder of Kitman Labs, a leading sports performance intelligence company set up to reduce injury risk who work with the Premier League and EFL. Speaking to Telegraph Sport, he said: “It's impossible to state definitively that these injuries are as a direct result of the Club World Cup. “Arsenal have not had to do that across the board and Madueke has played almost 400 minutes for the club, so far, while an average Chelsea player sits at somewhere closer to 200 minutes. It will probably create more fear around the Club World Cup, but people are already worried about it, so now's the time to get ahead of this and start trying to do something about player health and safety rather than burying our heads in the sand.” Back at the start of June, Tuchel had said: “I think it [the Club World Cup] will have a huge impact and it will give Liverpool and Arsenal a huge advantage in the next season to not be there.” The England manager has already seen his own World Cup preparations impacted, as Palmer and Jude Bellingham, who delayed shoulder surgery to play at the Club World Cup for Real Madrid, were unavailable for his last squad to face Andorra and Serbia. Palmer may well be a doubt again, while Madueke will now miss the Wales and Latvia games. Chelsea central defender Levi Colwill will miss most of the season. Tuchel is short of in-form strikers other than Harry Kane, but Chelsea's summer signing Liam Delap is out until Christmas with a hamstring injury. Ahead of Tuesday night's Carabao Cup trip to Lincoln City, Chelsea head coach Maresca was without six players who had appeared at the Club World Cup. He said: “We are in a new situation for us because of the Club World Cup, so we don't know how this season will be in terms of injury. Chelsea returned to pre-season training on Aug 4, three weeks after their Club World Cup success, which gave them just 13 days of preparation from their opening league game against Crystal Palace. The club had been prepared for some resulting turbulence through the first few games and so it has proved with injuries piling up and Chelsea dropping points against Palace, Brentford and Manchester United, as well as losing to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Chelsea and City have been trying to manage the situation through rotation, with both teams using 22 players in the Premier League so far this season. City are without three of their Club World Cup players, Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki, who all missed the draw with Arsenal in which Guardiola further mitigated the physical demands on his players by parking the bus. Guardiola's team have taken one point fewer than Chelsea from their opening five league games, having lost to Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton, but did start with a win against Napoli in the Champions League. And maybe in November, December, January, ask me, Pep. I may say: ‘So listen, we are a disaster. Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they'll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league. We need to be documenting the injuries that are happening and the game exposure, and perform research in it to implement solutions. “The NFL have been doing this for years, running long-term injury surveillance research and they've made huge changes as a result to improve player health and safety. Fortunately for Arteta, the Spaniard has Bukayo Saka returning from injury to step in as a like-for-like replacement. Noni Madueke has his first England goal and it's a BEAUTY 👏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿Appreciation for the Rogers flick on 😮‍💨 pic.twitter.com/FEbaGjiMzh Arteta also has summer-signing Eberechi Eze pushing for a place in the frontline or as No10, with both roles supporting Viktor Gyökeres up front.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This time last year, we'd never have said that. He was an overpriced error when Barcelona paid £88million ($118.8m) to buy him from Borussia Dortmund in 2017. He was equally dubious value when PSG gave him a route out of Barca by signing him for £42m six years later. Dembele landing the men's trophy yesterday wrong-footed most of us. Take this stat, for instance: last season, when Dembele scored 35 goals during PSG's surge to the Ligue 1 title, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, it was the first time in nine years that he'd hit double figures in a league campaign. And truth be told, he didn't light fires on either front. Even in 2024-25, when with blinkered hindsight it feels like PSG could do no wrong, he was an awkward fit for parts of it. He got it in the ear again after a red card against Bayern Munich. Football won't remember him as its top men's player per se — Lamine Yamal, who came second last night, should ultimately make greater waves — but in one mesmerising purple patch, Dembele definitely was. For all Luis Enrique's sporadic criticism of the forward, he's a long-time Dembele enthusiast. At PSG, in 2023, Luis Enrique went out and bought him — for a modest return initially. Dembele churned out three whole league goals in 2023-24, but the revelation last season — the first campaign for PSG with no out-and-out superstar such as Messi, Kylian Mbappe or Neymar — was his insertion as a false nine, the deep-lying centre forward role made fashionable by Messi in his pomp. As Dembele got on a spectacular roll, his club did, too. It was almost a clean sweep for PSG in Paris yesterday. There was no arguing with any of it. But Dembele it was who took centre stage and crowned a glorious renaissance. Nobody saw those stars aligning, and perhaps Dembele least of all. It's a rare year when the men's top 30 looks just about right. And in Full Time, our women's soccer newsletter, Tamerra Griffin asks if Bonmati was actually Ballon d'Or-worthy. While PSG killed it on stage in Paris, they could have done with Dembele and others elsewhere. A postponed trip to Marseille in Ligue 1 ended in a 1-0 loss, courtesy of Nayef Aguerd's scrappy header (above), tempting the division to think — and whisper this extremely quietly — that it might have a title race on its hands. Luis Enrique's line-up fell well short of full strength, and it showed. Dembele is injured and several weeks short of a comeback (he streamed footage from Marseille at the Ballon d'Or ceremony). Desire Doue has fitness problems, too, and with Bradley Barcola also out, Achraf Hakimi pushed up into PSG's front three, embarking on a fruitless shift. Hakimi might be “more than a full-back”, as we once wrote, but he has some natural limits. Ligue 1, therefore, looks like this: Monaco top by virtue of goals scored, level on 12 points with PSG, Lyon and Strasbourg. But what harm in clubs around them being made to feel like it's worth turning up? When FIFA set up a portal for the submission of human rights complaints, it must have hoped the influx would not be huge. Others concerned discrimination following an event in which FIFA abandoned plans for widespread anti-discrimination messaging. FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, saw no evil over the summer, saying the Club World Cup passed without “one single incident”. Also in Adam's World Cup column this morning: La Liga: Levante vs Real Madrid, 3.30pm/8.30pm — ESPN, Fubo/Premier Sports. Coppa Italia, second round: Milan vs Lecce, 3pm/8pm — Paramount+/Premier Sports. Hier soir, la grande légende du catch Bret Hart était à Kaiserslautern ! We're getting used to random celebrities appearing at random football games, so wrestler Bret ‘The Hitman' Hart sitting through Kaiserslautern versus Preussen Munster in Germany's second division last week was perfectly on trend. I did laugh, though, at this question from a perplexed TV interviewer who collared the WWE hall of famer and, with no formalities, cut to the chase by asking: “Bret… what the hell are you doing here?” He is now lead writer of The Athletic FC newsletter. He previously worked for the Yorkshire Evening Post as its chief football writer.</p>
