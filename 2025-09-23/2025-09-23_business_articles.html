                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stock futures were little changed Tuesday night after the S&P 500 pulled back from record levels, snapping a three-day winning streak. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 18 points, or 0.04%. In after-hours trading, shares of Micron Technology gained more than 2% on the back of better-than-expected earnings and a strong forecast. The artificial intelligence boom fueled a 46% increase in Micron revenue. The leading memory chipmaker's results follow a trading session that was dominated by heightened fears about the circular nature of the AI industry, sparked by a Nvidia-OpenAI partnership. Shares of leading AI players Nvidia and Oracle tumbled on Tuesday. The Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 1%, pulled down by a 2.8% loss in Nvidia shares just one day after the chipmaker announced a massive investment in OpenAI, which prompted questions about whether there is enough energy to power planned data centers and if Nvidia's partnerships are akin to the risky practice of vendor financing. Traders could also be profit-taking amid elevated market valuations, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called out at a Tuesday press conference. Wells Fargo chief equity strategist Ohsung Kwon remains bullish on the AI trade, anticipating that spending will continue to be robust. "I think this is a AI-led bull market, and I think this is likely to continue," he said Tuesday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." "First of all, it's not a bubble," Kwon continued. Second, we still think we are in the early innings of the AI investment cycle. I think the way this plays out is, as long as the equity market continues to reward companies' capex outlook and the growth outlook, this is likely to continue." The Trump administration is looking to get an equity stake amounting to as much as 10% in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates terms of the company's Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass project, according to a Reuters report that cited two people familiar with the matter. Thacker Pass is a proposed large lithium mine in Nevada that has been under construction for almost one year. General Motors has a 38% stake in the project, which would be the Western Hemisphere's largest source of lithium when it opens in 2028, the report said. It underscores President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. production of lithium, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles, grid storage and batteries. Trump's interest in Lithium Americas comes after the administration took a 10% stake in beaten-down chipmaker Intel. Shares of Micron Technology rose about 2.8% after Tuesday's close on the back of the chip manufacturer's strong quarterly results. Micron, one of the world's leading suppliers of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips, exceeded estimates on top and bottom lines and gave a strong forecast for the current quarterly period. Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue of $11.32 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG expected earnings of $2.86 per share on $11.22 billion in revenue. The company said that its revenue in its fiscal first quarter will be about $12.5 billion, higher than the $11.94 billion consensus analyst estimate per LSEG. Shares of Micron have skyrocketed 97.7% this year amid ongoing demand for Micron's high-tech memory and storage technology, which powers AI workloads. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33 points, or less than 0.1%. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>returns to air Tuesday night, roughly one week after the late night show was suspended by Disney's ABC broadcast network. The program was initially pulled "indefinitely" following comments by host Kimmel during a show monologue that criticized President Donald Trump's MAGA movement for their reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing. Earlier Tuesday, Kimmel's show posted a photo to Instagram with the caption, "We are back full of love." Kimmel's personal account posted a photo of the host with the late screenwriter Norman Lear, who in 1981 founded People For The American Way, an organization dedicated to First Amendment rights. Ahead of the show's taping, protesters and supporters appeared outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood. "He should be off the air for another full week if not a full month to think about what he said," Perry Caravello, a YouTuber who was protesting Kimmel's return to air, told CNBC outside the studio Tuesday. Meanwhile, Gregg Donovan, who donned a black top hat and red blazer, carried a laminated sign welcoming Kimmel back. "I don't think free speech will ever really be threatened." Live audience members were ushered inside quickly. However, NBC News reported Kimmel didn't take the stage until closer to 6 p.m. PT. Kimmel's show is filmed at the El Capitan Entertainment Centre on Hollywood Boulevard, across from the iconic TCL Chinese Theater. The Hollywood Walk of Fame takes up the sidewalk outside Kimmel's venue, with names as diverse as Roy Disney, Eva Longoria, Kelly Ripa, Paul Rudd and Chris Pratt decorating the pavement. Kimmel's suspension came amid statements from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr that suggested ABC and its affiliate stations could be at risk of losing broadcast licenses over the comments. Local station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair both planned to preempt the show's return on Tuesday. Together, they own roughly 70 ABC affiliate stations. Kimmel, ABC and Disney are the latest targets of Trump's scrutiny of media companies, which has intensified during his second term marked by high-profile defamation lawsuits, the defunding of public broadcasters and regulatory interference from the FCC. — CNBC's Gabriel Cortes contributed reporting from Los Angeles We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is planning to raise as much as $20 billion in a deal that could put the crypto company's value on par with OpenAI, according to a report from Bloomberg News. The crypto company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a roughly 3% stake through a private placement, the report said, citing two individuals familiar with the matter. However, the deal could ultimately value Tether at around $500 billion, according to the report. That would mean the crypto giant's valuation would rival some of the world's biggest private companies, including SpaceX and OpenAI. OpenAI's fundraising round earlier this year valued the tech company at $300 billion. Tether, which was once accused of being a criminal's "go-to cryptocurrency," has been furthering its plans to return to the U.S. in recent months, given President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance. The company earlier this month named a CEO for its U.S. business and launched a new token for businesses and institutions in the U.S. called USAT, which will be regulated in the U.S. under the GENIUS Act. Stablecoin USD Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. dollar with a market cap that recently surpassed $172 billion. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The debut site in Abilene, Texas, about 180 miles west of Dallas, is up and running, filled with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and racks of Nvidia chips. The data center, which is being leased by Oracle, is one of the most notable physical landmarks to emerge from an unprecedented boom in demand for infrastructure to power AI. Over $2 trillion in AI infrastructure has been planned around the world, according to an HSBC estimate this week. In addition to the $500 billion Stargate project, the startup on Monday announced an equity investment deal with Nvidia that will add an estimated $500 billion worth of data centers in the coming years. Additionally, OpenAI contracts with smaller cloud companies for additional compute capacity and help operating its infrastructure. The campus has the potential to ultimately scale past a gigawatt of capacity, OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar told CNBC. That would be enough electricity to power about 750,000 U.S. homes. The data center construction plans are important enough that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang personally engaged in last-minute negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the weekend to get in on the action, CNBC reported earlier on Tuesday. "People are starting to recognize just the sheer scale that will be required," Friar said. "We're just getting going here in Abilene, Texas, but you'll see this all around the United States and beyond." "What we see today is a massive compute crunch," she said. OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is helping fund the project, announced on Tuesday five additional Stargate sites across Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and an additional unnamed site in the Midwest. Although Nvidia is putting in equity to jumpstart the project, Friar said the chipmaker will get paid for all graphics processing units (GPUs) that it provides as those chips get deployed. Friar said OpenAI will generate $13 billion in revenue this year, and that the company plans to help pay for the construction using its own cash flow and debt financing. The Stargate name will refer to all OpenAI infrastructure projects going forward, CNBC reported this week. Together with CoreWeave and other partners, the companies say they are ahead of schedule to meet their full 10-gigawatt commitment by the end of 2025. Friar told CNBC the shovels going into the ground today are laying foundations for compute that won't come online until 2026, starting with Nvidia next-generation Vera Rubin chips. "No one in the history of man built data centers this fast," Friar said, adding that the entire ecosystem has to work together to meet demand. Critics have questioned the circular funding behind Stargate -- OpenAI committing hundreds of billions of dollars to projects while suppliers like Nvidia are also investing directly into those same buildouts. Friar said history shows that technology booms require bold infrastructure bets. "When the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, 'Oh, we're over-building, there's too much,'" Friar said. OpenAI and Oracle first unveiled Stargate alongside President Donald Trump at the White House in January. Friar called Trump "the president of this AI era," pointing to Washington's role in framing the technology as both an economic engine and a national security priority. Oracle says the project will employ more than 6,000 construction workers daily and deliver nearly 1,700 long-term jobs. In a paper published Tuesday about OpenAI's infrastructure plans, the company wrote that its data center buildout could help reshape the American power grid with new technologies and help the U.S. exert global influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joe Rogan has had enough of the right celebrating Jimmy Kimmel's suspension. "I definitely don't think that the government should be involved ever in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say in a monologue," Rogan said during an episode of his influential podcast that was posted on Tuesday. Rogan's statement mirrored what Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican and Trump ally, said last week: Conservatives will come to regret setting a precedent where the federal government can bully media companies into censorship. Oh my God, you are crazy," Rogan said. While Rogan has emphasized he is "not a Republican," he has often expressed similar views to the GOP base, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rogan's podcast appeared to have been recorded before Disney announced on Monday that Kimmel and his late-night show would return Tuesday evening. Last week, ABC said it was suspending "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" A comedian himself, Rogan said part of Kimmel's final monologue before his suspension was hilarious, even if the framing around the shooting suspect's ideology was inaccurate. "We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them," Kimmel said during the September 15 show, before cutting to a clip of Trump discussing the construction of the new ballroom at the White House after a reporter asked him about Kirk. He was trying to knock on the MAGA people, but also set up a joke, which was good," Rogan said. Before ABC's suspension, Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting Company, which combined own roughly 25% of all local ABC stations, announced that they would not air Kimmel's show on their stations. Both groups have said that they will continue not to air Kimmel's show. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, had pressured local broadcasters to take action after Kimmel's comments angered some conservatives. In his comments, Carr threatened broadcasters' licenses, which the FCC holds jurisdiction over, and which are the lifeblood of local stations. While ABC does not have a license itself, Disney does own a small number of stations in some of the nation's biggest markets. Trump, who has yet to comment on Kimmel's return, was among those who celebrated ABC's suspension. The president also called for NBC to fire its two late-night hosts. "Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. Rogan said it was odd that the President of the United States would comment on such news. Correction: September 23 — This story has been updated to correct a quote attributed to Rogan about Kimmel's monologue. He said, "I think what he was trying to do was just set up a joke. He was trying to knock on the MAGA people, but also set up a joke, which was good.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google-owned YouTube on Tuesday said it will soon allow previously banned accounts to apply for reinstatement, rolling back a policy that had treated violations as permanent. "Today, YouTube's Community Guidelines allow for a wider range of content regarding Covid and elections integrity," Donovan wrote. YouTube wrote on X that it will be a limited pilot project open to a subset of creators as well as channels that were terminated under policies the company has since retired. YouTube also said its new reinstatement program will launch soon. Among channels previously banned under those rules were some associated with Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's not yet clear whether those channels will be reinstated. In 2021, YouTube said it would remove content that spread misinformation about all approved vaccines. Donovan wrote that during the pandemic, senior Biden administration officials pressed the company to remove certain Covid-related videos that did not technically violate YouTube's policies. In the letter, Donovan said this pressure was "unacceptable and wrong." YouTube ended its stand-alone Covid misinformation rules in December 2024, according to Donovan's letter. YouTube "will not empower third-party fact-checkers" to moderate content and will continue to enable "free expression" on the platform, Donovan wrote. While Donovan writes that YouTube has not used fact-checkers, the platform has produced programs that are meant to label context on videos. Similarly, Meta said in January that it had eliminated its fact-checking program on Facebook and Instagram. YouTube has a feature that will display information panels with links to independent fact checks under videos. The feature says it provides more context on videos across YouTube with information from third-party sources. In 2017, Google launched a fact-checking tool that would display labels on search and news results. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A roster of high-profile conservative voices could soon return to YouTube. YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, said in a letter published Tuesday that it intends to "provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform" whose accounts had been terminated over repeated violations of its COVID-19 and election integrity policies. The letter, written by Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan to Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said that YouTube "values conservative voices on its platform" and recognized their reach and role in civic discourse. The House Judiciary Committee published the letter on its website on Tuesday following its monthslong investigation into whether Biden White House officials pressured Big Tech platforms into censoring content. YouTube's about-face on previously banned accounts marks the latest shift in Big Tech content moderation. Prominent YouTube channels from conservative creators — including Dan Bongino, Steve Bannon, and Children's Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nonprofit activist group, as well as those from lesser-known creators — had been banned from YouTube for flouting its COVID-19 misinformation and election-related policies. Google's lawyer said in the letter published Tuesday that YouTube had ended all of its stand-alone, COVID-19-related policies by December 2024 and retired a separate policy regarding election integrity in 2023 to "allow for discussion of possible widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurring in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections." The letter didn't go into detail about how previously banned creators could resume their terminated channels or whether their content would be monetized and therefore eligible to get a cut of ad revenue. Google, via its @UpdatesFromYT X account, later clarified that it is planning a pilot program that would be available to a "subset of creators" who have been suspended from YouTube — in addition to accounts that were kicked off for violating COVID-19 or election-misinformation policies that have since been deprecated. "I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it," Zuckerberg wrote in the August 2024 letter. Google, too, said senior Biden administration officials, including White House officials, had pressed the company to remove content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that didn't violate YouTube's policies. "It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how" a company moderates content, Google wrote in the letter published Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Generative AI is steadily rewiring the DNA of work, radically transforming some jobs, while other professions remain relatively immune. Indeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index measures how much generative AI could change the way different skills or jobs are performed. Instead of measuring whether this technology will fully replace human workers, it examines how skills may be applied going forward and how human involvement with those skills and tasks could evolve. Problem-solving ability: The degree to which a skill requires cognitive reasoning, applied knowledge, and practical judgment, and how well generative AI can replicate this. Until general-purpose robotics advances significantly, these tasks remain mostly human-exclusive, according to Indeed. When Indeed ran an initial version of this analysis a year ago, no skills were rated as "very likely" to be fully replaced by GenAI. Today, 19 skills (0.7% of all skills analyzed) were assessed to be "very likely" to be fully replaced by GenAI, still small in absolute terms, but a significant signal of progress. "GenAI has gotten (and continues to get) smarter," Annina Hering, senior economist at Indeed's Hiring Lab, and Arcenis Rojas, a data scientist at the lab, wrote. "As long as physical execution is not required — an admittedly big caveat — and GenAI capabilities continue to grow, more skills are likely to cross the threshold into realistic automation as work continues to evolve." Meanwhile, software development is most likely to be transformed by generative AI. Eighty-one percent of the skills involved in these jobs will experience a hybrid transformation in which GenAI leads and humans provide oversight, according to Indeed's index. Technical and information-heavy roles will feel the brunt of automation, while jobs grounded in physical presence and human touch will remain mostly shielded. For businesses, that means redesigning workflows and training pipelines. For workers, it means leaning into uniquely human strengths, such as physical dexterity, informed oversight, and empathy, that AI still can't replicate well.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Philanthropist Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will contribute $912 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, while warning that global health funding cuts could disproportionately affect Africa. Speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, Gates noted the risks facing African children. “The Goalkeepers event celebrates and seeks to accelerate progress on United Nations global development goals set for 2030, including improving health and ending poverty,” Gates said. “I am not capable of making up what the government cuts, and I don't want to create an illusion of that.” he added. Founded in 2000 by Gates and his ex-wife, the foundation is one of the largest funders of global health initiatives worldwide. Its work focuses on ending preventable deaths of mothers and babies, tackling infectious diseases, and lifting millions out of poverty. In countries like Ethiopia, its initiatives to expand vaccination coverage and improve maternal healthcare have been credited with significantly reducing child and maternal mortality rates. However, challenges remain in sustaining progress across the globe. Experts warn that this decline could put at risk the progress that has halved child mortality since 2000, saving five million lives each year. Bill Gates said maintaining funding for the Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, prioritising primary healthcare, and rolling out innovations like the long-acting HIV prevention drug lenacapavir could save additional lives. “What's happening to the health of the world's children is worse than most people realize, but our long-term prospects are better than most can imagine,” Gates added. According to the World Health Organization, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for nearly 70 percent of all people living with HIV worldwide, and the region records the highest rates of tuberculosis infection and death.
