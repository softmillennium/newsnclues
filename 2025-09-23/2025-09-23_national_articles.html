                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Monday, Sept. 22, 2025, in Washington, as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. listens. Nine times in all, Trump said expectant mothers should suffer through their discomfort instead of reaching for acetaminophen — or paracetamol in countries outside the U.S. — to cure their fevers or headaches, despite the drug being one of the few painkillers that pregnant women are allowed to take. What many women and experts heard was the latest example of a man telling women how much physical pain they should endure — and an age-old effort to blame mothers for their babies' autism. “His use of ‘tough it out' really was infuriating because it dismissed women's pain and the real danger that exists with fever and miscarriage during pregnancy,” said women's rights advocate and social media influencer Amanda Tietz, a 46-year-old mom of three in Wisconsin, in an email. Others saw a man opining — again, without evidence that maternal use of Tylenol causes autism or ADHD in children — on mothers, children with disabilities and their health at a time when studies show pain suffered by women is frequently dismissed. Women's health and their autonomy are especially fraught issues in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in 2022 to strip away constitutional protections for abortion, a deeply personal change for Americans nearly a half century after Roe v. Wade. “Yesterday 5 powerful men stood together in the WH and shamed: Pregnant women, told to ‘tough it out' through pain; Moms of autistic kids, blamed for their child's condition; Autistic people, called broken & in need of fixing,” Trump's former surgeon general, Jerome Adams, posted on social media. Dr. Nicole B. Saphier of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said pregnant women generally are advised to take acetaminophen only under medical supervision, when necessary and at the lowest effective dose. But equally important — and missing from Trump's message — was that untreated fever or severe pain can also pose serious risks to mothers and babies, she said. “For decades, women have endured a paternalistic tone in medicine. We've moved past dismissing symptoms as ‘hysteria,'” Saphier, who also is a Fox News medical contributor, wrote in an email. “The President's recent comments on Tylenol in pregnancy are a prime example. Trump is not known for a delicate touch around policy where women are concerned. Ahead of the 2016 election, he erupted over tough questioning by Fox News' Megyn Kelly, later telling CNN: “You can see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” He's got a special playbook for female opponents that includes put-downs about their appearance, their emotional stability and their intelligence. There's a long history of men holding forth, sometimes incorrectly, about women's reproductive health. Former Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin sank his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign with remarks about what constituted “legitimate rape.” Others have erred by suggesting publicly and falsely that rape victims can't get pregnant. History offers a long list of men making medical policy for women based on the beliefs of their time — and, some say, suspicion about the power of women to create and shape their unborn babies. A nearly half-century-old theory, long discredited, held that “refrigerator mothers” — cold or distant figures — were responsible for their children's autism. “He basically said, if you can't take the pain, if you can't deal with the fever, then it's your fault.” Trump's “tough it out” advice is familiar to Mary E. Fissell, a professor of medical history with Johns Hopkins University. “It's the idea that what a pregnant woman desires or feels or imagines will shape the form of her unborn child,” said Fissell, who focuses on 17th- and 18th-century medical history. “But sometimes in life or a lot of other things, you have to tough it out also.”</p>

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons discusses efforts to stop illegal immigration on 'The Ingraham Angle.' U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is targeting an illegal alien who is charged with strangling his infant sister with a power cord, leaving the baby in critical condition. In a statement Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had lodged a detainer against Alvaro Mejia-Ayala, a 21-year-old Salvadoran national, after he was arrested for strangulation of an infant by police in Leesburg, Virginia. According to the Leesburg Police Department, police responded to a report of an infant not breathing on the morning of Sept. 17. Local Fox affiliate Fox 5 reported that the infant was found unresponsive with a white charging cable around her neck.

(Salwan Georges/The Washington Post via Getty Images and DHS) According to DHS, the baby is in critical condition. A spokesperson for the agency told Fox News Digital that Mejia-Ayala entered the U.S. as part of a family unit from El Salvador during the Obama administration in 2016. DHS also said that Mejia-Ayala was previously arrested by police for reckless driving in 2024, but he was released "before ICE could even lodge a detainer." U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents look over lists of names and their hearing times and locations inside the Federal Plaza courthouse before making arrests on June 27, 2025, in New York. The Virginia General District Court online database says that Mejia-Ayala pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless driving in February 2024. The database also lists several other charges against Mejia-Ayala, including driving without a license in 2023 and failure to display license plates in 2024 and 2025. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin commented on the case, saying that "ICE lodged an immigration detainer to ensure this heinous criminal is not released on U.S. This barbarism has no place in the U.S.," said McLaughlin. "President Trump and Secretary Noem have been clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States." In a separate message posted to X, McLaughlin wrote, "Pray for this precious baby girl. In another X post, Homeland Security called Mejia-Ayala a "monster" and the case an example of "PURE EVIL." "This criminal illegal alien STRANGLED AN INFANT with a charging cable," DHS wrote, adding, "President Trump and @Sec_Noem will not allow this barbarism in America." A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment. Fox News Digital also reached out to Obama spokespeople but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Law enforcement personnel investigate after the Department of Homeland Security said an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a man in the Franklin Park suburb of Chicago on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. Law enforcement personnel investigate after the Department of Homeland Security said an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot a man in the Franklin Park suburb of Chicago on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. CHICAGO (AP) — Police body camera footage released Tuesday shows a federal immigration agent who fatally shot a Mexican immigrant describing his own injuries during a vehicle pursuit as “nothing major,” a contrast from the Trump administration's characterization of events in suburban Chicago earlier this month. The Department of Homeland Security has said the officer was “seriously injured” by Silverio Villegas González, who allegedly tried to evade arrest after agents pulled over his car in Franklin Park. Nearly three hours of video and audio clips obtained by The Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on the shooting that has escalated tensions amid a federal immigration crackdown in the country's third-largest city. DHS said Villegas González drove his car at officers, dragging one of them “a significant distance,” leaving the officer to “fear for his life.” The officer then opened fire. Federal officials have said their officers weren't wearing body cameras at the time. Franklin Park police footage shows local officers arriving at the roadside where a car had crashed into a cargo truck in Franklin Park, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) west of Chicago. Two ICE agents attempt to explain to the police officer what had happened moments after an agent shot and killed Villegas González, “He tried to run us over,” an ICE agent says. “I got dragged a little bit,” said the injured agent, who can be seen walking and talking while wearing ripped jeans with blood on them. The videos show the first agent saying his partner had suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands” while speaking over a radio. “Nothing major,” the injured officer says while putting his arms up to shrug off concerns. Federal officials had previously said the agent suffered “multiple” and “serious injuries.” DHS, which has not identified either agent, said the injured officer who fired his weapon has been a member of ICE since 2021 and served in the military. DHS said it was the officer's first time firing his weapon in a “use of force incident.” “His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited Chicago for an immigration operation last week, posted on X last week. He declined further comment, saying there is an open investigation. ICE operations in Chicago, where federal officials have arrested more than 550 people, have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Villegas González, who worked as a cook, had just dropped off one of his children at day care the morning of the shooting in the close-knit and largely Hispanic suburb of roughly 18,000 people. DHS said he had a history of reckless driving and did not have legal permission to live in the U.S. The day care's director described him as a good father while many Franklin Park residents came to vigils and remembered him as a kind family man.

This photo provided by the U.S. Secret Service, in New York, Monday, Sept. 22, 2025, shows part of a wall of SIM boxes that were seized by the agency. NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Secret Service has found and is quietly dismantling a massive network of “SIM farms” across the New York area just as world leaders gather for meetings at the United Nations. Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the SIM farm uncovered by the Secret Service just ahead of the UN General Assembly and its nefarious undertones. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls. While initially developed for legitimate purposes, such as low cost international calling, the technology has become a cornerstone of organized fraud targeting mass audiences — phishing texts and scam calls. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. The investigation is ongoing, but McCool said forensic analysts currently believe the system could have been used to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations. MobileX, the producer of some of the SIM cards recovered in the raids, said they are prepared to cooperate with authorities in their investigation. “Like all wireless providers, we occasionally see bad actors attempt to misuse our services,” CEO Peter Adderton said in a statement. Anthony J. Ferrante, the global head of the cybersecurity practice at FTI, an international consulting firm, said the photos show a very sophisticated and established SIM farm that could be used for any number of nefarious activities, including the potential to overwhelm cellular networks with millions of calls in just a few minutes. “So if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,” Ferrante said in an interview. He also notes that it's possible the system could be used for surveillance operations, given its proximity to the United Nations, “potentially that equipment could be used to either intercept communications, eavesdrop on communications, or actually, clone devices, as well.” “The masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,” he said. “It's a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.”</p>

This rendering shows what a newly discovered dinosaur called Joaquinraptor casali may have looked like, with the bones that were uncovered in blue. This undated photo provided by Marcelo Luna shows an aerial view of the site where bones belonging to a new kind of dinosaur with big claws were found in Chubut, Argentina. NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone. The new find was possibly 23 feet (7 meters) long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years. But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline — mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete. AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the discovery of a new dinosaur from Argentina that may have used its long arms and claws to capture prey. In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhué Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species. This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali “fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,” Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago — close to the time dinosaurs went extinct — and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it. The front leg bone pressed against its jaws — belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles — could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains. Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.</p>

War Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed Pentagon employees, promising to bring accountability for the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 and ripped the notion that 'our diversity is our strength.' The Department of War on Tuesday announced Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to terminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS), a civilian advisory group that provides recommendations on policies affecting women in the U.S. Armed Forces. Department of War press secretary Kingsley Wilson made the announcement on X, calling the committee "divisive." "The Committee is focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness, while Secretary [Pete] Hegseth has focused on advancing uniform, sex-neutral standards across the Department," Wilson wrote in the post. The DACOWITS website notes it focuses on recruitment, retention, employment, integration, well-being and treatment of service women. Committee members gather data through briefings, written responses, expert input and direct interactions with service member focus groups during installation visits. While 17.7% of U.S. military service members are women, the Department of War's 2023 demographics report called for the Marine Corps to fully integrate recruit training at the platoon level and to use mixed-gender drill instructor teams. Two female soldiers walk back after checking their targets at a qualification range at Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, March 9, 2014. As of 2013, women can serve in the combat arms. As one of the oldest War Department advisory committees, the DACOWITS claims its recommendations have "historically been instrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to military women," according to the site. Other less controversial recommendations in the committee's 2023 report included ensuring the timely distribution of female-specific aviation safety gear, standardizing maternity leave, updating maternity uniforms for function and professionalism and distinguishing between sexual harassment and gender-based discriminatory harassment. Since 1951, the committee said it has submitted more than 1,100 recommendations to the Secretary of War, with about 94% full or partial adoption by the department, as of 2025. "Its agenda — which promotes gender quotas, women in combat roles, and gender-integrated basic training — weakens the basic purpose of the military: to fight and win wars," Nancy M. Pfotenhauer, president at the time of the Independent Women's Forum, wrote in a 2002 statement. The Department of War did not immediately provide additional comment to Fox News Digital.

FIRST ON FOX: A conservative climate policy group is urging House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to subpoena records from the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project as part of an ongoing probe into the influence of climate advocacy groups in climate policy litigation. Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, a conservative pro-U.S. energy production policy group, wrote a letter to Jordan last week pointing to evidence from a Sept. 12 Multnomah County v. ExxonMobil et al. court filing that he says suggests "covert coordination and judicial manipulation." According to Isaac's letter to Jordan, the court filing submitted by Chevron Corporation earlier this month reveals that "one of the plaintiffs' lead attorneys, Roger Worthington, had undisclosed involvement in at least two so-called scientific studies that the county is presenting as independent, peer-reviewed evidence." Rep. Jim Jordan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, speaks to reporters at the Longworth House Office Building on Oct. 13, 2023, in Washington. One of those studies "acknowledged funding from the Climate Judiciary Project in a draft version, but that disclosure was inexplicably removed from the final publication," Isaac said in the letter. Earlier drafts of the study, labeled "DO NOT DISTRIBUTE," were found on Worthington's law firm website, the letter revealed. The website also included a "pre-publication draft of a CJP judicial training module" with internal editorial comments, according to the letter. Isaac told Jordan this mark-up raises "serious questions about how and why a plaintiffs' attorney had early access to, and possibly editorial influence over, materials being presented to state and federal judges as ‘neutral' science." Attribution science seeks to measure how much human-caused climate change is responsible for certain extreme weather events, per Science News Explores' definition. "The Environmental Law Institute has claimed neutrality, yet documents suggest coordination with plaintiffs' counsel who stand to profit from the outcomes," Isaac told Fox News Digital. Congress is right to dig deeper, and the American Energy Institute is proud to support that effort." Isaac is requesting that Jordan formally request "communications, draft documents, funding agreements, and internal editorial notes related to the scientific studies and CJP curriculum." While commending Jordan's leadership, Isaac said, "Judges and the public deserve to know whether the courtroom is being quietly shaped by coordinated climate advocacy posing as neutral expertise." Climate protesters take part in an Earth Day rally against fossil fuels on April 22, 2022. "Does ELI regularly seek input from plaintiffs' attorneys on its judicial education modules?" "ELI did not fund the Nature study, and the Climate Judiciary Project has not coordinated with Mr. Worthington," Environmental Law Institute spokesman Nick Collins told Fox News Digital in a statement. "CJP does not participate in or provide support for litigation," Collins added. "Rather, CJP provides evidence-based continuing education to judges about climate science and how it arises in the law. Our curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards." When 23 Republican state attorneys general sent a letter last month to Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee Zeldin calling on him to cancel funding to the Environmental Law Institute, Collins told Fox News Digital that the Climate Judiciary Project's projects are far from "radical." "The programs in which the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) participates are no different than other judicial education programs, providing evidence-based training on legal and scientific topics that judges voluntarily choose to attend," Collins said. Fox News Digital has reached out to Jordan and Worthington for comment on the letter but did not immediately hear back. Fox News Digital's Emma Colton contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ryan Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after a jury found him guilty on all counts for attempting to kill President Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign season at his Florida golf course. Court marshals tackled him and he was taken from the room in handcuffs. Jury deliberations lasted a few hours on Tuesday. For his most serious charge, attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Routh, a Hawaii resident, was arrested after a Secret Service agent spotted him hiding in the shrubbery near the fifth hole of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and, according to prosecutors, waiting for Trump to get into his line of fire. The trial had a number of unusual elements to it. Judge Aileen M. Cannon cut off Routh's opening statement for being irrelevant. Routh called just three witnesses to the stand, which led the trial to be short, lasting just 12 days, for such serious charges. Following his arrest, public records and interviews from people who knew him suggested that Routh, a former supporter of Trump, had become increasingly concerned about Russia's war in Ukraine and saw himself as an influential figure. “Make no mistake: The defendant was going to kill Donald Trump,” Christopher Browne, one of the federal prosecutors, said during his closing argument. Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement said “this attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself. “Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life. This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform. FBI Director Kash Patel also praised the conviction, writing, “Proud of the FBI and our partners for working together to deliver justice against Ryan Routh, the individual who attempted to assassinate President Trump. We have a lot more work to do to crack down on political violence and make sure those who engage in this heinous behavior are off the streets and behind bars.”</p>

Peri Pourier, who had been a Democrat, announced Monday that she switched her voter registration to Republican. "I have formally changed my voter registration from Democrat to Republican. My name will now appear with an (R) designation," she said in a statement. The move leaves just five Democrats in the Mount Rushmore State's House, compared to a whopping 65 Republicans. "The core tenets of the Republican Party, decentralized government, self-determination, economic prosperity, lower energy costs, and strong public safety align with the principle of tribal sovereignty," she noted. Democratic and Republican parties' logos on a phone screen and American flag displayed on a laptop screen are seen in this multiple exposure illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland, on Aug. 25, 2022. "By contrast, well-intentioned Democratic reforms have too often undermined sovereignty. Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 forced a one-size-fits-all model of governance that disregarded traditional systems and tied federal funding to this imposed framework. " "What was presented as empowerment ultimately diminished nationhood, reinforced federal control and depilating [sic] any hope of self-sufficiency. The long-term consequences of such federal policy failures are still felt on the Pine Ridge reservation today," she asserted.

The H-1B program is meant to help American employers hire foreign workers with rare intellectual abilities. It aims to ensure that the US “knowledge economy” is not undermined by shortfalls of highly skilled labor. Yet some companies have used the program to essentially replace US workers with immigrants — less because the latter boast exceptional skills than because they have lower wage expectations. Trump's $100,000 fee is ostensibly meant to fix this problem. In theory, employers won't pay that hefty charge to hire a garden-variety foreign coder over an American one. Rather, a company would only be willing to foot that bill for extraordinary foreign talent. Trump's exorbitant fee would undermine American scientific research, technological progress, and economic growth. And this would translate into lower wages for American workers in the long term. The problems with H-1B visas mostly stem from how they're allocated. Demand for such visas far outstrips their supply: In 2023, 446,000 people sought an H-1B visa, but America only provides 85,000 of them each year (20,000 of which are reserved for workers who have attained a master's degree or higher from a US institution of higher education). Whether a given worker secures an H-1B visa is left largely to chance. This process actually favors low-wage employers seeking to hire workers with middling abilities. If you're an AI firm that's looking to hire one particular machine learning engineer who holds superlative skills, you will probably lose the H-1B lottery. After all, any individual applicant has a low chance of getting selected. On the other hand, if you're an outsourcing company that's looking to hire lots of foreign workers with basic IT skills, your odds of winning the lottery are quite good. Such companies don't need any specific candidate, only a large number of interchangeable laborers. So, they can sponsor many more workers than they actually need and then take whichever ones happen to make it through the filter. By flooding the lottery in this way, IT staffing and outsourcing firms secured 40 percent of all H-1B visas in 2023, according to a Bloomberg investigation. To secure an H-1B visa, companies must pledge that they will pay their applicant at least as much as they currently pay similar American employees. A company, therefore, cannot lay off its existing IT workforce and then hire lower-wage H-1B workers in their place. Yet a firm can eliminate its IT department — and then delegate those functions to an outsourcing company, which is largely staffed by H-1B workers. In this way, companies can use the H-1B program to effectively replace domestic workers. Trump's $100,000 application fee constitutes one answer to the H-1B program's allocation problem. Outsourcing companies aren't going to shell out that kind of money for entry-level IT specialists. Nevertheless, Trump's fee entails far greater costs than benefits. Companies can often replace their American tech support staff with remote workers abroad. And as the Economist notes, top outsourcing companies responded to the last crackdown on their H-1B access by shifting their hiring towards India. Meanwhile, AI is enabling the rapid automation of many IT functions. If Trump's policy would do relatively little to insulate American IT workers from competition, it would do a great deal to undermine economic growth. For one thing, it's not clear that private sector employers would be willing to sponsor 85,000 visas a year, at the price of $100,000 per application. More critically, the statutory cap on H-1B visas does not apply to many universities and nonprofits. Scientific research often generates large economic and social benefits in the long term, but scant profits in the short run. Thus, in many cases, universities will not be able to finance guest workers' applications, even if their labor is highly valuable to the United States. At the very least, many schools and smaller American companies would struggle to offer foreign workers competitive wages, if they were forced to eat $100,000 on each hire: A European university that has a $350,000 budget for a research position could actually offer a higher salary than an American university with a $400,000 for an analogous position, because the latter school would need to spend $100,000 just to get its applicant into the country. American science is already reeling from the Trump administration's cuts to NIH grants and revocation of student visas. From this perspective, the priority must be improving American workers' wages and job opportunities. If US schools can't find enough native-born scientists to staff their labs, then they should do a better job of educating their American students. Even in its current, dysfunctional form, the H-1B visa program appears to boost wages and employment opportunities for American workers. There's reason to think this same pattern holds at the national level — that companies are more likely to invest in countries that have lots of highly skilled labor. This effectively transfers dollars out of the US economy and into foreign ones. The H-1B visa program is falling short of its official objectives: It leaves many cutting-edge firms unable to hire top foreign talent, and undermines the bargaining power of some native-born workers. But there are better ways to address these issues than Trump's $100,000 fee. In this way, it is of a piece with Trump's broader agenda.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump criticized European allies in an address before the United Nations, warning them that mass migration will lead to their destruction. “In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime, and deplete our social safety net.” “[Europe has] been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Trump drew particular attention to London, where he just had a state visit with King Charles III. Trump went on to cite 2024 statistics from the Council of Europe that found that the majority of inmates in Germany, Austria, Greece, and Switzerland were from foreign countries. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe,” Trump said, ultimately warning, “It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. I'm really good at this stuff — your countries are going to hell.” Turning his attention to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump expressed discontent with Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued refusal to participate in meaningful ceasefire negotiations. He pointed a finger at China and India as the “primary funders of the ongoing war” for their uninterrupted purchase of Russian oil. “But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures,” he warned. However, the EU has continued to purchase key resources from Russia, including oil, natural gas, steel, and fertilizer, due to insufficient supply trains from alternative sources. During his speech, Trump announced that he would meet with European leaders on the sidelines of the conference to discuss minimizing this reliance and applying further pressure on Moscow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term,” Trump told the U.N.'s annual leaders summit on Tuesday. “For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a strongly worded letter and never follow that letter up,” he said. Trump escalated his criticism, claiming that not only did he not receive a phone call from the U.N. as he tried to negotiate peace deals, but that the organization “is actually creating new problems,” particularly regarding immigration. Trump, who also said, “Everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize,” acknowledged the foreign policy challenges posed by the likes of Israel, Gaza, Russia, and Ukraine, in addition to Iran and Venezuela. Of Iran, Trump repeated that his position “is very simple: the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon.” Then, of Israel and Hamas, Trump reiterated that the terrorist organization should reduce its demands and instead release its remaining hostages “now.” Regarding Russia and Ukraine, Trump criticized China and India as “the primary funders” of the war because they continue to rely on Russian energy before alleging that NATO allies are “funding the war against themselves” through similar oil purchases. “In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. Trump had a particularly stark warning for Europe, again regarding immigration, asserting London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for example, wanted to introduce Sharia law toi his city to murmurs from the audience. “It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. I'm really good at this stuff — your countries are going to hell.” “This I take as an evidence that the U.S. is ready to engage with its closest ally. There are things we [have] already done like a trade deal. There are things where the [European Union] moved much faster on support for Ukraine and sanctions.” “The potential for peace with this institution is so great. During his address, before he scrutinized climate change and renewable energy policies as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” Trump announced that his administration would “lead an international effort to enforce [the] Biological Weapons Convention, which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an [artificial intelligence] verification system that everyone can trust.” And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. At the start of the address, Trump seemed to enjoy a warm welcome, mentioning that the teleprompter was not working for his remarks as first lady Melania Trump, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, newly confirmed U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz, and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff watched on. During his own address to the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres bemoaned decreases in foreign aid funding as “wreaking havoc” on advancements made since the U.N. was established 80 years ago. “They are a death sentence for many,” he said. We have the solutions, but we are siphoning off the fuel that would make it possible to make progress. We need to reform the international financial architecture so it drives development for all.” For American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer, Trump “undermined his message by going off script for extended moments that distracted the listener and blurred what precisely he wanted the U.N. and the assembled governments to do to support to America's priorities and respond to its concerns.” “This was not a wasted opportunity, but one that could have been better utilized,” he told the Washington Examiner. Some observers waved to Trump, with the president responding with fist pumps after having to walk up the escalator that was not working. Trump is expected to with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after his address and take part in a multilateral sit-down with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan. “After these important meetings, the president will attend a reception tomorrow night with more than 100 world leaders before returning to Washington, D.C.,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor who chairs the Senate health committee, is calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to release any evidence tying acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism, noting that “the preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.” HHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim. “The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy. Trump announced Monday that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe. Experts say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science showing a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled. Trump links autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy, despite decades of evidence it's safe “They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” such as to treat fever, “if you can't tough it out,” Trump said, speaking from the White House alongside US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others. The senator, however, has before pushed back on Kennedy's claims about vaccines and as recently as last week, would not say whether he would vote to confirm Kennedy if given the choice now. “I am steadfastly not judging until we have a chance to hear the secretary's perspective,” he told reporters, after he led a hearing where the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, testified about her clashes with the health secretary. Cassidy is up for reelection in 2026, and given his previous vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection after January 6, 2021, the Louisiana senator will be walking a political tightrope to keep the president from endorsing any of his primary opponents. He has been careful to not directly criticize the president or Kennedy, despite expressing concern at some CDC and HHS actions. Most recently, Cassidy has warned that the new federal vaccine advisory committee's proposal to change recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccination would put children at risk. The panel ultimately delayed its vote on that proposal. Cassidy, a liver doctor, has long advocated for greater access to the vaccine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Tuesday canceled a sit-down with Democratic congressional leaders less than 24 hours after a meeting was confirmed on the looming government shutdown. The president said that after reviewing the “unserious and ridiculous” demands from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), he determined no meeting could “possibly be productive.” Less than a day later, the president changed his mind, telling Jeffries and Schumer that the “ball is in your court” and they “must do their job.” Historically, any shutdown reflects badly on the party in power, but Republicans have been quick to argue that they are advocating a short-term spending deal that maintains Biden administration spending levels and that Democrats want unnecessary additions such as an extension of Obamacare subsidies. Jeffries said in a post to X that Trump “Always Chickens Out.” “Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,” Jeffries said. Schumer said in a statement, “Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there. House lawmakers passed a short-term spending deal on Friday and sent it over to the Senate, but that proposal and an alternative from Democrats both failed on the floor. Schumer and Jeffries have been in lockstep when it comes to a blockade, arguing they won't vote for it unless there are healthcare concessions. This puts the Senate at a standstill, as 60 votes are required to break the filibuster, and Republicans do not reach that number with just their own members.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Backlash has been swift and forceful as other parts of the world woke up to US President Donald Trump's comments blaming – without solid evidence – acetaminophen and certain vaccines for autism in children. “Don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don't take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists,” UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a televised interview on Tuesday. It comes after Trump announced Monday the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol – the brand name for acetaminophen, known in most countries as paracetamol – during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism.” Despite decades of evidence that it is safe, Trump suggested that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy “if you can't tough it out.” “Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,” Steffen Thirstrup, chief medical officer of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said in a statement. “Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.” Experts also say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science on a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism. The authors recommended judicious acetaminophen use, under medical guidance. Meanwhile, a 2024 peer-reviewed Swedish study published in the medical journal JAMA found no link between acetaminophen taken in pregnancy and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders. None.” He encouraged the British public to “follow the science,” especially at a time when “you've got kids in this country now dying of measles, whooping cough, kids not taking the RSV vaccine, when those respiratory diseases can be life-threatening in our children.” The vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) has long been a target of misinformation and alarm, including by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, following discredited research linking it to autism by a British doctor who has since been barred from practicing medicine. Kennedy publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine amid this year's outbreak that led to three deaths and nearly 200 hospitalizations across the US, but also touted unconventional therapies. Other common pain relief options like ibuprofen or regular-dose aspirin can increase the risk of serious pregnancy complications, according to experts. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: “Paracetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed. Pregnant women should continue to follow existing NHS (National Health Service) guidance and speak to their healthcare professional if they have questions about any medication during pregnancy.” Hepatitis B vaccines used in the UK have a well-established safety profile and play a vital role in protecting infants from serious illness,” Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement that vaccination campaigns, which have saved more than 150 million lives in the past 50 years, are being threatened by misinformation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The first to take place under the British Fashion Council's new CEO Laura Weir, who has made her message clear: “fashion matters.” In her opening speech on Friday, Weir doubled down on her ambition to make London “a sensational showcase of creative fashion design talent” by reducing the barriers to entry and opening the schedule to “new energy, new thinking and new ideas.” That includes participation from new and returning brands, but also a wider breadth of international editors and buyers to platform the UK capital on the global stage. Backstage, designers both new and established were cautiously optimistic at the promises being made. Already, there are signs that the city is being taken more seriously. “We know as an industry that there is often a lapse of respect for fashion and the contribution it brings to the UK,” Weir said. Let us show them what only London can do.” Indeed, there were blockbuster moments from the likes of Burberry — who closed out the week's schedule with a star-studded show at Kensington Palace Gardens, attended by Elton John, Olivia Dean and Vanessa Williams — as well as H&M (the latter opened the week with a celebrity-filled catwalk walked by Romeo Beckham and with a performance from “Messy” singer Lola Young). But smaller designers also gave plenty to talk about — from noteworthy milestones, including the various anniversaries of Roksanda, Harris Reed, Ashish and Fashion East (the incubator that launched Jonathan Anderson's career), to the innovation from newcomers including Oscar Ouyang, Maximilian Raynor and Johanna Parv. “It really feels like there's a renewed sense of energy in London right now,” said Daniel Fletcher, who designs for his namesake label as well as the Chinese brand Mithridate. Patrick McDowell, a Liverpudlian designer based in London, staged his first catwalk since winning the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Award for Design in May. Fletcher, who presented his second collection for Mithridate, said he was inspired by two British archetypes: the country folk and the town dwellers. His fusion of these two “very different worlds” manifested in pink sequined party dresses layered over Oxford shirts and tall riding boots paired with sparkly underwear. “It's a clash that shouldn't really work, but somehow does,” he told CNN backstage. But a few renegades creatively defected across the pond, looking instead at America for inspiration. The eponymous designer Yuhan Wang was inspired by David Lynch's “Mullholland Drive” (2001), while the cult British-Bulgarian brand Chopova Lowena created an entire cheer squad with tinsel hair extensions and rhinestone eyeliner. Inspired by the community and culture that comes with cheerleading, there were letterman jackets, T-shirts that read “Popular” in varsity typeface, and knitted hoodies emblazoned with pom-pom yielding models, who walked to the tune of AC/DC's “Thunderstruck,” which has become synonymous with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders following their hit Netflix show. Streetwear, a pillar of UK dressing for several decades, was made new again by a slew of designers redefining urban style. Yaku Stapleton, founder of YAKU, designed hoodies, capes and camouflage pants that looked like they were inspired by role-playing games (RPG). His models could have been downloaded from Zelda, with cargo pants that held axes and sword sheaths remade in fabric. Lueder's take on modern medieval feudalism, with knitted hoods and 3D-printed horned clogs, was inspired by the historical summer camps designer Marie Lueder went to as a child, where she role-played periods in history (costumes and all) from 300 BC to the end of the 15th century. This time, however, there were bomber jackets, mesh shirts and Bermuda shorts — the kind of everyday clothing you'd see on the street, though some items, such as a cap and body vest, were aerated for old times' sake. Elsewhere, Johanna Parv continued to design for “the woman who is living in the city right now,” she told CNN, particularly “brave” cyclists, with nylon dresses, skirts and rain jackets that can be adjusted for whether one is commuting, working, partying or exercising. Panniers — undergarments that sit on the hips to expand the silhouette outwards — have also been seen on recent red carpets. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this summer, Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher turned heads when she stepped out in a Dior haute couture gown complete with a protruding bustle. No surprise, then, that voluminous hips were a seasonal feature on the runway. See the Chinese-Irish designer Simone Rocha whose dresses and skirts had wired crinolines on show, rather than hidden underneath. Backstage, Rocha shared her inspiration — a “disgruntled debutante” — and the desire to push herself by working with tried-and-tested materials albeit in new ways. She also nodded to her heritage with pops of red, an auspicious color in Chinese culture. At Dilara Findikoglu, models looked like ladies in waiting that had risen from the dead; wearing antiquated corsetry that was dirtied and torn. Sharp hip bones jutted out above low-slung lace-up leather pants, at times accentuated further by draped body chains. Findikogulu's uncompromising and subversive vision, along with her meticulous understanding of the female body, has made her one of London Fashion Week's hottest tickets. Backstage, Oscar Ouyang said the word that summarized his debut show was “reinvention”. Fresh-faced models wore sprigs of down in their hair, like the lost boys in “Peter Pan.” The Beijing-born designer, who studied a MA course in knitwear at Central Saint Martins, didn't stop there: He used a combination of machine and hand-knit techniques to create cartoon-sh proportioned T-shirts and braided bags and tunics out of straw. Dujancourt's hauntingly beautiful gowns were a mixture of chunky Argyle knit, delicate lace and frothy tulle ruffle — but the sum was greater than its parts. “I discovered all those techniques from my grandmother,” Dujancourt told CNN after the show. Elsewhere, rising designers Paolo Carzana and Susan Fang continued to challenge material boundaries, resulting in garments that are thoughtfully designed, adaptable and aesthetically unique. Carzana's selling point is using repurposed materials and vegetable dyes, which encourages a more considered approach to clothes (not to mention, unexpected color pairings like violet with burnt orange). But that spirit of a London woman is really reflected in the collection.” We obviously reference that… But it's always about reinventing your ideas.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Palestinian statehood has never had so much international support — or seemed less attainable. On Sunday, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia confirmed that they now recognize Palestine as an independent state, following France, which announced its intention to do so last July and formalized it with a speech by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, and Malta, among others, have announced plans to recognize Palestine as well. Monday's meeting followed the passage, on September 12, of a UN General Assembly resolution now being referred to as the “New York declaration,” outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution. “Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at Monday's meeting. In Washington, a new resolution cosponsored by eight senators calls on President Donald Trump to recognize Palestinian statehood. Still, even though none of those senators are Republicans, and the resolution is unlikely to pass, the level of support for a measure that calls for unilateral recognition is an indication of how politics on this issue have shifted in the United States. Not that any of this is swaying the Israeli government. This place is ours,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared earlier this month at a ceremony announcing Israel's expansion of the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim. In fact, his government is weighing formally annexing parts of the West Bank in retaliation for the wave of recognition by Western governments. It also raises the possibility that the world may be coming to consensus on Palestinian statehood just as it slips out of reach as a realistic possibility. Since former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared independence in 1988, some 145 countries have recognized Palestine, including the recent additions, according to a tally by Agence France Presse. That includes nearly all of Africa, Latin America, and the former Communist bloc. Most of those who do not recognize it are close US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Palestine currently has “permanent observer status” at the UN, meaning it can participate in debates, but not vote on resolutions in the main UN bodies. The Security Council has to approve new members and all five permanent members have veto power, so membership is not on the table for now. In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Macron said that “recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has charged that France's move is a “reckless decision that only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace.” Macron countered that in fact it would “isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians” and provide an alternative political vision. Skepticism about the recognition declarations has come not just from supporters of Israel, but also from its critics, who see recognition as a means for governments to deflect criticism over their failure to hold Israel to account for the carnage in Gaza. “This is worse than political theater,” said Tamara Kharroub, deputy executive director of the Arab Center in Washington, DC. “It's a smokescreen to mask their decades-long failure to implement this very two-state solution and to end Israel's occupation and apartheid, and their complicity in the genocide that has been taking place in Gaza for the past two years.” He added that the leaders of these countries “felt they had to make a declaration, but there isn't really a plan to go with it. The only way that you can really back this up would be for these countries and the wider UN membership to agree to some sort of framework for sanctions against Israel. Meanwhile on the ground in Israel and occupied territories, a two-state solution looks farther off than ever. Only 21 percent of Israelis believe their country can coexist peacefully with a Palestinian state, according to a Pew poll, down 14 percentage points since before Hamas's October 7, 2023 attacks. As the war in Gaza drags on, members of Netanyahu's government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are now publicly discussing proposals to annex parts of the enclave if Hamas does not surrender; late last week, Smotrich touted the territory as a potential “real estate bonanza.” Those comments are in line with Trump's apparently still active proposals to turn Gaza into a tourist resort after the “voluntary” relocation of its civilian population. Far-right ministers like Smotrich have proposed going even further and dissolving the Palestinian Authority entirely. Van Hollen, who recently visited the West Bank, dismissed these threats, saying it's clear that plans for annexation are already underway. “For them to pretend that the actions they're taking in the West Bank are in response to calls for recognition of a Palestinian state is just a cover story,” he said. Yoel Guzansky, a former Israeli government adviser who now leads the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, told Vox that Netanyahu “needs a green light from the Trump administration” to move ahead with annexation. Axios has reported, citing Israeli officials, that Rubio, who visited Israel earlier this month, has signaled that the Trump administration is not opposed to annexation, but other administration officials disputed the Israeli characterization. While a “two-state solution” was long bipartisan orthodoxy in Washington, Trump has suggested in the past he's not wedded to the idea, and some members of his administration, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are openly annexationist. What may deter Trump from giving Netanyahu a green light is the effect that annexation would have on one of his signature accomplishments: the Abraham Accords. Even a “limited” annexation of West Bank territory would likely drive a deeper wedge between Israel and its erstwhile partners in the Arab world. Guzansky said that the Abraham Accords countries “might not cancel the agreement entirely” if Israel went ahead with annexation, but that the agreements are “becoming an empty shell of something that was once seen as a model peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors, a ‘Cold Peace' agreement.” That could mean the Arab states continue cooperating with Israel on security, but do so without the people-to-people exchanges or deeper political and economic integration that the accords had promised. A few years ago, Netanyahu likely would have also pointed to normalizing relations between Israel and countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco as one of the crowning foreign policy achievements of his long era in office. The grand prize, normalization with Saudi Arabia, seemed at least a realistic possibility. The Abraham Accords saw many Arab governments willing to sidestep the Palestinian issue to find common ground with Israel on trade and their shared rivalry with Iran. Israel's military strikes throughout the Middle East in recent months, particularly the recent airstrike on Qatar, have further convinced these governments that Israel is increasingly a source of regional instability. In a recent speech, Netanyahu warned Israel that it would likely have to accept an increasingly isolated position on the world stage for the time being, and transform into a “super Sparta” and “adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics.” Regional integration and good relations with its neighbors would be nice, in other words, but in the Israeli government's view, if the price is a negotiated end to the war in Gaza and serious steps toward accepting Palestinian statehood, it's just not worth it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Christmas Day 2023, a man called the suicide prevention hotline claiming he had shot his girlfriend and threatening to kill himself. Police barreled toward the address but turned around before they arrived. Five days later, GOP Sen. Rick Scott's home in Florida was swatted. The wave of false alarms about shootings and violence continued to assail high-level government officials: the federal judge overseeing Trump's election subversion case, then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Maine's Democratic secretary of state. Within a month of Donald Trump clinching his second presidential election win, several of his Cabinet picks and administration appointees also were targeted with threats, including calls about bombs and swatting, his transition team said. So, a fledgling unit of the service set out six months ago to unmask the layers of burner phones, changing phone numbers and SIM cards swatting American officials. What they found was an operation apparently capable of chaos far beyond masking swatting calls to potentially disabling cell phone towers, disrupting emergency services and enabling spies, hackers and organized crime. Instead, they found a vast and stunning network of more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 SIM servers – the largest seizure ever of such devices by the Secret Service – all concentrated within 35 miles of New York City. The servers could be commanded remotely to create massive amounts of phone traffic in a stealthy and unceasing operation that switched out SIM cards quickly to keep federal law enforcement off its trail. The hidden electronic maze was so powerful, it could have sent an encrypted and anonymous text to every human being in the United States within 12 minutes, McCool said. It could have overwhelmed cell towers, toppling New York City's cell service and preventing every Manhattan resident from accessing Google Maps. But its early forensic analysis suggests foreign governments and criminals in the US have used the network to run their organizations, McCool said. The network has been taken down and is no longer a threat to New York, law enforcement officials said. But, McCool cautioned, “It would be unwise to think that there's not other networks across the country.” The Secret Service unit is now working to identify other similar networks, he said. “The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” US Secret Service Director Sean Curran said. Wireless service provider MobileX, whose SIM cards are featured in photographs of items seized in the investigation, said it was “fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities should they reach out.” “We are aware of recent reports that MobileX SIM cards, along with those of other providers, were recovered during a federal investigation,” MobileX founder and CEO Peter Adderton said in a statement. “Our platform is designed to be easy to use and cost-effective, qualities that unfortunately can also attract occasional bad actors. MobileX has robust safeguards in place to identify and block automated or bulk usage, and we shut down suspicious activity on our network every day.” This story has been updated with additional information.
