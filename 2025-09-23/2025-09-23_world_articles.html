                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drinking any amount of alcohol increases your risk of dementia later in life, according to a new study that challenges prior research findings. Some research has suggested light drinking — such as fewer than seven drinks a week — may be more neuroprotective than no alcohol at all. Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn't differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said. Smart wellness goals are backed by science-based studies. The genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or “spurious” variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said. Mendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person's entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate. “This is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,” said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease, was not involved in the new study. “In my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,” he said in an email. However, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer's it often depends on “when” and “how” people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner. The new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the US Million Veteran Program, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry. “In the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),” said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement. “Interestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,” said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. The study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime. Here are the 17 best nonalcoholic wines we're sipping on (Courtesy CNN Underscored) “Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,” Spires-Jones said. “But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.” Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra speaks with the media in Fredericton, on Sept. 19.Stephen MacGillivray/The Canadian Press Most Canadians say they'll never trust the United States the way they once did, according to a new poll. Conducted by Ipsos for Global News, the poll found that 60 per cent of those surveyed believe Canada won't ever be able to rely on their southern neighbour the same way, while 71 per cent feel the trade dispute that upended the countries' long-standing friendship will continue for years. These results have no doubt perplexed and angered some Americans, including the current U.S. Mr. Hoekstra made news last week when he told an audience in Halifax that he was “disappointed” with Canada's reaction to the tariffs President Donald Trump has placed on some Canadian imports. Earlier this year, Mr. Hoekstra had downplayed Mr. Trump's stated desire to make this country the “cherished 51st state“ of the U.S., saying it was merely a “term of endearment.” “A cabinet minister came out and said, ‘We're in a trade war with the United States, we're at war with the United States,'” Mr. Hoekstra said last week. “I think that's a dangerous place to go.” Clearly, anyone in Canada who has used the term “war” to describe what has happened over the last several months is talking about “economic war.” And Mr. Hoekstra, a seasoned politician, knows that. Can the man not even begin to understand why Canadians might be upset with tariffs that are devastating our domestic economy? Tariffs that are based, in large part, on a bogus rationale: that fentanyl is pouring into the U.S. from Canada – an allegation that even America's own border agency can't back up with proof, because it's not true. But Mr. Hoekstra wants us to believe it was all just a form of flattery. And I suspect there are few in Canada who believe we have heard the end of this fantasy of Mr. Trump's. Opinion: To counter Trump's tariffs, Canada must invest in life sciences A seasoned envoy might have recognized the upset that exists in this country and attempted to smooth things over a bit, instead of suggesting Canadian politicians button their lips or watch what they say. The rest of us should just be grateful, apparently, that we live in the shadow of such a great nation. This is not Mr. Hoekstra's first stint as an ambassador. But when he was presented with video evidence of his comments, he had no choice but to backtrack and apologize for the untrue remark. Many are watching what is taking place in America at the moment and are horrified by what they see. It's also because many see an autocracy beginning to take shape where one of the world's greatest democracies once existed. Some genuinely worry they might get apprehended at the border and sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in Louisiana for some spurious reason. I'm afraid Mr. Hoekstra doesn't see his own country the way many others do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When asked whether NATO allies should fire on Russian planes entering their territory, Trump replied: "Yes, I do." He was speaking at a joint briefing with President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly. Russia has violated the airspace of several NATO member states in recent weeks, including Poland, Romania, and Estonia. On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace before being intercepted by NATO aircraft. Asked further by a reporter on whether the U.S. would back NATO allies if they shot down a Russian aircraft, Trump said: "That depends on the circumstances. Earlier on Sept. 23, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a CBS interview that NATO had not discussed shooting down Russian jets unless they were attacking. President Volodymyr Zelensky met his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 23. The meeting, their fourth since Trump returned to office in January, comes amid rising tensions between NATO and Moscow over Russian aerial incursions into allied countries, while the U.S. push to broker peace in Ukraine has stalled. "We have great respect for the fight Ukraine is putting up. "We have a lot of meetings scheduled today going pretty late into the night, but this is an important one." Asked about progress since his last meeting with Zelensky, Trump pointed to the state of Russia's economy and Ukraine's resilience. "This was supposed to be quick, three or four days, but it's been three and a half years of very hard fighting. Russia doesn't look very distinguished," American president added, saying the war looks like "it's not going to end for a long time." The Ukrainian president spoke about developments on the battlefield, saying Ukrainian troops had advanced some 360 kilometers (223 miles) in recent weeks and inflicted losses on Russian forces. Ukrainian forces struck the 8-N linear production dispatching station near the village of Naitopovichi in Russia's Bryansk Oblast overnight on Sept. 23, Ukraine's General Staff reported. The news comes as Ukraine escalates attacks against Russian oil infrastructure, a key source of revenue helping Moscow fund its all-out invasion. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure in the area of Naitopovichi, a village some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border. Samara Oblast lies some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. Ukraine carried out drone strikes on Moscow throughout the night of Sept. 23, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported, adding that dozens of unmanned aircraft were downed. Thirty-four Ukrainian drones flying toward Moscow were shot down as of around 9 a.m. local time, he said. According to Russia's Defense Ministry, a total of 69 Ukrainian drones were shot down over nine Russian regions, including Moscow Oblast, as well as over occupied Crimea overnight on Sept. 23. Airspace over the Russian capital was closed due to the drone attack, prompting a temporary suspension of operations at Moscow's airports. His comment follows Russian claims that Kupiansk, a strategically important town in northeastern Ukraine, had been encircled. Victor Tregubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, also denied these claims, saying that Russia is trying to advance toward Kupiansk from the north. "Russian forces are currently not close to fully encircling Kupiansk, although they have made incremental gains and are intensifying their efforts on multiple axes," Borsari said. According to the expert, Russia's renewed push to capture the town is primarily driven by a combination of "strategic logistical imperatives," the objective of creating a more favorable operational environment for future offensives, and the desire to regain lost territory to show some progress "domestically."

Yesterday, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa — the decentralized movement against fascism — a domestic terrorist organization, although the U.S. does not have a federal domestic terrorism law. “[Antifa] uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals,” the order states. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. “ICE officers are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” the factsheet says, a claim the administration has made numerous times without evidence. Faiza Patel, director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told NPR before the order was announced that “[t]here is no framework to designate an organization as a domestic terrorist organization.” “I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,” he continued. There is no legal statute with which to declare antifa a ‘major terrorist organization.' Nor does antifa have a network of rich, shadowy benefactors who can be unmasked. (What little money antifa's practitioners do have typically comes from their own pockets. “In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau posted on X on September 11. “I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” he continued. The day before his death, the Center for Media and Democracy reported that DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the outlet that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxxing our agents.” Truthout is funded almost entirely by readers — that's why we can speak truth to power, cut against the mainstream narrative and uplift the movements resisting fascism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump told the assembled European leaders that they were destroying their own countries in a move that was ‘basically Maga madlibs' In an hourlong address to the assembled world leaders and delegations, Trump told European leaders directly that they were destroying their own countries – and that they should be more like the US as he condemned their policies on immigration, green energy and political correctness. At moments, he would not have been out of place running for European parliament. And I hate to see it being devastated by [green] energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.” This is red meat for his supporters, and observers from across the aisle in the United States quickly identified Trump's likely audience as his own base. The first 10 minutes were almost a classic stump speech, with Trump telling foreign leaders about how well he had handled inflation and that after just eight months in office “we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close”. But then he turned his gaze to the failures of the United Nations and other world leaders – in which an aide forecast that he would denounce “globalists”. US conservatives would have been delighted to watch Trump tear into European liberals, who were forced to watch and politely applaud as they were accused of gross mismanagement of their countries. “Let's not pretend this is a foreign policy speech or dignify it by calling it one,” wrote Ned Price, a former deputy to the US representative to the United Nations during the Biden administration. Trump is speaking to his political base, hitting each of his campaign trail hits, while addressing a room of leaders who'd rather be just about anywhere else.” If Trump's speech did have a foreign policy predecessor, it would be JD Vance's address earlier this year at the Munich security conference, when the US vice-president launched into a tirade against European leaders over conservative hobby horses including migration and claims that Europe was stifling free speech. Trump didn't mention European voters on Tuesday, but he did accuse European leaders of “destroying your heritage” – a claim shared by rightwing groups in Europe with whom the US president and his allies have been increasingly friendly. Once again, it sounded very much like the administration was seeking to pick a fight with Europe.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anti-vaxxers are copying a core anti-abortion strategy: if you can't make it illegal, make it inaccessible instead. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. For the first time since COVID vaccines were made widely available in 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has severely restricted who can access them. After years of allowing everyone to access this life-saving vaccine, the FDA has said that it is limiting COVID vaccines to people who are 65 years or older and at high risk. Some states, including Illinois and Colorado, have chosen to ignore this guidance, because it isn't based on science, and it isn't about protecting anyone's health — it's about cowering to fanatics while maintaining the veneer of decorum. It's a tactic vaccine deniers learned from another radical, anti-science faction — abortion opponents. For the decade leading up to the Dobbs decision that finally overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion opponents grew ever more creative in their attempts to undermine access to abortion without outright banning it. TRAP laws, short for Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, became all the anti-abortion rage in the 2010s because they allowed hostile legislators to force abortion clinics to close without directly banning abortion. These laws required abortion clinics to meet onerous and medically unnecessary requirements — requiring that abortion clinics meet the facility standards for ambulatory surgical centers, for example. Abortion is an outpatient procedure that is 14 times safer than childbirth, according to one study, and has a lower complication rate than knee surgery. There is absolutely no need for an abortion clinic to meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center, and it is extremely costly to do so. While abortion opponents branded TRAP laws as “protecting women's safety,” in reality, they were designed to force abortion clinics to close. And they were extremely successful at it — between 2018 and 2023, 139 abortion clinics were forced to close their doors, according to the Abortion Care Network. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Limiting COVID vaccines arbitrarily, without any scientific basis and after years of unfettered access, is straight out of the TRAP law playbook. Even if you are over 65 years of age, access to the COVID vaccine isn't guaranteed. In Florida, folks over 65 have reported that they've been told they require a prescription in order to get the vaccine. That isn't specific in the new FDA guidance, either. Even in states where abortion is legally protected, some companies have refused to fulfill prescriptions for the medications. Other pharmacies, like Walgreens and CVS, have said that they will provide the medication. The patchwork of legality and access regarding abortion care has made it difficult for the average abortion seeker to understand what the law is, where they can get one, and if they could face criminalization. This kind of rampant confusion and chaos created a chilling effect among abortion seekers, and it is now being used in service of vaccine deniers. Jared Polis (D) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued a public health order ensuring access to the COVID vaccine for anyone who wants one. My husband and I were both able to get our COVID vaccines without any issue. But even with that order in place, some Coloradans have reported being denied access to the COVID vaccine because they don't meet the FDA's preconditions, even though the state's public health order guarantees them the ability to have one. But even if you can get a COVID vaccine, vaccine deniers are still working to stigmatize this kind of basic care that enjoys broad American support, just as abortion opponents did. Taking a page directly out of the anti-abortion playbook, the Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo equated vaccine mandates with “slavery.” Ousted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Susan Monarez testified before Congress that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told her that the “CDC told hospitals to turn away sick Covid patients until they had blue lips before allowing them to get treatment,” an absurd lie. What RFK Jr. and Ladapo are doing is reframing vaccines — a traditionally nonpartisan, broadly supported, basic health care service — as threatening and destructive. That's because attacks on vaccines, like attacks on abortion, don't just defy evidence — they are anti-evidence. Like so much of the Republican Party's positioning today, these attacks rely on drumming up fear and distrust of the scientific advancements that have provided stability and safety for millions of Americans. When fanatics can erode our public confidence in basic health care that has been proven to save lives, they can easily consolidate control in even broader, more insidious ways. Stigmatizing vaccines is a means of making us disbelieve what we see with our own eyes. Do not allow fanatics and bad actors to brand basic health care as somehow deviant and wrong, to convince you that they alone have the answers, to wipe out decades of research about vaccines' safety, from right under your noses. Take it from those of us who have been fighting for abortion rights — once that right is gone, it's hard to get back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The limit is not mandatory but helps ensure that all voices are heard during the six days of debate. In his remarks, Trump declared that the world has entered "one of the greatest crises in its history" and placed blame on the United Nations for failing to resolve international challenges. Below are the key points from his speech, compiled by TASS. He identified nuclear weapons as the most severe danger: "There is no more serious danger to our planet today than the most powerful and destructive weapons ever devised by man, of which the United States, as you know, has many." Trump criticized the UN for its ineffectiveness in resolving global conflicts, including Ukraine: "Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help. In any of them - I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal. He also condemned what he described as wasteful spending in the UN: "They had massive cost overruns and spent between $2 and 4 billion on the building. <...> Unfortunately, many things in the United Nations are happening just like that, but on an even much bigger scale." Trump acknowledged US efforts in the Ukrainian conflict but admitted the process has been harder than anticipated: "I thought that would be the easiest [conflict to settle] because of my relationship with President Putin, which had always been a good one. I thought that was going to be the easiest one. There are always lots of surprises, both good and bad." He accused several nations of indirectly fueling the conflict: "China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil, but inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products." Trump warned that the US is ready to impose tariffs if Russia does not agree to a settlement: "In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly. But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations <...> would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures." He added that he would be raising the matter with European officials: "They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we're all wasting a lot of time. We're going to discuss it today with the European nations all gathered here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The defeatist narrative is formed by framing news about Taiwan's foreign affairs, national defense, economic issues and democracy with messaging that depicts the nation as weak and dependent on foreign powers, Yu said. The defeatist worldview, built to dovetail with other Chinese information campaigns, creates a sense of crisis and then presents acquiescence to China as its solution, he said. The promotion of defeatist messages is being timed to put a negative spin on specific events as they happen in real time, such as Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises, he said. The vectors for Chinese propaganda include Taiwanese politicians and political pundits, social media accounts under the management of unknown organizations or individuals, Beijing's leadership and state-run media, he said.

TikTok users are more likely to approve of China and express pessimism about the economy, he said. The executive branch should enhance information governance, regulate the quality of open source media and emphasize critical reading skills in education, Yu said. Academics should deepen interdisciplinary study of the information environment in Taiwan and promote public educational efforts, while Taiwanese should be more critical of the information they encounter online and base their discussion about public affairs on verifiable facts, he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chuck Schumer says Trump is ‘running from negotiating table' after president wrote meeting wouldn't be productive Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would not meet with top congressional Democrats to discuss their demands for keeping the federal government open, prompting Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer to accuse the president of “running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there”. Congress is up against a 30 September deadline to authorize more funding or spark a shutdown that would see many federal agencies close their doors and furlough workers. While Republicans have proposed continuing funding through 21 November to allow passage of legislation authorizing spending for the rest of the fiscal year, Democrats have seized on the deadline to demand their healthcare priorities be addressed. Schumer together with his House counterpart, minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, had called for a meeting with Trump to discuss the impasse, and on Tuesday morning announced the president had agreed to sit down. Hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would not be meeting with the Democrats. “After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” the president said. “We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed. Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand,” Trump added. On X, Jeffries wrote that Trump “just cancelled a high stakes meeting” and “the extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.” “Trump Always Chickens Out,” Jeffries said, repeating a saying that spread earlier this year amid the president's uneven imposition of tariffs. Schumer said in a statement: “Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there. Democrats have proposed legislation funding the government through 31 October, while also undoing changes to Medicaid that Republicans enacted earlier this year, which are expected to cost millions of people their healthcare. Both parties have included in their funding bills additional money for the security of Congress, judges and executive branch officials in response to Charlie Kirk's assassination.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The news comes as Ukraine escalates attacks against Russian oil infrastructure, a key source of revenue helping Moscow fund its all-out invasion. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure in the area of Naitopovichi, a village some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border. Samara Oblast lies some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine. The General Staff also confirmed that Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) hit two Russian Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft at the Kacha military airbase, located in occupied Crimea. Kateryna Denisova works as a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a news editor at the NV media outlet for four years, covering mainly Ukrainian and international politics. Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany. The strikes came after Russian aircraft bombed Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing one person. The meeting, their fourth since Trump returned to office in January, comes as tensions between NATO and Moscow flare up over Russian aerial incursions into allied countries. "I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form," Trump wrote on his Truth Social following his meeting with the Ukrainian president. Asked whether NATO allies should fire on Russian planes entering their territory, U.S. President Donald Trump replied: "Yes, I do." They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia," U.S. President Donald Trump told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. "Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. Former detainees reported experiencing a broad array of torture and ill-treatment during their captivity. Commonly described methods included severe beatings with various objects such as batons and sticks,  electric shocks to different body parts, mock executions, kickings, threats of death, and violence directed either to a detainee or their loved ones, according to the report. All flights at Denmark's Copenhagen Airport were halted after police reported two to three large drones in the area. Victor Tregubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, also denied these claims, saying that Russia is trying to advance toward Kupiansk from the north.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kenvue's logo is displayed during its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. Kenvue KVUE-N  bounced back sharply at the opening bell Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism. Shares of the New Jersey consumer brands company tumbled 7.5 per cent Monday. At the open of trading, shares bounced back by more than 6 per cent. The announcement, which appeared to rely on existing studies rather than significant new research, arrives as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, advances the Make America Healthy Again movement that has focused on what it sees as potential causes of autism. Kenvue disputed any link between the drug and autism this week and warned that if pregnant mothers don't use Tylenol when in need, they could face a dangerous choice between suffering fevers or using riskier alternatives. Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023 because it was thought that the companies could function more efficiently if they were independent from each other. Aside from Tylenol, the consumer health company makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other household brand names. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni wrote that he sees a limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump's announcement, but thinks “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.” Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

MAEBASHI — A blue-eyed doll on display at the main entrance of Tone Elementary School in Numata, Gunma Prefecture, is one of 12,739 dolls gifted as a token of friendship by the United States before World War II. Mitsu Araki, 97, from Maebashi, first saw Mary-chan in 1934 when she entered the then Azumamura elementary and junior high school in Numata, where her father, Takeo Kaneko, served as vice principal. Araki said she still remembered when she first encountered the 40-centimeter-tall doll sitting on a cabinet in the school staff room and thought Mary-chan was “cute, with strong features different from Japanese dolls, and wearing a pretty cape.” The blue-eyed dolls were gifted to Japanese kindergartens and elementary schools by a private group in the United States in 1927. Following the enforcement of the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned immigration from Japan to the United States, a missionary with a positive view on Japan was concerned about bilateral relations souring and called upon Americans to send friendship dolls to Japanese children. Of the 12,739 dolls collected, about 140 arrived in Gunma Prefecture. At the Azumamura school, teachers had many meetings to discuss what to do with Mary-chan, but no conclusion was reached. Kaneko, who was entrusted with the decision, thought he could not destroy the doll because it came as a messenger of peace. He hid it in a sewing room cabinet while on night duty. Back then, his students were being drafted one after another, and Araki said, “My father may have been making a plea, saying ‘I am protecting you, so please don't take the lives of Japan's young people. Mary-chan saw the light of day again in 1966. After its story was featured on a television program in 1973, other friendship dolls were discovered nationwide, with over 300 confirmed to date. She did not know that her father was agonizing over the doll. “I want to honor him for his courage to hide the doll and wish for peace,” Araki said as she reminisced about her deeply sincere father. Araki visited her alma mater for the first time in 13 years last spring to meet Mary-chan at the entrance. It will soon be 100 years since the doll's arrival in Japan. “Thank you for your long service,” she said. Another doll also called Mary-chan is at Niragawa Elementary School in Ota, the same prefecture. The exhibition was organized by Tetsuya Maezawa, 65, a modern military history researcher and historical writer. Maezawa displayed a panel photo of his uncle in the exhibition. “I was finally able to reunite my uncle with Mary-chan. I hope children will feel how precious peace is,” Maezawa said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. SHIRA EFRON is Distinguished Chair for Israel Policy and Senior Fellow at the RAND Corporation. Following Sunday's recognitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a Hebrew-language video statement: “It will not happen. A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan.” Although Netanyahu will only make a final decision on Israel's full response when he returns to the region after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, his coalition has repeatedly threatened to annex West Bank territory and collapse the Palestinian Authority entirely. Instead, they give hard-line elements of the Israeli government more pretext to try to suppress Palestinian self-determination and further weaken the PA. “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state,” he said, “because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.” But something good could still come out of the momentum toward recognition if both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership look beyond the symbolism—and if international actors work to market recognition not as a unilateral action but as a small part of an arduous multilateral push for mutual recognition by Israel and Palestine, the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and its neighbors, and greater regional integration. Both propose more practical ways forward—and Israel should take the opportunity that these initiatives offer. The New York Declaration outlines a comprehensive framework for ending Israel's military operations in Gaza, returning the remaining hostages, dismantling Hamas, and rebuilding the strip and backs these steps with security guarantees and initiatives to boost regional integration. All these measures are consistent with Israel's military and political objectives. Israeli leaders must look past the ideological rigidity that drives them to oppose any notion of Palestinian self-determination. The recognizing states will have to step up, too, by making their security guarantees concrete and by helping shape a Palestinian state that does not threaten its neighbors and dignifies its people by providing functioning institutions and proper services. The state of Israel was established by a UN General Assembly resolution, which theoretically means that Israel cannot selectively accept the legitimacy that created it while rejecting a Palestinian state formed under the same framework. But Israeli opposition to a Palestinian state has only hardened since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack. A September 2024 joint poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) and Tel Aviv University's International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation found that most Israelis believed that if a Palestinian state were established, terrorist attacks on Israel would persist or increase. Even centrist leaders who persistently oppose Netanyahu have come out strongly against recognition. On August 2, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera that “the initiative by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state is one of the fruits of October 7. We proved that victory over Israel is not impossible, and our weapons are a symbol of Palestinian dignity.” Beyond the trouble with this narrative, Israelis have other valid concerns. Before September, nearly 150 UN member countries already recognized a Palestinian state. Germany, Italy, and even the United States may eventually feel that they have no choice but to follow their Security Council peers' lead. It will also strengthen Palestinians' standing in international forums and pave the way for Palestine's transition from a permanent observer at the UN to a full member—which would make its status as a state unquestionable despite Israel's objections. Government departments such as the Ministry of Health provide only partial services. The West Bank's economy has shrunk to less than a sixth of its 2022 size, and unemployment stands at over 30 percent. The PA enjoys little popularity among its people: a May PCPSR poll found that 81 percent of Palestinians want President Mahmoud Abbas to resign and that 69 percent believe that the PA will not succeed in accomplishing the reforms necessary to govern. This week's recognitions do nothing, in practice, to give the PA more capacity or shore it up against Israeli aggression. Instead, they put Palestinians even more squarely in the crosshairs of Israeli officials seeking to render Palestinian statehood impossible. Speaking at a September 20 event at Maale Adumim, a large settlement near Jerusalem, Netanyahu declared, “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This wave of recognitions will likely increase anti-Israel sentiment globally, accelerating divestments and boycotts. Some European institutions have already divested from Israeli enterprises: in August, for instance, Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing an “unacceptable risk” that its investments were contributing to human rights violations. Many economic ties between EU member states and Israel are governed by the 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which can be canceled only by unanimous consensus, an unlikely outcome given Hungary's continued support for Israel. A European Commission proposal in mid-September to partially suspend the agreement—which required only the backing of a majority of member states—was vetoed by Germany and Italy. Israel is a major beneficiary of the program, but this year to date, its approval rates for projects with Israeli collaborators has already dropped by 68.5 percent. In May, David Harel, the president of Israel's Academy of Sciences and Humanities, said that if Israel were excluded entirely it would be a “death sentence for Israeli science.” The executive committee of the Union of European Football Associations is expected to vote soon on suspending Israel's national team and all of its clubs from its competitions, which would exclude Israelis from a leading venue for its favorite sport. Cultural institutions face equally severe pressure—pressure that will only increase after this week's recognitions. In early September, the Flanders Festival Ghent, in Belgium, canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic solely because its conductor, Lahav Shani—who has called for peace in Gaza—also directs the Israel Philharmonic; over 4,000 actors and filmmakers have pledged not to cooperate with Israeli institutions. It may seem trivial to outsiders, but the growing possibility that Israel could be ejected from the Eurovision Song Contest hits Israelis especially hard. The competition is one of Israel's most cherished events of the year, and Israelis take pride in their exceptional record: Israel has won four times, and the fact that an Israeli contestant reached the 2025 final felt enormously comforting to Israelis, reassuring them that their artists could still be loved in countries where protests against their government are common. But Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain have all threatened to boycott Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. The recent recognitions and Israel's aggressive counterreaction may well push more countries to issue similar threats. At a Finance Ministry conference last week, Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel is entering “a kind of isolation.” But he has sought to claim that the country could manage this isolation, suggesting that Israel can adopt an economy with “autarkic features” and become a “super-Sparta.” Netanyahu appears to have forgotten that Israel's economic success owes much to Oslo's peace dividend and that Israel has become an export-driven economy that relies on the tech sector and a highly educated, globally connected workforce. This is why Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, famously said in 1955 that “Israel is not destined to become a new Sparta.” Regardless of Israel's military engagements, he continued, “we must not be distracted” from the fact that “our ultimate goal in our relations with our neighbors is peace and coexistence.” That declaration's objective was to avoid the pitfalls of previous unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives by proposing time-bound, tangible steps toward a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within a regional framework that shuns Hamas and incentivizes Arab states to play major roles. Unfortunately, the escalatory rhetoric and mutual threats surrounding recognition took attention off these measures. But they could provide the Israeli government with an off-ramp to end its war in Gaza, which is unpopular among Israelis. The New York Declaration is perfectly aligned with Israel's first three goals, and it implicitly accepts that in the near term, Israel will maintain peripheral security control over Gaza and that Hamas will not return to power. Its vision for PA authority over Gaza is conditioned on reforms that would make the PA a more trusted neighbor than it is today. France, Saudi Arabia, and the governments that endorsed the New York Declaration should immediately start taking practical steps to operationalize its proposed measures, such as by designing a mechanism to disarm Hamas, training a multinational security force that could properly monitor and enforce a cease-fire, acquiring real commitments from international players to stabilize and reconstruct Gaza, and developing a concrete plan to deradicalize Palestinian armed-resistance movements. They also should seek to bring the United States on board in their September 23 meeting with Trump, which is expected to cover a post-war vision for Gaza. Now is the time to be even more pragmatic. Whether even more powerful states will recognize Palestine is a question of when, not if. It will also clarify the obligations that Palestinian leaders have to abide by international law, prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel, and stop Hamas's terrorist activities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. More Drones and Missiles Are All That Can Stop Russia Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, officials across Europe have scrambled to craft a peace deal that could work for Ukraine. They know by now that, at the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in stopping his offensives, and they fear that shifting American priorities may leave Ukraine without a critical source of support. As a result, they are racing to find a way to provide Kyiv with security guarantees that could deter Russia and allow for an armistice. In conversations about security guarantees, officials have tended to focus on a handful of measures: placing a small number of European troops in Ukraine to shore up the country's defense (so-called reassurance forces), levying additional sanctions against Russia, and providing Ukraine with more weapons, including conventional ones. They have also mused about committing themselves, on paper, to Ukraine's defense. Two of these actions—more weapons and sanctions—could take place before any cease-fire. But by themselves, they are not enough to guarantee Ukraine's security. Since the start of Russia's invasion in 2022, Putin has been transparent about his objective—the destruction of Ukraine as an independent nation—and has subjected many people to almost unimaginable suffering in order to achieve it. NATO countries, after all, have been arming Kyiv for years, and Moscow keeps making incremental gains. But Ukraine need not destroy every element of the Russian military to achieve strategic neutralization—stripping away the enemy of its ability to achieve its objectives. And the conflict has recently changed in ways that have made it easier to freeze. In fact, Ukraine has already done a great deal of what's needed to deter Russia for good. It needs to invest heavily in the country's sophisticated defense industry. Such measures will indeed be daunting, but not any more than NATO's original effort to help Ukraine. Those guarantees, however, have only conferred a real benefit when they created tangible shields. In Asia, the mutual defense treaty between South Korea and the United States works to deter a North Korean invasion because tens of thousands of American troops remain on the peninsula, where they jointly plan and train with their South Korean partners. Likewise, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which a consortium of states (including Russia) promised to protect Ukraine's sovereignty if it gave up its nuclear weapons, did nothing to stop Russia from invading its neighbor multiple times because it offered no military resources to Kyiv. But it was only in late 2021, after it became clear that Russia aimed to invade the entire country, that NATO states got somewhat serious about arming Ukraine. Moscow's Black Sea Fleet blockaded Ukrainian ports, occupied Snake Island, and threatened Odessa, the country's main coastal city. (Ukrainian-made weapons, of course, were also essential to this victory.) Although these strikes only destroyed part of Russia's fleet, Kyiv made it impossible for Putin's ships to sail near Ukraine's main ports, and Moscow was left with no choice but to move most of its fleet to the east. Ukraine has had success in the air, as well. Instead, Ukraine's innovative defenses have made it impossible for Russia to achieve superiority. In an air denial operation undertaken in the first days of the invasion, now known as Ghost of Kyiv, Ukraine used its limited air capabilities to intercept many Russian fighter jets and effectively push these planes out of its airspace. During its more complex 2025 “Spiderweb” operations, Ukraine has used innovative uncrewed systems to destroy a substantial portion of Russia's strategic aviation fleet, or the aircraft Russia uses to launch numerous cruise missiles at all areas of Ukraine. Kyiv has not been able to make its skies safe enough for commercial air-traffic transit, and it experiences constant missile and long-range drone attacks. But strategic neutralization is attainable without waging a multidecade war of attrition. Instead, it can paralyze the military by targeting essential functions such as logistics, coordination, mobility, and firepower. In this way, it can follow a template pioneered by Israel, which neutralized Egypt's far larger air force in 1967 not by destroying every aircraft but by taking out many of them and eliminating its runways and command systems. As a result, Israel preserved its existence without annihilating vast opposition forces. Ukraine is closer to paralyzing Russia than most people think. Russia's jets do still strike Ukrainian targets, albeit from a great distance, and Russian ground forces continue to seize small chunks of territory. But with drones, remote mines, precision artillery, and constant surveillance, Ukraine has transformed large stretches of the front into persistent kill zones: areas where forces find it nearly impossible to maneuver without being detected and then immediately hit. If Ukraine can widen these kill zones—by surveilling more territory and striking behind Russia's current forward lines—and deny Russia the ability to mass men and materiel in its rear, Russian formations will be unable to generate any momentum. Future offensives by Russia would then become strategically futile, and thus not worth attempting. To succeed, however, Ukraine will need more drones and high-tech weapons. But as the operational environment has evolved, many legacy systems have become largely obsolete. Europe alone has financial resources, scientific capabilities, and an industrial base that Russia cannot match. The continent has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. The European Union has launched several programs designed to channel money into Ukrainian defense-industrial factories. Kyiv has also forged bilateral deals with a variety of countries to scale up its drone and ammunition production. But it must also focus on speeding up design, testing, and scaling. Perhaps the most important is a European Sky Shield for Ukraine: an initiative proposed by a group of international and Ukrainian military experts. In it, a collection of European states would establish a no-fly zone, first over western Ukrainian territory and later over central Ukraine. Participating states would mobilize roughly 120 combat aircraft, which would fly from European bases and shoot down missiles and drones over the covered territory. In addition to safeguarding Ukraine's infrastructure and economy—by, for example, shielding Ukrainian nuclear plants and export corridors—it would free Ukraine's own air force to concentrate on the eastern front. NATO states will also have to continue supplying Kyiv with some traditional weapons. Ukraine will need more F-16 fighter jets to defend its skies. Ukraine's allies should also earmark certain stockpiles of ammunition, drones, and spare parts housed in eastern Europe for Ukraine, so that they are never again vulnerable to political delays in Washington or European capitals. And the United States must continue providing Kyiv with military intelligence, which has been indispensable to tracking Russian troop movements and missile strikes. Such high-end enablers will remain cornerstones of any meaningful security guarantees. But tanks or other legacy equipment would be of little use on their own. Giving Ukraine another paper commitment to its security, even one modeled on NATO's Article 5, as some European states have discussed, would do nothing. And without tangible support that's tailored to today's Ukrainian battlefield, even European reassurance forces would be of dubious value. Unless NATO countries decide to station large numbers of combat-ready troops or send over instructors, these deployments would have the main effect of being expensive and politically risky within their home countries. The troops are unlikely to stop, or be spared from, Russia's military. Giving Ukraine what it needs does not only help Kyiv. If Putin's military is not stopped somewhere in Ukraine, it may march on a NATO member. Putin has made no secret of his desire to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union and establish Russian dominance over Europe's east. Over the last several weeks, he has floated drones and fighter jets over NATO's boundary in a clear test of the alliance's integrity. At a minimum, more of these provocations are likely to happen unless NATO helps Ukraine neutralize Russia's military. It called for a “steel porcupine” strategy—or fortifying Ukraine so that future Russian offensives fail by design—and investing in Ukraine's defense industry as part of creating a shared European capacity. But the EU and NATO must do more to help Ukraine firmly prevail over Russia's technologies and deny Moscow any further battlefield victories. Its members need to plow more resources and in-kind technology contributions into Ukraine's defense industry. They must help Kyiv quickly develop and massively scale up new systems.
