            Ryan Routh, the 59-year-old accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump as the former and future president played a round of golf on his Florida course last year – the second attempt on Trump's life during his second campaign – has been found guilty on all charges against him.
    


            Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was read, but authorities stopped him.
    


            A sketch artist who was in the first row of the courtroom said Routh had “no emotion” during the verdict. Lothar Speer started a drawing when he heard Routh's daughter yell from behind: “Oh my god, he's trying to kill himself, he's trying to kill himself! Someone stop him, please!”
    


            An IT specialist who witnessed Routh try to stab himself said the defendant was tackled by marshals and dragged out of the courtroom's side entrance. When he returned to court, he was shackled.
    


            “I didn't see any blood, no one in there saw blood,” John Grouse told CNN.
    


            Routh's daughter, Sarah, yelled out, “I love you and we will get you out, don't worry,” according to Grouse. She was escorted out of the courtroom.
    


            Routh, who represented himself at his federal trial in Fort Pierce, Florida, was facing five charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Authorities say Routh created a “sniper's nest” near the sixth green of Trump International Golf Club, but never fired a shot at Trump.
    


            Jurors deliberated for under three hours before delivering the guilty verdict.
    


            Routh will be sentenced on December 18 by Judge Aileen Cannon. He faces the possibility of life in prison.
    


            Trump took to social media after the verdict to congratulate law enforcement.
    


            “Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.



            “This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,” the president added.
    


            US attorneys rested their case on Friday after calling 38 witnesses. Nearly two weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits culminated with the final witness who pieced together how Routh was allegedly “stalking” Trump and collecting both “physical and electronic evidence.”
    


            Kimberly McGreevy, an FBI supervisory special agent, focused on evidence collected between August 14 and September 15, 2024, leading up to the alleged assassination attempt. Prosecutors ticked through a mountain of evidence with McGreevy on the stand, including call logs, text messages, bank records and video surveillance.
    


            Highlighting cellphone records allegedly from Routh's “burner phones,” the witness pointed to calls and text messages Routh allegedly made to arrange for the purchase of the rifle.
    


            The FBI witness told the jury cellphone data showed Routh “in the vicinity” of the golf club for weeks before the incident, including on September 2 for 16 hours beginning at 4 a.m. A Google account on one of Routh's alleged “burner phones” showed he searched for “Trump's upcoming rallies” and “Palm Beach traffic cameras,” according to prosecutors.
    


            The government also laid out Routh's alleged getaway plan: multiple license plates, three aliases, and Google searches for “directions to Miami airport” and “flights to Mexico.” Text messages allegedly show he told a friend in Mexico, “I may see you Monday,” the day after his alleged plan to shoot Trump. Other searches online, prosecutors say, included “hospitals in the area” and instructions on “how to make a tourniquet.”
    


            On September 15, 2024, less than an hour before authorities say Routh was going to open fire on Trump, he texted his three children. His daughter Sarah at 12:55 p.m.: “Love you so much, you are the best daughter.” His son Adam at 12:56 p.m.: “You are so awesome dude, love you so much.” His son Orin also at 12:56 p.m.: “Love you so much, man. You are so brilliant.”
    


            Orin, seemingly alarmed, wrote back: “Love you too, Dad. What's up? Everything alright?”
    


            Routh was arrested as he fled north on Florida's Interstate 95 about an hour later.
    


            Eyewitness Tommy McGee also testified for the government. He told the jury he saw a “frantic and disheveled” man leaving the scene and decided to follow him. He took pictures of his black Nissan Xterra and also wrote down his license plate. McGee alerted authorities, who stopped Routh's car about 45 minutes north on Highway 95. McGee was later brought to the scene to ID him.
    


            On cross-examination, Routh told McGee, “You're a good man. You're my hero. You're an American hero.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said the guilty verdict “illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence. This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself.”
    


            During closing arguments Tuesday, both prosecutors and the defendant zeroed in on intent.
    


            “Even though he didn't kill Trump, he wanted to,” prosecutor Chris Browne told the jury.
    


            He said Routh “obsessively stalked and tracked his intended victim,” and planned his alleged assassination attempt “meticulously and obsessively.”
    


            The defendant, delivering his own closing argument, claimed the assassination was “never going to happen.” Routh said, “If the attempted assassination was not taken, it is not an attempt.”
    


             “There was no intent,” he told the jury.
    


            Routh's closing was interrupted by Cannon at least 10 times as he veered into territory outside the bounds of evidence and charges. She told him to “move on” numerous times.
    


            On rebuttal, the prosecution reminded the jury that the crime does not have to be “completed” to convict of attempted assassination – “nobody has to be shot,” prosecutor John Shipley said.
    


            Routh had considered testifying in his own defense, but did call three witnesses, including two friends and a former Marine sniper, Michael McClay.
    


            McClay told the jury that the SKS rifle authorities say they found at the scene jammed twice, after firing only one shot. The prosecutors disputed the weapon's capability during cross-examination, noting McClay had tested the weapon seven months after the incident at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Prosecutors also noted by then, the weapon had been treated with acid to try and restore the serial number.
    


            When Routh's testimony veered into territory like his alleged drug use with his character witnesses, the judge jumped in, telling him, “I've given you substantial latitude. Drugs and cigarettes are not relevant here. I'm going to ask you conclude the direct of this witness.”
    


            After her father rested his case without testifying, Routh's daughter, Sarah, told CNN: “I feel like he really didn't have another choice. After seeing how rigged it is, why would he put himself in that position, you know, that would be stupid. It's obviously all rigged and it's all bullsh*t.”

            Despite what you may have heard recently, and contrary to what US President Donald Trump apparently believes, there is autism in Cuba.
    


            For years the island's state-run medical system has operated clinics to treat Cubans with autism and carried out campaigns to raise awareness of the neurological developmental disorder. Cuba even offers specialized autism therapies such as swimming with dolphins for foreigners seeking treatment who can pay in badly needed hard currency.
    


            But even though information about how Cuba's healthcare system treats autism is available to anyone savvy enough to write “Cuba” and “autism” into Google, Trump on Monday made the bizarre and false claim that the island's poverty has spared Cubans from the condition.
    


            “I mean, there's a rumor, and I don't know if it's so or not, that Cuba, they don't have Tylenol because they don't have the money for Tylenol. And they have virtually no autism, OK. Tell me about that one,” Trump said at an event on Monday where he urged pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol, which he claimed – despite a lack of scientific evidence – could cause autism in their unborn children.
    


            Cuban officials have yet to respond to Trump's false claims and his comments have not been reported so far in the island's state-run press.
    


            But for years Cuban doctors have publicly detailed efforts made to treat children on the island who suffer from autism.
    


Trump links autism to Tylenol use during pregnancy, contradicting decades of evidence



            “Every autistic person is unique, and their well-being depends on listening, understanding, and walking alongside them, knowing that inclusion isn't measured in words, but in embraces that respect silence and celebrate different ways of existing,” Dr. Osmara Delgado Sánchez told the state-run website Cubadebate on April 2, which is Autism Awareness Day.
    


            While Cuba has reported much lower instances of autism than many developed countries – 0.36 cases per 10,000 people – the island's health professionals concede that may in part be the result of the lack of resources needed to more widely diagnose the condition.
    


            According to the World Health Organization, in 2021 about 1 in 127 people had autism. But the WHO cautioned, “the prevalence of autism in many low- and middle-income countries is unknown.”
    


            Despite increasingly scant funds, Cuba's beleaguered health sector is making autism a priority, officials said.
    


            In the same Cubadebate article, Delgado said that there are 300 Cuban health professionals specialized in autism working in seven centers across the island devoted to treating patients with autism.
    


            Cuba, she said, has developed specific autism treatments since 2018.
    


            “We don't talk about curing (Cuban patients with autism),” Delgado told the site. “But maximizing abilities … so no one is left behind.”

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Ukraine could restore its borders from before Russia's invasion and that he believes NATO member countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace, escalating his rhetoric against the Kremlin as its war in Ukraine drags on.
    


            Taken together, Trump's remarks on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly about shooting down Russian aircraft and his later post on Truth Social about Ukraine's borders seemed to reflect a significant shift in his attitude toward Moscow and what the end of the intractable conflict might look like.
    


            His comments on Ukraine's borders represent the first time since taking office that he's suggested the nation could win back all of the territory that Russia has taken since 2014. He had previously suggested Ukraine would need to give up some of its territory in order to secure a peace deal. And his statement on NATO shooting down aircraft suggests a willingness to put the defense alliance in more direct conflict with Russia than merely giving weapons to Ukraine.
    


            “Yes, I do,” Trump said when posed a question about NATO shoot-downs during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.
    


            Later, on Truth Social, Trump wrote that after developing a more fulsome understanding of Ukraine and Russia's economic and military situations, he had come to believe “Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.” He said the conflict was making Russia look like a “paper tiger,” and asserted it was costing Moscow significant funds and making it hard to get gasoline.
    


            “With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not?” Trump wrote in a lengthy post, adding, “Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.”
    


            CNN has asked the White House on what borders Trump is specifically referring to.
    


            Zelensky hailed Trump's post as “a big shift,” calling the US leader “a gamechanger.”
    


            “This post of Trump, it's a big shift,” Zelensky said at a press conference later in the afternoon.
    


            Zelensky told reporters that he briefed Trump “on what's going on,” and the US president “agreed with” him about the situation on the battlefield.
    


            “I think that president is – he knows some details. And I think he knows more details … than before. And I am happy with this, and I'm thankful for him, or maybe also for him, for his people who briefed him,” Zelensky said.
    


            Asked if it's a “gamechanger” that Trump believes Ukraine can win, Zelensky replied, “Trump is a game changer by himself.”
    


            In his Truth Social post, Trump suggested Ukraine could win the war with European support, with no mention of the US getting further involved. CNN has asked the Trump administration whether it is going to provide Ukraine any more support.
    


            Recent incursions of Russian aircraft over Poland, Estonia and other nations have led to the first direct encounters between NATO and Moscow since the start of the Ukraine war, testing the alliance's preparedness and credibility in deterring Russia's aggression.
    


            European leaders have voiced outrage and vowed to respond with force. But NATO's leader said Tuesday that shooting down Russian aircraft should only proceed after an analysis of intent.
    


            NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said shoot-downs should depend “on available intelligence regarding the threat posed by the aircraft, including questions we have to answer like intent, armaments and potential risk to allies, forces, civilians or infrastructure.”
    


            “We will always assess the situation, assess the immediate threat the plane poses,” Rutte said. He was speaking after a meeting of NATO members requested by Estonia after Russian jets violated its airspace last week.
    


Five takeaways from Trump's UN speech



            Trump, speaking a few hours later, appeared less cautious, offering no qualifiers about when or if NATO members should shoot down violating Russian aircraft. He also stopped short of saying the United States would join in the effort.
    


            “Depends on the circumstance,” he said. “But you know, we're very strong toward NATO.”
    


            The president's comments came hours after his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, indicated the US would not shoot down Russian jets that enter NATO airspace but said the alliance would continue to intercept them.
    


            Rubio said he didn't think NATO allies would shoot down Russian aircraft “unless they're attacking.”
    


            “I think what you have seen is NATO responding to those intrusions the way we respond to them all the time, and that is when enter your airspace or your defense zone, you go up and you intercept them,” Rubio said in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday.
    


            NATO members have scrambled in recent weeks after Russian drones and aircraft violated their airspace. Three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland without permission Friday. That came the week after several Russian drones and fighter jets entered Polish airspace, prompting a scramble of F-15 and F-35 fighter jets.
    


Trump takes shots at UN, climate change and immigration policies in speech



            On Monday, two of Scandinavia's busiest airports — Oslo, Norway, and Copenhagen, Denmark — were forced to close for several hours due to drone sightings, disrupting the travel plans of tens of thousands of people.
    


            When asked about the incident Tuesday, Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said she “cannot reject in any way that it could be Russia” behind it.
    


            Trump declined to pin blame on Russia when asked about the incident Tuesday.
    


            “I have no response until I find out exactly what happened. I know about it but … they don't know what happened. But we're going to find out very soon,” he said.
    


            European allies warned Monday during a fiery emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that they would shoot down Russian jets or drones involved in any further violations of NATO airspace.
    


            The incursions have raised questions about how prepared Europe is to defend itself against Russian aggression. Trump has warned the continent it must do more to bolster its own security and has put the onus on other NATO members to provide funding for Ukraine's military assistance.
    


            Rutte on Tuesday said NATO was prepared to defend itself.
    


            “We have all the defensive systems in place to make sure that we can defend every inch of allied territory,” he said. “That's what we have shown both in the Polish case as well as in the Estonian case.”

US President Donald Trump has held a meeting with Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York.

Trump delivered a typical speech to the assembly on Tuesday, in which he was initially denied use of a teleprompter (and for which he promised “big trouble,” to laughter in the audience).

While criticizing mass migration, Trump also told the gathered delegations that the peace he “forged” during his first presidential term had been “shattered” by the “guns of war” and questioned the role of the UN in resolving recent conflicts and political crises.

After his speech, he met with Zelensky to discuss the Ukraine conflict.

This live feed has ended.

23 September 2025

When asked about the progress in resolving the Ukraine conflict, Trump claimed that “the biggest progress is that the Russian economy is terrible right now” and is “crashing.”

Although Russia's economy has shown some signs of slowing down in recent months, President Vladimir Putin said last week that the country “is still far from a recession,” citing the “historically low unemployment rates.” Most analysts and economists have acknowledged that the Russian economy has broadly weathered the sweeping Western sanctions.

The US president believes NATO nations should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they cross into their airspace, answering in the affirmative to a question to that effect.

When further pressed on whether Washington would aid other NATO members in such cases, the president replied that it would depend “on the circumstance.”



Hungary could forgo Russian oil imports, Trump has claimed during a joint briefing with Zelensky. The US president has said he had not yet talked to Prime Minister Viktor Orban about the issue. “I have a feeling if I did, he might stop, and I think I'll be doing that,” he has added.

When asked whether he still trusts Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump replied that he would give an answer “in about a month.”

It is “too early” to talk about guarantees for Ukraine, Trump has told journalists during a short joint press briefing ahead of his meeting with Zelensky.

Zelensky is heading to his sit-down with Trump.



Trump and Zelensky most recently met in Washington in mid-August, soon after the US president's summit with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska. The leaders of the UK, France, Italy, Germany and Finland, as well as the heads of NATO and the European Commission were also present at the talks between the American president and Ukrainian leader.

Trump also put a big map on a display at the Oval Office showing the frontline situation in the Ukraine conflict. “I assume you've all seen the map,” Trump told Fox news after the meeting. “A big chunk of territory is taken and that territory has been taken,” he said, referring to the areas controlled by Russia.

Zelensky also admitted that territorial exchanges were on the talks agenda at the White House – something he had previously outright refused to discuss.

Trump spoke for almost an hour at the UN General Assembly, even though each speaker is usually given around 15 minutes. At 56 minutes, it was the longest speech at the UN among US presidents.

Renewable energy is “a joke” and is too expensive and insufficient to power an industrial economy, Trump claimed. According to the president, the “green energy agenda” has brought many nations in Europe to “the brink of destruction,” adding: “All green is all bankrupt.”

The US president called global warming and the idea of the carbon footprint a “hoax” and a “scam,” claiming that the green agenda was aimed at moving manufacturing and industrial activity away from developed nations.



The US will lead an international effort to enforce the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention, Trump announced, adding that it will involve “pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust.” He did not provide any details about the system.

Russia recognized Palestinian statehood many years ago, without waiting for the “monstrous catastrophe” that has killed thousands, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin has said, referring to Israel's current offensive in Gaza and the toll it has taken on the enclave's civilian population.

Speaking on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Vershinin said that while Russia condemns the Hamas October 7 attack that triggered Israel's retaliation, it “cannot and must not be used as a pretext for collective punishment of millions of Palestinians.” According to Gaza's health authorities, at least 65,000 people have been killed since Israel launched its offensive nearly two years ago.

Vershinin's comments came after the recognition of Palestine by France, the UK, Portugal, Belgium, Canada, and Australia. Moscow noted that it had recognized Palestinian statehood back in 1988, soon after the Palestinian Declaration of Independence.

Russia maintains that a lasting Middle East settlement is only possible based on the UN Security Council formula entailing the creation of a Palestinian state within the armistice lines that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War and with East Jerusalem as its capital. The UNGA earlier this month overwhelmingly backed a resolution supporting a two-state solution, which was opposed only by the US, Israel, and a handful of Pacific island states.

The original UN plan for partition in 1947 envisioned separate Jewish and Arab states, but subsequent wars allowed Israel to seize most of the land, including West Jerusalem, which had been allocated to the Palestinians.

Western powers have long resisted recognizing a Palestinian state and have aligned with Washington and insisting it could only come as part of direct negotiations. However, after years of stalemate and the humanitarian disaster in Gaza since 2023, leaders in Paris, London and elsewhere are now calling recognition both a moral step and a diplomatic signal that the two-state solution remains the only path to peace.

Ukraine has to agree to a peace deal with Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. He added that it is not up to the US to end the conflict, and that the two sides themselves must find a compromise.

Since returning to office, US President Donald Trump has made repeated attempts to mediate the Ukraine conflict, initiating numerous rounds of talks with Russian officials and holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in mid-August. The sides described their contacts as productive, but no breakthrough was achieved.

Speaking on NBC's Today Show on Tuesday, Rubio replied that it is “not up to us to end the war” when asked why the conflict continues despite Trump's repeated promises to end it “on day one” of his new administration. “The Russians have to stop the war and the Ukrainians have to agree to a peace deal,” he added.

Ending the conflict is still a “priority” for the Trump administration, Rubio maintained. When asked about Washington's alleged reluctance to impose new sanctions on Russia, the secretary of state said the US would like to retain the role of a “broker” in the conflict for as long as possible.

“The minute we go heavy on the sanctions and everything else, our ability to act as a broker to bring about peace is diminished,” he told NBC. The conflict could then go on for “another two years,” Rubio warned, adding that “we hope to avoid that.”

He also accused Kiev's Western backers of hypocrisy by saying they demand that the US introduce harsher economic restrictions against Moscow, with some “countries in Europe… still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas” from Russia.

Moscow has repeatedly stated it is open to a peaceful resolution of the hostilities at any time, but has maintained that any deal must address the roots of the conflict and respect the realities on the ground. This includes the status of the former Ukrainian territories that joined Russia after public referendums.

Russia has also accused Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky of being in denial and unnecessarily prolonging a conflict he cannot win.

MOSCOW, September 23. /TASS/. France and other Western states have backed a wave of recognition of Palestine at the UN General Assembly; Russia may continue adhering to New START nuclear limits for one year after the treaty lapsing in 2026; and Moscow and Washington are preparing a third round of talks to reduce bilateral tensions. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

On September 22, France became another nation in the latest wave to join the recognition of the independent State of Palestine on the sidelines of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly, with the announcement made by French President Emmanuel Macron. According to Ofer Bronstein, special adviser to the French leader on Middle Eastern affairs, such recognition is expected to spark a ""small diplomatic tsunami,"" prompting more states to acknowledge Palestine. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti believe that Western recognition of Palestine is mainly symbolic, but could paradoxically obstruct the creation of a viable Palestinian state while pushing Israel to expand settlements rather than engage in peace negotiations.

According to Politico, Macron's goal is indeed to motivate other Western states to grant recognition. The French move is based on Macron's personal stance, head of the Section for Regional Issues and Conflicts in the Department of European Political Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Pavel Timofeev told Vedomosti.

Recognition from the UK, France, Canada, Australia, and Portugal is largely symbolic - while it may slightly boost the international standing of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), it is unlikely to produce major changes ""on the ground,"" research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Lyudmila Samarskaya told the newspaper.

Pavel Timofeev agreed that the step is mostly symbolic. ""According to France's concept, if moderate groups win elections in Gaza and Hamas is sidelined, this will enable Western nations to deliver financial and other backing to a 'democratic Gaza', steering it toward dialogue with Israel under a two-state framework,"" the expert noted.

Samarskaya added that ""this new recognition wave also shows the decline of Israel's foreign policy standing, particularly among European states. While personal sanctions carry little influence, any EU economic restrictions against Israel would be highly sensitive, since the union is one of Jerusalem's top trading partners. Yet such measures are unlikely to be serious. The psychological effect would be far greater.""

At the same time, Samarskaya stressed that the ongoing wave of recognition complicates the chances of building a viable Palestinian state, giving grounds for implementing the Knesset's decision to annex the West Bank. Although extending Israeli sovereignty over the entire West Bank or even part of it appears too risky given the Abraham Accords with Arab states, expanding settlements in response may well be the path Israel opts for, she suggested.

 

Russia is willing to adhere to the key restrictions of the New START Treaty for one year after its expiry in February 2026, President Vladimir Putin announced during a meeting with members of the Security Council. According to the president, Moscow is prepared to take this step in order to avoid provoking a strategic arms race. At the same time, Putin acknowledged that the situation in the field of strategic stability keeps worsening. Experts believe the Russian leader's remarks are a signal of intent to preserve New START and negotiate new agreements. However, further dialogue will depend on Washington's willingness to consider the arsenals of NATO allies - namely, France and the United Kingdom.

""Russia is ready, after February 5, 2026, to continue for one year to uphold the central quantitative limits of the New START Treaty. Thereafter, based on an assessment of the situation, we will make a decision regarding the future maintenance of these voluntary self-restrictions,"" Putin declared.

In early 2021, the two sides prolonged the treaty until February 5, 2026. It was expected that during this period, Russia and the United States would develop a document or a set of documents on strategic stability to succeed New START. Until February 2022, Moscow and Washington indeed held consultations, but with the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, that dialogue was suspended at Washington's initiative.

Putin's latest remarks represent a clear sign of readiness to resume such dialogue, research fellow at the Center for International Security of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Vasily Klimov told Izvestia. ""Putin's statement indicates readiness, taking into account the requirements set out in 2023, to preserve this vital arms control agreement and to begin negotiations on arrangements that would replace New START,"" the expert said.

Nevertheless, rapprochement between Russia and the United States on issues of strategic stability is still distant, Director of the Center for Military and Economic Studies at the Higher School of Economics' Institute of World Military Economy and Strategy Prokhor Tebin said. ""Tense relations between Russia and the West remain. As for the United States, there are certain hopes for improvement, but they have not yet led to a substantial change in the situation,"" the expert emphasized.

Unless the United States agrees to include the nuclear arsenals of the United Kingdom and France and acknowledges the link between strategic offensive and defensive weapons, speaking of convergence in the sphere of strategic stability is premature, Vasily Klimov stressed.

 

Russia and the United States are currently coordinating the time and venue for the third round of consultations aimed at removing ""irritants"" in bilateral ties, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Izvestia. The ministry stressed that it expects the meeting to occur soon. Following two previous rounds of talks, Moscow and Washington managed to resolve the most pressing issues, with the resumption of direct air service now priority on the agenda. Experts told Izvestia that the pause in negotiations has lasted too long and that a new impetus is necessary to revive the Russia-US dialogue.

""The timing and location of the third round of consultations on the so-called irritants in Russian-American relations are currently being coordinated. We expect them to take place in the near future,"" the Russian diplomatic service told Izvestia.

""Without delving into technical details, we would like to point out that the current agenda includes genuinely important matters, the resolution of which requires time, political will, and a certain sensitivity in conducting negotiations. This is why logistical parameters inevitably take a back seat,"" the Foreign Ministry underlined.

The pause in negotiations has been lengthy, and the initial drive toward restoring Russia-US relations that was visible earlier this year has faded, Valdai Club expert Andrey Kortunov told Izvestia. ""Although these are technical issues, they depend on the overall climate of bilateral relations and on decisions made at the highest level,"" the expert noted.

Despite the difficulties of the Ukrainian settlement process, Moscow and Washington have already signaled interest in cooperation in several areas. Direct flights between Russia and the United States could be restored by the end of 2025, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Special Presidential Envoy on Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, suggested in mid-June.

A second promising area is space cooperation. Joint manned flights to the Moon with the United States are feasible, Deputy Director General for manned space programs at Roscosmos Sergey Krikalev told Izvestia.

Opportunities also remain open in the economic sphere. Putin previously declared Russia's readiness to cooperate with the United States in the extraction of rare-earth metals. In March, Dmitriev told Izvestia that Moscow and Washington were holding discussions on joint projects in this sector.

 

The concept of an ""Arab NATO,"" proposed by Egypt in response to Israeli strikes on Qatar earlier this month, has collapsed at the stage of initial discussions. Experts doubt that Gulf states will abandon the Abraham Accords, noting that Israel's supply of advanced surveillance technologies has made regional security structures heavily reliant on Israeli intelligence, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

Sources from the Emirati newspaper The National reported that the recent summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Qatar was expected to focus on the idea of an ""Arab NATO."" According to their information, the proposal was submitted by Egypt in response to the Israeli strikes on Qatar on September 9. Under this project, a military bloc based on the LAS could have been formed, with forces able to operate on land, in the air, and at sea, in order to counter existential threats.

Middle Eastern and North African states were unable to reach consensus on the idea of an ""Arab NATO,"" sources told the Qatari portal The Middle East Eye (MEE). According to them, the process stalled due to several factors, including disputes among Arab actors over who could take command of the bloc's forces. Egypt, as one of the key architects of the idea, maintained that it should oversee the military mechanism, while Saudi Arabia sought the same role, MEE's sources said. Another version, previously circulated, claimed that the creation of the bloc was blocked by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who preferred an ""Arab NATO"" under Gulf leadership.

As a result, Arab states opted for the idea of diplomatic pressure on the administration of US President Donald Trump, which they believe wields the greatest influence over the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Contacts at Le Figaro within French intelligence working with the Persian Gulf expressed skepticism about the ability of Gulf players to fully give up the Abraham Accords. According to a Le Figaro source, the transfer of advanced Israeli spyware to Arab countries had been a central element of Israeli diplomacy for over a decade. The source warned that Israeli intelligence services had invested so deeply in the security framework of the Gulf that regional players are now completely dependent on them.

 

The price of gold futures on the New York Comex exchange on September 22 climbed past $3,750 per ounce for the first time in history, rising 1.23% in Monday morning trading to $3,751.5. Previously, the precious metal had set a record on September 17, when it rose above $3,744 following the US Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4-4.25% annually. Analysts interviewed by Vedomosti agree that gold's rally is driven by Fed easing, declining faith in the dollar, central banks' reserve diversification, and geopolitical risks.

The upward movement in gold prices has persisted for three years and is being supported by three key factors, Alexander Golovtsov, head of the analytical department at PSB Asset Management explained. First, the global cycle of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve has ended, giving way to monetary easing: interest rates in advanced economies and in China are approaching zero, heightening inflation risks and increasing the appeal of gold as a store of value. Second, the situation with Russian currency reserves has pushed many central banks to boost their gold holdings while cutting their exposure to the dollar and the euro. Third, concerns over fiscal stability in the US and other advanced economies have undermined confidence in paper currencies overall and strengthened the desire of investors to diversify into tangible assets, the expert concluded.

Gold prices are rising primarily due to expectations of further Fed rate cuts, as the US economy shows signs of cooling, senior analyst at Sinara Investment Bank Sergey Krivokhizhin told the newspaper. This is happening against the backdrop of a weakening US dollar, which typically supports commodity markets and gold.

Analysts at Finam also identified geopolitics as one of the factors bolstering gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. The conflict in the Middle East is far from resolved, while tensions surrounding Venezuela are also escalating, Finam analyst Nikolay Dudchenko noted.

The current price reflects waning trust in the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, director of the wealth management department at AF Capital Ruslan Klyshko said. Accordingly, the forecasts of major banks anticipate a price range of $3,800-4,000 per ounce by the end of the year, with the possibility of surpassing these levels under favorable conditions, the expert believes.

LUGANSK, September 23. /TASS/. NATO is looking for alternative platforms to counter Russia and is using Moldova as an additional platform for its aggressive policy against Russia, military expert Andrey Marochko has said.

""It's already becoming clear to NATO and Western military leadership that sooner or later Ukraine will suffer a defeat on the frontline. This is easy to calculate. In order to find alternative platforms for countering Russia and continuing its aggressive policy additional footholds and sites are being prepared. Moldova has been considered as an alternative since Kiev's crackdown on Donbass began in 2014. Therefore, I do not rule out that this spot on the map could become the next hotbed of tension due to actions by the Western countries,"" he said.

Marochko doubts that NATO would deploy its contingents in Odessa. However, he remarked, ""NATO sponsors have long been present in Odessa, conducting subversive activities against Russia. Earlier, the press bureau of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) said that the European Union ""intends to occupy Moldova."" Preparations are currently underway to deploy NATO troops to Ukraine's Odessa Region, and NATO military units are also concentrating in Romania near the Moldovan border.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump told the assembled European leaders that they were destroying their own countries in a move that was ‘basically Maga madlibs'

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump may have been speaking to the 192 other world leaders gathered in the United Nations, but the real target of his speech on Tuesday was Europe, which was hauled up repeatedly as the whipping boy for an antiliberal, blood-and-soil polemic that renewed an assault on the transatlantic relationship that has become a theme of his second administration.

In an hourlong address to the assembled world leaders and delegations, Trump told European leaders directly that they were destroying their own countries – and that they should be more like the US as he condemned their policies on immigration, green energy and political correctness.

These were not subtle digs. On migration, he told Europeans that “your countries are going to hell.” On Europe's approach to climate change, he said it was “on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda”. On the war in Ukraine, he said Europe was “funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?”

He even found time to target local politicians such as Sadiq Khan, whom he called a “terrible, terrible mayor” and said that London “wants to go to Sharia law”. There was a barrage of claims about immigrants and questionable statistics about the prison populations in Germany and “beautiful Switzerland”. At moments, he would not have been out of place running for European parliament.

“If you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail,” he said during the speech. “I'm the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by [green] energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.”

This is red meat for his supporters, and observers from across the aisle in the United States quickly identified Trump's likely audience as his own base. The first 10 minutes were almost a classic stump speech, with Trump telling foreign leaders about how well he had handled inflation and that after just eight months in office “we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close”.

But then he turned his gaze to the failures of the United Nations and other world leaders – in which an aide forecast that he would denounce “globalists”. US conservatives would have been delighted to watch Trump tear into European liberals, who were forced to watch and politely applaud as they were accused of gross mismanagement of their countries.

“Let's not pretend this is a foreign policy speech or dignify it by calling it one,” wrote Ned Price, a former deputy to the US representative to the United Nations during the Biden administration. “This is basically Maga madlibs. Trump is speaking to his political base, hitting each of his campaign trail hits, while addressing a room of leaders who'd rather be just about anywhere else.”

If Trump's speech did have a foreign policy predecessor, it would be JD Vance's address earlier this year at the Munich security conference, when the US vice-president launched into a tirade against European leaders over conservative hobby horses including migration and claims that Europe was stifling free speech.

“No voter on this continent went to the ballot box to open the floodgates to millions of unvetted immigrants,” Vance told them during a speech that the EU's top diplomat said sounded like he was “trying to pick a fight”. “If you are running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing America can do for you.”

Trump didn't mention European voters on Tuesday, but he did accuse European leaders of “destroying your heritage” – a claim shared by rightwing groups in Europe with whom the US president and his allies have been increasingly friendly.

“You're doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct,” he told them mockingly. Once again, it sounded very much like the administration was seeking to pick a fight with Europe.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The gift, one of Scott's largest single donations, will help UNCF build a $370m pooled endowment for its 37 HBCUs

Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated $70m to the UNCF, as the nation's largest private provider of scholarships to minority students works to raise $1bn to strengthen all 37 of its historically Black colleges and universities.

The gift is one of Scott's largest single donations ever and among the first to be publicly disclosed in 2025. Famously private, Scott only discusses her donations through her website and does not confirm them until after the recipients do.

“This extraordinary gift is a powerful vote of confidence in HBCUs and in the work of UNCF,” the non-profit's president and chief executive officer Dr Michael L Lomax told the Associated Press in a statement. “It provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our member institutions to build permanent assets that will support students and campuses for decades to come.”

Lomax said Scott's donation would be used for UNCF's pooled endowment, which aims to establish a $370m fund – $10m for each UNCF member HBCU. That fund will be invested and designed to pay out about 4% annually, which will then be divided among the HBCUs to help stabilize their budgets. Increasing HBCU endowments is a priority since they trail endowments at non-HBCUs by 70%, according to the UNCF.

The broader $1bn fundraising effort is an attempt to help HBCUs address the funding disparity they face when compared to other colleges and universities. A 2023 study by philanthropic research group Candid and ABFE, a non-profit that advocates for investments in Black communities, found that the eight Ivy League schools received $5.5bn from the 1,000 largest US foundations compared to $45m for the 99 HBCUs in 2019.

Since Scott, a novelist who received the bulk of her fortune after divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, promising to donate more than half her wealth, HBCUs have been among her favorite grantees. She previously gave UNCF $10m in 2020.

Though Scott hasn't addressed HBCU donations specifically, she wrote in 2020 that her funding decisions were “driven by a deep belief in the value different backgrounds bring to problem-solving on any issue”.

Scott hasn't made any announcements about her giving since she acknowledged $2bn in gifts in 2024, bringing her total to $19.2bn. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is now about $34bn.

Her unusual donations – which are much larger than most foundations give at one time and carry no restrictions on when they can be used or what they can be used for – financially strengthened the non-profits that received them, said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which studied Scott's giving over three years.

“We didn't see the fears people predicted come to pass,” said Buchanan, who disclosed that the Center for Effective Philanthropy received a one-time $10m grant from Scott. Though some worried that the large gifts would cause the recipients to increase staffing too much or hurt their fundraising efforts, Buchanan said their study of 2,000 non-profits saw little evidence of that. “Folks are pretty prudent,” he said. “This shows that if you carefully vet non-profits, we can trust them to make good use of funds.”

It's a lesson that UNCF hopes other funders will learn, following Scott's example.

“We are deeply grateful for MacKenzie Scott's continued support,” Lomax said. “By entrusting UNCF to decide how best to use these funds, she affirms that HBCUs merit investment at this scale and her generosity will strengthen our member institutions and provide pathways to success for tomorrow's changemakers.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Chuck Schumer says Trump is ‘running from negotiating table' after president wrote meeting wouldn't be productive

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would not meet with top congressional Democrats to discuss their demands for keeping the federal government open, prompting Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer to accuse the president of “running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there”.

Congress is up against a 30 September deadline to authorize more funding or spark a shutdown that would see many federal agencies close their doors and furlough workers. While Republicans have proposed continuing funding through 21 November to allow passage of legislation authorizing spending for the rest of the fiscal year, Democrats have seized on the deadline to demand their healthcare priorities be addressed.

Schumer together with his House counterpart, minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, had called for a meeting with Trump to discuss the impasse, and on Tuesday morning announced the president had agreed to sit down.

“In the meeting, we will emphasize the importance of addressing rising costs, including the Republican healthcare crisis. It's past time to meet and work to avoid a Republican-caused shutdown,” they said in a joint statement.

Hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he would not be meeting with the Democrats.

“After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” the president said.

He dangled the possibility of future talks with the Democrats “if they get serious about the future of our Nation”.

“We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed. I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter. They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand,” Trump added.

On X, Jeffries wrote that Trump “just cancelled a high stakes meeting” and “the extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.”

“Trump Always Chickens Out,” Jeffries said, repeating a saying that spread earlier this year amid the president's uneven imposition of tariffs.

Schumer said in a statement: “Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there. While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job.”

A White House spokesperson declined to comment on whether Trump had initially agreed to meet with the Democrats.

Democrats have proposed legislation funding the government through 31 October, while also undoing changes to Medicaid that Republicans enacted earlier this year, which are expected to cost millions of people their healthcare. They are also including an extension of subsidies for the costs of healthcare plans under the Affordable Care Act, along with the restoration of public media funding that Republicans cut earlier this year and a prohibition on Trump's “pocket rescission” of foreign aid funding.

Both parties have included in their funding bills additional money for the security of Congress, judges and executive branch officials in response to Charlie Kirk's assassination. Republicans have proposed $88m in spending, while Democrats have offered $326m.

Beijing is conducting a sophisticated campaign to demoralize Taiwanese by exploiting their economic anxieties and fear of war, a report released yesterday by a civil research organization showed.

China has been engaged in a systematic campaign to construct a narrative of “Taiwan defeatism” to encourage Taiwanese acquiescence, Information Operations Research Group codirector Yu Chih-hao (游知澔) told a news conference in Taipei.

The defeatist narrative is formed by framing news about Taiwan's foreign affairs, national defense, economic issues and democracy with messaging that depicts the nation as weak and dependent on foreign powers, Yu said.

Photo: Chen Yi-kuan, Taipei Times

People who identify as both Taiwanese and Chinese have positive views of China's economy and negative views of the Democratic Progressive Party government, and are more likely to accept defeatism, he said.

The types of issues Beijing seeks to leverage to spread defeatism reflect Taiwanese fears of being abandoned by allies, conflicted national identity and lack of education in national security matters, he said.

The defeatist worldview, built to dovetail with other Chinese information campaigns, creates a sense of crisis and then presents acquiescence to China as its solution, he said.

The promotion of defeatist messages is being timed to put a negative spin on specific events as they happen in real time, such as Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises, he said.

The vectors for Chinese propaganda include Taiwanese politicians and political pundits, social media accounts under the management of unknown organizations or individuals, Beijing's leadership and state-run media, he said.

Chinese propaganda routinely quotes Taiwanese opposition figures, and makes use of idioms and phrases typically used in China to homogenize Taiwanese culture, language and public discourse, Yu said.

Citing a poll the center conducted last year, Yu said that 46 percent of Taiwanese are pessimistic about the nation's economy and national security, suggesting a high level of potential susceptibility to Beijing's propaganda.

TikTok users are more likely to approve of China and express pessimism about the economy, he said.

Chinese propaganda preys on anxiety and a sense of helplessness, especially in disinformation campaigns aimed at sowing division in Taiwan, he said.

The executive branch should enhance information governance, regulate the quality of open source media and emphasize critical reading skills in education, Yu said.

Academics should deepen interdisciplinary study of the information environment in Taiwan and promote public educational efforts, while Taiwanese should be more critical of the information they encounter online and base their discussion about public affairs on verifiable facts, he said.

The Information Operations Research Group seeks to spread public awareness about information manipulation.



                                                                                One of two tropical depressions that formed off Taiwan yesterday morning could turn into a moderate typhoon by the weekend, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said yesterday.
Tropical Depression No. 21 formed at 8am about 1,850km off the southeast coast, CWA forecaster Lee Meng-hsuan (李孟軒) said.
The weather system is expected to move northwest as it builds momentum, possibly intensifying this weekend into a typhoon, which would be called Mitag, Lee said.
The radius of the storm is expected to reach almost 200km, she said.
It is forecast to approach the southeast of Taiwan on Monday next week and pass through the Bashi Channel                                    


WARNING:
                                        People in coastal areas need to beware of heavy swells and strong winds, and those in mountainous areas should brace for heavy rain, the CWA said                                        The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday issued sea and land warnings for Typhoon Ragasa, forecasting that it would continue to intensify and affect the nation the most today and tomorrow. 
People in Hualien and Taitung counties, and mountainous areas in Yilan and Pingtung counties, should brace for damage caused by extremely heavy rain brought by the typhoon's outer rim, as it was upgraded to a super typhoon yesterday morning, the CWA said. 
As of 5:30pm yesterday, the storm's center was about 630km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip, moving northwest at 21kph, and its maximum wind speed had reached                                    



                                                                                The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday said that it expected to issue a sea warning for Typhoon Ragasa this morning and a land warning at night as it approached Taiwan.
Ragasa intensified from a tropical storm into a typhoon at 8am yesterday, the CWA said, adding that at 2pm, it was about 1,110km east-southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip.
The typhoon was moving northwest at 13kph, with sustained winds of up to 119kph and gusts reaching 155kph, the CWA Web site showed.
Forecaster Liu Pei-teng (劉沛滕) said that Ragasa was projected to strengthen as it neared the Bashi Channel, with its 200km                                    


PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS:
                                        Hualien and Taitung counties declared today a typhoon day, while schools and offices in parts of Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties are also to close                                        Typhoon Ragasa was forecast to hit its peak strength and come closest to Taiwan from yesterday afternoon through today, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said.
Taiwan proper could be out of the typhoon's radius by midday and the sea warning might be lifted tonight, it added.
CWA senior weather specialist Wu Wan-hua (伍婉華) said that Ragasa's radius had reached the Hengchun Peninsula by 11am yesterday and was expected to hit Taitung County and Kaohsiung by yesterday evening.
Ragasa was forecast to move to Taiwan's southern offshore areas last night and to its southwestern offshore areas early today, she added.
As of 8pm last night,                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

MAEBASHI — A blue-eyed doll on display at the main entrance of Tone Elementary School in Numata, Gunma Prefecture, is one of 12,739 dolls gifted as a token of friendship by the United States before World War II.

While many of them were targets of hatred as dolls of the enemy and destroyed, this school's doll, named Mary-chan, was hidden away in a cupboard and survived unscathed. The doll is now preserved as a reminder of the importance of peace for children.

Mitsu Araki, 97, from Maebashi, first saw Mary-chan in 1934 when she entered the then Azumamura elementary and junior high school in Numata, where her father, Takeo Kaneko, served as vice principal. Araki said she still remembered when she first encountered the 40-centimeter-tall doll sitting on a cabinet in the school staff room and thought Mary-chan was “cute, with strong features different from Japanese dolls, and wearing a pretty cape.”

The blue-eyed dolls were gifted to Japanese kindergartens and elementary schools by a private group in the United States in 1927. Following the enforcement of the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned immigration from Japan to the United States, a missionary with a positive view on Japan was concerned about bilateral relations souring and called upon Americans to send friendship dolls to Japanese children. Of the 12,739 dolls collected, about 140 arrived in Gunma Prefecture. Mary-chan was one of those dolls.

Welcoming ceremonies were held across the prefecture, and the dolls “met” Japanese dolls brought by children at the Hina Matsuri Doll Festival in March. The situation changed dramatically when the war between Japan and the United States began in 1941. They were seen as dolls from an enemy country, and many were stabbed with bamboo spears or burned.

At the Azumamura school, teachers had many meetings to discuss what to do with Mary-chan, but no conclusion was reached. Kaneko, who was entrusted with the decision, thought he could not destroy the doll because it came as a messenger of peace. He hid it in a sewing room cabinet while on night duty.

Back then, his students were being drafted one after another, and Araki said, “My father may have been making a plea, saying ‘I am protecting you, so please don't take the lives of Japan's young people.'”

Mary-chan saw the light of day again in 1966. It was found when the school building was being demolished to build a new one. After its story was featured on a television program in 1973, other friendship dolls were discovered nationwide, with over 300 confirmed to date.

During the war, Araki studied at the prefectural teacher's school in Maebashi while living in the dormitory. She did not know that her father was agonizing over the doll. Even after the war ended, he had never spoke of the hidden doll to others. However, after the TV program, he started talking about the doll with his family.

“I want to honor him for his courage to hide the doll and wish for peace,” Araki said as she reminisced about her deeply sincere father.

Araki visited her alma mater for the first time in 13 years last spring to meet Mary-chan at the entrance. It will soon be 100 years since the doll's arrival in Japan.

“Thank you for your long service,” she said.

Another doll also called Mary-chan is at Niragawa Elementary School in Ota, the same prefecture. The then principal hid it away in a cupboard as “the doll did nothing wrong.”

This Mary-chan is displayed in the principal's office but had been exhibited at the city's Nittanosho History Museum until the end of August.

The exhibition was organized by Tetsuya Maezawa, 65, a modern military history researcher and historical writer. His uncle, who graduated from Niragawa, died in battle in the Philippines in 1945 at the age of 25. Maezawa displayed a panel photo of his uncle in the exhibition.

“I was finally able to reunite my uncle with Mary-chan. I hope children will feel how precious peace is,” Maezawa said.

Key developments on Sept. 23: 

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sept. 23 that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace.

When asked whether NATO allies should fire on Russian planes entering their territory, Trump replied: ""Yes, I do.""

He was speaking at a joint briefing with President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly.

Russia has violated the airspace of several NATO member states in recent weeks, including Poland, Romania, and Estonia. On Sept. 19, three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace before being intercepted by NATO aircraft.

Asked further by a reporter on whether the U.S. would back NATO allies if they shot down a Russian aircraft, Trump said: ""That depends on the circumstances. We are very strong toward NATO.""

Earlier on Sept. 23, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a CBS interview that NATO had not discussed shooting down Russian jets unless they were attacking. He said NATO's response to such intrusions has been to intercept the aircraft, and that this practice would continue.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York on Sept. 23.

The meeting, their fourth since Trump returned to office in January, comes amid rising tensions between NATO and Moscow over Russian aerial incursions into allied countries, while the U.S. push to broker peace in Ukraine has stalled.

""We have great respect for the fight Ukraine is putting up. It is pretty amazing,"" Trump told journalists. ""We have a lot of meetings scheduled today going pretty late into the night, but this is an important one.""

Asked about progress since his last meeting with Zelensky, Trump pointed to the state of Russia's economy and Ukraine's resilience. ""Well, the biggest progress is that the Russian economy is terrible right now. It's crashing. And frankly, Ukraine is doing a very good job of stopping this very large army. It's pretty amazing,"" Trump said.

""This was supposed to be quick, three or four days, but it's been three and a half years of very hard fighting. Russia doesn't look very distinguished,"" American president added, saying the war looks like ""it's not going to end for a long time.""

The Ukrainian president spoke about developments on the battlefield, saying Ukrainian troops had advanced some 360 kilometers (223 miles) in recent weeks and inflicted losses on Russian forces.

""Thanks to our soldiers, we have this possibility, this opportunity, and we will continue until Russia stops this war,"" Zelensky said.

Ukrainian forces struck the 8-N linear production dispatching station near the village of Naitopovichi in Russia's Bryansk Oblast overnight on Sept. 23, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The news comes as Ukraine escalates attacks against Russian oil infrastructure, a key source of revenue helping Moscow fund its all-out invasion.

The Bryansk Oblast facility is part of the main oil pipeline system 8-N — Stalnoy Kon (Steel Horse) linear production dispatching station and is considered strategically important for supplying fuel to the Russian military.

Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure in the area of Naitopovichi, a village some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border.

In a separate attack, Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces again targeted the Samara dispatching station in Russia's Samara Oblast.

The facility blends high- and low-sulfur crude oil from various fields to produce the Urals export-grade oil. Samara Oblast lies some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.

Ukraine carried out drone strikes on Moscow throughout the night of Sept. 23, Mayor Sergey Sobyanin reported, adding that dozens of unmanned aircraft were downed.

Sobyanin began reporting on the drone attacks on the evening of Sept. 22 and continued to update throughout the night. Thirty-four Ukrainian drones flying toward Moscow were shot down as of around 9 a.m. local time, he said.

According to Russia's Defense Ministry, a total of 69 Ukrainian drones were shot down over nine Russian regions, including Moscow Oblast, as well as over occupied Crimea overnight on Sept. 23.

Airspace over the Russian capital was closed due to the drone attack, prompting a temporary suspension of operations at Moscow's airports.

Emergency services were dispatched to the sites where drone debris had fallen, the mayor said. No casualties or damage were reported.

Russian troops have not yet come close to encircling the town of Kupiansk in Kharkiv Oblast, Federico Borsari, a security expert at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), told the Kyiv Independent on Sept. 23.

His comment follows Russian claims that Kupiansk, a strategically important town in northeastern Ukraine, had been encircled.

Victor Tregubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, also denied these claims, saying that Russia is trying to advance toward Kupiansk from the north.

""Russian forces are currently not close to fully encircling Kupiansk, although they have made incremental gains and are intensifying their efforts on multiple axes,"" Borsari said.

According to the expert, Russia's renewed push to capture the town is primarily driven by a combination of ""strategic logistical imperatives,"" the objective of creating a more favorable operational environment for future offensives, and the desire to regain lost territory to show some progress ""domestically.""

Russia occupied the town after the outbreak of the full-scale invasion in 2022, but was pushed out during a Ukrainian counteroffensive in the fall of that year.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

""Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,"" NATO said in a statement. 



Former detainees reported experiencing a broad array of torture and ill-treatment during their captivity.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated.

Airports in Copenhagen and Oslo suspended operations for several hours late on Sept. 22 following drone sightings in the area, forcing flight diversions and disrupting travel for thousands of passengers.""CPH (Copenhagen) Airport is currently closed for takeoffs and landings, as two to three larger drones have been observed flying in the area,"" the police said in a statement posted on X at approximately 8:46 p.m. local time. 

A spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that all traffic at Denmark's largest airport had been suspended but declined to provide further details. At least 15 flights were diverted to other airports, according to flight-tracking site FlightRadar24.

Elsewhere in the region, two foreign nationals were arrested in Oslo for flying drones near a military site. 

""Two foreign nationals arrested for drone flying within the prohibited zone,"" Oslo police reported at 9:10 p.m. local time.

Copenhagen Airport reopened at around 0:30 a.m. local time after being shut for nearly four hours. In Norway's Oslo, flights also resumed following roughly four hours of restricted airspace.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the incident must be viewed in the context of recent cyberattacks against European airports and Russian aerial incursions inside NATO territory.

Many European NATO members have been on edge after recent airspace violations by Russian drones in Poland and Romania and fighter jets in Estonia.

When asked whether Copenhagen suspects Russian involvement in the latest incident, Frederiksen said the option cannot be ruled out.

""I cannot rule out that it is Russia. We have seen drones over Poland that should not have been there. We have seen activity in Romania. We have seen violations of Estonian airspace,"" Frederiksen said.

""Therefore, I can only say that, in my view, this is a serious attack on critical Danish infrastructure.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed suggestions of Russian involvement as ""unfounded.""

The type of the detected drones was not disclosed. Copenhagen's deputy police inspector said at a press conference that Danish police will work with Norwegian authorities to determine whether the two incidents are connected.

""We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,"" Danish Police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told journalists on Sept. 23. ""It's an actor who has the capabilities, the will, and the tools to show off in this way.""

Swedish outlet Sydsvenskeren reported that several flights were diverted to Malmo, a city in southern Sweden, located east of Copenhagen across the Oresund strait that separates the two countries.

Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are all NATO members and have been staunch allies of Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Opinion: The comments of the U.S. Ambassador to Canada reveal a shocking ignorance and disdain","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-pete-hoekstra-us-ambassador-canada-shocking-ignorance-disdain/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:43:21 GMT","

U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra speaks with the media in Fredericton, on Sept. 19.Stephen MacGillivray/The Canadian Press

Most Canadians say they'll never trust the United States the way they once did, according to a new poll.

Conducted by Ipsos for Global News, the poll found that 60 per cent of those surveyed believe Canada won't ever be able to rely on their southern neighbour the same way, while 71 per cent feel the trade dispute that upended the countries' long-standing friendship will continue for years.

These results have no doubt perplexed and angered some Americans, including the current U.S. Ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra.

Mr. Hoekstra made news last week when he told an audience in Halifax that he was “disappointed” with Canada's reaction to the tariffs President Donald Trump has placed on some Canadian imports. Earlier this year, Mr. Hoekstra had downplayed Mr. Trump's stated desire to make this country the “cherished 51st state“ of the U.S., saying it was merely a “term of endearment.”

Ultimately, the ambassador can't understand why politicians in Canada would respond to these developments in a hostile manner. 

“A cabinet minister came out and said, ‘We're in a trade war with the United States, we're at war with the United States,'” Mr. Hoekstra said last week. “I think that's a dangerous place to go.”

Canada focused on tariff relief as it begins consultations on USMCA review, LeBlanc says

A dangerous place to go? How so? Could Mr. Trump misinterpret the remarks and then urge his Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to get troops at the ready? 

Clearly, anyone in Canada who has used the term “war” to describe what has happened over the last several months is talking about “economic war.” And Mr. Hoekstra, a seasoned politician, knows that.

What is really shocking about his statements, however, is just how tone-deaf and arrogant they are. Can the man not even begin to understand why Canadians might be upset with tariffs that are devastating our domestic economy? Tariffs that are based, in large part, on a bogus rationale: that fentanyl is pouring into the U.S. from Canada – an allegation that even America's own border agency can't back up with proof, because it's not true.

And Mr. Hoekstra can't seem to believe Canadians would be upset with a President who has repeatedly said he wants to annex Canada – to make it part of the States. Can you imagine what the reaction would be in the U.S. if anyone, let alone the leader of another country, threatened the sovereignty of America? What would Donald Trump say to that?

But Mr. Hoekstra wants us to believe it was all just a form of flattery. Sorry – no one is buying that. And I suspect there are few in Canada who believe we have heard the end of this fantasy of Mr. Trump's. 

Opinion: To counter Trump's tariffs, Canada must invest in life sciences

Someone with more diplomatic chops, with a little more international savvy, would have handled this entire confab with far more agility than Mr. Hoekstra. A seasoned envoy might have recognized the upset that exists in this country and attempted to smooth things over a bit, instead of suggesting Canadian politicians button their lips or watch what they say. The rest of us should just be grateful, apparently, that we live in the shadow of such a great nation.

This is not Mr. Hoekstra's first stint as an ambassador. He previously served in the position in the Netherlands during Mr. Trump's first term. That did not go smoothly. When remarks he made at a right-wing conference in 2015 – in which he claimed Dutch politicians were being “burned” by Muslim immigrants – resurfaced, he denied making them, saying it was fake news. But when he was presented with video evidence of his comments, he had no choice but to backtrack and apologize for the untrue remark.

It's doubtful that the Ambassador's admonishment of Canadians over their reaction to the U.S. and its economic decisions in the last several months will do anything to change the current mood here. Many are watching what is taking place in America at the moment and are horrified by what they see. We barely recognize a country we thought we knew well.

There is a reason that travel to the U.S. from Canada has plunged over the last several months, and it's not just because of the gut punch the tariffs delivered. It's also because many see an autocracy beginning to take shape where one of the world's greatest democracies once existed. Some genuinely worry they might get apprehended at the border and sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) centre in Louisiana for some spurious reason. 

I'm afraid Mr. Hoekstra doesn't see his own country the way many others do. As for Canada, he would be advised to lecture a little less and listen a whole lot more.

Kenvue's logo is displayed during its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. The company says there's no scientific link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism.Brendan McDermid/Reuters

Kenvue KVUE-N  bounced back sharply at the opening bell Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump instructed pregnant women around a dozen times during the White House news conference Monday, also urging mothers not to give their infants the drug, known by the generic name acetaminophen in the U.S. or paracetamol in most other countries.

Shares of the New Jersey consumer brands company tumbled 7.5 per cent Monday. At the open of trading, shares bounced back by more than 6 per cent.

The announcement, which appeared to rely on existing studies rather than significant new research, arrives as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, advances the Make America Healthy Again movement that has focused on what it sees as potential causes of autism.

Kenvue disputed any link between the drug and autism this week and warned that if pregnant mothers don't use Tylenol when in need, they could face a dangerous choice between suffering fevers or using riskier alternatives.

What the research says about Tylenol, pregnancy and autism

Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023 because it was thought that the companies could function more efficiently if they were independent from each other. Aside from Tylenol, the consumer health company makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other household brand names.

Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni wrote that he sees a limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump's announcement, but thinks “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.”

Falorni anticipates a positive reaction for Kenvue's stock at the opening bell on Tuesday given the lack of new scientific evidence.

The company has fought hundreds of lawsuits related to the product and its alleged ties to autism, but most have been dismissed.

Tylenol made headlines in the 1980s when seven people in the Chicago area were killed after taking the over-the-counter painkiller laced with cyanide. The incident triggered a nationwide panic and led to an overhaul in the safety of over-the-counter medication packaging. No one was ever charged in the deaths.

The West African states, led by military juntas, said they don't recognize the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction and want to create ""indigenous mechanisms"" to secure peace and justice.

Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger on Monday announced their withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In a joint statement, the military-led West African states said that the court's jurisdiction had ""transformed into an instrument of neocolonial repression in the hands of imperialism.""

Because of this, the neighboring states accused the ICC of becoming ""a global example of selective justice.""

""The ICC has proven itself incapable of handling and prosecuting proven war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide, and crimes of aggression,"" the West African states said.

The military-led countries have previously used this same argument to justify their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

The three states also said they wanted to create ""indigenous mechanisms for the consolidation of peace and justice"".

The juntas, which toppled the governments in Bamako, Ouagadougou and Niamey after coups between 2020 and 2023, have since formed a confederation called the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).

They have actively distanced themselves from the West, notably from former colonial ruler France and have moved closer toward Russia for military cooperation.

The West African countries are currently in the grip of deadly violence from jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the so-called ""Islamic State"", but their armies have also been accused of committing crimes against civilians. 

The ICC is a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is intended to complement existing national judicial systems.

The court is headquartered in The Hague, and has prosecuted some of the world's worst crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity since 2002.

Global powers, the United States, China, and Russia are not members of the ICC because they have not ratified the Rome Statute, which is the treaty which established the court.

Israel is also not a member and does not recognize ICC jurisdiction over its nationals or territory.

Donald Trump has strongly criticized the United Nations in his speech to the UN General Assembly, where leaders from over 140 countries have gathered. DW has more.

Read below for a roundup of the latest news, analyses and videos on the United Nations' 80th General Assembly session on September 23, 2025.

US President Donald Trump appeared to shift his rhetoric about the war in Ukraine, following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.

""After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" Trump wrote in his social media platform Truth Social.

""With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option,"" Trump added.

Trump said Russia had been fighting ""aimlessly"" in a war that a ""real military power"" would have won in less than a week.

""Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act,"" the US president said, adding that he wished both countries well and that the US will ""continue to supply weapons to NATO for NATO to do what they want with them.""

As the UN General Assembly was underway, Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, addressed the Security Council over a recent Israeli strike on Doha.

Israeli warplanes attacked a residential area in the Qatari capital on September 9, hitting the residence of Hamas leaders and their families.

Six people were killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas' top negotiator and a Qatari security officer.

""No party seeks to assassinate a negotiating delegation except with the aim of thwarting the negotiations,"" Tamim told the Security Council.

He called the strike a ""treacherous assault"" and ""a blatant act of state terrorism.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that the attack was ""fully justified"" in response to the October 7 terror attack by Hamas in 2023.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Germany's recognizing of the state of Palestine was ""a question of when.""

Speaking to DW's chief political editor, Michaela Küfner, in New York as the UN marks its 80th anniversary, Wadephul said EU member states ""are all united in the goal of a two-state solution"" and ""only the question of when to recognize the state of Palestine is dividing us.""

Unlike the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and other Western allies of Israel, Germany has yet to formally recognize Palestinian statehood.

""You know that Germany is reluctant to do this step. It's more a question of time, of course, because we are engaged in building a Palestinian state, but that needs some time, and that needs especially negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,"" Wadephul said when asked about European allies' recognition of Palestinian statehood.

On the infringement of Estonian airspace and Denmark's reports of a drone attack, Wadephul said NATO was standing together ""very firmly"" and making it clear that ""we defend every inch of NATO territory."" 

Wadephul said ""a flexible response"" was always NATO's strategy.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his UN General Assembly address Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.

""A genocide is continuing in Gaza,"" Erdogan said. ""Even as we meet here innocent people are dying.""

He said he was speaking ""on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" who he said had been silenced.

""There is no war in Gaza, there are no two sides. This is an invasion, a genocide, a policy of mass massacre,"" he added.

The Turkish leader's comments come after an independent commission of the UN Human Rights Council found that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.

During his speech, Erdogan held up photos of women waiting for rations, an emaciated child and a street filled with displaced Palestinians.

US President Donald Trump called renewable energy a ""joke"" and the idea of man-made climate change ""the greatest con job ever.""

Trump made the remarks during a wide-ranging speech to world leaders at the UN General Assembly.

The US leader's denial of climate change goes against the overwhelming scientific consensus that fossil fuels and climate change are going to have devastating consequences for the environment and for humanity.

Trump also accused other nations of violating rules on pollution, even though the US continues to be one of the world's most worst polluters.

The US president also repeating his criticism of ""open border"" migration policies.

""Immigration and the high cost of so called green, renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet. Countries that cherish freedom are fading fast,"" Trump said.

""We need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again,"" he said as he concluded his speech, which lasted nearly an hour — well over the 15 minutes allotted to each speaker.

US President Donald Trump questioned the purpose of the United Nations in his speech to the General Assembly, saying the UN had ""so much potential"" that it hadn't realized.

""Empty words don't solve wars,"" he said, seeming to accuse the body of inaction, after he took credit for saving ""millions of lives"" by stopping seven wars, though he did not clarify which ones he was referring to.

""A dramatically better future is within our reach,"" he said, but added that the world would have to leave behind ""the failures of the past.""

In a series of statements in which he addressed his and his wife's physical fitness, his real estate acquisitions and interior design, Trump also made a joke about a teleprompter that stalled mid-speech.

He took aim at Iran, calling it the ""world's number one state sponsor of terrorism,"" before blaming Tehran for ending the nuclear deal that he pulled out of during his first term. 

Trump also called on Hamas to release the Israeli hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, to mild applause. He added that ""the war in Gaza has to stop.""

But he condemned recent announcements from Western nations recognizing Palestinian statehood, saying the moves are a ""reward"" for Hamas.

He went on to criticize China and India for ""funding the war in Ukraine"" by continuing to do business with Russia, as well as European allies for continuing to buy Russian oil and gas.

He also called ""uncontrolled migration"" the greatest issue of the present age, and accused the UN of funding it, though he did not cite evidence for this claim.

Brazil President Lula da Silva was the first head of government to address the General Assembly on Tuesday.

The left-wing leader used the opportunity to warn that ""anti-democratic forces"" were targeting institutions such as the UN.

""Throughout the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms,"" he said.

In what was seen as a jab at US President Donald Trump, who had supported his predecessor, the far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, da Silva said, ""Brazil sent a message to all aspiring autocrats and those who support them: Our democracy, our sovereignty, are nonnegotiable.""

Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his attempt to overturn the results of Brazil's presidential election. Trump had threatened massive tariffs on the South American nation over the case.

One world leader who won't be addressing the United Nations General Assembly is German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. 

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is representing Germany as Merz stays home to focus on the federal budget week and a key Constitutional Court election in the Bundestag.

The Green Party has criticized Merz for staying in Germany.

Agnieszka Brugger, who is deputy parliamentary leader of the Greens, warned that his absence could hurt Germany's security, prosperity and bid for a non-permanent UN Security Council seat next year, saying the country ""cannot afford"" such disengagement in serious times.

Check out our blog from DW's newsroom in Bonn for more of the stories that Germany is talking about.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that reductions in development aid are ""wreaking havoc."" 

As he addressed the General Assembly, Guterres did not name specific countries, but said the cuts threaten futures around the world. His remarks came ahead of a scheduled speech by the US president, whose government has made significant aid reductions.

""Development aid cuts are wreaking havoc,"" said Guterres. ""They are a death sentence for many. A stolen future for many more.""

""This is the paradox of our time: We know what we need — yet we are pulling away the very lifeline that makes it possible.""

Guterres also called on member states to reaffirm international law and condemn nations ""acting as if rules don't apply to them.""

""Far too many crises continue unchecked. Impunity prevails. Lawlessness is a contagion. It invites mayhem, accelerates terror, and risks a nuclear free-for-all,"" he said.

The UN leader highlighted civilian suffering in Sudan and urged all sides to protect civilians. He also called for a lasting ceasefire and peace in Ukraine.

Guterres said ""nothing can justify"" the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, and pressed for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, more humanitarian aid to the territory and the release of all hostages.

A video went viral on TikTok on Tuesday morning, apparently showing French President Emmanuel Macron attempting to get to the UN building — only to be blocked by President Trump's motorcade.

In the video, Macron speaks with a New York police officer who does not appear to understand who the French president is.

Macron then gets on the phone with Trump to ask what can be done while walking down the street.

The US Secret Service said it dismantled a network of about 100,000 SIM cards in New York that agents suspected were part of a plan to disrupt communications during the UN General Assembly.

""In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, these devices could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks,"" the agency said in a statement.

""This includes disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial of services attacks and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.""

Without naming exactly who they thought was behind the plan, the Secret Service said the threat was linked to ""nation-state"" actors.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have formally recognized a Palestinian state. The move comes in the run-up to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the recognition would endanger Israel's existence and reward Hamas terror.

DW News asked Middle East analyst Fawaz Gerges for his assessment.

Fifty countries founded the United Nations after World War II, pledging to promote global peace and human rights.

Eighty years later, as divisions deepen, the United Nations is struggling to overcome deadlocked conflicts, such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

The relevance of the United Nations in a world of unresolved crises is being questioned by many.

Further highlighting tensions at the UN General Assembly is the fact that Brazil, Spain and Chile are hosting a high-level meeting on the sidelines to discuss the state of global democracy.

Unlike in previous years, the United States has not been invited. This reflects changing global perceptions about the health of American democracy amidst increasing clampdowns from the Trump administration on free speech, immigration, and the neutrality of the courts.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the incident was ""the most serious attack"" on Denmark's critical infrastructure. A number of flights were diverted from Denmark's main airport after drones disrupted operations.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on Tuesday said the incident at Copenhagen Airport, in which large drones disrupted operations, constituted ""the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date.""

""This says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared for,"" said Frederiksen, according to the Ritzau news agency.

""Of course, we are not ruling out any possibility as to who is behind it,"" she added.

Frederiksen noted that the attack aligned with the recent trend ""other drone attacks, airspace violations and hacking attacks on European airports.""

Copenhagen Airport halted operations on Monday after multiple drones were spotted in the area, Danish police said.

Copenhagen Airport's official X account said it had shut down operations due to ""activity.""

The airport reopened a few hours later, but recognized there would still be ""delays and canceled departures.""

Copenhagen police earlier posted on social media that the airport was ""closed for take-off and landing, as 2-3 large drones"" had been seen ""flying in the area.""


""We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,"" Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday.

""It's an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,"" he said.

The senior police officer said the drones came from several different directions, turning their lights on and off, before disappearing after several hours.

According to the FlightRadar tracking service, around 35 flights were diverted from the airport.

The service said that Copenhagen Airport halted air traffic at 8:26 p.m. local time (1826 UTC).

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the drones in the Danish capital were ""pattern of persistent contestation at our borders.""

""Our critical infrastructure is at risk,"" she wrote on X, adding that all the facts had yet to be established.

Meanwhile, a drone incident was reported on the same evening at Oslo Airport in Norway, forcing all traffic to move to one runway, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK. 

Security concerns in northern Europe have been heightened over a recent spate of Russian sabotage activities, as well as multiple drones and fighter jet incursions into NATO airspace in recent weeks.

			‘It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,' US president tells General Assembly

Donald Trump told the United Nations (UN) that European countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration.

In a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York, the US president attacked Europe several times over its immigration and green energy policies.

He said: “You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble.

“They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”

He said: “It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,” adding: “Your countries are going to hell.”

It was Mr Trump's fifth address to the UN, and his first since being re-elected.

It served as a reminder that his second term is even more America First than what came before.

His comments also come at a time when tensions between Europe and Mr Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) movement threaten to boil over.

Senior members of his cabinet have repeatedly attacked the Continent, with JD Vance, the vice-president, saying Europe was “engaging in civilisational suicide”.

Mr Trump, who returned last week from a comparatively passive state visit to Britain, appeared to relish the UN speech as an opportunity to hit out at his opponents, reserving particular scorn for his hosts at the UN.

In a meandering address marked by ad libs, he recalled his spurned offer to refurbish the UN headquarters in the early 2000s, and used it to illustrate what he called the organisation's overspending and incompetence.

And just as Mr Trump has used his second term to confront institutions that he sees as opponents, such as the media and the courts, he used the speech to signal a shake-up of the international order built after the Second World War.

His audience watched as he bragged about his achievements and berated allies.

Mr Trump lauded his administration's “bold” measures against immigration, with the number of crossings at the US southern border reduced to a trickle.

This year, the US population is poised to shrink for the first time on record, and is forecast to lose as many as 525,000 people from net outward migration this year, thanks to Mr Trump's tough position on immigration.

His sweeping measures against illegal immigration, including deportations, have not only put the brakes on new arrivals but also pushed people to leave the country, figures suggest.

Mr Trump added: “If you don't stop people that you've never seen before that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail.

“I'm the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe. I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration.

“This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer.”

The 79-year-old continued: “You're doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct.

“You're destroying your heritage. They must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late.”

In his longest-ever General Assembly address, which ran for more than 50 minutes, Mr Trump took credit for ending world conflicts and ran through a list of targets from “sleepy” Joe Biden to the climate lobby, as well as criticising Nato allies who have recognised a Palestinian state.

He reserved particular scorn for Sir Sadiq Khan, making the false claim that the Mayor of London wanted to impose sharia law.

“I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible terrible mayor, and it's been so changed, so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law, but you're in a different country,” he claimed.

Mr Trump said the result would be “the death of Western Europe”.

The two leaders have a chequered past. In 2019, Mr Trump branded the London Mayor a “stone-cold loser” and poked fun at his 5ft 5in stature.

Earlier this year, Mr Trump said he did not want Sir Sadiq to attend a state dinner with him in the UK, branding him among “the worst mayors in the world”.

Sir Sadiq, in turn, has previously branded the president racist, sexist and homophobic.

Sir Sadiq's office said on Tuesday that it would not “dignify” Mr Trump's “appalling and bigoted comments” by responding to them.

A spokesman for the mayor said: “London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.”

Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, said Mr Khan was “not trying to impose sharia law on London”.

Mr Trump began his speech by apologising to his audience about having to read from a folder, saying the teleprompter was not working.

He later added that an escalator had broken down as he and the first lady made their way up the building.

“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle,” he said.

“If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen, but she's in great shape. We're both in good shape.”

The broken lift and teleprompter served as a metaphor for UN incompetence and overspending, he said, claiming the organisation budgeted several hundred million dollars to support more than half a million migrants entering the US in 2024.

“The UN is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States, and we have to get them out,” Mr Trump said. “The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.”

Turning his attention to Russia's invasion of Ukraine – a war Mr Trump had vowed to end on his first day in office – he threatened to impose “a very strong round of powerful tariffs” on Russia if Vladimir Putin did not come to the table.

He claimed the measures would “stop the bloodshed ... very quickly”, but said for the tactic to work, European nations would need to join the US and adopt the same measures.

After his UN address, Mr Trump urged Volodymyr Zelensky to take back all of Ukraine's territory won by Russia and “go even further than that”.

The surprise policy reversal was posted on Truth Social, with the president adding: “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

In his speech, Mr Trump added: “I've always said the UN has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.

“For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter. It's empty words, and empty words don't solve war.”

He also doubled down on his stance on the recognition of the Palestinian state, saying it was a “reward” for Hamas.

The UK joined France, Canada and Australia in announcing formal recognition of Palestine on Sunday.

Responding to the decision, the US president said: “The rewards for Hamas would be too great for Hamas terrorists and their atrocities, including Oct 7.”

He added: “Instead of giving in to Hamas... those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.”

Mr Trump's comments came after Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, said Britain and its allies had only recognised Palestine because their migration policies meant they had been “flooded with foreigners”.

Mr Rubio accused Sir Keir Starmer and other world leaders of giving in to “domestic political pressure” fuelled by high levels of immigration.

He said: “These countries are doing it frankly because of domestic political pressure in their own countries.

“Because of migration policies, these countries have been flooded with foreigners who have become politically active and are insisting their government do these sorts of things.

“That's what they're responding to. It's irrelevant, it's gonna get a little bit of attention, but there is no Palestinian state.”

Following his speech, Mr Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he thought it had been “very well received”.

“It was a great honour to speak before the United Nations. I believe the speech was very well received. It focused very much on energy and migration/immigration.

“I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this forum was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements.

“I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden [halt] as we were [riding] up to the podium, but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise.

“It is always an honour to speak at the United Nations, even if their equipment is somewhat faulty. Make America Great Again!”

Jimmy Kimmel's talk show will return to air after it was cancelled indefinitely over his “offensive” comments about Charlie Kirk's death.

Disney said it reinstated the show after having “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy”.

“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” it said in a statement on Monday.

“It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

Turning Point, the conservative organisation founded by Kirk, responded by urging ABC affiliates not to run Kimmel's show when production resumes on Tuesday.

Andrew Kolvet, a spokesman for the organisation, wrote on X: “Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmel back on the air is not surprising, but it's their mistake to make.”

He also urged ABC affiliates to refuse to broadcast the show, writing: “Nextstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice.”

Nextstar Media Group and Sinclair Inc, ABC's two biggest affiliate television groups, said they would preempt Kimmel's show following his comments last week, meaning it was pulled from dozens of local news channels.

Sinclair confirmed on Monday evening that it would continue to not air the programme while conducting talks with ABC.

In a statement shared on X, the broadcaster said: “Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming.

“Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return.”

There was no immediate comment from Nextstar, one of the biggest owners of television stations in the US, which needs federal approval for a $6.2 billion merger with Tegna. Commentators have suggested that dismissing Kimmel may have been part of an effort to curry favour with the administration.

Kimmel had sparked Republican outrage when he said that a “Maga gang” was trying to score political points from the killing of Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative influencer who was shot dead at a Utah university on September 10.

The television host said during the opening monologue of his show on September 15: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the Maga gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

He also mocked Donald Trump's reaction to the death.

The decision to pull Kimmel's show after 22 years on air has raised questions about the Trump administration's approach to free speech.

Hundreds of celebrities, including Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Ben Stiller, and Robert De Niro, signed an open letter calling Kimmel's suspension a “dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation”.

Several artists protested by cancelling plans to appear on Disney shows or threatening to boycott its networks.

Angelina Jolie also warned free speech was in danger in America, with the Oscar-winning actress saying: “Limits to personal freedoms are dangerous.”

She made the comments when asked about her “fears as an artist and American” while promoting her new film at a film festival in San Sebastian, Spain.

The Writers Guild of America said: “The right to speak our minds and to disagree with each other – to disturb, even – is at the very heart of what it means to be a free people.

“It is not to be denied. Not by violence, not by the abuse of governmental power, nor by acts of corporate cowardice,”

The U-turn on the show is likely to anger Mr Trump, who hailed the show's cancellation as “great news for America”.

The president ignored questions from reporters asking about the reversal at the end of his autism press conference on Monday.

Democrats celebrated the news of Kimmel's impending return and called for the resignation of Brendan Carr, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) who appeared to threaten the ABC shortly before the show was pulled off the air.

“This is about fighting for free speech and against these abuses by Donald Trump and Brendan Carr,” Chuck Schumer, the Californian senator, said on X.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor, wrote: “Thank you to everyone but Brendan Carr. This is a win for free speech everywhere”.

Celebrities and artists who spoke out in support of Kimmel hailed the reversal as a win for people power.

Crime author Don Winslow said “the only reason Disney is bringing Jimmy Kimmel back is because the American people stood up, called out the executives by name, Disney's stock plummeted and Disney lost a lot of money”.

He added: “Get it? That's the play book for the next three years of Trump. You must be louder than him.”

Last week, Mr Trump, who has frequently been the target of Kimmel's jokes, celebrated the decision to axe the show.

“The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is cancelled,” he wrote on Truth Social.

“Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done. Kimmel has zero talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible.”

Kimmel's viewing figures declined to 1.1 million total viewers in August, down from January's 1.95 million, according to Nielsen media data.

Mr Trump and his administration have issued threats and pursued lawsuits against what they claim is a Left-leaning “fake news” media industry.

The US president has, in the past, reached settlements with ABC and CBS over their coverage.

Mr Trump has also filed defamation lawsuits against The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times for their reporting. Republicans in Congress stripped federal funding from NPR and PBS.

After Kimmel's show aired last week, Mr Carr warned that the FCC could take action against ABC and Disney.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” he said. “These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, compared Mr Carr's threats to mafia tactics, saying: “That's right out of Goodfellas.”

The White House is “systematically destroying” protections for renters and homeowners, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

A group of whistleblowers from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) alleges that the agency is abdicating its duty to enforce federal civil rights and fair housing laws. 

On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) sent a letter to Brian Harrison, the acting inspector general for HUD, urging him to investigate the allegations. 

“Right now, if you're a mom protecting your kids from living with an abusive father, or if you're getting denied a mortgage because of the color of your skin, you have civil rights protection under U.S. law,” Warren said in a video posted to X on Monday. 

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

She continued: “But the Trump administration has been systematically destroying these federal protections for renters and homeowners, and now new internal documents shared with my office from whistleblowers inside the Department of Housing and Urban Development show the extent of the Trump administration's attack on civil rights and show how the administration appears to be ignoring the law.” 

Warren's letter to Harrison quotes extensively from a “Letter by Named and Anonymous OFH [Office of Fair Housing] Attorneys” sent to the senator.

HUD leadership, they wrote, has “placed the Department on an unalterable course towards violating its statutory and regulatory obligations to safeguard the equal distribution of federal funds, to combat housing discrimination in the public and private sectors, and to protect the lives of countless survivors of domestic violence.”

The attorneys allege that HUD staff were told that “fair housing was ‘not a priority' of the administration, that less civil rights work would be performed under this administration, and that there was an ‘optics problem' with [OFH] being as large as it was,” as per Warren's letter. 

Warren condemned the idea that “optics” should have an effect on the enforcement of federal civil rights laws. 

“Imagine thinking that defending Black families from being denied a mortgage because they're Black, or protecting a mom and her kids from living with an abusive father is a quote, optics problem,” Warren said in the video. “Imagine thinking that it's an optics problem to help the dad with a bad knee whose landlord refuses to install a handrail on the stairs.”

A New York Times investigation, published on Monday, found that “internal communications, memos and other documents …. show efforts by the Trump administration to limit enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, the landmark civil rights law that has prohibited discrimination in housing for nearly six decades.”

The Times reports that since Trump's second presidential term began, “hundreds of pending fair housing cases were frozen, and some settlements revoked, even when accusations of discrimination had been substantiated.”

In addition to enforcing anti-discrimination laws, HUD is tasked with implementing the housing provisions in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA.) 

“In its 2022 reauthorization of VAWA, Congress expanded HUD's role in implementing VAWA, and OFH became ‘instrumental in ensuring that survivors [of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and/or human trafficking] are provided with emergency transfers to safe housing and that they are not retraumatized by being evicted because of an assault,'” Warren wrote.

But HUD leadership has reassigned 75 percent of the VAWA team, including its supervisors, which would leave just two attorneys in the unit, according to the whistleblowers. 

“These are life and death requests,” HUD attorney Paul Osadebe told the Times. “These women are legitimately in mortal danger, and often without the government stepping in, nothing will be done.”

The Times reports that Osadebe and other HUD attorneys filed a federal lawsuit on Monday seeking to halt their reassignments. 

“This is a deliberate plan, and it's about shutting down fair housing,” said Osadebe, who is also an organizer with the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of federal workers fighting the Trump administration's mass layoffs and budget cuts. 

Before Trump took office, HUD's Office of Fair Housing employed 31 people, according to Warren's letter. There are now just 11 staff members, including six staff attorneys. The whistleblowers allege that HUD officials told OFH attorneys “they could go to almost any other office [within the agency]; they must simply abandon fair housing work,” according to Warren's letter. 

“The Trump administration is firing and reassigning as many people from the Civil Rights Office as they possibly can, and why?” the senator said in the video posted on X. “To make it impossible for the few staff that remain to actually do their jobs and help people the way the law says.”

Before becoming president, Donald Trump was a real estate developer and property owner. In the 1970s, the Department of Justice sued Trump and his father for refusing to rent to prospective Black tenants in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Trump hired Roy Cohn, a virulent anti-communist, to defend him. The Trumps eventually settled the case, but the Justice Department later accused them of violating the terms of the settlement.

""The fearmongering will prevent women from accessing the appropriate care during pregnancy,"" one health expert noted.

On Monday, President Donald Trump advised against the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, baselessly suggesting that there is a link between the over-the-counter painkiller (also known by its brand name, Tylenol) and rising rates of autism.

His comments were condemned by international health experts, who have warned that untreated fever during pregnancy can lead to dangerous complications, including congenital disabilities in the fetus. Experts have also noted that increasing autism diagnoses in recent years can largely be attributed to wider testing and professionals broadening the definition of autism.

During his speech, the president announced that government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), would be “strongly recommending” that pregnant people stop using acetaminophen “unless medically necessary.”

Trump then went further than the official guidance, instructing people not to give children Tylenol at all. 

“Taking Tylenol is not good. Alright, I'll say it: It's not good,” Trump said, citing no evidence.

Instead, pregnant people should “fight like hell” if they feel pain or have fevers during term, Trump said, falsely claiming that there is “no downside” to foregoing pain medication.

Several studies contradict Trump's statements. A recent analysis examining more than four dozen studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy advised against broad limitations on the drug, arguing for a “balanced approach” and noting the risks of untreated fevers and pain. Another study, released in Sweden this summer, analyzed 2.5 million children born in the country between 1995 and 2019 and found no correlation between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and post-birth autism rates. 

Trump acknowledged during his speech that his advice wasn't doctor- or expert-approved.

“I'm just making these statements from me…I'm not making them from these doctors,” he said, dubiously claiming his administration's recommendations were based on “common sense.”

Leading medical experts and health organizations have spoken out against the president's disinformation.

“There is no direct evidence that linked Tylenol to any kind of intellectual or developmental disabilities post-pregnancy. [The scientific consensus still holds that] Tylenol is safe to take during pregnancy,” said Jenny Phan, an autism researcher at George Mason University, who is autistic herself and has two autistic children. 

Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official Debra Houry also blasted the Trump administration's guidance, taking note of the Swedish study that seemed to disprove fears about acetaminophen use during pregnancy.

“As of three weeks ago, we hadn't seen evidence that acetaminophen was linked with autism, so it's curious to know how quickly that was developed,” Houry said. 

Trump's claim is “not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” said Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”

“The fearmongering will prevent women from accessing the appropriate care during pregnancy,” warned Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University.

Other countries' health leaders also warned their residents against heeding Trump's advice.

“Don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine,” United Kingdom Health Minister Wes Streeting said, adding:

I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this. I've just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.

World Health Organization spokesperson Tarik Jašarević described any statement linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism as “inconsistent” with the existing body of evidence. 

Trump has a history of promoting unsubstantiated and often widely dangerous medical advice to the public, particularly during his first term as president amid the spread of COVID-19.

For example, Trump advocated for those infected with the virus to consider treating themselves with hydroxychloroquine, a medication commonly used for malaria, which had not been proven to be effective in treating coronavirus. Later studies found that use of the drug resulted in higher rates of people dying from the virus versus those who disregarded Trump's advice. 

Trump also wondered aloud at a press briefing during the pandemic whether bleach could be used by “injection” to somehow treat COVID-19, leading to a spike in bleach-based poisonings across the U.S.

The executive order comes in the midst of the Trump administration's widespread attacks on the First Amendment.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

Yesterday, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa — the decentralized movement against fascism — a domestic terrorist organization, although the U.S. does not have a federal domestic terrorism law. 

“[Antifa] uses illegal means to organize and execute a campaign of violence and terrorism nationwide to accomplish these goals,” the order states. “This campaign involves coordinated efforts to obstruct enforcement of Federal laws through armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violent assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other law enforcement officers, and routine doxing of and other threats against political figures and activists.”

“Because of the aforementioned pattern of political violence designed to suppress lawful political activity and obstruct the rule of law, I hereby designate Antifa as a ‘domestic terrorist organization,'” the order continues.

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day.

The order directs the federal government to investigate and prosecute “those who fund [antifa] operations.”

An accompanying factsheet also emphasizes anti-ICE protests. 

“Antifa has engaged in armed standoffs with law enforcement, organized riots, violently assaulted ICE and other law enforcement officers, and engages in routine doxing of political figures and activists, threatening public safety,” the factsheet reads. 

“ICE officers are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” the factsheet says, a claim the administration has made numerous times without evidence. 

Faiza Patel, director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told NPR before the order was announced that “[t]here is no framework to designate an organization as a domestic terrorist organization.”

Trump first proposed designating antifa a “terrorist organization” during the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 that erupted in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. The president renewed this call last week in a social media post saying he was designating antifa, “A SICK, DANGEROUS, RADICAL LEFT DISASTER, AS A MAJOR TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.”

“I will also be strongly recommending that those funding ANTIFA be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the highest legal standards and practices,” he continued. 

“Nearly every word in the president's post was a lie,” wrote Christopher Mathias, author of the forthcoming book, “To Catch a Fascist: The Fight to Expose the Radical Right,” for MSNBC. “Antifa isn't an organization. There is no legal statute with which to declare antifa a ‘major terrorist organization.' Nor does antifa have a network of rich, shadowy benefactors who can be unmasked. (What little money antifa's practitioners do have typically comes from their own pockets.)”

Trump's order follows a ramped-up assault on the First Amendment in the wake of the fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk, a right-wing commentator who made numerous racist and anti-trans statements. There is no evidence to suggest that Kirk's murder was tied to left-wing activists or movements, but that has not stopped the far right from using his death to squash dissent. 

The day after Kirk's death, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau requested people report “foreigners” to the State Department who post on social media “praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event.”

“In light of yesterday's horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau posted on X on September 11.

“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” he continued. “Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so that the @StateDept can protect the American people.”

Of course, the Trump administration's assault on the First Amendment did not begin with Kirk's murder. The day before his death, the Center for Media and Democracy reported that DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin told the outlet that “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxxing our agents.”

“We will prosecute those who illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.

In July, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem claimed “violence” against ICE agents includes “anything that threatens them and their safety, so it is doxing them, it's videotaping them where they're at when they're out on operations.”

Recording law enforcement is protected by the First Amendment.

 More Drones and Missiles Are All That Can Stop Russia

 Andriy Zagorodnyuk

Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, officials across Europe have scrambled to craft a peace deal that could work for Ukraine. They know by now that, at the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in stopping his offensives, and they fear that shifting American priorities may leave Ukraine without a critical source of support. As a result, they are racing to find a way to provide Kyiv with security guarantees that could deter Russia and allow for an armistice.

In conversations about security guarantees, officials have tended to focus on a handful of measures: placing a small number of European troops in Ukraine to shore up the country's defense (so-called reassurance forces), levying additional sanctions against Russia, and providing Ukraine with more weapons, including conventional ones. They have also mused about committing themselves, on paper, to Ukraine's defense. Two of these actions—more weapons and sanctions—could take place before any cease-fire. The rest would go into effect only after the fighting ends.

These proposals have certain virtues. But by themselves, they are not enough to guarantee Ukraine's security. Since the start of Russia's invasion in 2022, Putin has been transparent about his objective—the destruction of Ukraine as an independent nation—and has subjected many people to almost unimaginable suffering in order to achieve it. He will not be deterred by words, a smattering of NATO troops, or by more agony (including if it affects Russians). In fact, he will not stop the war unless Russian troops literally cannot advance any further.

Right now, some U.S. and European analysts are pessimistic that Ukraine can completely halt Russia's aggression, and understandably so. NATO countries, after all, have been arming Kyiv for years, and Moscow keeps making incremental gains. But Ukraine need not destroy every element of the Russian military to achieve strategic neutralization—stripping away the enemy of its ability to achieve its objectives. And the conflict has recently changed in ways that have made it easier to freeze. Today, the war is being fought less with traditional military equipment and more with newer, cheaper technologies that Ukraine helped pioneer. In fact, Ukraine has already done a great deal of what's needed to deter Russia for good. But Europe must stop focusing on which traditional capabilities it should provide to Ukraine or on establishing written security guarantees. Instead, the continent should get serious about investing more in Ukraine's war effort by flooding the country with more advanced technologies. It needs to invest heavily in the country's sophisticated defense industry. It must cooperate more directly with Kyiv on matters of military manufacturing and on air defenses. Such measures will indeed be daunting, but not any more than NATO's original effort to help Ukraine. And ultimately, Europe has little choice. They are the only way to bring peace.

Throughout the past century, powerful states have sought to provide security guarantees to weaker partners. Those guarantees, however, have only conferred a real benefit when they created tangible shields. During the Cold War, NATO effectively deterred the Soviet Union because the United States situated substantial forces and firepower on the continent, including some nuclear weapons. In Asia, the mutual defense treaty between South Korea and the United States works to deter a North Korean invasion because tens of thousands of American troops remain on the peninsula, where they jointly plan and train with their South Korean partners. In the 1930s, by contrast, the British and the French backed their pledge to defend Poland with nothing but rhetoric; as a result, Nazi Germany felt free to invade the country. Likewise, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which a consortium of states (including Russia) promised to protect Ukraine's sovereignty if it gave up its nuclear weapons, did nothing to stop Russia from invading its neighbor multiple times because it offered no military resources to Kyiv.

After Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine, sending troops into Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014, the United States and Europe did begin supplying Kyiv with defensive and, eventually, offensive assistance. But it was only in late 2021, after it became clear that Russia aimed to invade the entire country, that NATO states got somewhat serious about arming Ukraine. That support, however, proved effective: rather than quickly conquering Ukraine, as much of the world expected, Russia quickly became bogged down.

In fact, in some domains, Ukraine has managed to functionally defeat its enemy. Consider the battle over the Black Sea. From the outset of its full-scale invasion, Russia sought to strangle Ukraine's economy by cutting off its maritime access. Moscow's Black Sea Fleet blockaded Ukrainian ports, occupied Snake Island, and threatened Odessa, the country's main coastal city. Allied attempts to negotiate a partial end to this blockade failed. But by the fall of 2023, the Ukrainian military succeeded in breaking it with naval drones, precision missiles, and air-launched bombs—a substantial portion of which came from the United States. (Ukrainian-made weapons, of course, were also essential to this victory.) Although these strikes only destroyed part of Russia's fleet, Kyiv made it impossible for Putin's ships to sail near Ukraine's main ports, and Moscow was left with no choice but to move most of its fleet to the east.

Ukraine has had success in the air, as well. Russia began its 2022 war confident it could establish air dominance within days, allowing it to quickly march on Kyiv. Instead, Ukraine's innovative defenses have made it impossible for Russia to achieve superiority. In an air denial operation undertaken in the first days of the invasion, now known as Ghost of Kyiv, Ukraine used its limited air capabilities to intercept many Russian fighter jets and effectively push these planes out of its airspace. During its more complex 2025 “Spiderweb” operations, Ukraine has used innovative uncrewed systems to destroy a substantial portion of Russia's strategic aviation fleet, or the aircraft Russia uses to launch numerous cruise missiles at all areas of Ukraine. Kyiv has not been able to make its skies safe enough for commercial air-traffic transit, and it experiences constant missile and long-range drone attacks. But it has been able to force Russian manned aircraft to operate tens of kilometers from the frontlines, launching glide bombs rather than conducting close air support operations to help ground forces.

Fully liberating Ukraine would take more than just such measures, at least for now, and it would require considerable additional capabilities. But strategic neutralization is attainable without waging a multidecade war of attrition. To obviate Russia's threat, Ukraine does not need to kill off every Russian soldier. Instead, it can paralyze the military by targeting essential functions such as logistics, coordination, mobility, and firepower. In this way, it can follow a template pioneered by Israel, which neutralized Egypt's far larger air force in 1967 not by destroying every aircraft but by taking out many of them and eliminating its runways and command systems. As a result, Israel preserved its existence without annihilating vast opposition forces.

Ukraine is closer to paralyzing Russia than most people think. Russia's jets do still strike Ukrainian targets, albeit from a great distance, and Russian ground forces continue to seize small chunks of territory. But with drones, remote mines, precision artillery, and constant surveillance, Ukraine has transformed large stretches of the front into persistent kill zones: areas where forces find it nearly impossible to maneuver without being detected and then immediately hit. Only by throwing thousands upon thousands of troops at Ukrainian targets can Russia advance through a few of these regions. If Ukraine can widen these kill zones—by surveilling more territory and striking behind Russia's current forward lines—and deny Russia the ability to mass men and materiel in its rear, Russian formations will be unable to generate any momentum. Future offensives by Russia would then become strategically futile, and thus not worth attempting.

To succeed, however, Ukraine will need more drones and high-tech weapons. And helping Kyiv get these systems will necessitate that NATO change its presumptions and priorities. When the war broke out, it made sense for the United States and Europe to pump Ukraine full of traditional weapons systems. But as the operational environment has evolved, many legacy systems have become largely obsolete. For instance, some sophisticated assault weapons, such as tanks, are now disabled almost as soon as they enter the kill zone by simpler, cheaper uncrewed aerial vehicles. They therefore do little to help either party.

Ukraine's allies must refocus their attention on helping Ukraine innovate and integrate new technologies at the scale needed to stop Russia. These allies have what they need. Europe alone has financial resources, scientific capabilities, and an industrial base that Russia cannot match. If the continent uses these capacities alongside Ukraine, it could help the Ukrainian military develop and produce many advanced and affordable precise, long-range systems—including missiles and uncrewed aerial vehicles—as well as communications gear, positioning and targeting equipment, air defenses, and electronic warfare systems.



The continent has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. The European Union has launched several programs designed to channel money into Ukrainian defense-industrial factories. Kyiv has also forged bilateral deals with a variety of countries to scale up its drone and ammunition production. But these partnerships must be expanded dramatically. Europe must, of course, spend more on Ukraine and increase its own production of material. But it must also focus on speeding up design, testing, and scaling.

There are other ways Europe can assist Kyiv. Perhaps the most important is a European Sky Shield for Ukraine: an initiative proposed by a group of international and Ukrainian military experts. In it, a collection of European states would establish a no-fly zone, first over western Ukrainian territory and later over central Ukraine. Participating states would mobilize roughly 120 combat aircraft, which would fly from European bases and shoot down missiles and drones over the covered territory. In addition to safeguarding Ukraine's infrastructure and economy—by, for example, shielding Ukrainian nuclear plants and export corridors—it would free Ukraine's own air force to concentrate on the eastern front. The model, which is based on the air policing missions Europe has conducted over the Baltics for 20 years, carries some escalation risks. But Russia is unlikely to interfere, since direct, air-to-air combat would not work to its advantage.

NATO states will also have to continue supplying Kyiv with some traditional weapons. Ukraine will need more F-16 fighter jets to defend its skies. It still requires long-range missiles, like the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and British and French Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles, to hit the many Russian logistics hubs, command centers, stockpiles, and troop formations located beyond the battlefield. Ukraine's allies should also earmark certain stockpiles of ammunition, drones, and spare parts housed in eastern Europe for Ukraine, so that they are never again vulnerable to political delays in Washington or European capitals. And the United States must continue providing Kyiv with military intelligence, which has been indispensable to tracking Russian troop movements and missile strikes. Such high-end enablers will remain cornerstones of any meaningful security guarantees.

But tanks or other legacy equipment would be of little use on their own. Giving Ukraine another paper commitment to its security, even one modeled on NATO's Article 5, as some European states have discussed, would do nothing. And without tangible support that's tailored to today's Ukrainian battlefield, even European reassurance forces would be of dubious value. Unless NATO countries decide to station large numbers of combat-ready troops or send over instructors, these deployments would have the main effect of being expensive and politically risky within their home countries. The troops are unlikely to stop, or be spared from, Russia's military.

After more than 11 years of war, the lesson from Ukraine is clear: the security guarantees that matter are the ones that practically shape the battlefield. If the goal is to make Russian aggression futile, then the United States and Europe must channel resources into capabilities that deny, disrupt, and paralyze the Russian military. Nothing less will succeed.

Giving Ukraine what it needs does not only help Kyiv. If Putin's military is not stopped somewhere in Ukraine, it may march on a NATO member. Putin has made no secret of his desire to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union and establish Russian dominance over Europe's east. Over the last several weeks, he has floated drones and fighter jets over NATO's boundary in a clear test of the alliance's integrity. At a minimum, more of these provocations are likely to happen unless NATO helps Ukraine neutralize Russia's military.

The EU seems aware of this. In European Defence—Readiness 2030, a report published in early 2025, the European Commission explicitly framed Ukraine's survival as central to Europe's own security. It called for a “steel porcupine” strategy—or fortifying Ukraine so that future Russian offensives fail by design—and investing in Ukraine's defense industry as part of creating a shared European capacity. But the EU and NATO must do more to help Ukraine firmly prevail over Russia's technologies and deny Moscow any further battlefield victories. Its members need to plow more resources and in-kind technology contributions into Ukraine's defense industry. They must help Kyiv quickly develop and massively scale up new systems. Then, and only then, will Europe be able to breathe.

            Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor who chairs the Senate health committee, is calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to release any evidence tying acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism, noting that “the preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.”
    


            “I understand and applaud President Trump's desire to address this issue and to support HHS. HHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim. The preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case,” he wrote Monday on X. “The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy. We must be compassionate to this problem.”
    


            Trump announced Monday that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe. Experts say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science showing a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled.
    


Trump links autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy, despite decades of evidence it's safe



            “They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” such as to treat fever, “if you can't tough it out,” Trump said, speaking from the White House alongside US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.
    


            In February, Cassidy cast a deciding vote to confirm Kennedy to lead HHS. The senator, however, has before pushed back on Kennedy's claims about vaccines and as recently as last week, would not say whether he would vote to confirm Kennedy if given the choice now.
    


            “I am steadfastly not judging until we have a chance to hear the secretary's perspective,” he told reporters, after he led a hearing where the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, testified about her clashes with the health secretary.
    


            Cassidy is up for reelection in 2026, and given his previous vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection after January 6, 2021, the Louisiana senator will be walking a political tightrope to keep the president from endorsing any of his primary opponents.
    


            He has been careful to not directly criticize the president or Kennedy, despite expressing concern at some CDC and HHS actions.
    


            Most recently, Cassidy has warned that the new federal vaccine advisory committee's proposal to change recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccination would put children at risk. The panel ultimately delayed its vote on that proposal. Cassidy, a liver doctor, has long advocated for greater access to the vaccine.
    


            “President Trump and I agree: vaccines save lives. If a mom wants to get a lifesaving hepatitis B vaccine to protect her newborn, she should be able to get it,” he said on X last week. “The proposed (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendation could have put that access at risk, making it harder for that mom or that parent to protect their child against hepatitis B.”

            Backlash has been swift and forceful as other parts of the world woke up to US President Donald Trump's comments blaming – without solid evidence – acetaminophen and certain vaccines for autism in children.
    


            “Don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don't take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists,” UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a televised interview on Tuesday. “I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this.”
    


            It comes after Trump announced Monday the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol – the brand name for acetaminophen, known in most countries as paracetamol – during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism.” Despite decades of evidence that it is safe, Trump suggested that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy “if you can't tough it out.”
    


            The medicine regulatory agencies of the European Union and the United Kingdom also quickly issued statements Tuesday confirming that taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.
    


            “Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,” Steffen Thirstrup, chief medical officer of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said in a statement. “Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.”
    


            Experts warn that an untreated fever can be dangerous for both the fetus and the pregnant person. Risks include miscarriage, birth defects and high blood pressure. Experts also say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science on a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled.
    


            A peer-reviewed analysis published in BioMed Central in August looked at 46 studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism. The authors recommended judicious acetaminophen use, under medical guidance.
    


            Meanwhile, a 2024 peer-reviewed Swedish study published in the medical journal JAMA found no link between acetaminophen taken in pregnancy and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
    


            The EMA statement said that in 2019, the agency “reviewed available studies that investigated the neurodevelopment of children exposed to paracetamol in utero and found that the results were inconclusive and that no link with neurodevelopmental disorders could be established.”
    


            Speaking on Britain's ITV News, Streeting said: “I've just got to be really clear about this: There is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.” He encouraged the British public to “follow the science,” especially at a time when “you've got kids in this country now dying of measles, whooping cough, kids not taking the RSV vaccine, when those respiratory diseases can be life-threatening in our children.”
    


            The vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) has long been a target of misinformation and alarm, including by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, following discredited research linking it to autism by a British doctor who has since been barred from practicing medicine. Kennedy publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine amid this year's outbreak that led to three deaths and nearly 200 hospitalizations across the US, but also touted unconventional therapies.
    


            Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is considered the only safe over-the-counter option for pain or fever during pregnancy. Other common pain relief options like ibuprofen or regular-dose aspirin can increase the risk of serious pregnancy complications, according to experts.
    


            The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: “Paracetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed. Pregnant women should continue to follow existing NHS (National Health Service) guidance and speak to their healthcare professional if they have questions about any medication during pregnancy.”
    


            On Monday, Trump also advocated for breaking up childhood vaccinations and even pushing back the hepatitis B shot for newborns to age 12. It's “too much liquid, too many different things are going into that baby,” Trump said, without citing scientific evidence.
    


            As a public health strategy, providing hepatitis B shot to infants brought the infection in children to the brink of elimination in the United States.
    


            And extensive research has shown that there's no link between vaccines and autism.
    


            “Extensive safety monitoring in the UK and internationally continues to show that the benefits of these vaccinations outweigh any risks. Hepatitis B vaccines used in the UK have a well-established safety profile and play a vital role in protecting infants from serious illness,” Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement.
    


            The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement that vaccination campaigns, which have saved more than 150 million lives in the past 50 years, are being threatened by misinformation.
    


            “Misinformation is increasingly driven from the top, with prominent influencers pushing thoroughly debunked myths, such as the disproven and false claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism,” said WHO's immunization director, Kate O'Brien.
    


Vaccines Fast Facts



            “Pseudoscience, false logic, and selective ‘evidence' are weaponized in ways that sow confusion and doubt among well-meaning parents.”
    


            O'Brien said the consequences of this misinformation were “real and tragic,” pointing to how the drop in coverage of the measles vaccine “is driving a significant rise in measles cases and deaths, including in wealthy countries like the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries.”

            It's a new chapter for London Fashion Week. The first to take place under the British Fashion Council's new CEO Laura Weir, who has made her message clear: “fashion matters.”
    


            In her opening speech on Friday, Weir doubled down on her ambition to make London “a sensational showcase of creative fashion design talent” by reducing the barriers to entry and opening the schedule to “new energy, new thinking and new ideas.” That includes participation from new and returning brands, but also a wider breadth of international editors and buyers to platform the UK capital on the global stage. Backstage, designers both new and established were cautiously optimistic at the promises being made.
    


            Already, there are signs that the city is being taken more seriously. Earlier in the week, members of Parliament gathered to discuss whether London Fashion Week was in the national interest — marking the first time the event had been debated at government level. “We know as an industry that there is often a lapse of respect for fashion and the contribution it brings to the UK,” Weir said. “The world is watching this week. Let us show them what only London can do.”
    


            Indeed, there were blockbuster moments from the likes of Burberry — who closed out the week's schedule with a star-studded show at Kensington Palace Gardens, attended by Elton John, Olivia Dean and Vanessa Williams — as well as H&M (the latter opened the week with a celebrity-filled catwalk walked by Romeo Beckham and with a performance from “Messy” singer Lola Young). But smaller designers also gave plenty to talk about — from noteworthy milestones, including the various anniversaries of Roksanda, Harris Reed, Ashish and Fashion East (the incubator that launched Jonathan Anderson's career), to the innovation from newcomers including Oscar Ouyang, Maximilian Raynor and Johanna Parv.
    


            “It really feels like there's a renewed sense of energy in London right now,” said Daniel Fletcher, who designs for his namesake label as well as the Chinese brand Mithridate.
    


            While members of the UK government were considering the country's relationship to fashion, a handful of designers were distilling their own experience of British life onto the runway. Patrick McDowell, a Liverpudlian designer based in London, staged his first catwalk since winning the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Award for Design in May. Dedicated to his home county, the collection was titled “Lancashire Rose,” and featured cinched blazers in jacquard fabric and sandy colored trench coats reimagined into strapless tops and full skirts. Fletcher, who presented his second collection for Mithridate, said he was inspired by two British archetypes: the country folk and the town dwellers. His fusion of these two “very different worlds” manifested in pink sequined party dresses layered over Oxford shirts and tall riding boots paired with sparkly underwear. “It's a clash that shouldn't really work, but somehow does,” he told CNN backstage.
    


            But a few renegades creatively defected across the pond, looking instead at America for inspiration. The eponymous designer Yuhan Wang was inspired by David Lynch's “Mullholland Drive” (2001), while the cult British-Bulgarian brand Chopova Lowena created an entire cheer squad with tinsel hair extensions and rhinestone eyeliner.
    


            Inspired by the community and culture that comes with cheerleading, there were letterman jackets, T-shirts that read “Popular” in varsity typeface, and knitted hoodies emblazoned with pom-pom yielding models, who walked to the tune of AC/DC's “Thunderstruck,” which has become synonymous with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders following their hit Netflix show. “It was a lot of healing high school trauma in a way,” co-founder Emma Chopova said after the show. “It reframed things that happened to us, who were, and who we wanted to be.”
    


            Streetwear, a pillar of UK dressing for several decades, was made new again by a slew of designers redefining urban style. Yaku Stapleton, founder of YAKU, designed hoodies, capes and camouflage pants that looked like they were inspired by role-playing games (RPG). His models could have been downloaded from Zelda, with cargo pants that held axes and sword sheaths remade in fabric.
    


            Lueder's take on modern medieval feudalism, with knitted hoods and 3D-printed horned clogs, was inspired by the historical summer camps designer Marie Lueder went to as a child, where she role-played periods in history (costumes and all) from 300 BC to the end of the 15th century. For his first ready-to-wear collection the mononymic designer HARRI, known for his circus-like inflatable pieces, stuck with his signature fabric of latex. This time, however, there were bomber jackets, mesh shirts and Bermuda shorts — the kind of everyday clothing you'd see on the street, though some items, such as a cap and body vest, were aerated for old times' sake.
    


            Elsewhere, Johanna Parv continued to design for “the woman who is living in the city right now,” she told CNN, particularly “brave” cyclists, with nylon dresses, skirts and rain jackets that can be adjusted for whether one is commuting, working, partying or exercising.
    


            Royalty may be on the mind of many, following the new exhibition on Marie Antoinette's style in London, which has many of the French queen's extravagant gowns on show. Panniers — undergarments that sit on the hips to expand the silhouette outwards — have also been seen on recent red carpets. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this summer, Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher turned heads when she stepped out in a Dior haute couture gown complete with a protruding bustle.
    


            No surprise, then, that voluminous hips were a seasonal feature on the runway. See the Chinese-Irish designer Simone Rocha whose dresses and skirts had wired crinolines on show, rather than hidden underneath. Backstage, Rocha shared her inspiration — a “disgruntled debutante” — and the desire to push herself by working with tried-and-tested materials albeit in new ways. She also nodded to her heritage with pops of red, an auspicious color in Chinese culture.
    


            At Dilara Findikoglu, models looked like ladies in waiting that had risen from the dead; wearing antiquated corsetry that was dirtied and torn. Sharp hip bones jutted out above low-slung lace-up leather pants, at times accentuated further by draped body chains. Others were padded in ruffles and lace. The collection was titled “Cage of Innocence,” in a nod to the silenced women of history. Findikogulu's uncompromising and subversive vision, along with her meticulous understanding of the female body, has made her one of London Fashion Week's hottest tickets.
    


            One notable feature of London designers is their desire to experiment and seek alternatives to the status quo.
    


            Backstage, Oscar Ouyang said the word that summarized his debut show was “reinvention”. He experimented with bird feathers, seen on the collar of a shortened car coat and a pair of shorts. Fresh-faced models wore sprigs of down in their hair, like the lost boys in “Peter Pan.” The Beijing-born designer, who studied a MA course in knitwear at Central Saint Martins, didn't stop there: He used a combination of machine and hand-knit techniques to create cartoon-sh proportioned T-shirts and braided bags and tunics out of straw.
    


            Pauline Dujancourt, a womenswear designer also specializing in knitwear, was also inspired by the symbolism of birds. Dujancourt's hauntingly beautiful gowns were a mixture of chunky Argyle knit, delicate lace and frothy tulle ruffle — but the sum was greater than its parts. “I discovered all those techniques from my grandmother,” Dujancourt told CNN after the show.  She also emphasized the importance of craft, and modernizing the artform for new generations.  “It's really important to go back to that but offer a new rationale so people will actually want to knit and want to wear knitwear.”
    


            Elsewhere, rising designers Paolo Carzana and Susan Fang continued to challenge material boundaries, resulting in garments that are thoughtfully designed, adaptable and aesthetically unique. Carzana's selling point is using repurposed materials and vegetable dyes, which encourages a more considered approach to clothes (not to mention, unexpected color pairings like violet with burnt orange). They popped against the backdrop of books in the British Library, where the show was held. Fang, meanwhile, took to the leafy conservatory of the Barbican, where she showed dresses made using beads and 3D-printed patchwork that looked like flower petals as the models — including Korean it-girl Irene Kim — walked.

                    “We're just really proud to be showing here. As a sensibility our brand has such a global audience. But that spirit of a London woman is really reflected in the collection.”
                


                    Camille Perry, TOVE designer and co-founder
                


                    “It's really important to support British fashion. And for me, London is my home.”
                


                    Daniel Fletcher, Mithridate
                


                    “It's not just protect the dolls. It's employ the dolls. It's champion the dolls.”
                


                    Conner Ives
                


                    “People always look at sequin clothing and think it's so delicate, you can't do stuff in it. And I was like, well it's not. You can chuck it in a suitcase and go to a club in it.”
                


                    Ashish Gupta, Ashish
                


                    “At the end of the day we're here to reinvent fashion and try new things.”
                


                    Pauline Dujancourt
                


                    “Knitwear has always been this traditional craft, people have a stereotypical idea of it being for grannies, or being vintage. We obviously reference that… But it's always about reinventing your ideas.”

They found 300 servers capable of crippling New York's cell system","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/us/swatting-investigation-server-network-discovered","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:01:05 GMT","


            On Christmas Day 2023, a man called the suicide prevention hotline claiming he had shot his girlfriend and threatening to kill himself. Police barreled toward the address but turned around before they arrived.
    


            It was a hoax – a swatting call at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia residence.
    


            Five days later, GOP Sen. Rick Scott's home in Florida was swatted.
    


            The wave of false alarms about shootings and violence continued to assail high-level government officials: the federal judge overseeing Trump's election subversion case, then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Maine's Democratic secretary of state.
    


            Within a month of Donald Trump clinching his second presidential election win, several of his Cabinet picks and administration appointees also were targeted with threats, including calls about bombs and swatting, his transition team said.
    


            The threats weren't legitimate. There were no shootings, no violence.
    


            Still, the surge of swatting calls against high-ranking officials posed a real and “imminent threat” to the Secret Service's prote﻿ctive operations, said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the agency's New York field office.
    


            So, a fledgling unit of the service set out six months ago to unmask the layers of burner phones, changing phone numbers and SIM cards swatting American officials.
    


            The Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit, along with a flurry of other law enforcement agencies – the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the New York Police Department, and other state and local law enforcement – began unraveling the web.
    


            What they found was an operation apparently capable of chaos far beyond masking swatting calls to potentially disabling cell phone towers, disrupting emergency services and enabling spies, hackers and organized crime.
    


            The new unit traced the swatting signals to an apartment just outside New York City.
    


            They found another rented space.
    


            Then, more.
    


            No one was inside.
    


            Instead, they found a vast and stunning network of more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 SIM servers – the largest seizure ever of such devices by the Secret Service – all concentrated within 35 miles of New York City.
    


            The servers could be commanded remotely to create massive amounts of phone traffic in a stealthy and unceasing operation that switched out SIM cards quickly to keep federal law enforcement off its trail.
    


            The hidden electronic maze was so powerful, it could have sent an encrypted and anonymous text to every human being in the United States within 12 minutes, McCool said. It could have overwhelmed cell towers, toppling New York City's cell service and preventing every Manhattan resident from accessing Google Maps.
    


            The electronic safe houses were found in places including Armonk, New York; Greenwich, Connecticut; Queens, New York; and across the river in New Jersey – essentially forming a circle around New York City's cellular network infrastructure, officials briefed on the investigation said.
    


            The Secret Service hasn't announced any arrests connected to the operation. But its early forensic analysis suggests foreign governments and criminals in the US have used the network to run their organizations, McCool said.
    


            “That includes cartels, that includes human traffickers, that includes terrorists,” he told CNN. “It is absolutely well funded and well-organized.”
    


            The network has been taken down and is no longer a threat to New York, law enforcement officials said.
    


            But, McCool cautioned, “It would be unwise to think that there's not other networks across the country.”
    


            The Secret Service unit is now working to identify other similar networks, he said.
    


            “The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” US Secret Service Director Sean Curran said.
    


            Wireless service provider MobileX, whose SIM cards are featured in photographs of items seized in the investigation, said it was “fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities should they reach out.”
    


            “We are aware of recent reports that MobileX SIM cards, along with those of other providers, were recovered during a federal investigation,” MobileX founder and CEO Peter Adderton said in a statement. “Our platform is designed to be easy to use and cost-effective, qualities that unfortunately can also attract occasional bad actors. MobileX has robust safeguards in place to identify and block automated or bulk usage, and we shut down suspicious activity on our network every day.”

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Secret Service has found and is quietly dismantling a massive network of “SIM farms” across the New York area just as world leaders gather for meetings at the United Nations.

Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries.

Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. 

So what are these SIM farms and what are they capable of?

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the SIM farm uncovered by the Secret Service just ahead of the UN General Assembly and its nefarious undertones.

SIM farms are hardware devices that can hold numerous SIM cards from different mobile operators. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls.

While initially developed for legitimate purposes, such as low cost international calling, the technology has become a cornerstone of organized fraud targeting mass audiences — phishing texts and scam calls. 

“Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.




In this case, the devices were concentrated within 35 miles of the U.N. building. The investigation is ongoing, but McCool said forensic analysts currently believe the system could have been used to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations. 

MobileX, the producer of some of the SIM cards recovered in the raids, said they are prepared to cooperate with authorities in their investigation. 

“Like all wireless providers, we occasionally see bad actors attempt to misuse our services,” CEO Peter Adderton said in a statement. 

Anthony J. Ferrante, the global head of the cybersecurity practice at FTI, an international consulting firm, said the photos show a very sophisticated and established SIM farm that could be used for any number of nefarious activities, including the potential to overwhelm cellular networks with millions of calls in just a few minutes.

“So if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,” Ferrante said in an interview. He also notes that it's possible the system could be used for surveillance operations, given its proximity to the United Nations, “potentially that equipment could be used to either intercept communications, eavesdrop on communications, or actually, clone devices, as well.”

Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure. 

“The masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,” he said. “It's a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.”

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — A Palestinian medical charity said Tuesday that Israel destroyed its main center in Gaza City after ordering its evacuation. 

The Palestinian Medical Relief Society said an Israeli strike reduced its six-story building in the central Samer area to rubble. It said the center was one of the main facilities in the city providing blood donation and testing services, trauma care, cancer medicine and chronic disease treatment.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military, which has repeatedly bombed and raided hospitals in Gaza throughout the war.

In a separate development, Israel announced Tuesday complete closure of the border crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan until further notice after an attack last week that killed two Israelis.

The Allenby Bridge Crossing over the Jordan River, also known as King Hussein Bridge, is the only cargo and passenger crossing available to Palestinians in the West Bank that does not lead to Israel. It is also on a key route for delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Multiple hospitals in famine-stricken Gaza City have been forced to shut down as Israel forces advance. Israel accuses Hamas of using medical facilities for military purposes — which could cause them to lose their protection under international law — but the military has often provided little or no evidence of a significant militant presence.

The head of the World Health Organization, which has partnered with the charity, condemned the strike. “Attacks on health facilities must end. The senseless violence must stop. Ceasefire!” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on X.




The medical charity said another of its centers was damaged and surrounded by Israeli troops, and that a third center was destroyed in a separate strike. Gaza's Health Ministry said Monday that the Al-Rantisi Children's Hospital and the Specialized Eye Hospital had been forced to shut down because of nearby Israeli military operations.

Several Western countries on Monday called on Israel to restore a medical corridor for Palestinians in Gaza to be treated in east Jerusalem and the West Bank, and for Israel to lift restrictions on medical supplies entering Gaza.

The statement was cosigned by 24 nations, including Canada, France and Germany, and comes as Israel has faced mounting criticism over the war in Gaza from even some of its closest allies.

Israel captured east Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for a future state.

Israel launched a major offensive earlier this month aimed at occupying Gaza City, the territory's largest, which has already suffered heavy damage from previous raids and bombardment. Israel says the operation is aimed at pressuring Hamas to surrender and return the remaining 48 hostages taken during its Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Israel believes around 20 of the captives are alive.

The world's leading authority on hunger crises said last month that Israel's blockade and ongoing offensive had already pushed Gaza City into famine. More than 300,000 people have fled the city in recent weeks as Israel has ordered the population to move south, but an estimated 700,000 remain, according to U.N. agencies and aid groups.

Meanwhile a Palestinian man died from his injuries after being shot by Israeli settlers in the village of al-Mughayyir, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said Tuesday.

Palestinian residents of al-Mughayyir said Saeed Murad Naasan, 20, was shot after confronting settlers who were grazing their livestock on the outskirts of the village which is situated east of Ramallah.

The Israeli military said troops fired live rounds to disperse Palestinians hurling rocks at Israeli civilians during a “violent confrontation” that wounded one person. It said the incident is under review.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7 attack. Most of the captives have since been released in ceasefires or other deals.

The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 65,382 Palestinians have been killed in the war, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. It is part of the Hamas-run government. Its figures are seen by the U.N. and many independent experts as the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace. He also praised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in his nation's war against Russia, saying it's “putting up one hell of a fight.”

Russia dropped five glide bombs on Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine last night into Tuesday killing one person. In the Odesa region, Russian ballistic missiles also struck the town center of Tatarbunary, located some 45 kilometers (28 miles) from the border with Romania, killing one person.

Fall is expected to bring another gruelling test for Ukraine's armed forces as Russia intensifies its campaign to seize an eastern region it has sought to conquer for years. Russia now controls about 70% of the Donetsk region, once Ukraine's industrial heartland. (AP video by Vasilisa Stepanenko)

UNITED NATIONS (AP) — President Donald Trump said Tuesday that Ukraine can win back all territory lost to Russia, a dramatic shift from the U.S. leader's call on Kyiv to make concessions to end the war.

Trump offered his position in a social media posting soon after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly gathering of world leaders.

Trump in part wrote, “I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.”

The strengthened support from Trump, if it sticks, is a huge win for Zelenskyy, who has urged the American president to keep up the pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his brutal war.

However, the post did not include language about new U.S. sanctions or tariffs targeting Russia's energy sector, although Trump has discussed both, including with European leaders. And, neither did the post discuss fresh direct U.S. arms sales to Ukraine, instead suggesting that NATO members would continue to buy American weaponry and then transfer it to Ukraine.

Trump going back to his 2024 campaign insisted that he would quickly end the war. And he's frequently suggested that U.S. interests in the outcome were limited.




“Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win,” Trump wrote. “This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like ‘a paper tiger.'”

In his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy was seeking additional U.S. help in defending his country from Russia's onslaught of missiles, drones and bombs.

The two presidents, who have had strained ties in previous sitdowns, greeted each other warmly.

“We have great respect for the fight that Ukraine is putting up,” Trump told Zelenskyy, who replied that he had “good news” from the battlefield.

“We will speak of how to finish the war and security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said, thanking the U.S. leader for the meeting and for his “personal efforts to stop this war.”

As the fighting rages on, Trump said the “biggest progress” toward ending the conflict “is that the Russian economy is terrible right now.” Zelenskyy said Ukraine agreed with Trump's call for European nations to further halt imports of Russian oil and natural gas.

In his speech to the General Assembly earlier Tuesday, Trump said the war in Ukraine was making Russia “look bad” because it was “supposed to be a quick little skirmish.”

“It shows you what leadership is, what bad leadership can do to a country,” he said. “The only question now is how many lives will be needlessly lost on both sides.”

With his troops under strain on the front line after more than three years of fighting Russia's bigger invading army, Zelenskyy was meeting world leaders in New York and was due to speak at a special U.N. Security Council session on Ukraine.

Peace efforts set in motion by Trump since he returned to office in January appear to have stalled. Trump's Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and a White House meeting with Zelenskyy and key European leaders took place more than a month ago, but the war has continued unabated.

Following those meetings, Trump announced that he was arranging for direct talks between Putin and Zelenskyy. But Putin hasn't shown any interest in meeting with Zelenskyy and Moscow has only intensified its bombardment of Ukraine.

European leaders as well as American lawmakers, including some Republican allies of Trump, have urged the president to dial up stronger sanctions on Russia. Trump, meanwhile, has pressed Europe to stop buying Russian oil, the engine feeding Putin's war machine.

Trump said a “very strong round of powerful tariffs” would “stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly.” He repeated his calls for Europe to “step it up” and stop buying Russian oil.

Before meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump held talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who said Europe would be imposing more sanctions and tariffs on Russia and that the bloc would be further reducing its imports of Russian energy.

European leaders have supported Zelenskyy's diplomatic efforts, with some alarmed by the possibility that the war could spread beyond Ukraine as they are facing what they have called Russian provocations.

NATO allies will hold formal consultations at Estonia's request on Tuesday, after the Baltic country said that three Russian fighter jets entered its airspace last week without authorization. 

Trump said he would back NATO countries that choose to shoot down intruding Russian planes but said direct U.S. involvement would depend on the circumstances. 

Meanwhile, the full-scale war, which began on Feb. 24, 2022, continues to take a heavy toll on Ukrainian civilians.

The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said this month that Ukrainian civilian casualties increased by 40% in the first eight months of this year compared with 2024, as Russia escalated its long-range missile and localized drone strikes.

Also, a U.N. Human Rights Office report released Tuesday described the dire situation of thousands of civilians detained by Russia in areas of Ukraine it has captured.

“Russian authorities have subjected Ukrainian civilian detainees in occupied territory to torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, in a widespread and systematic manner,” the report said.

Russian aircraft dropped five glide bombs on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia overnight, killing a man, regional head Ivan Fedorov said Tuesday. In the Odesa region of southern Ukraine, Russian ballistic missiles struck the town center of Tatarbunary, killing a woman, regional head Oleh Kiper said.

Overall, Russian forces launched three Iskander ballistic missiles and 115 strike and decoy drones at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force said. It said 103 drones were intercepted or jammed, but 12 drones and three missiles reached their targets at six locations. 

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said more than 40 Ukrainian drones flying toward the Russian capital were shot down between Monday evening and midday Tuesday.

Flights were temporarily halted overnight in and out of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, causing delays and cancellations, because of the attack.

The Russian Defense Ministry reported Tuesday that it intercepted 69 Ukrainian drones over a number of Russian regions and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.

FARMINGDALE, N.Y. (AP) — The Ryder Cup had moments of inspiration in vastly different forms during a quiet Monday start to golf's most chaotic week. There were tears for the Americans as they gathered on the first tee at sunrise and a strong reminder for Europe as it goes after a rare road win.

U.S. captain Keegan Bradley had his entire team on the first tee before the gates open, no one in the massive grandstands that come Friday will be packed with flag-waving fans.

He had Chris Mascali, a New York firefighter whose father died during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, speak to the team. Mascali brought his uniform, along with the helmet of his father, Joe Mascali. Those now are in the team room for the Americans.

Bryan Robinson from FDNY Ladder 16 sang the national anthem as the large video board showed great moments in Ryder Cup history.

“I had this vision of doing that for about a year,” Bradley said. “And to be out there and see it, and see how emotional the guys got, was a really special time for our team.”

The Americans walked solemnly across the bridge from the first tee complex, headed to the practice area, then played 18 holes of the Black Course.

Team Europe spent two days at Bethpage Black a week ago and then dispersed — some to American homes, others playing some of Long Island's best golf courses — until returning to Bethpage for what it expects to be a big challenge.

The Americans have lost at home only four times since the Ryder Cup began in 1927. European captain Luke Donald had his team wear salmon-colored pullovers or sweater vests, a subtle reminder of what can be done.

That was the Sunday color for the European team in 1987 when it stunned the Americans at Muirfield Village to win its first Ryder Cup away from home. Europe has won three more times on U.S. soil since then, the most recent 13 years ago in what became known as the “Miracle at Medinah” because of the Sunday rally.

“That's motivating to the guys that it can be done, it has been done, and again, we're here to try and do it again,” Donald said.

Europe is coming off a resounding win at Marco Simone and returns 11 of the 12 players from the Italy matches in 2023 — the exception is Rasmus Hojgaard, the identical twin of Nicolai Hojgaard, who played in the last Ryder Cup.

But the Europeans lost by nine points in 2021 at Whistling Straits, by six points at Hazeltine in 2016 and by five points at Valhalla in 2008.

“I think it's always important to rally around something,” Donald said. “We always have things that we come up with that are important to us. History and our unity and celebrating what we've done in the past and the legends that have kind of come before us is really important.

“This is going to be a difficult challenge.”

There were not many surprises in the way Bradley grouped his three groups of four players for the only full practice round they play this week.

Justin Thomas and Cameron Young were together, as they were in the Procore Championship two weeks ago in Napa, California. Ben Griffin, one of four Ryder Cup rookies, was with Bryson DeChambeau, who was not in Napa because he's with LIV Golf and thus ineligible for PGA Tour play.

Scottie Scheffler was with Russell Henley — they formed a tough partnership in the Presidents Cup last year at Royal Montreal — along with U.S. Open champion J.J. Spaun and Harris English.

The final group had Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele, partners for most team matches over the last six years, along with Sam Burns and Collin Morikawa, who won a fourballs match in Marco Simone at the last Ryder Cup.

Schauffele and DeChambeau have gone about a month since last competing. DeChambeau finished the LIV season on Aug. 24, and Schauffele missed the Procore Championship while at home with a newborn son.

The captains are good friends, both living close to each other in South Florida, and shared one sentiment about the Ryder Cup. As tense as it has become, the goal is to enjoy the week not knowing if the opportunity will come up again.

Bradley played in two Ryder Cups, the last one in 2014. He has not been back in any capacity until the 39-year-old who played college golf at St. John's was named captain last year.

He felt that sentiment as his team gathered on the first tee to listen to Mascali.

“It was a powerful moment,” Bradley said. “You're looking around and seeing all the guys staring at what we were doing and so into it in such an emotional way. A lot of people have worked really hard to get to this point in their lives.

“Sometimes in your life and in your career, you have to take stock in what's happening around you,” he said. “I think one of my biggest regrets earlier in my career wasn't enjoying things more. And for that moment out this morning, guys were really taking that in and enjoying it, and that was a beautiful thing.”

President Donald Trump on Monday used the platform of the presidency to promote unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism as his administration announced a wide-ranging effort to study the causes of the complex brain disorder.

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump on Monday promoted unproven ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism without offering new medical evidence.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump instructed pregnant women around a dozen times during the unwieldy White House news conference, also urging mothers not to give their infants the drug, known by the generic name acetaminophen. He also repeated long-debunked claims that ingredients in vaccines or timing shots close together could contribute to rising rates of autism in the U.S., without providing medical evidence.

The rambling announcement, which appeared to rely on existing studies rather than significant new research, comes as the Make America Healthy Again movement has been pushing for answers on the causes of autism.

Here's what to know: 








The New York City mayoral candidate is open again to participating in a town hall hosted by a local ABC outlet now that the national network says Kimmel's late night show has been reinstated.

Mamdani said hours ago that he was pulling out of the event following ABC's recent decision to suspend the late-night host for comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which sparked a backlash.

“Last week, Disney/ABC caved to Trump administration pressure. Millions of Americans helped them find their backbone. Whether you watch Jimmy Kimmel or not, today's decision is a victory for free speech,” the Democrat wrote on X. “We've reached out to WABC to reschedule the town hall.” 

Mamdani is facing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November election.

President Trump repeatedly told Americans not to use Tylenol during pregnancy, going far beyond more measured language published by his health regulators.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump said of the bestselling form of acetaminophen, raising his voice. “There's no downside. Don't take it.”

But a letter published by the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's afternoon news conference says only that doctors “should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.”

The FDA points to recent evidence suggesting an association between the pain reliever and conditions like autism and attention deficit disorder. But it also includes the qualifier that “a causal relationship has not been established.”

U.S. physicians are not bound by FDA guidance and can prescribe and recommend medications for alternate uses. Medical experts say untreated fever during pregnancy carries significant risks to moms and babies, such as miscarriage and birth defects.

That's according to a person granted anonymity because they are unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The Democratic leaders Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer had requested the meeting in a weekend letter to the president, imploring him to open talks over their demands to protect health care program funds as part of any deal.



Another person familiar with the talks said the meeting between Trump and the two Democratic leaders is now scheduled for Thursday. The person also was given anonymity for lack of authorization to speak publicly. 



The federal government is heading toward a shutdown next week, Oct. 1, if Congress fails to act.

The former Senate majority leader echoed concerns first raised by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that some government officials may violate First Amendment principles by coercing private individuals and companies to remove speech some find distasteful.“

As a First Amendment guy, myself, I think he's probably got it right,” McConnell wrote on X. “You don't have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn't be getting involved here.”

President Donald Trump and multiple senior officials in his administration have called on Disney, which owns the ABC network, to remove late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel from the airwaves and said the federal government may use its leverage to force a change. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said that comments Kimmel made in the aftermath of Kirk's killing may prompt retaliatory action from the telecommunications regulator.

“We can do this the easy way, or the hard way,” Carr said at the time. Carr denied on Monday that he threatened to revoke ABC's local station licenses because of Kimmel's remarks.

Lindsey Halligan was sworn in Monday as interim U.S. attorney for the prestigious prosecutors' office that's overseeing separate criminal investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

She replaces Erik Siebert, a longtime prosecutor who resigned Friday amid pressure from administration officials to indict James.

Halligan will immediately face intense scrutiny given Trump's public calls on the Justice Department to move forward with prosecutions against the president's perceived political foes.

Halligan has been part of Trump's legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI's investigation into his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

The Food and Drug Administration is taking the first steps to try and approve a decades-old generic drug for a new group of patients, including some who may have autism.

The agency said it will seek approval of leucovorin for patients believed to have low levels of folate, one form of vitamin B, in the brain. That may include some people with autism.

The agency's highly unusual move is based on a review of small studies performed between 2009 and 2024.

Several studies have recently suggested the drug may help with autism symptoms when given to certain children. But autism experts say much larger, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm any benefit.

The discontinued drug, previously marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, was sold in tablets to treat side effects of chemotherapy. It's currently available in other forms.

Trump is flying to New York to give a speech Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly.

His departure from the White House has been delayed by about a half an hour because the autism announcement started nearly an hour behind schedule.

As part of the president's announcement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya said his agency has launched the Autism Data Science Initiative to “turbocharge” autism research. He said millions of dollars will be spent to collect the data.

The NIH and other research institutes have studied autism for decades.

The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.

Besides warning people about taking Tylenol during pregnancy, the Trump administration on Monday raised unfounded concerns about vaccines contributing to rising rates of autism, which affects 1 in 31 U.S. children today, according to the CDC. 

Any concern that measles vaccine — or other vaccines — could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stress scientists and leading advocacy groups for people with autism.

While Trump insists there's no downside to not treating a fever during pregnancy, obstetricians disagree.

The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine says untreated fevers in pregnancy, particularly the first trimester, increase the risk for miscarriages, preterm birth and other problems.

The manufacturer of Tylenol, the best-selling form of acetaminophen, says it “strongly disagrees” with the suggestion that its drug may cause autism.

Kenvue said in a statement that “sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.” The company pointed to scientific reviews by multiple government regulators worldwide, including those previously published by the FDA.

Shares of Kenvue Inc. fell 7.5% in trading Monday, reducing the company's market value by about $2.6 billion.

Tylenol's original manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, spun off the best-selling brand in 2023.

In addition to Tylenol, acetaminophen is used in hundreds of other over-the-counter cold and flu formulas.

The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said Monday that suggestions that Tylenol use in pregnancy causes autism are “irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients.”

“Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” Dr. Steven Fleischman said in a statement. 

“It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”

Tylenol is “an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy,” the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said.

The expert group says untreated fever during pregnancy carries significant risks to moms and babies, such as miscarriage and birth defects.

There has been research on a potential link between Tylenol during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children, but it “does not establish a causal relationship,” the society said in its statement. It said the studies have significant limitations.

The president said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration will be notifying doctors that the use of acetaminophen “can be associated” with an increased risk of autism.



Trump, several minutes into the announcement, has not offered medical evidence for the FDA's new recommendation.



Still, Trump said the FDA will strongly recommend that pregnant woman not take Tylenol unless “medically necessary.”



“Ideally you don't take it at all,” Trump said.



American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has long recommended acetaminophen as a safe pain reliever option during pregnancy.

The president has started his remarks on the issue.

He is speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, accompanied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and other administration officials who focus on health.

ABC will reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's late night show in the wake of criticism over his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, officials with the network said Monday.

“We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” said a statement from the network.

ABC suspended Kimmel indefinitely after comments he made about Kirk, who was killed Sept. 10, in a monologue. Kimmel said “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”

The White House is standing behind “border czar” Tom Homan following reports that he had accepted $50,000 from undercover agents posing as businesspeople during an undercover FBI operation last year, leading to a bribery investigation that was shut down by the Trump administration Justice Department.

MSNBC first reported Saturday that Homan had accepted the cash during a 2024 encounter with undercover agents who were posing as businesspeople seeking government contracts that Homan suggested he could help them get in a second Trump term.

Two people familiar with the investigation, who were not authorized to discuss a sensitive law enforcement inquiry by name, confirmed details of it to The Associated Press on Monday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt characterized Homan's encounter with the undercover agents as an effort by the Biden administration to “entrap one of the president's top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position.”

She said the White House and Trump stand by Homan “100 % because he did absolutely nothing wrong.”

The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider expanding President Donald Trump's power to shape independent agencies by overturning a nearly century-old decision limiting when presidents can fire board members.

The justices have allowed the Republican president to carry out some high-profile firings while lawsuits play out, signaling the conservative majority is poised to overturn or narrow a 1935 Supreme Court decision that found commissioners can only be removed for misconduct or neglect of duty.

The high court agreed to take up the case of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission who was reinstated by lower courts under a 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor. In that case, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D. Roosevelt as the president worked to implement the New Deal. The justices unanimously found commissioners can be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.

Leavitt said Trump “is aware” of an offer by Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend by a year an arms control treaty limiting both sides' nuclear capabilities.

She said, “I think it sounds pretty good” but that Trump “wants to make some comments about it himself” and that she'd “let him do that” when the president speaks to reporters in the Oval Office during an unrelated announcement on autism coming up later Monday.

Leavitt said the White House had gotten a letter from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro but would not detail its contents.

Venezuela said over the weekend that Maduro wrote to Trump, rejecting implications his government was involved in drug trafficking.

“I think there were a lot of lies that were repeated by Maduro in that letter,” Leavitt said.

She added, “We view the Maduro regime as illegitimate” and that Trump “has clearly shown that he's willing to use any and all means necessary to stop the illegal trafficking of deadly drugs from the Venezuelan regime.”

Trump previously announced fatal U.S. strikes on alleged drug smuggling vessels associated with Venezuela, and the president said Friday that a third strike took out another vessel, without providing location details.

A federal judge on Monday rule that the Trump administration can't continue to keep work paused on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project has been stopped since Aug. 22, when the Interior Department halted the project over unspecified national security concerns.

Both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts seeking to resume the project. Danish energy company Orsted sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court in Washington that would allow the project to move forward.

Judge Royce Lamberth granted it, citing likely irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.

Several U.S. allies, including Canada, Australia and Britain, have announced support for a Palestinian state, putting them at odds with Trump.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Trump feels such recognition won't do anything to secure release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, nor will it end the war between Israel and Hamas.He also believes such recognition rewards the militant group operating in Gaza.

“So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies,” Leavitt said, adding that Trump would address the issue in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is denying that Trump is attempting to weaponize the Justice Department by urging his attorney general to go after his perceived political foes.

Leavitt was asked at a White House briefing Monday about a social media post over the weekend that Trump directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi in which he demanded action on investigations related to public officials including former FBI Director James Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. 

His post came one day after the top federal prosecutor in charge of the Eastern District of Virginia resigned his position amid pressure to bring charges against James in a mortgage fraud investigation.

Leavitt told reporters at the White House that Trump was merely trying to demand accountability. She denied that he had weaponized the Justice Department and instead blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for having done that.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa who is in New York this week as the first Syrian leader to attend the United Nations General Assembly in nearly 60 years.

Neither man spoke as they posed for photos ahead of their U.S.-hosted meeting at Rubio's midtown Manhattan hotel.

The last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967. That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad's fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.

Since then, al-Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaida militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.

The State Department waived Assad-era visa restrictions on Syria for al-Sharaa and his delegation for them to participate in the general assembly's high-level week, which kicks off on Tuesday.

Trump flies to New York City later Monday to be in place for what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said will be a “major speech” to the world body on Tuesday on the “renewal of American strength around the world” under his leadership.

Leavitt said Trump will also hold one-on-one meetings with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and the leaders of Ukraine, Argentina and the European Union.

Trump on Tuesday will also hold a group meeting with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

He'll return to Washington after hosting a reception Tuesday night with more than 100 world leaders.

The Trump administration is appealing an appellate court panel's ruling that it cannot use an 18th century wartime law to speed deportations of people it says belong to a Venezuelan gang.

The administration appealed the 2-1 ruling from the panel on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — one of the most conservative in the nation — to the entire circuit. In doing so, the administration opted against an immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The administration argues the majority of the panel erred in second-guessing President Donald Trump's determination that the gang constitutes an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” under the Alien Enemies Act.

Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr is denying that he threatened to revoke ABC's local station licenses if the broadcasting company did not fire late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, despite saying last week that “these companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

“Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation he's in because of his ratings. Not because of anything that's happened at the federal government level,” Carr said at the Concordia Annual Summit.

Carr said late night television hosts abandoned their role as “court jesters that make fun of everybody” and became “court clerks, where they were enforcing a very narrow, sort of partisan view.”

“And that's not for me, ultimately, to judge,” Carr said. “That's for the ratings and the audience to judge.”

The Trump administration has barred Iranian diplomats based in or visiting New York from shopping at wholesale club stores like Costco.

They also must get specific permission from the State Department before purchasing luxury goods.

The department's Office of Foreign Missions determined that diplomatic memberships in wholesale club stores as well as diplomats' ability to buy items like furs and jewelry are a “benefit” requiring U.S. government approval. 

However, the only country whose diplomats were specifically targeted is Iran.

Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appeared before the Security Council for the first time Monday.

Waltz spoke during the emergency meeting of the U.N.'s most powerful body on the topic of Russia's recent incursion into Estonian airspace.

“As we said, nine days ago, the United States stands by our NATO allies in the face of these airspace violations,” the former Republican congressman said.

“And I want to take this first opportunity to repeat and to emphasize the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory.”

Trump said Saturday that he will award Ben Carson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the third such award he's announced this month.

A former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Carson, 74, went on to serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration.

The one-time rivals developed a strong bond, and Carson — seen at one point as among the top contenders for Trump's running mate in the 2024 campaign — served as Trump's national faith chairman during last year's race.

A staunch social conservative who has opposed abortion rights and same-sex marriage, Carson has become a popular conservative speaker and author.

The Medal of Freedom, established in 1963, is awarded to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, or cultural or other significant public endeavors.

Tech giant Oracle will receive a copy of TikTok's algorithm to operate for U.S. users, according to a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration on Monday.

Determining next steps for the algorithm, currently owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, has been one of the most closely watched issues during negotiations over TikTok's future.

The Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the emerging deal, said they believe the plan will satisfy national security concerns over a Chinese company potentially manipulating what is being shown to platform users.

Full details on investors have not been released. However, the official confirmed that Silver Lake, a private equity firm, is part of the investment group.

President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed bipartisan legislation before leaving office requiring ByteDance, the Chinese company behind TikTok, to sell its assets to an American company or face a ban.

Trump, a Republican, has extended the deadline several times as he worked to reach a deal to keep TikTok available. He spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

John Jovanovic, Trump's recently confirmed chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, vowed no more “business as usual” in public remarks criticizing a trade system he said has placed vital supply chains under the control of free market opponents.

“EXIM will no longer be focused on distractions, namely anything that does not help create jobs here in America and ensure American companies are treated fairly in every market in which they operate,” Jovanovic said at the Concordia Annual Summit in New York.

The event, scheduled for 4 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room, will be closely watched by scientists and advocates.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised earlier this year to determine the cause of autism by September. 

The announcement alarmed experts because Kennedy has promoted discredited theories that routine childhood shots cause the developmental disability.

Speaking at a memorial for Charlie Kirk on Sunday, Trump said “I think we found an answer to autism.""On the flight back to Washington, he suggested that children receive too many vaccines. “It's like you're shooting up a horse,” he told reporters.

Fox News correspondent Danamarie McNicholl reports on what appears to have prompted Ryan Routh's daughter to storm out of the courtroom after her father's guilty verdict on all counts on 'America Reports.'

Jurors on Tuesday delivered a guilty verdict for Ryan Routh on all charges after he attempted to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club last September. 

After the verdict was read, Routh reportedly appeared to try to stab himself in the neck with a pen before four U.S. Marshals restrained him.

His daughter, Sara Routh, reportedly stood up and said:

""Don't do anything. I will get you out. What the f---, f---, he didn't hurt anybody. This is not fair. This is all rigged – you guys are a--holes."" The jury was still in the room at the time. 

Routh, 59, was charged on five federal criminal counts, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses.

The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. 

Jurors deliberated for several hours before returning to the court with a verdict.

The update comes after a nearly three-week trial. Prosecutors used the bulk of their closing arguments Tuesday to emphasize both the digital and forensic evidence presented at trial and what they described as Routh's clear intent: to kill Trump. 

They noted the 1 7 ""reconnaissance"" trips he allegedly made to Trump's golf course, and what they described as his excessive stalking of Trump, prior to the Sept. 15, 2024 incident in question.

This part was critical for the prosecution to convict Routh on the first and most serious criminal count: Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. 

In order to secure a conviction on that charge, prosecutors had to prove to jurors two things: First, that the defendant had the intent to carry out the crime, and second, that the defendant had taken ""substantial steps"" to do so.

During closing arguments, federal prosecutors stressed that it should not be difficult for jurors to conclude that they'd met that bar.

""This was not a publicity stunt,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Browne told the jury. ""The evidence has shown one thing and one thing only — the defendant wanted Donald Trump dead.""

There is ""no doubt, no reasonable doubt, no doubt whatsoever that it was this man,"" Browne said, stopping to point to Routh, ""who was hiding"" in the sniper's nest for what they said was roughly 10 hours, beginning around 4 a.m.

Prosecutors spent nearly two full weeks meticulously presenting their case. They walked jurors through hundreds of pieces of evidence, including call logs, text messages, forensic evidence, and surveillance footage that they used to carefully track Routh's actions.

They also used bank records to tie Routh to the purchase of a SKS semi-automatic 7.62x39 caliber rifle that was recovered near Trump's golf course.

Expert witnesses for the prosecution testified that the weapon was in working condition. Forensic experts said the fingerprint on the scope matched to Routh. They also linked Routh's DNA to matches on the rifle itself, as well as gloves, a bag, and other items. 

Browne reminded jurors Tuesday that there were 19 rounds found in the magazine of the SKS rifle that was recovered at the scene, including one in the chamber. 

""This was not a publicity stunt,"" Browne told the jury. ""The evidence has shown one thing and one thing only — the defendant wanted Donald Trump dead,"" Browne said.

A total of 38 witnesses testified for the prosecution before it rested its arguments Friday. 

A box delivered months earlier to Samuel and Lazaro Plata — brothers from North Carolina — contained pipes, bullets, wires, and a 12-page manifesto titled ""Dear World."" In it, Routh allegedly offered $150,000 to anyone willing to ""complete the job."" After a series of court rulings, prosecutors were permitted to introduce only the first three lines of the letter.

FBI digital evidence showed web searches, flight-tracking activity, texts about Trump's rallies and plane movements, license-plate reader records of Routh's vehicle (a black Nissan Xterra) and other surveillance tying him to Palm Beach County around the same time of the assassination attempt.

Law enforcement testimony described ""sniper tradecraft"" involving a hideout near the 6th hole on the golf course, steel plates for ballistic protection, concealment, fences used for support of weaponry and long-distance shooting lanes on the 6th and 7th holes.

Routh, who represented himself in the case, did not introduce any evidence that was deemed to be admissible in court. 

He rested his own defense after just several hours Monday, and after questioning just three witness — two of whom were friends and colleagues, who acknowledged during cross-examination that they had not seen or spoken to Routh in years.

South Dakota state Rep. Peri Pourier, who had been a Democrat, announced Monday that she switched her voter registration to Republican.

""I have formally changed my voter registration from Democrat to Republican. My name will now appear with an (R) designation,"" she said in a statement.

The move leaves just five Democrats in the Mount Rushmore State's House, compared to a whopping 65 Republicans.

Pourier, who is Oglala Lakota, suggested that the key pillars of the GOP line up ""with the principle of tribal sovereignty.""

""The core tenets of the Republican Party, decentralized government, self-determination, economic prosperity, lower energy costs, and strong public safety align with the principle of tribal sovereignty,"" she noted.

""By contrast, well-intentioned Democratic reforms have too often undermined sovereignty. Under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 forced a one-size-fits-all model of governance that disregarded traditional systems and tied federal funding to this imposed framework. ""

""What was presented as empowerment ultimately diminished nationhood, reinforced federal control and depilating [sic] any hope of self-sufficiency. The long-term consequences of such federal policy failures are still felt on the Pine Ridge reservation today,"" she asserted.

Country star Kenny Chesney is mourning the sudden and devastating loss of his longtime friend, Brett James.

James, whose songwriting credits shaped some of the biggest hits in country music, was confirmed dead in a tragic plane crash that also killed his wife and stepdaughter on Sept. 18. He was 57.

In a heartfelt tribute shared on X (formerly Twitter), Chesney remembered the deep creative bond they shared for decades.

""A very difficult goodbye to my Brother Of The Sun Brett James,"" Chesney, 57, wrote.

""I haven't wanted to post cause I didn't want to believe it. Brett and I shared a unique bond. A Brotherhood. A kinship.""

The duo created several beloved hits together, some of which Chesney recalled were written in a single afternoon.

""We wrote Reality and Out Last Night on the same afternoon sitting on my pool deck in the Virgin Islands two days after Christmas,"" he said.

James, whose songwriting credits included other chart-toppers like Carrie Underwood's ""Jesus, Take the Wheel"" and Jason Aldean's ""The Truth,"" was more than a collaborator for Chesney – he was family.

""We had a lot of authentic life fun writing songs together over the years and I'm sure going to miss it,"" Chesney continued. ""It's hard to process his creative soul being gone. This kind of loss. I feel as if part of my creative soul went with him.""

Chesney acknowledged how much of James' songwriting is showcased in his set lists.

""Half the songs in my shows are songs he wrote or songs we wrote together. So it's impossible for me to do shows moving forward and not think about him.""

Chesney said that several of the songs he typically performs in concerts were written or co-written by James. (Rick Diamond/Getty Images for BMI)

The country star concluded his tribute with a gut-wrenching goodbye.

""I can't believe I'm saying it but adios Brett James,"" he wrote. ""Thank you for being a lifer, for being a shirtless, sunburned troubadour, for your friendship, your songs and all the laughs. Save me a seat at the After Party!""

He closed with lyrics from his song, ""Knowing You.""

""God we were so alive /  I was a kid on a carnival ride / Holding my breath til the moment you were gonna leave me to soon / But I'd do it all over cause damn it was good Knowing You.""

The Department of War on Tuesday announced Secretary Pete Hegseth has decided to terminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS), a civilian advisory group that provides recommendations on policies affecting women in the U.S. Armed Forces.

Department of War press secretary Kingsley Wilson made the announcement on X, calling the committee ""divisive.""

""The Committee is focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness, while Secretary [Pete] Hegseth has focused on advancing uniform, sex-neutral standards across the Department,"" Wilson wrote in the post.

The DACOWITS website notes it focuses on recruitment, retention, employment, integration, well-being and treatment of service women.

Committee members gather data through briefings, written responses, expert input and direct interactions with service member focus groups during installation visits.

While 17.7% of U.S. military service members are women, the Department of War's 2023 demographics report called for the Marine Corps to fully integrate recruit training at the platoon level and to use mixed-gender drill instructor teams.

The report also suggested adopting new gender and race-sensitive body composition standards and reviewing the last 10 years of promotion data by gender and race.

THE WARRIOR ETHOS EFFECT: WHY FEMALE ENLISTMENT IS SURGING UNDER TRUMP

As one of the oldest War Department advisory committees, the DACOWITS claims its recommendations have ""historically been instrumental in effecting changes to laws and policies pertaining to military women,"" according to the site.

Other less controversial recommendations in the committee's 2023 report included ensuring the timely distribution of female-specific aviation safety gear, standardizing maternity leave, updating maternity uniforms for function and professionalism and distinguishing between sexual harassment and gender-based discriminatory harassment.

Since 1951, the committee said it has submitted more than 1,100 recommendations to the Secretary of War, with about 94% full or partial adoption by the department, as of 2025.

AIR FORCE TIGHTENS RULES ON TRANSGENDER AIRMEN; SUPPORTERS SAY IT PRIORITIZES READINESS: REPORT

The Bush administration in 2002 scaled back the DACOWITS, with officials more than two decades ago claiming the panel ran rampant and promoted gender quotas.

""Its agenda — which promotes gender quotas, women in combat roles, and gender-integrated basic training — weakens the basic purpose of the military: to fight and win wars,"" Nancy M. Pfotenhauer, president at the time of the Independent Women's Forum, wrote in a 2002 statement.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday at the UN that he thinks NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace.

President Donald Trump called on NATO countries Tuesday to shoot down any Russian jets that violate their airspace.

Trump made the comments during a bilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Both leaders were in New York City on Tuesday for a United Nations General Assembly meeting.

""Do you think that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft if they enter their airspace?"" a reporter asked.

""Yes, I do,"" Trump replied.

The statement came hours after Trump slammed the United Nations for not aiding his administration's peace push and for ""creating new problems"" for the U.S. and member nations. He also questioned the UN's purpose and offered ""the hand of American leadership and friendship"" to all countries in the body.

""Not only is the U.N. not solving the problems it should. It, too often, is actually creating new problems for us to solve,"" Trump said. ""The best example is the No. 1 political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration. It is uncontrolled. Your countries are being ruined.""

The president said the U.N. is ""funding an assault on Western countries and their borders.""

""The U.N. is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States, and we have to get them out,"" Trump said. ""The U.N. also provided food, shelter, transportation and debit cards to illegal aliens.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions — not create them and not finance them.""

Trump said illegal immigrants are also ""pouring into Europe.""

""It is not sustainable and, because they choose to be politically correct, they are doing absolutely nothing about it,"" Trump said. ""Your countries are going to hell. In America, we've taken bold action to swiftly shut down uncontrolled migration.

""Once we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border and removing illegal aliens from the United States, they simply stop coming. They're not coming anymore,"" Trump said, while thanking El Salvador for ""receiving and jailing criminals"" who entered the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Google vows to restore YouTube content creators banned over political speech","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/3819776/google-vows-restore-youtube-creators-banned-political-speech/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:02:41 GMT","

Google has indicated that it plans to restore YouTube content creators who were banned for violating the platform's past political speech policies, the House Judiciary Committee announced on Tuesday.

Under the Biden administration, Google targeted conservative accounts for covering politically divisive topics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.

A lawyer for Google's parent company admitted the Biden administration exerted its executive authority, pressuring the tech company to censor people and remove certain content in a new letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

“Senior Biden Administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies,” Alphabet counsel Daniel Donovan wrote.

“While the Company continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press the Company to remove non-violative user-generated content.”

The lawyer called the Biden White House's censorship pressure “unacceptable and wrong,” adding that Google “has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds.”

Google's statement came as a result of Jordan's March 6 subpoena to Google as part of his investigation into the company, according to a Judiciary Committee press release.

In the letter, Google committed itself to protecting free expression and applying its community guidelines and terms of service “equally to all users” and “to all types of content, regardless of the viewpoints expressed.”

Google removed channels for violating its policies on election-related content through 2023 and COVID-19 content through 2024, Donovan said.

The company has since overhauled its policies that unfairly targeted political speech.

“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” the letter reads.

The Washington Examiner contacted Google for further comment.

Among the top conservative figures who were removed from YouTube are now-Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and current Trump deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka. Each of them was permanently banned for speaking on alleged misinformation about COVID-19 or the 2020 election, which President Donald Trump claimed was rigged against him.

Bannon, in particular, was accused of inciting violence against then-National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci and then-FBI Director Christopher Wray in 2020. He was subsequently punished by YouTube and Twitter.

When asked for comment by the Washington Examiner about Google's move to reinstate banned accounts, Bannon offered a direct message to those who censored him: “Google oligarchs, go f*** yourself — our mission is to destroy you.”

It remains to be seen whether previously banned content creators take up Google on its offer to return to the video platform. Bannon's War Room podcast started posting content on YouTube again earlier this year. Its last video was from two weeks ago.

While some accounts have been removed from the site, others have had their videos deleted.

This was the case for right-wing commentator Tim Pool, whose video featuring Alex Jones and Joe Rogan was removed. He requested that YouTube restore the episode after Tuesday's news.

TECH COMPANY PENALTIES HANG OVER TRUMP'S UK STATE VISIT

“The episode was banned 3 years after airing for incredibly dubious reasons related to ‘medical misinformation,'” Pool posted on X.

Later on his show, he asked whether YouTube would start removing antifa content for promoting violence in line with the platform's “violent extremist or criminal organizations policy.” Trump recently designated antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump used his address to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly to decry the state of the organization and detail his vision for a new world order.

Acting as a metaphor for the U.N. as a whole, Trump complained that he was met with a broken escalator and a malfunctioning teleprompter, before tearing apart the organization itself over the course of an hour. He compared the failures of the U.N. with his own domestic accomplishments, including immigration and the economy, and his foreign policy achievements.

“Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term,” Trump told the U.N.'s annual leaders summit on Tuesday. “Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents,” he said, referencing the Russia–Ukraine and Israel–Hamas conflicts.

To that end, Trump asked the crowd what the purpose of the U.N. is, contending that it “has such tremendous potential” but that “it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.”

“For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a strongly worded letter and never follow that letter up,” he said. “It's empty words, and empty words do not solve war. The only thing that solves war is action.”

LIVE UPDATES: WORLD LEADERS GATHER IN NEW YORK FOR 2025 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Trump escalated his criticism, claiming that not only did he not receive a phone call from the U.N. as he tried to negotiate peace deals, but that the organization “is actually creating new problems,” particularly regarding immigration.

“All I got from the U.N. was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle and a teleprompter that didn't work,” he said. “The best example is the No. 1 political issue of our time — the crisis of uncontrolled migration. Your countries are being ruined. The U.N. is funding an assault on Western countries.”

Trump, who also said, “Everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize,” acknowledged the foreign policy challenges posed by the likes of Israel, Gaza, Russia, and Ukraine, in addition to Iran and Venezuela. At the same time, he underscored a new dynamic between the United States, Europe, and China.

Of Iran, Trump repeated that his position “is very simple: the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon.”

Then, of Israel and Hamas, Trump reiterated that the terrorist organization should reduce its demands and instead release its remaining hostages “now.”

Regarding Russia and Ukraine, Trump criticized China and India as “the primary funders” of the war because they continue to rely on Russian energy before alleging that NATO allies are “funding the war against themselves” through similar oil purchases.

“In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. “But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.”

Trump had a particularly stark warning for Europe, again regarding immigration, asserting London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for example, wanted to introduce Sharia law toi his city to murmurs from the audience.

“It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now,” he said. “I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff — your countries are going to hell.”

A senior diplomat, who made a quip about the U.N. headquarters building, particularly its air conditioning, told the Washington Examiner it was “great” that Trump “recognizes the potential of the U.N.” 

“He mentioned Europe multiple times,” the source said. “This I take as an evidence that the U.S. is ready to engage with its closest ally. There are things we [have] already done like a trade deal. There are things where the [European Union] moved much faster on support for Ukraine and sanctions.”

During his bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Trump appeared to temper his address, telling the former Portuguese prime minister that the U.S. is behind the U.N. “100 percent.” 

“I think the potential of the United Nations is incredible. Really incredible. It can do so much. I'm behind it. I may disagree with it some times, but I am so behind it,” he said. “The potential for peace with this institution is so great. So I just want to thank you for treating us so lovely.”

During his address, before he scrutinized climate change and renewable energy policies as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” Trump announced that his administration would “lead an international effort to enforce [the] Biological Weapons Convention, which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an [artificial intelligence] verification system that everyone can trust.”

“I'm really good at predicting things,” he said. “During the campaign, they had a hat, a bestselling hat, ‘Trump was right about everything.' And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything.”

At the start of the address, Trump seemed to enjoy a warm welcome, mentioning that the teleprompter was not working for his remarks as first lady Melania Trump, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, newly confirmed U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz, and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff watched on.

“Whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said to laughs.

During his own address to the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres bemoaned decreases in foreign aid funding as “wreaking havoc” on advancements made since the U.N. was established 80 years ago.

“They are a death sentence for many,” he said. “For so many more, a stolen future. This is the great paradox of our time. We have the solutions, but we are siphoning off the fuel that would make it possible to make progress. To choose dignity, we must choose financial justice and solidarity. We need to reform the international financial architecture so it drives development for all.”

For American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer, Trump “undermined his message by going off script for extended moments that distracted the listener and blurred what precisely he wanted the U.N. and the assembled governments to do to support to America's priorities and respond to its concerns.”

“This was not a wasted opportunity, but one that could have been better utilized,” he told the Washington Examiner.

Trump and the first lady arrived together on Tuesday at the U.N. headquarters, where they were greeted by U.N. officials and interested onlookers alike at the delegate entrance. Some observers waved to Trump, with the president responding with fist pumps after having to walk up the escalator that was not working.

Trump is expected to with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after his address and take part in a multilateral sit-down with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

“After these important meetings, the president will attend a reception tomorrow night with more than 100 world leaders before returning to Washington, D.C.,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday canceled a sit-down with Democratic congressional leaders less than 24 hours after a meeting was confirmed on the looming government shutdown.

The president said that after reviewing the “unserious and ridiculous” demands from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), he determined no meeting could “possibly be productive.”

“There are consequences to losing Elections but, based on their letter to me, the Democrats haven't figured that out yet,” Trump said in a post to Truth Social.

The Washington Examiner confirmed on Monday that a meeting between Trump and the leaders would take place on Thursday. Less than a day later, the president changed his mind, telling Jeffries and Schumer that the “ball is in your court” and they “must do their job.”

“I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,” Trump said.

The president is the latest Republican placing blame for a possible government shutdown on the Democrats despite the GOP holding the White House and both chambers of Congress. Historically, any shutdown reflects badly on the party in power, but Republicans have been quick to argue that they are advocating a short-term spending deal that maintains Biden administration spending levels and that Democrats want unnecessary additions such as an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

Jeffries said in a post to X that Trump “Always Chickens Out.”

“Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,” Jeffries said. “The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.”

Schumer said in a statement, “Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there. While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.”

The deadline is fast approaching on Sept. 30, when the federal government will shut down. House lawmakers passed a short-term spending deal on Friday and sent it over to the Senate, but that proposal and an alternative from Democrats both failed on the floor.

House members are expected to be in a two-week recess until after Oct. 1, while the Senate is likely to return on Sept. 29 for last-minute negotiations on the continuing resolution to fund the government. The bill extends funding until Nov. 21 to allow lawmakers to continue working on passing all 12 appropriations bills for the fiscal year.

DEMOCRATS RISK SHUTDOWN BLAME GAME WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING HARDBALL

Democrats offered a proposal that would include money for member security in addition to the funds proposed in the GOP's continuing resolution, as well as include provisions to extend the Obamacare tax credits that expire at the end of the year. Schumer and Jeffries have been in lockstep when it comes to a blockade, arguing they won't vote for it unless there are healthcare concessions.

This puts the Senate at a standstill, as 60 votes are required to break the filibuster, and Republicans do not reach that number with just their own members.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Return of the self-deluding Barack Obama","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/fairness-justice/3817665/return-of-self-deluding-barack-obama/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Here he goes again. The self-deluding Barack Obama hit a new low last week when he tried to absolve his presidency of any responsibility for the deep divisions in America that led to Charlie Kirk's assassination. Instead, Obama blamed President Donald Trump.

“Those extreme views were not in my White House,” Obama claimed in remarks to the Jefferson Society. “I wasn't empowering them. I wasn't putting the weight of the United States government behind them. When we have the weight of the United States government behind extremist views, we've got a problem.”

Either I've misremembered Obama's two terms in the Oval Office, or he's delusional. 

Beginning with a 2010 Univision interview, in which he urged Hispanics to “punish our enemies” in the midterm elections, Obama started dividing Americans into friends and foes. Obama was the first modern president to rally voters against the opposing party by calling them “enemies.” That kind of divisive rhetoric hadn't been used since the Civil War. In the Univision interview, Obama said publicly what he'd been saying privately for over a year. In the spring of 2009, the populist tea party movement sprang up in response to the Federal Reserve's bailouts of Wall Street, while Main Street businesses went under and millions of Americans lost their homes.

Its supporters were largely the class of Americans Obama belittled at a San Francisco fundraiser as “bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment.” Primed by his own prejudices to see these fellow Americans as a political threat, Obama went on offense. His strategy was to use the media to smear tea party patriots as bigots. Obama directed White House aides to put the word out to legacy media that the movement was motivated not by the individual liberty, pro-market, and small government principles it proclaimed but by racism, pure and simple.

Suddenly, millions of Americans found themselves labeled as racist enemies of the Obama White House. Soon thereafter, the tea party was under scrutiny by the IRS. Lois Lerner, head of the tax agency's Exempt Organizations Unit, oversaw the denial of tax-exempt status to tea party-affiliated groups and demands for lists of donors. In congressional testimony, Lerner pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating herself and was censured by Congress as a result.

In his memoir A Promised Land, Obama reveals how his hatred of the tea party morphed into his belief that Republicans were the “enemy.” He attacked Sarah Palin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and subsequent leader of the tea party movement. “Through Palin,” Obama wrote, “it seemed as if the dark spirits that had long been lurking on the edges of the modern Republican Party — xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, paranoid conspiracy theories, an antipathy toward black and brown folks — were finding their way to center stage.”

Victor Davis Hanson was on to Obama's game years earlier. In a January 2012 CBS News column titled “Barack Obama's Most Disturbing Legacy,” he chronicled Obama's propensity for dividing Americans by race and ethnicity. He termed it “racial tribalism.” Hanson explained the political calculus behind Obama's racial tactics.

“Any short-term damage incurred by engaging in racial tribalism can easily be later erased by soaring teleprompted speeches on racial harmony; the media will either not widely report his emphases on race or generally support his charges; a person of color can hardly be culpable of racial polarization himself given the history of racial discrimination in this country,” Hansen wrote.

“There will be many legacies of Barack Obama,” Hansen concluded. “Racial divisiveness is proving the most disturbing.”

Hansen's prediction of polarization was prescient. In January 2017, Gallup released a poll headlined “Obama Job Approval Ratings Most Politically Polarized By Far.” Under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, polarization was minimal. It began its climb during George W. Bush's presidency and then soared under Obama to a 70% gap between Democrats and Republicans. 

Obama's worldview that Republicans, especially white Republicans, were “enemies” and all opponents racists and bigots drove polarization to extremes. In his second term, he harped on race. 

“Racism, we are not cured of,” Obama said on a 2015 podcast with comedian Marc Maron, “and it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‘n*****' in public. That's not a measure of whether racism still exists or not. Societies don't overnight completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.”

Obama foreshadowed Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo's critique of America as systemically racist. This was pure critical race theory, a harbinger of the CRT and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that relied on a concept psychologists term “splitting,” in which the world is divided into moral absolutes like oppressors and the oppressed, or anti-racists and racists, with no shades of gray.

Splitting, psychologists tell us, is an ego-defense that helps people cling to a rigid belief system, aka political ideology, when confronted with facts that don't fit into their orthodoxy. The conscious self safeguards the ego's belief system from challenge, but the unconscious self realizes the difference between belief and reality. 

TURNING POINT'S ERIKA KIRK TURNS GRIEF TO MOBILIZATION FOR YOUNG CONSERVATIVE WOMEN

Self-deception results as a related ego-defense mechanism.

With some people, the self-delusion is so extreme that they can lie, believing at a conscious level that they're telling the truth. That's why Obama maintains with a straight face that he and his White House were not extremist when the facts plainly present otherwise.

Ryan Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after a jury found him guilty on all counts for attempting to kill President Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign season at his Florida golf course.

He was found guilty in federal court on all five counts including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate; possessing a firearm to carry out a violent crime; assaulting a federal officer; felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition; and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.

Immediately after the verdict was announced, Routh, 59, tried to stab himself himself in the neck with a pen in the court room. Court marshals tackled him and he was taken from the room in handcuffs.

The trial lasted about two weeks. Jury deliberations lasted a few hours on Tuesday.

Routh was his own attorney and delivered a brief argument in his favor. He pleaded not guilty. For his most serious charge, attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Routh, a Hawaii resident, was arrested after a Secret Service agent spotted him hiding in the shrubbery near the fifth hole of the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and, according to prosecutors, waiting for Trump to get into his line of fire.

Federal prosecutors rested their case Friday. They spent a week presenting 38 witnesses who detailed what they said was Routh's planned attack.

The trial had a number of unusual elements to it. Judge Aileen M. Cannon cut off Routh's opening statement for being irrelevant. He chose to represent himself after claiming he did not trust court-appointed federal public defenders to represent him. Routh called just three witnesses to the stand, which led the trial to be short, lasting just 12 days, for such serious charges.

Following his arrest, public records and interviews from people who knew him suggested that Routh, a former supporter of Trump, had become increasingly concerned about Russia's war in Ukraine and saw himself as an influential figure.

After the verdict was read, Routh appeared to attempt to stab himself in the neck with a pen, but was stopped by authorities from doing so, according to CNN.

JUDGE SHUTS DOWN WOULD-BE TRUMP ASSASSIN RYAN ROUTH'S RAMBLING OPENING STATEMENT

“Make no mistake: The defendant was going to kill Donald Trump,” Christopher Browne, one of the federal prosecutors, said during his closing argument. “The defendant was just one bullet away.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi in a statement said “this attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself.

“Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life. The trial was meticulously handled, and I would like to thank the Judge and Jury for their time, professionalism, and patience. This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

FBI Director Kash Patel also praised the conviction, writing, “Proud of the FBI and our partners for working together to deliver justice against Ryan Routh, the individual who attempted to assassinate President Trump. We have a lot more work to do to crack down on political violence and make sure those who engage in this heinous behavior are off the streets and behind bars.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A telecommunications network posing a threat to senior United States officials at the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week has been “dismantled,” the Secret Service announced on Tuesday.

If successful, the network of electronic devices would have disabled cellphone towers and effectively shut down the cellular network in New York City. It would also have enabled denial of services attacks and facilitated anonymous, encrypted communications between threat actors and criminal enterprises.

The Secret Service says the plot no longer represents a threat to the New York tristate area.

“The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement. “The U.S. Secret Service's protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled.”

Over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 colocated SIM servers were discovered across multiple sites within 35 miles of the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.

After photos of the MobileX SIM cards recovered during the federal investigation circulated online, the mobile service said it actively shut down suspicious activity on its network.

“Like all wireless providers, we occasionally see bad actors attempt to misuse our services. Our technology and processes are specifically designed to detect and stop any misuse in order to protect both the network and legitimate customers,” MobileX CEO and Founder Peter Adderton told the Washington Examiner. “We are fully prepared to cooperate with the authorities should they reach out.”

The federal agency moved quickly to thwart the telecommunications threat, given that President Donald Trump and other high-ranking U.S. officials are attending the global meeting.

The investigation remains ongoing, and no arrests have been made.

The Secret Service led the investigation in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations, the Justice Department, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the New York City Police Department.

In a video, Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool revealed foreign actors may have been communicating with people known to federal law enforcement based on early analysis. He declined to share further details, given the sensitivity of the investigation.

McCool said law enforcement would continue investigating whether the plot was designed to disrupt the U.N. meeting.

She seemed to return my affection but then backpedaled. Is this situationship doomed?

Dear James,

I'm a 22-year-old woman in my first-ever situationship with another woman. We started off as good friends and a few months ago admitted we had feelings for each other. She was seeing someone else casually but then had to leave town for a bit. We stayed in touch while she was away, and at one point I traveled eight hours to visit her and meet her family. During this time I fell head over heels for her, and it was clear she was also interested in me.

Once she returned, however, she revealed that she wanted to be just friends. I felt used and embarrassed. I asked her to give us a chance. At the end of that conversation, we decided to try to make it work in some capacity—the one caveat being that she wanted to see other people. (I didn't.)

Since then, we've had beautiful, romantic moments, although the relationship doesn't feel as magical as it did before. When we talked recently, she told me that she hadn't yet seen others—but because of lack of opportunity, not because she doesn't want to. Meanwhile, I find I'm not being my full self. Typically, I feel secure in relationships. But partly because I'm worried she is seeing others, I've developed an anxious attachment to her. I've been trying to rely less on her. I don't want to resent her. This is especially hard because I know what a lovely friendship we once had, and I hope to have a friendship with her if this ends. So I'm really struggling: Is it possible for this to work? Do I need to cut things off completely? Could we be friends with benefits, or should we immediately go back to being just friends?

Dear Reader,

Ah, the anxious attachment. I know all about that. Nothing makes sense, and nothing can be resolved, and nothing can move forward until you get the response you need—and you never get the response you need. So you dangle, you fizz, you drift with wet cheeks through needling clouds of anxiety. It's a completely existential situation, in my view, because you're radically in touch with (1) your own incompleteness and (2) the impossibility of ultimate security in this life.

What's to be done? The original existentialists, all those lovely, gallant, puffing-their-ciggies Parisian men and women, were very happy for everything to be a dilemma. They loved a predicament; they loved a pickle. They loved a situation that had to be lived into and lived through—because that, as torrid and confusing as it might be, is how you know you're living.

But what if you need an answer? Here, you must consult your impulses. All of the options feel terrible, but I'm pretty certain that one of them, carefully considered, will feel slightly less terrible than the others. And it might have something to do with reclaiming your autonomy, with restoring yourself to a state of, if not wholeness, then at least coherence. A state in which your entire condition of being is not oriented to this other person and what they say or don't say. Imagine what a relief that would be.

Wondering what to have for lunch,

James

Dear James,

I'm a 19-year-old waiting for life to happen to me. I've graduated from high school, and I'm in a holding pattern until my next chapter can begin. In the meantime, I've lost all of my friends because they went off to college, and now they have new friends. I have panic attacks daily because I used to be a bright student, and now I feel like everyone is ahead of me and I've been left behind. How to find hope? What should I do?

Dear Reader,

All through life we tell ourselves stories about who we are, what we're doing, and how we're feeling. The right stories give us strength; the wrong stories take that strength away. It sounds to me like you've got yourself stuck in a wrong story. You need to tell yourself a different, better story, and talk to yourself in a new way.

So you're feeling alone, for the time being. That's okay. There's great power in being alone. You can look around with clear eyes; you can make your own decisions.

Fall is coming, the most beautiful season of the year. And although you're feeling autumnally sad, you can, with just a tweak of the emotional dial, turn that feeling into autumnal joy: a sense of things passing, changing, moving, blazing up into their brightest colors.

Don't worry about being hopeful. The universe is going to keep on ticking, and it's going to keep on offering you chances to feel better, whether you're in a position to recognize these chances or not. You're young, and you're strong, and the good stuff is ahead of you. All you have to do is keep getting up in the morning.

Sending you the mega-vibe,

James

For the first time in more than 30 years, attacks by the far left outnumber those by the far right.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

No matter how hard ideologues try to exclusively blame their political foes for acts of political violence, the truth is that violent extremists today emerge from across the political spectrum. We have studied this problem and believe that our data can help illuminate an issue too often defined by partisan finger-pointing. As part of a study to be published this week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, we compiled and analyzed a data set of 750 attacks and plots in the United States from January 1, 1994, to July 4, 2025. Our research focuses only on incidents of terrorism, which we define as attacks or plots by a nonstate actor attempting to achieve a political end and exert a psychological influence on a broad population. Among other details, the data set includes the types of weapons used, the intended targets, the number of fatalities, and the ideology of the perpetrators.

We found that left-wing terrorism has increased since President Donald Trump's rise to political prominence in 2016. Indeed, 2025 marks the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing attacks outnumber those from the far right. Despite its recent increase, however, left-wing terrorism is not nearly as common today as it was in the 1960s and early '70s. Those years marked the height of groups such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, best known for kidnapping the newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. In the '80s and early '90s, left-wing terrorism declined while jihadist and right-wing terrorism rose, particularly in the forms of anti-government and white-supremacist violence.

Following that trend, according to our analysis, violence on the left accounted for four plots and attacks from 1994 to 2000, compared with 144 on the right. That difference narrowed in the following decade, but the right continued to account for significantly more attacks and killings than did the left.

Read: Strawberries in winter

The year 2016 was a turning point for left-wing terrorism, even as right-wing incidents remained much more common. Trump's political ascent and the expansion of the MAGA movement seem to have reenergized left-wing violent extremism, which accounted for 37 incidents from 2016 to 2024, most of them motivated by either anti-government or partisan sentiment. By July 4 of this year, far-left extremists had already been responsible for five terrorist attacks and plots, putting 2025 on pace to be the left's most violent year in more than three decades.

On July 4, for example, law-enforcement officials say that an assailant shot and wounded a police officer who was responding to reports of a disturbance at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Texas; meanwhile, another alleged assailant fired at ICE correctional officers. Authorities apprehended 14 suspects, who now face federal charges including attempted murder of federal officers and firearm-related offenses. Details about Kirk's alleged killer are still emerging, but preliminary evidence indicates that he had left-wing motivations, and could add to this year's tally. 

In many cases, categorizing the ideology of a perpetrator is difficult, if not impossible. Some extremists pick from a “salad bar of ideologies,” as the former FBI Director Christopher Wray once said, many of which don't fit the traditional right-left dichotomy. In other instances, such as the 2011 shooting of Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords, a perpetrator's beliefs are so muddled that even calling them “political” exaggerates their coherence—despite the fact that the target is a political figure.

A major shift in politics, however, can cause the losing side to become more combative. Just as Trump's election led to a rise in left-wing violence, President Barack Obama's election corresponded with a surge of violence from the right. From 2009 to 2016, right-wing extremists were responsible for 106 terrorist attacks and plots, nearly double the 58 right-wing incidents that occurred in the eight years prior. These tend to be more lethal than left-wing attacks, which generally target specific individuals, such as the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year or the assassination attempt on Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course. Right-wing extremists, by contrast, are more likely to target whole groups. In the past decade in the United States, 36 left-wing attacks have killed 13 people, whereas 152 right-wing attacks have killed 112.

The Biden administration took important steps to counter the rise of far-right extremism. After January 6, 2021, the U.S. government brought charges against more than 1,000 people, disrupting violent right-wing networks such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. The administration also made right-wing groups a counterterrorism priority, taking measures to reduce the presence of extremists in the military. The far-right-terrorist death toll fell under Biden, compared with the previous four years, but lethal attacks persisted.

This year, however, violence on the right has plummeted. Only one right-wing-terrorist incident occurred in the first six months of 2025: the June assassination of the Minnesota state legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband. This extraordinary drop-off is too recent to allow for any definitive explanations—and the number of terror incidents often fluctuates over short periods—but Trump's reelection could be a key factor. His victory deflated election conspiracies that had once motivated many extremists. Since then, Trump has taken a maximal approach on some of the far-right's highest-priority issues, particularly immigration. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader and a convicted seditionist whom Trump pardoned, recently summed up the president's potential psychological effect on the violent far right: “We won. We've got what we wanted.”

Under Trump, right-wing extremists may feel less need to mobilize, because they sense that their interests are already being taken care of. But Kirk's death could change this calculus. Conservatives, including members of Congress and online influencers, have used the assassination to support the contention that the left is engaged in “war.” Trump himself has claimed that a network of political organizations fund and support violence, and must be neutralized. This sort of rhetoric could encourage right-wing vigilantism or presage a government crackdown on left-leaning organizations—which in turn could inflame left-wing extremism and pose a grave threat to free speech.

Jonathan Chait: Stephen Miller's hypocrisy is right there in his speech

Exaggerated rhetoric across party lines helps explain why both Republicans and Democrats believe that more than 40 percent of the other side supports murder if it serves their political interests. In reality, less than 4 percent of Americans support partisan violence such as assault or arson, let alone murder. Even that number is too high, of course, but it would surely drop if partisans stopped misconstruing their opponents.

Actually stanching political violence will require America's leaders to commit to fighting all forms of extremism, not just those associated with their opponents. The Trump administration has prioritized combatting the rise of left-wing terrorism but not right-wing terrorism, which remains a concern despite its decline this year. Developing the programs and expertise to suppress different forms of terrorism takes years, and ignoring a long-term threat to go after a more immediate one could be deadly over time.

Condemning all political violence, especially when it emanates from one's own side or targets one's opponents, is also an important means of breaking the cycle of distrust. Many prominent Democrats have done this since Kirk's shooting. So did many Republicans after the assassination of Hortman and the attack on Paul Pelosi in 2022. Still, both sides need to improve, as evidenced by some left-wing celebrations of Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of Thompson, the health-care executive, and the failure of some conservative leaders to expressly condemn white supremacists, Hortman's assassin, and other violent extremists.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has served as a model in unequivocally denouncing extremists, which makes them outcasts instead of heroes. Cox described Kirk's killing as “an attack on all of us.” And he offered a simple exhortation that would benefit both sides, particularly in moments like these, when violence can spiral: “Disagree better.”

In the White House adviser's view, violent rhetoric is allowed only when he and Trump are the ones spewing it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Yesterday, Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that served as a battle cry for the Trump administration's state-sponsored war on his perceived foes—a war for which Miller is the primary strategist. The speech was a jarring piece of rhetoric. It is a perfect encapsulation of the ethos of Trumpism, boiling away the president's idiosyncratic habits of mixing insult comedy and weird digressions into his rhetoric and leaving, in Miller's tongue, the residue of pure ideology and will to power.

Miller's theme was that President Donald Trump's side embodies pure good, his opponents pure evil, and the former is destined to utterly destroy the latter. Republicans have never stopped complaining that Hillary Clinton once described a portion of Trump's base as “a basket of deplorables.” Yet over the weekend the president's most powerful adviser depicted half the country as worthless, irredeemably wicked, and fated for destruction.

“We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion,” he thundered. “Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry.”

I feel less confident than Miller does that future historians will laud Trump's distinct additions of legalized bribery, casino-style decor, and Ultimate Fighting Championship matches on the White House lawn as cultural and philosophical advances. Yet Miller confidently conscripted the pillars of Western civilization into his domestic political war.

Miller's peroration managed the difficult combination of being redundant and short. In place of uplift, he brought bludgeoning repetition. “The light will defeat the dark. We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil,” he said at one point. “We will defeat the forces of darkness and evil. And we will stand every day for what is true, what is beautiful, what is good.” he proclaimed shortly thereafter.

Miller directed much of his speech to the enemy camp. “And to those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hatred against us,” he said, “what do you have? You have nothing. You are nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy. You are envy. You are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing. You can produce nothing. You can create nothing.” In case any member of the audience had dozed off, which seems unlikely given the volume at which he spoke, Miller reiterated the point a few sentences later: “And what will you leave behind? Nothing. Nothing. To our enemies, you have nothing to give. You have nothing to offer. You have nothing to share but bitterness.”

Having nothing to share but bitterness is a strange insult for Stephen Miller, of all people, to hurl. But part of the Miller worldview is an almost proud insistence on holding his enemies to standards he refuses to abide by. The Trump camp has insisted that the fault for last year's attempts on Trump's life lies with anybody who has attacked him as dangerous or authoritarian. Yet Trump himself attacks his enemies in such terms routinely, and Miller seems to be attempting to exceed his boss's Manichaean style by depicting their opponents as the literal embodiment of malevolence.

In some ways, Miller's speech was the distilled antithesis of Barack Obama's rhetorical style. Obama gained fame with a stirring 2004 speech arguing that America's cultural divisions were surmountable—that red America and blue America had more in common than the pundits appreciated. Miller's view, like that of his boss, is that America is even more divided than we think, and the only resolution to this state of affairs is for one side to subjugate the other.

Ten years ago, a white supremacist gunned down nine worshippers at one of the oldest Black churches in the South, including Clementa Pinckney, a pastor and member of the South Carolina state Senate. The horrific event provides a striking contrast to the aftermath of Kirk's murder. In his eulogy, Obama did not scour the internet for conservatives making insensitive comments about the event—even though many such cases could be found, including on Fox News—let alone use the tragedy as a pretext to delegitimize the opposition.

Obama described the murderer in the singular and spoke of reconciliation. “The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court—in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness,” Obama said. “He couldn't imagine that.” Miller's speech used the third person plural to describe Kirk's assassination: “They cannot imagine what they have awakened. They cannot conceive of the army that they have arisen in all of us because we stand for what is good, what is virtuous, what is noble.”

Miller made no effort to distinguish the vaguely defined multitudes that he implicates in Kirk's murder from Trump's political opponents or the Democratic Party—which, at other times, he has said is “not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization.”

Miller taunted his opponents, “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened.” To the contrary, his targets seem very aware of the administration's instinct to take revenge. But given Miller's past statements, I question the premise that Kirk's murder “awakened” Miller's desire to crush the right's enemies. It seems to have merely provided a convenient pretext.

Three decades ago, 2 Live Crew fought a First Amendment battle against the government—and won.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Luther Campbell, the front man for one of the most controversial rap groups in history, has advice for Jimmy Kimmel and for any media executives trying to decide how to respond to the Trump administration's attempts to censor disfavored speech: You've got to fight. He would know. When the government came after him and his music, he fought, and he won, creating a legal precedent that still protects artists and entertainers who offend the sensibilities of those in power.

In 1989, Campbell's Miami-based group, 2 Live Crew, released their album As Nasty as They Wanna Be, which included the smash hit “Me So Horny.” The album went platinum, but its sexually graphic lyrics drew widespread condemnation from conservative politicians and activists on the Christian right. Florida Governor Bob Martinez asked the state prosecutor to bring obscenity and racketeering charges against 2 Live Crew, and the Broward County sheriff warned music retailers that they could go to jail for selling it. 2 Live Crew sued, but a federal judge ruled that the album was obscene. A record-store owner was arrested for selling the album in defiance of the judge's ruling; Campbell himself was arrested for performing songs from the album at a Florida nightclub.

“I had Governor Martinez here in Florida going after me,” Campbell, who at the time was better known by the stage name Luke Skyywalker, told me. “I had the sheriffs going after me, pretty much every Republican municipality around the country.” Campbell found himself defending not just his own interests, but a larger principle. “I was fighting to protect free speech,” he said. “It became that fight, and I'm pretty sure that right now, Jimmy Kimmel is probably feeling something similar to it.”

Of course, Campbell's story and Kimmel's differ in some important ways. Campbell was targeted at a moment when the supposed menace of rap music was a major topic in the culture wars. (Around the same time, Vice President Dan Quayle also pressured Time Warner to pull Tupac Shakur's album 2Pacalypse Now because a man who killed a Texas state trooper had been listening to the album when he was stopped by the officer.) Campbell felt that he had to resist efforts to demonize certain elements of Black culture. “I was fighting it from the standpoint of a young Black man taught by my dad and my uncle how history repeats itself on a consistent basis,” Campbell said.

Campbell and 2 Live Crew appealed the obscenity ruling. The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit sided with them, ruling that their music wasn't legally obscene under First Amendment precedent. “We reject the argument that simply by listening to this musical work, the judge could determine that it had no serious artistic value,” the court wrote.

Adam Serwer: The Constitution protects Jimmy Kimmel's mistake

The Kimmel situation is not about obscenity per se, but about what views can and cannot be expressed on television—and who gets to decide. Several days after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, Kimmel commented on his show that “the MAGA gang” had been “desperately trying” to portray the accused killer “as anything other than one of them.” Conservative activists objected. Brendan Carr, the Federal Communications Commission chairman, publicly criticized Kimmel's remarks as “truly sick” and threatened to go after the networks that aired his program. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” he said in a podcast appearance. “These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

The companies heard the message. Hours later, Nexstar, which operates 32 ABC affiliate stations, announced that it would be pulling the show indefinitely, and ABC swiftly followed suit. (Perhaps relatedly, Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval to acquire Tegna, another station group, for $6.2 billion.) Sinclair, which owns 38 ABC affiliates, also took Kimmel off the air and issued a statement demanding that Kimmel apologize and make a sizable donation to the Kirk family and to Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA.

Kimmel shouldn't have implied that Kirk's killer is a Donald Trump–supporting Republican. Nor should mistakes like that—or even worse ones—incur the selective wrath of government. Kimmel's comments were clearly exploited as a pretext to take down someone whom the president had long considered an enemy. “The word is, and it's a strong word at that, Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes,” Trump posted after CBS declined to renew Stephen Colbert's late-night show earlier this year. “It's really good to see them go, and I hope I played a major part in it!” Similarly, he posted last week that he now wants NBC to get rid of its late-night hosts, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon. Carr has warned, “We're not done yet.”

Yesterday, however, the story took a surprising turn. After facing substantial backlash over its decision to suspend Kimmel, ABC announced that his show would return tonight (although Sinclair said it would continue to preempt Kimmel). Whether that reversal will dull the administration's appetite for censorship or only inflame it further remains to be seen. (At an event earlier in the day, Carr seemed to be attempting to walk back his earlier comments, claiming that “the easy way or the hard way” was not intended as a threat.)

Given the unusual, high-stakes circumstances, one wonders what to expect from Kimmel once he returns. According to Campbell, Kimmel has only one option. “It's like a boxing match,” he told me. “They threw the first punch, so now you've got to throw another punch. Because if you lay down, then they're going to use this same thing against every other person on TV. This is now the precedent that they've set. He has to fight this to protect our free speech.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Sure, Let's Try Bribes!","https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2025/09/tom-homan-bribe-cash/684322/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:34:00 GMT","

If taxpayers want to influence policy, maybe this is our only option.

If we're going through the federal budget in search of areas to cut, I would maybe cut the budget line where we pay Tom Homan $50,000 in cash, consequence-free, to demonstrate that he is susceptible to bribes. I would cut that before the pediatric-cancer research, personally.

Just to explain what happened: Last year Tom Homan, the border czar, was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash in a bag (specifically, a bag from CAVA, the Mediterranean fast-casual chain) from undercover FBI agents posing as government contractors in a sting operation, in which Homan intimated that he would now try to steer DHS contracts their way. And then they … let him hang onto the cash, to see what he would do with it. Maybe nothing! Maybe report it to the IRS in a really scrupulous way!

When the Trump administration took over, it dropped the case. FBI Director Kash Patel even said that there was “no evidence of wrongdoing.” Homan also denies doing anything wrong. Remember, a wad of money in a weird bag intended for food only looks like a bribe, as a City Hall adviser recently explained. In its proper cultural context, handing someone $50,000 in a CAVA bag is actually a way of saying, “You seem like a man of unimpeachable integrity, and I respect you so much”—and it would be rude to refuse it.

That's right! Just because someone accepts a bag of cash to steer contracts a certain way doesn't mean he has done anything wrong. Donald Trump didn't get where he is today by refusing to take money from people. What, you're supposed to discriminate against money just because it's in cash in a CAVA bag, rather than in the form of someone buying your special novelty crypto coin?

Look, Trump officials are being offered all kinds of money from all kinds of sources. Businessmen go to dinner with the president, and then charges against them are dropped. Corporations settle the frivolous lawsuits being brought against them by the president, and then their mergers go through. Clearly, money is a language to which the president and his cronies respond. (It's always a good sign when the people around your president can reasonably be described as “cronies.”) Well, if we as taxpayers want to influence policy, maybe we should take a page from this same book.

We deserve a piece of the action! The trouble is that it is hard, as individuals, to come up with enough money to swing policy in our preferred direction. What am I going to do, pointedly let a single egg slip out of my purse as the president walks by? (“There's more where that came from, but I'll need you to get rid of those tariffs for me first!”) But if we work together, we, as a nation, can probably successfully do a single bribe. Or even multiple bribes! Let's build on the FBI's idea. Let's use our tax dollars to try to bribe Trump-administration officials to act in the national interest!

When RFK Jr. says that he is replacing everyone on the committee that makes vaccine recommendations with a series of alchemists and mountebanks, an FBI agent (acting on our behalf) can say, “But wait! Look what just fell out of my bag! Why yes, it's a squirrel carcass! But what's that inside it? Yes, maggots, but also … $50,000 in unmarked bills! Now whom do you want to put on the vaccine committee?” “Hey, Tom Homan, how many bags of CAVA cash do you need to treat other people accused of crimes—and those not even accused of crimes—as human beings instead of dragging them off to a gulag?”

This new system of taxpayer-funded bribes will take a lot of money just to revert things to the status quo, but I am willing to pay. Much better than the current approach, where we silently pay for tank parades, the Army Corps of Engineers adjusting J. D. Vance's vacation water levels, and the refurbishing of the president's gift plane—but get nothing in return, except a worse-looking White House and decreased national prestige.

No, I am on board with the concept. My concern is the number: $50,000 in a CAVA bag? That's chicken feed. I just don't think we, the American people, are going to be able to compete with bribes from the private sector.

Apps are promising to ease the job of child-rearing—but they're missing something crucial.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A few weeks before my daughter's fourth birthday, I stumbled across an AI party planner called CelebrateAlly. “Looking to plan a themed party, a surprise bash, or just a relaxed get-together?” read a banner on its website, which promised that the app would take care of “all the details—themes, activities, and decorations.” It also offered to write birthday cards, “capturing your heartfelt sentiments beautifully!”

The offer had a certain appeal. I was overwhelmed, entering the phase of planning where I actually had to execute on my daughter's vision for her bash. We'd been talking about the party for months, and her requests were specific yet constantly changing. (She wanted a unicorn cake—no, a unicorn piñata; to invite only her cousins—then a few of her friends too, and then all of the kids on our block.) But I was genuinely curious to hear them. Each question I asked her was a way to draw closer to her: I learned about who she is right now while, I hope, showing her that I really want to know. After all those conversations, using AI would have felt like a betrayal.

So I didn't—but I've found it impossible to avoid the ads for AI tools cluttering my social-media feeds. A few months ago, Welch's Fruit Snacks launched a “Lunchbox Notes Translator” on their website, which promised to transform “candid parental sentiments into heartfelt messages”—for example, turning “You make me tired” into “I love how independent you can be!” The forthcoming app Trove offers “AI-guided storytelling”; another app, Kidli, says that it will use AI to “help you raise happy, healthy, and smart kids” (though exactly how is unclear). Then there's Snorble, a $300 AI robot designed to help kids sleep better. In its promotional video, when a child wakes in the night with a bad dream, Snorble smiles and says, “It's okay, I'm here with you,” presumably soothing the child back to sleep, no human interaction necessary. Milo, an AI tool that claims to help with the organizational tasks of running a family, summed up the mindset espoused by many of these apps: “Don't ask Mom, ask Milo.”

Some of these tools are yet to be fully funded or launched. The Lunchbox Notes Translator, which was much maligned on social media, is now on a “snack break.” But others are already quite popular. Last year the parenting influencer Becky Kennedy (a.k.a. “Dr. Becky”) released an app that, among other things, lets parents bring dilemmas to an AI chatbot named GiGi. It now has more than 90,000 paying members, one spokesperson told me, and may be a sign of AI's coming influence on child-rearing.

For parents, 41 percent of whom are often “so stressed they cannot function,” according to an advisory issued last year by then–Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, any offer of help may be alluring. With these apps promising to enable people to parent better—responding to messages from school, laying out perfectly Tetris-ed play-date calendars, preparing carefully calibrated scripts to respond whenever a child has a tantrum—it's perhaps no wonder some are taking off.

Yet when parents outsource the work of raising their kids to a bot, both adults and children are bound to miss out. In my case, with CelebrateAlly, the app might have made for a more picture-perfect bash—but the party wasn't the point. What my daughter needed from me, and what the time we spent planning together gave her that an AI never could, was my attention and care. Apps may promise to optimize parenting, but ultimately, they threaten to sap its intimacy and humanness.

Take the apps that create scripts for difficult conversations with kids. The AI might seem omniscient, but parents know much more about their children than any large language model ever could. “I know that if I give my kid a hug, in this way or at this moment, they're going to lean into me and be all cuddly,” Rebecca Winthrop, a senior fellow and the director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, told me. Winthrop called information like that “tacit knowledge”—the small, intangible things about a child that only another human can pick up on. Decisions based on this type of knowledge—not those made by a chatbot—are what help make a child feel truly cared for.

As I read about the Lunchbox Note Translator, for instance, it occurred to me that when I pack my 7-year-old son's lunch, the love letter I include is a Starburst. I take extra care to make sure that I put in his favorite color (red) on big days. That chewy little square is just one way I show him that I know him as only I can.

My gesture may seem small—but, contrary to what some AI tools may seem to imply, in most cases, small is plenty. And that points to another problem with AI's promises of optimized parenting: Rather than dismantling families' to-do lists, the apps tend to encourage a do-it-all model of parenthood (and of childhood) that constantly demands more from parents. Milo, for example, promises to help filter through “school apps, sports schedules, and endless group texts” to make a to-do list. But after the app arranges the list, parents are still responsible for completing it. If my family's daily activities ever balloon to the point of needing digital project management, I'd rather reevaluate our priorities than ask AI to help us juggle more. Instead of downloading yet another app, other parents, too, might be better served by trusting their own instincts and doing less for their kids: scaling down the birthday party, skipping the lunch-box note entirely, saying no to the third (or fourth, or fifth) after-school activity.

Of course, many parents still want and need help. And AI may be useful for some household tasks. But parents risk isolating themselves if they turn to AI too frequently, rather than to friends and family. Kennedy told me that the idea for her app's bot came out of conversations with followers who desperately wished they could text her during their tougher parenting moments. She said that she would never want to replace mom-to-mom interactions. But I struggle to imagine that paying for Kennedy's app wouldn't stop some moms from texting their friends: Why risk exposure and vulnerability with a fellow parent when they can ask an AI bot that has been carefully trained to speak only words of encouragement?

Read: AI will never be your kid's friend

If they hold off on reaching out to friends and family when the going gets hard, though, parents may lose out on more than just in-the-moment guidance. Asking for help “is often the way we build community,” Winthrop told me. The friends a parent calls when they run into a tricky situation may become part of their bigger support system—a network that parents need. As Winthrop put it: “A chatbot's not going to feed your cat or take your kid to school when you have a work call.”

A chatbot is also not going to show up to your child's birthday. As is often the case with celebrations for little kids, the guest list for my daughter's party included as many grown-ups as children. There was the school mom who knows how passionate my daughter is about Frozen and suggested hiring the same Elsa actor who had been a hit at her own daughter's party. There was the mom next door who knew just where I could order the rainbow-shaped cake my daughter wished for. We didn't have balloon arches, the cake came out a bit funky, and the Elsa experience was unbelievably awkward for the adults (though the preschoolers loved it). Still, I am so glad we all planned it—me, my daughter, and our community—slowly, imperfectly together.

Trump's H-1B plan is a bad solution to a real problem.

Donald Trump just transformed America's high-skill immigration system.

In a proclamation Friday, the president imposed a $100,000 fee on all new applications for H-1B visas (although the administration would retain the right to offer companies exemptions at will).

Such visas have long been controversial. The H-1B program is meant to help American employers hire foreign workers with rare intellectual abilities. It aims to ensure that the US “knowledge economy” is not undermined by shortfalls of highly skilled labor.

Yet some companies have used the program to essentially replace US workers with immigrants — less because the latter boast exceptional skills than because they have lower wage expectations.

Trump's $100,000 fee is ostensibly meant to fix this problem. In theory, employers won't pay that hefty charge to hire a garden-variety foreign coder over an American one. Rather, a company would only be willing to foot that bill for extraordinary foreign talent.

If the president's policy addresses legitimate complaints with the H-1B system, however, it does so in a needlessly costly manner. Trump's exorbitant fee would undermine American scientific research, technological progress, and economic growth. And this would translate into lower wages for American workers in the long term.

The problems with H-1B visas mostly stem from how they're allocated.

Demand for such visas far outstrips their supply: In 2023, 446,000 people sought an H-1B visa, but America only provides 85,000 of them each year (20,000 of which are reserved for workers who have attained a master's degree or higher from a US institution of higher education).

Whether a given worker secures an H-1B visa is left largely to chance. Instead of prioritizing the most skilled applicants — or those pursuing the highest-paid jobs — the government selects them at random through a lottery.

This process actually favors low-wage employers seeking to hire workers with middling abilities. If you're an AI firm that's looking to hire one particular machine learning engineer who holds superlative skills, you will probably lose the H-1B lottery. After all, any individual applicant has a low chance of getting selected.

On the other hand, if you're an outsourcing company that's looking to hire lots of foreign workers with basic IT skills, your odds of winning the lottery are quite good. Such companies don't need any specific candidate, only a large number of interchangeable laborers. So, they can sponsor many more workers than they actually need and then take whichever ones happen to make it through the filter. If too many of their workers get selected, they can simply decline to complete all of their applications. By flooding the lottery in this way, IT staffing and outsourcing firms secured 40 percent of all H-1B visas in 2023, according to a Bloomberg investigation.

This is suboptimal for the American economic dynamism. Helping cutting-edge tech firms access top talent is better for innovation than helping outsourcing companies hire mediocre IT support specialists. And doing the latter also entails higher tradeoffs for native-born workers, since outsourcing firms subvert the H-1B program's labor protections.

To secure an H-1B visa, companies must pledge that they will pay their applicant at least as much as they currently pay similar American employees. A company, therefore, cannot lay off its existing IT workforce and then hire lower-wage H-1B workers in their place.

Yet a firm can eliminate its IT department — and then delegate those functions to an outsourcing company, which is largely staffed by H-1B workers. In this way, companies can use the H-1B program to effectively replace domestic workers. And some have in fact done this.

Trump's $100,000 application fee constitutes one answer to the H-1B program's allocation problem. Outsourcing companies aren't going to shell out that kind of money for entry-level IT specialists.

By contrast, a well-capitalized firm seeking a specific, exceptionally talented foreign worker may consider $100,000 to be a “rounding error” (as one tech CEO called it Sunday).

The president's policy is therefore likely to increase the proportion of H-1B visas going to immigrants with genuinely rare skills,

Nevertheless, Trump's fee entails far greater costs than benefits.

On the latter front, the White House's policy won't necessarily safeguard the jobs and wages of native-born IT specialists. Companies can often replace their American tech support staff with remote workers abroad. And as the Economist notes, top outsourcing companies responded to the last crackdown on their H-1B access by shifting their hiring towards India. Meanwhile, AI is enabling the rapid automation of many IT functions.

If Trump's policy would do relatively little to insulate American IT workers from competition, it would do a great deal to undermine economic growth.

This is because the president's fee wouldn't merely change the distribution of H-1B visas, but dramatically reduce their total supply.

For one thing, it's not clear that private sector employers would be willing to sponsor 85,000 visas a year, at the price of $100,000 per application.

More critically, the statutory cap on H-1B visas does not apply to many universities and nonprofits. If forced to pay $100,000 per worker, however, such research institutions would likely need to turn away many exceptional foreign scholars. Scientific research often generates large economic and social benefits in the long term, but scant profits in the short run. Thus, in many cases, universities will not be able to finance guest workers' applications, even if their labor is highly valuable to the United States.

At the very least, many schools and smaller American companies would struggle to offer foreign workers competitive wages, if they were forced to eat $100,000 on each hire: A European university that has a $350,000 budget for a research position could actually offer a higher salary than an American university with a $400,000 for an analogous position, because the latter school would need to spend $100,000 just to get its applicant into the country.

American science is already reeling from the Trump administration's cuts to NIH grants and revocation of student visas. The president's H-1B policy threatens to further undermine the competitiveness of US research institutions and chase more academic talent abroad.

To some on the populist right, sustaining American universities' access to international scholars may seem like an elitist concern. From this perspective, the priority must be improving American workers' wages and job opportunities. If US schools can't find enough native-born scientists to staff their labs, then they should do a better job of educating their American students.

But this perspective grossly underestimates the economic benefits of immigration in general, and high-skill migration in particular.

Even in its current, dysfunctional form, the H-1B visa program appears to boost wages and employment opportunities for American workers. This is true for at least three reasons:

There's reason to think this same pattern holds at the national level — that companies are more likely to invest in countries that have lots of highly skilled labor. Researchers have found that when multinational firms lose access to H-1B workers, they tend to replace them by increasing hiring abroad. This effectively transfers dollars out of the US economy and into foreign ones.

For these reasons, any reform of the H-1B system that reduces high-skill immigration in the US will hurt American workers in the aggregate.

The H-1B visa program is falling short of its official objectives: It leaves many cutting-edge firms unable to hire top foreign talent, and undermines the bargaining power of some native-born workers.

But there are better ways to address these issues than Trump's $100,000 fee. For example, the government could distribute visas on the basis of compensation rather than a lottery: Rather than distributing 85,000 slots at random each year, it could award them to the 85,000 applicants offered the highest-paying jobs.

But the president's approach would reduce America's dynamism and living standards — while tilting the economic playing field towards the administration's cronies (who are liable to have an easier time securing fee exemptions). In this way, it is of a piece with Trump's broader agenda.

Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel, and the end of American democracy.

After the Trump administration pressured late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air last week, my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote about what it tells us about President Donald Trump's roadmap to ending American democracy. I spoke with him about some of his big takeaways, including what we can do to prevent that kind of democratic erosion, for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can also sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

It was an eventful week. What changed in your understanding of the Trump administration and democracy?

My view for most of the second Trump administration has been that they are pursuing a policy agenda that threatens American democracy, but that they were doing so poorly and haphazardly (and thus were likely to ultimately fail).

But recently, and especially since Charlie Kirk's death, they seem to have gotten a lot more serious about consolidating power. By that, I meant that the White House has taken credible steps toward policies that would materially stack the deck in favor of the Republican Party.

A few examples include striking a deal to spin off TikTok USA and put it in the hands of MAGA-friendly ownership; threatening to go after leading liberal NGOs using RICO, an anti-racketeering law designed for mob prosecutions; and weaponizing a little-used FCC rule to threaten station licenses if they air Jimmy Kimmel, leading to his suspension.

No single one of those policies, on its own, destroys democracy. But they point to a generalized pattern: one in which policy is bent toward crushing the financial and civil society support base that allows for meaningful democratic politics.

You write that you're afraid of the US sliding toward “competitive authoritarianism.” What is that?

Authoritarian governments come in lots of different styles. This one doesn't involve the outright criminalization of the opposition, formal martial law, or even Russian-style fake elections. Instead, it depends on perverting the law, modifying and twisting it with the intent of incrementally undermining the opposition's ability to compete fairly in elections.

Competitive authoritarian regimes target opposition parties through burdensome tax audits, dubious criminal investigations, and uneven application of campaign finance regulations. They also focus on attacking the civil foundations of the opposition — meaning attacking the donors who might fund them, the activist groups who might stand up for their rights, and the free media they depend on to get their message out.

Silence or co-opt enough of these voices, and the ruling party doesn't actually have to outlaw political opposition or stuff ballot boxes. The opposition will simply be weak enough that letting them compete poses little threat.

In the US, this would look like a country where corporations depend on the goodwill of the White House to remain profitable, leading the wealthy to cease meaningful support for Democrats. The press would be owned — in large part, though not entirely — by the regime's favored and trusted oligarchs. And what remains of the independent media and liberal activist class would be subject to relentless state harassment, draining the resources they would need to fight back on an increasingly uneven playing field.

How far are we down that road? 

There are roughly four areas you should be watching for progress.

First, Trump using hiring and firing powers to purge career civil servants from key agencies, like the Justice Department, and erode the traditional barriers preventing undue political influence on law enforcement and regulatory decisions.

Second, Trump using the power of these newly Trumpified agencies to target dissent in civil society — a broadening of the assaults on Ivy League universities.

Third, Trump bullying and bribing large corporations until significant economic power is concentrated in the hands of regime allies dependent on the president's goodwill for their survival

And fourth, Trump turning this accumulated power against the political opposition — turning elections into facially free contests where, in fact, Democrats face enormously unfair hurdles (and would likely be unable to govern even if they managed to succeed).

Of these four, I think there has only been significant progress in the first. He has extensive control over the executive branch, thanks in part to the willingness of key officials like Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Andrew Ferguson, and Brendan Carr to play ball. But American civil society remains vibrant, large corporations and the media mostly independent, and the opposition still relatively free to act.

But what's happened recently looks a lot like Trump offensives in the other areas, especially the second and third. This is a serious emergency.

What can we do to prevent that future? 

Actually, a lot!

The slide toward competitive authoritarianism in America depends, crucially, on acquiescence — on the idea that people are unwilling to bear the costs of standing up to each individual attack on liberty before they can combine into true authoritarian control over society.

Even the most pessimistic assessments would say we're not there yet: that Trump can't pull something like what he did with Kimmel and expect to avoid mass pushback. Trump is immensely unpopular, and Republicans are likely to lose at least one house of Congress in the midterms, which could significantly limit his ability to silence other prominent voices.

Trump's approach also depends on a tactic that political scientists call “salami slicing”: cutting off one little bit of democracy at a time by targeting one specific person or group, thus avoiding a sense that the collective needs to stand up for shared rights. That's why we've seen not an attempt to criminalize dissent per se, but a series of discrete efforts like the Kimmel threats and the New York Times lawsuit.

Defiance, collective defiance, can make a big difference. The more that people across sectors take public and coordinated action — Congress, the media, the business world, even ordinary civil society — the more they can puncture Trump's sense of inevitability, by fighting against and delaying his power grabs until 2027, when Democrats could hold real power to stop and hold him accountable for them.

This means, specifically, that we need more senators talking about democracy the way Chris Murphy does. It means more business organizations refusing to implement Trump's directives and working with pro-democracy organizations like Leadership Now to demand nonpartisan regulatory policy. It means donors making a show of putting more money, not less, toward anti-Trump causes in general and toward the legal funds of targeted institutions in particular. It means media refusing to bend to Trump and providing relentless coverage of situations like Kimmel's.

And it means individual citizens attending protests and volunteering with the organizations under threat, as well as with political campaigns that could change things in 2026.

The internet loves to point and laugh at names like Oaklynn and Haleigh. There's real anxieteigh behind it. 

Before K-Anna Stephens posted her daughter's name to the Facebook group “that name is a tragedeigh,” she knew that the response wasn't going to be kind. Internet strangers aren't usually known for being nice, and the more than 154,000 group members were gathered specifically to mock and judge “tragic names.”

Stephens herself knows how hard it is to have a distinctive name. Named after a grandmother and distant relative (Kay + Anna), she's heard all kinds of pronunciations and remarks, and dealt with the never-ending headache of trying to submit the dash in “K-Anna” on government websites and filing systems. Still, she says, at almost 30 years old, she's become desensitized to it.

Still, even K-Anna Stephens, with her three decades of unique name experience, didn't know just how mean the internet could get when it came to her daughter's name: Sadilynn.

“It's Say-di-lynne,” Stephens tells Vox of the pronunciation. “After the first 10 or 20 comments, I turned the comments off and tried to forget about the post.”

Sadilynn, Stephens says, came about because she liked the name “Sadie” pronounced like Sadie Hawkins. A relative told her he had a dog named Sadie, which prompted her to add -lynn, combining her first choice with another name she liked. In 2016, when Sadilynn was born, Stephens says she noticed parents using -eigh and -lynn sounds in their children's names and followed the trend.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

When she submitted Sadilynn to the Facebook group — and it's worth noting, there's a similar congregation on Reddit called r/Tragedeigh, with 764,000 weekly users — she was looking for constructive criticism. What she got was a deluge of insults about her education, her sanity, her finances, her employment status, and her lack of compassion for her daughter.

“How would I put that into words? Like, Oh, my God, she's one of those people. Was she on drugs during pregnancy? What was going through her head?” Stephens tells me. “Those comments, they're quite literally what's in the back of my head.”

Alternatively spelled names are a peculiar trend — inherently hard to track, since uniqueness is a key factor. But they're undoubtedly inspiring both copycats and vitriol, often rising into the public consciousness through mockery. What's behind the drive to create these one-in-a-billion names? Why do they garner so much abuse, so much that they can sustain multiple internet forums with six-figure memberships? What do they mean for the children who bear them, and why do they make unrelated adult strangers so, so, so very upset?

As with so many things we dislike, our ire says a lot more about us than it does about any child named Sadilynn.

According to baby name experts and linguists, the insertion of Ys or addition of features like a -lynne or -eigh to a more common, already-existing name are part of a trend known as “alternatively spelled” or “uniquely spelled” names, more colloquially and less professionally referred to as “Utah Mom” names.

“Utah is sort of an early warning system for things that are going to become popular,” Cleveland Evans, a professor and former president of the American Name Society, told NPR earlier this year when speaking about the rise of Oaklynne, Oaklee, Oakleigh, and its variants. Perhaps the most internet famous example of Utah Mom naming conventions is “Chalkboard Mom” aka Beehive State resident McKinli Hatch, who went viral standing beside a list of names like “Mckarty” and “Nayvie.” (She chose “Lakynn.”)

But the naming phenomenon is not exactly exclusive to or even born from Utahns.

In July, the Toronto Blue Jays honored pitcher Jeff Hoffman, who was born in New York, with a bobblehead giveaway. Accompanying Hoffman for the first pitch that night were his sons Tytan and Houstyn and his daughters Jetsyn and Lennyn.

“Technically, it's not a new concept,” says Colleen Slagen, a baby name consultant, of the desire to purposely switch up conventional the spelling of a name and create a new one in the process. Slagen says that riffing on names goes back to the Puritans, the first Americans. The tradition goes back even further to William Shakespeare who Slagen says invented the name Jessica, the 775th most-popular girls' name in 2025 as of this writing, according to Babycenter. Some scholars speculate that Shakespeare anglicized the name from the original Hebrew name “Jesca.”

Perhaps the way we think of Oakleigh now is how Shakespeare's peers thought of Jessica back in 1598. Maybe we'd think of Oakleighs differently if playwrights, poets, and pilgrims were the people trial-ballooning these monikers, instead of people we see on Instagram.

“These days, this style — intentionally changing the traditional spelling of a name — is getting more popularized through social media and influencers,” Slagen says. Familiarity breeds likeness. For those who enjoy an influencers' aesthetics and see their lives as aspirational, a baby name is just one more facet of their lives to admire and perhaps copy.

Most of the names people are selecting to jazz up already exist, and spelling them differently gives them enough of a twist without going too far. “This is a way to choose a name that looks unique, but doesn't sound unique — like spelling the name Peyton Paytyn,” Slagen says.

The motivation to spell a name differently may go beyond the craving for quirkiness. Taylor Humphrey, a baby name consultant and expert in the immense world of things parents call their children, explains that certain sounds and features in names can connote things like femininity and masculinity. Changing the spelling of a traditional boy's name and implementing a feminine feature can upend the binary.

The switch can offer “daughters the strength of masculine name, while simultaneously feminizing the name so as to make it clear it was a girl's name,” Humphrey tells Vox. She explained that in the 1930s, increasingly popular names like Dolores, Frances, Florence, Beatrice, Gladys had the masculine “s” sound that appeared in historical names found in ancient Rome (e.g., Aurelius).

Humphrey expanded on this theory, noting that more popular masculine names today end with a “n” sound (e.g., Benjamin, Tristan, Hudson). If parents want a name that has that girly twist on a traditional boy name, it would mean finding a way to incorporate that “n” sound.

“I think girl moms are once again opting for that masculine strength, and included the ‘n' ending on names that may have otherwise ended in a or y.” Emily, then, becomes Emmersyn; Oakley, Oaklyn; and Trista, Tristan, or Tristyn.

Whether it's Sadilynn or Oaklee or Houstyn, these names strike a nerve. Jokes, insults, unserious accusations of “child abuse,” concern about future bullying, and comparisons to the characters from George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones tend to follow. With some regularity, they make their way to the Tragedeigh forums of Facebook and Reddit. Why all the anger?

While these names are still too new to be studied thoroughly, the existing research on how the general public views unique names isn't too promising. It might explain, though, why people get so mad.

Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn't.

Over and over, researchers have found that people tend to judge others more favorably and as more trustworthy when they have easy-to-pronounce, familiar names (famously to the disadvantage of immigrants and people of color). It seems that Americans are more likely to trust doctors and accountants with names like Pete and Laura rather than leave their taxes and health to Houstyns and Everleighs.

People like things they know, and don't seem to trust other people's novelty.

“English doesn't always have consistent spelling rules,” Humphrey says. “When parents add -eigh or swap in a y, it can feel like breaking the social contract of ‘how names should be spelled.'”

Ashleigh Zosel-Harper has dealt with that disconnect her entire life. She says that about once a month, she'll get asked why she spells her name with an -eigh instead of Ashley. It's a question that her parents, whom she says wanted a more feminine version of the name, would be better equipped to answer.

Some of curiosity though, may be specific to millennial Zosel-Harper's age. In the late '80s, “Ashley” boomed in popularity, and became the more common variation. “Ashleigh” had a small rise in popularity in the early '90s, right after the “Ashley” boom — perhaps a reflection of how unique spellings are a response to how popular an existing name becomes.

Zosel-Harper notes that the questions and the implication that “Ashley” is the more correct spelling, never really bothered her too much. “I think it made me feel like less of a stereotypical Ashley,” Zosel-Harper tells me. “I didn't fit that stereotype super well, so it made me feel more independent of my name.”

But she also says that she never really “loved” the name in either spelling (the extra letters, she says, are “kind of fussy”). There were so many Ashleys growing up, that it didn't feel unique. It was nothing compared to her high school classmate, Bradleigh.

“Bradley but spelled B-R-A-D-L-E-I-G-H? It totally blew my mind,” Zosel-Harper says.

But sometimes the backlash is more than just playful curiosity.

Humphrey, the baby name consultant, explains that a part of the backlash to these names is rooted in classism. Humphrey cited an argument from The Cut in 2022 when the publication explored the backlash to names like Loyal, Ozzy, Emberlyn, and theorized it was due to those names projecting an idea of being poor or uneducated, or someone poor and uneducated enough not realize that a name could convey all of those things.

Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn't.

Recently, there's been a growing, vocal obsession of “old money” and “quiet luxury” aesthetics. It's the idea of elegant consumption and behavior that only people with real wealth and class understand and access. This refined consumerism manifests itself in accessories, clothes, cars, hair color, schools, home goods and, even names. (Names considered “old money” like Amelia, Charlotte, Olivia, and Emma are all in the top 10 girls names of 2024, while Theodore, James, Henry, and William are in the top 10 boys names).

The throughline between these seemingly vast and disparate items and identifiers is understatement and tradition. Only people who understand quiet luxury will be able to spot quiet luxury, and anyone who can't is in the out-group.

Names like Tytan, Oakleigh, Jetsynn, Lennyn, are outliers. They're flashy, attention-grabbing, and meant to be noticed. They threaten structure and usurp tradition. Parents like Stephens are well aware of how these names are supposed to be spelled, and still don't follow.

“Sarah, Hannah, Emily — they're beautiful names, but I don't know, they're just not for me,” Stephens says. Despite the internet furor, Stephens says hasn't received much pushback to Sadilynn's name in real life except for when she asks teachers and faculty not to shorten it to Sadie.

“I had no intention of trying to make Sadilynn stand out,” Stephens tells me. The name “just brought me a lot of happiness.”

Humphrey pointed out to me that names were each given to less than 25 girls in 2024, like Tristyn (24), Lakynn (16), and Houstyn (5). Oaklynn, perhaps one of the most popular of these “Utah Mom” names, was given to 1,898 babies. Considering there were 3.6 million births in the US, the notion of these names becoming extremely popular feels a bit exaggerated.

It might be more helpful to look at the rise of these names (and the ensuing backlash) as part of a larger trend of Americans grappling with identity and tradition. Choosing a unique spelling for a name is a way for parents to signal individuality. They're also a way for parents to shift the way we think about gender (i.e., giving girls names that sound like boys' names but spelled with feminine features). Those trends feel more everlasting than the names people choose.

If the idea of more -y, -leigh, and -lynn names troubles you that greatly, there may be light at the end of the tunnel.

Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular.

“Here's the twist: Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular,” Humphrey tells me.

Essentially, there are less people naming their babies the most popular names. Today, the most common names don't dominate the way Michaels, Jessicas, and Sarahs did decades ago. Americans still have their favorites like Liam and Olivia — the top names in 2024 — but they aren't as saturated.

“Parents are naturally spreading out across a wider pool of options, which means the need for creative spellings may eventually solve itself,” Humphrey says.

Or maybe — maybeigh — it won't.

The war in Gaza has changed the global debate on the two-state solution. But is it too late?

Palestinian statehood has never had so much international support — or seemed less attainable.

As world leaders gather in New York City on Monday for the UN General Assembly, the question of Palestinian statehood is at the top of the agenda. On Sunday, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia confirmed that they now recognize Palestine as an independent state, following France, which announced its intention to do so last July and formalized it with a speech by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, and Malta, among others, have announced plans to recognize Palestine as well.

On Monday, representatives of most of the world's countries — but not the United States or Israel — gathered on the sidelines of the assembly for a meeting, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, to discuss implementing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also missed the meeting after being denied a visa to travel to New York by the United States, but addressed the assembly by video. Monday's meeting followed the passage, on September 12, of a UN General Assembly resolution now being referred to as the “New York declaration,” outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution. The resolution was backed by 142 of the assembly's 193 members.

“Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at Monday's meeting. “Without two states, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and radicalism will spread around.”

In Washington, a new resolution cosponsored by eight senators calls on President Donald Trump to recognize Palestinian statehood. Calling for a two-state solution is hardly a radical position in US politics, but calling for unilateral recognition of Palestine — rather than supporting a process by which a Palestinian state would emerge out of negotiations — is a more dramatic step, and it's unlikely the resolution would have gotten even this level of support before the war in Gaza. Still, even though none of those senators are Republicans, and the resolution is unlikely to pass, the level of support for a measure that calls for unilateral recognition is an indication of how politics on this issue have shifted in the United States.

Not that any of this is swaying the Israeli government. “There will be no Palestinian state. This place is ours,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared earlier this month at a ceremony announcing Israel's expansion of the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim. In fact, his government is weighing formally annexing parts of the West Bank in retaliation for the wave of recognition by Western governments. This in turn prompted a warning from the United Arab Emirates — arguably the most significant of the Arab countries that normalized relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords during Trump's first term — that it would downgrade diplomatic ties if Israel went ahead with annexation. At the same time, the war in Gaza is only escalating, as the Israel Defense Forces advance into Gaza City and thousands flee.

The reality in Israel and Palestine is so intractable that it raises the question of whether the global mobilization behind statehood is anything more than political theater. It also raises the possibility that the world may be coming to consensus on Palestinian statehood just as it slips out of reach as a realistic possibility.

Since former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared independence in 1988, some 145 countries have recognized Palestine, including the recent additions, according to a tally by Agence France Presse. That includes nearly all of Africa, Latin America, and the former Communist bloc. Most of those who do not recognize it are close US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Western Europe had, for the most part, refrained from recognizing, but that has shifted rapidly during the war in Gaza, with Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia making the decision to recognize Palestine last year.

The additions of Britain and France to the list are particularly significant, as it means that the United States is now the last permanent member of the UN Security Council that does not recognize a Palestinian state. Palestine currently has “permanent observer status” at the UN, meaning it can participate in debates, but not vote on resolutions in the main UN bodies. The Security Council has to approve new members and all five permanent members have veto power, so membership is not on the table for now. But the Senate resolution suggests that won't necessarily be the case forever.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), one of the cosponsors of the resolution, told Vox that the senators pursued it because “we have to create some light at the end of the very dark tunnel in the Middle East right now.” He added: “I do believe that the best way to ensure security and dignity and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians is through a two-state solution.”

In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Macron said that “recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has charged that France's move is a “reckless decision that only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace.” Macron countered that in fact it would “isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians” and provide an alternative political vision. Notably, the New York declaration, which the majority of Arab states supported, calls for disarming Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza.

Skepticism about the recognition declarations has come not just from supporters of Israel, but also from its critics, who see recognition as a means for governments to deflect criticism over their failure to hold Israel to account for the carnage in Gaza.

“This is worse than political theater,” said Tamara Kharroub, deputy executive director of the Arab Center in Washington, DC. “It's a smokescreen to mask their decades-long failure to implement this very two-state solution and to end Israel's occupation and apartheid, and their complicity in the genocide that has been taking place in Gaza for the past two years.”

Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said the flurry of activity around Palestinian statehood at the UN this week would be a form of “fantasy diplomacy.”

He added that the leaders of these countries “felt they had to make a declaration, but there isn't really a plan to go with it. The only way that you can really back this up would be for these countries and the wider UN membership to agree to some sort of framework for sanctions against Israel. I just don't think the political will is there to put the amount of pressure on Israel that you would need to actually dissuade Netanyahu and his government from the current course of action.”

Meanwhile on the ground in Israel and occupied territories, a two-state solution looks farther off than ever. Only 21 percent of Israelis believe their country can coexist peacefully with a Palestinian state, according to a Pew poll, down 14 percentage points since before Hamas's October 7, 2023 attacks. (The infeasibility of a two-state solution may ironically be one of the few things Israelis and Palestinians can agree on.)

As the war in Gaza drags on, members of Netanyahu's government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are now publicly discussing proposals to annex parts of the enclave if Hamas does not surrender; late last week, Smotrich touted the territory as a potential “real estate bonanza.” Those comments are in line with Trump's apparently still active proposals to turn Gaza into a tourist resort after the “voluntary” relocation of its civilian population.

Israeli officials have also discussed responding to the wave of Palestine recognitions by formally annexing parts of the West Bank. This could take several forms: from annexing Israeli settlements close to Israel, to annexing the area along the border between the West Bank and Jordan, to annexing all of what's known as “Area C” — the 60 percent of the West Bank currently under Israeli security control. Far-right ministers like Smotrich have proposed going even further and dissolving the Palestinian Authority entirely.

Van Hollen, who recently visited the West Bank, dismissed these threats, saying it's clear that plans for annexation are already underway. “For them to pretend that the actions they're taking in the West Bank are in response to calls for recognition of a Palestinian state is just a cover story,” he said. “It's a big lie.”

Yoel Guzansky, a former Israeli government adviser who now leads the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, told Vox that Netanyahu “needs a green light from the Trump administration” to move ahead with annexation. “He could not do it without it.”

Trump and his advisers have sent mixed signals on the issue over the years. Axios has reported, citing Israeli officials, that Rubio, who visited Israel earlier this month, has signaled that the Trump administration is not opposed to annexation, but other administration officials disputed the Israeli characterization. While a “two-state solution” was long bipartisan orthodoxy in Washington, Trump has suggested in the past he's not wedded to the idea, and some members of his administration, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are openly annexationist.

What may deter Trump from giving Netanyahu a green light is the effect that annexation would have on one of his signature accomplishments: the Abraham Accords. Even a “limited” annexation of West Bank territory would likely drive a deeper wedge between Israel and its erstwhile partners in the Arab world. West Bank annexation would be another red line crossed, and the government of the UAE — which has close relations with the Trump administration — has warned the White House that it could unravel the accords, entirely.

Guzansky said that the Abraham Accords countries “might not cancel the agreement entirely” if Israel went ahead with annexation, but that the agreements are “becoming an empty shell of something that was once seen as a model peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors, a ‘Cold Peace' agreement.” That could mean the Arab states continue cooperating with Israel on security, but do so without the people-to-people exchanges or deeper political and economic integration that the accords had promised.

A few years ago, Netanyahu likely would have also pointed to normalizing relations between Israel and countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco as one of the crowning foreign policy achievements of his long era in office. The grand prize, normalization with Saudi Arabia, seemed at least a realistic possibility. The Abraham Accords saw many Arab governments willing to sidestep the Palestinian issue to find common ground with Israel on trade and their shared rivalry with Iran.

The sheer level of devastation in Gaza, though, and the global reaction to it, have made that sidestepping much more difficult for even the most jaded and autocratic governments to maintain. Israel's military strikes throughout the Middle East in recent months, particularly the recent airstrike on Qatar, have further convinced these governments that Israel is increasingly a source of regional instability.

In a recent speech, Netanyahu warned Israel that it would likely have to accept an increasingly isolated position on the world stage for the time being, and transform into a “super Sparta” and “adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics.”

Regional integration and good relations with its neighbors would be nice, in other words, but in the Israeli government's view, if the price is a negotiated end to the war in Gaza and serious steps toward accepting Palestinian statehood, it's just not worth it.

This week's events in New York are unlikely to bring about a Palestinian state in reality — or end the carnage in Gaza — but they may one day be seen as an inflection point in Israel's path toward isolation on the world stage.

A pediatrician on why we should trust the vaccine schedule — even when Trump officials don't.

This week in “science” according to politicians, President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are now warning pregnant women to avoid Tylenol — yes, Tylenol — because of its supposed link to autism. Never mind that there's no strong scientific evidence to back that up. It's just the latest example of a clear trend in this administration: ideology-first policymaking.

Last week, a low-profile but high-stakes meeting on the country's vaccine guidance flew under the radar, but there was major drama — and again more ideology on display than science.

Kennedy's handpicked vaccine advisory committee met to update the schedule recommended to millions of parents across the US.

The meeting was chaotic and confusing — even to some of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices members. “I'm not sure what I'm voting on,” said Cody Meissner, one of its members. By the end of a grueling two-day session, the results were mixed. The committee walked back its previous recommendation of the Covid vaccines and postponed a vote that would delay the first vaccination for hepatitis B in newborns. But it did recommend that children under 4 years old shouldn't get a combined MMRV shot — and should instead get separate ones for MMR and chickenpox, or varicella.

The chaotic meeting underscored our fractured state of public health guidance and what it means for our future. If even top government health officials can't agree on immunizations, how are parents supposed to know what's best for their kids?

To untangle all of this, we spoke with Dr. William Moss, a former pediatrician and professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and the executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center. We get into the history of vaccination schedules, why countries can't agree on the same one, and how public health officials should build trust with vaccine-hesitant parents.

“The way I kind of look at it when I put my pediatrician's hat on is that all parents want to do what's right for their child. “But,” Moss told Today, Explained co-host Noel King, “sometimes the risk of the disease can be underestimated. And that's a large part due to the success of vaccines and the fact that we don't see many of these vaccine diseases anymore.”

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

When and why did we first start thinking that kids should be getting vaccines on this unified schedule?

There's actually a long history of guidance on immunizations here in this country, and it's gotten obviously more complicated as more vaccines have been introduced, but you can trace it all the way back to the 1930s when the American Academy of Pediatrics started issuing guidance on childhood vaccines.

At that time, it was really just the smallpox vaccine, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine. Then, as more vaccines got added: In the mid-1950s, the inactivated polio vaccine, in the early 1960s, the measles vaccine, and the oral polio vaccine. It was recognized that we needed experts to think through what the appropriate schedule should be for children.

And so in 1964, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was established. For many years, they issued ad hoc recommendations, and the American Academy of Pediatrics continued to issue its own guidelines. But in the mid-1990s, ACIP got together with the American Academy of Pediatrics and issued what is really considered the first unified immunization schedule for children.

I don't know if you were around and working in the field in 1995, but I would imagine that the feeling at the time was, “Okay, we are now organized. We have this under control. Everybody's gonna be more or less following the same rules.” Do I have that right?

Yes, I think there was. I was in my early days of my pediatric training in 1995. There was a recognition that we needed to have this unification of the immunization schedule or standardization of this immunization schedule. And it was really bringing together the key expert groups, getting them aligned. There were some differences before that, which created some confusion, so having this unified immunization schedule in the mid 1990s was a big advance.

“When I put my pediatrician's hat on, I see parents who want to do what's right for their child. But what I also see sometimes is that the risk of the disease can be underestimated.”

You've worked throughout the world, and so you know that these vaccine schedules differ, even across developed countries. If the schedule that we have here in the US is what is best, why do Denmark and the UK have different schedules for childhood vaccinations?

The way I would think about it is that there's not one true, you know, “the best” immunization schedule. These immunization schedules involve trade-offs. So, for example, one thing of big consideration is just the disease burden, the epidemiology of a particular disease. How big of a problem is it in a particular country? What age group is most impacted by that disease? Is it multiple doses or a single dose of a vaccine? Can the vaccine doses be aligned so that you can minimize the number of healthcare visits?

And then there are economic considerations: the cost of the vaccine. Who's paying for the vaccine in that setting? The UK and the United States have very different health care financing systems, so that can drive differences in decisions.

You can see that not having one right answer gives people pause.

Yeah, I can understand that, but I don't think it should. I think people can understand that, in many things in life, there's not one right answer. That opens the door for some flexibility. If a parent wants to space out a vaccine, they can do that in consultation with their health care provider. There are risks, obviously, in delaying vaccination because then their child is at risk for that disease during that longer period before they're vaccinated.

Vaccines and their schedules have become highly contentious, with a lot of confusing and unhelpful noise out there. It's not surprising that many well-meaning parents feel overwhelmed and uncertain. One common question I keep hearing is: Are infants getting too many vaccines at once? How should parents realistically approach and think about this question?

There are a couple of things nested within that. One is just seeing their child get multiple injections with a needle at the same time, knowing that that causes their child discomfort. And I think that is part of it. Sometimes parents are concerned — and this is where the evidence is less supportive — that their child's immune system is being exposed to too much at one time. I don't think there's any kind of biological or immunological basis for that. Our bodies are being exposed to foreign antigens, as we call them, all the time.

It's very important for those of us in public health and certainly those on the front line, administering vaccines, to listen to parents, to hear their concerns, but to also try to allay unfounded fears.

There has been a drawing of sides here that seems very unfortunate to me. For example, if you have questions about the vaccine schedule, people might say, “You're a conspiracist. You're a threat to public health. You're a threat to my kids.” If you feel comfortable with the existing science around vaccines, then you're participating in a broken system. You're not asking the kinds of questions you should ask on behalf of your kids. What do you make of this divide?

When I put my pediatrician's hat on, I see parents who want to do what's right for their child. But what I also see sometimes is that the risk of the disease can be underestimated. And that's a large part due to the success of vaccines and the fact that we don't see many of these vaccine-preventable diseases anymore.

Is there any room for improvement on our childhood vaccine schedules? The design of them, the way that they're updated, the messaging around them? Or is everything being done exactly right?

I would certainly say not everything's being done exactly right, and there's always room for improvement. But what I'll emphasize is — what's really important — is that process by which the immunization schedule is reviewed and updated. That's so critical to making sure that good, sound decisions are being made and to ensure the trust in those decisions.

Business Insider Edition 

Philanthropist Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will contribute $912 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, while warning that global health funding cuts could disproportionately affect Africa.


        Speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, Gates noted the risks facing African children. “A kid born in northern Nigeria has a 15% chance of dying before the age of 5. You can either be part of improving that or act like that doesn't matter,"" he said.
    


        The Gates Foundation's pledge matches its donation in 2022; the last time the Global Fund, a Geneva-based independent nonprofit, raised money on its three-year budget cycle. The announcement comes amid reductions in aid from governments worldwide, led by the United States.
    


        “The Goalkeepers event celebrates and seeks to accelerate progress on United Nations global development goals set for 2030, including improving health and ending poverty,” Gates said.
    


        “I am not capable of making up what the government cuts, and I don't want to create an illusion of that.” he added.
    


        Founded in 2000 by Gates and his ex-wife, the foundation is one of the largest funders of global health initiatives worldwide. Its work focuses on ending preventable deaths of mothers and babies, tackling infectious diseases, and lifting millions out of poverty.
    


        In countries like Ethiopia, its initiatives to expand vaccination coverage and improve maternal healthcare have been credited with significantly reducing child and maternal mortality rates. However, challenges remain in sustaining progress across the globe.

        Global development assistance dropped 21 percent between 2024 and 2025, hitting a 15-year low, according to the U.S.-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
    


        Experts warn that this decline could put at risk the progress that has halved child mortality since 2000, saving five million lives each year.
    


        Bill Gates said maintaining funding for the Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, prioritising primary healthcare, and rolling out innovations like the long-acting HIV prevention drug lenacapavir could save additional lives. Organisations including the Global Fund are racing to secure funds before the end of the year to prevent setbacks.
    


        “What's happening to the health of the world's children is worse than most people realize, but our long-term prospects are better than most can imagine,” Gates added.
    


        Africa continues to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. According to the World Health Organization, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for nearly 70 percent of all people living with HIV worldwide, and the region records the highest rates of tuberculosis infection and death.
    


        Malaria remains endemic in most African countries, with children under five and pregnant women among the most vulnerable. These diseases continue to strain healthcare systems and contribute significantly to preventable deaths.

        Despite these challenges, Bill Gates said there is still an opportunity to save millions of lives and eliminate some of the deadliest childhood diseases by the time he donates the remainder of his fortune in 2045.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Joe Rogan says conservatives were 'crazy' to support Jimmy Kimmel's suspension: 'This will be used on you'","https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-rogan-jimmy-kimmels-suspension-reaction-trump-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 20:02:00 GMT","

Joe Rogan has had enough of the right celebrating Jimmy Kimmel's suspension.

""I definitely don't think that the government should be involved ever in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say in a monologue,"" Rogan said during an episode of his influential podcast that was posted on Tuesday.

Rogan's statement mirrored what Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican and Trump ally, said last week: Conservatives will come to regret setting a precedent where the federal government can bully media companies into censorship.

""The problem is the companies, if they're being pressured by the government, so if that's real and if people on the right are like, 'Yeah, go get 'em.' Oh my God, you are crazy,"" Rogan said. ""You are crazy for supporting this because this will be used on you.""

Rogan endorsed Trump on the eve of the 2024 election, welcoming the then-former president on his show despite repeatedly saying he would never do so. While Rogan has emphasized he is ""not a Republican,"" he has often expressed similar views to the GOP base, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rogan's podcast appeared to have been recorded before Disney announced on Monday that Kimmel and his late-night show would return Tuesday evening. Last week, ABC said it was suspending ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" after the host's comments on the killing of Charlie Kirk.

A comedian himself, Rogan said part of Kimmel's final monologue before his suspension was hilarious, even if the framing around the shooting suspect's ideology was inaccurate. ""We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,"" Kimmel said during the September 15 show, before cutting to a clip of Trump discussing the construction of the new ballroom at the White House after a reporter asked him about Kirk.

""I think what he was trying to do was just set up a joke. He was trying to knock on the MAGA people, but also set up a joke, which was good,"" Rogan said. 'It was very funny.""

Before ABC's suspension, Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair Broadcasting Company, which combined own roughly 25% of all local ABC stations, announced that they would not air Kimmel's show on their stations. Both groups have said that they will continue not to air Kimmel's show.

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, had pressured local broadcasters to take action after Kimmel's comments angered some conservatives. In his comments, Carr threatened broadcasters' licenses, which the FCC holds jurisdiction over, and which are the lifeblood of local stations. While ABC does not have a license itself, Disney does own a small number of stations in some of the nation's biggest markets.

Trump, who has yet to comment on Kimmel's return, was among those who celebrated ABC's suspension. The president also called for NBC to fire its two late-night hosts.

""Kimmel has ZERO talent, and worse ratings than even Colbert, if that's possible. That leaves Jimmy and Seth, two total losers, on Fake News NBC,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social while on a state visit to the United Kingdom. ""Their ratings are also horrible. Do it NBC!!! ""

Rogan said it was odd that the President of the United States would comment on such news.

""How do you have time while you're running the world to be tweeting that you don't like talk show hosts?"" he said. ""That is so crazy, crazy.""

Correction: September 23 — This story has been updated to correct a quote attributed to Rogan about Kimmel's monologue. He said, ""I think what he was trying to do was just set up a joke. He was trying to knock on the MAGA people, but also set up a joke, which was good. It was very funny.""

In case you've missed it, there's been a bit of a gold rush going on.

The price of the precious metal is on a seemingly unstoppable ascent to record after record, including its latest on Tuesday.

There's interest from the Wall Street elite, such as billionaire Ray Dalio, who thinks 15% of your portfolio should be in the precious metal. But the rally has also captured the attention of everyday shoppers. Just ask Costco, which currently counts gold bars as a top-selling item online.

No matter how you slice it, gold is having a moment, but it didn't happen overnight.

It's been propelled higher by a mix of three main macro drivers, two of which have been simmering for months, and one that just presented itself this week.

These are detailed below, in reverse chronological order:

A new report from Bloomberg on Tuesday said that China is trying to become a custodian of foreign sovereign gold reserves. In other words, it wants to store the bullion bought by other countries. The report said that the plan had attracted interest from at least one Southeast Asian country.

The move is bullish for the price of gold in two ways. First, it incentivizes more people — in this case, governments — to buy the metal. Second, by making it a national financial priority, China is establishing itself as yet another major player in a system designed to do one thing: keep buying and holding gold.

Given the Federal Reserve's decision to lower interest rates by 25 basis points at its September meeting, this can be considered the second-most-recent bullish driver for gold.

It's also important to note that the mere prospect of rate cuts was also responsible for gains throughout 2025, before Jerome Powell finally pulled the trigger.

The technical reason for this is straightforward: if the Fed is going to cut rates and keep doing so, bond yields will fall alongside them, making bonds less attractive compared to non-interest-beating assets like gold.

In addition, lower rates boost the outlook for higher inflation, which gold is meant to hedge against in investor portfolios.

This catalyst points to gold's core function throughout history: a haven asset that investors turn to for safety and stability.

While gold's gains in recent weeks can be pegged to rate-cut expectations, the metal was predominantly driven by economic and political uncertainty during the first half of 2025.

There was Trump's tariff-a-palooza, which culminated in an early-April ""Liberation Day"" that rocked markets and sent investors scrambling to safety. This may be a back-burner issue at the moment, but the specter of more tariffs hasn't gone away.

There have also been Trump's near-constant attacks on the Fed, in pursuit of lower interest rates. This has challenged the central bank's independence, and — in some peoples' eyes — eroded the appeal of US government assets.

Enter gold, which is a safe haven without the current baggage of Treasury bonds.

Looking ahead, the prognosis on Wall Street is bullish. Goldman Sachs actually sees a silver lining to Trump's Fed offensive, saying earlier this month that gold prices could soar 40% if he keeps it up.

A-list investors are also getting in on the party. Both billionaire David Einhorn and ""Bond King"" Jeffrey Gundlach have sung gold's praises in the media lately, with the latter considering it a top investing idea.

With two more rate cuts expected by year-end, it's tough to find a weak spot in the bull case for gold. Perhaps the only thing that can derail it at this point is its own success — if investors start to question whether the record-setting run has gone too far.

Sorry, home-office enthusiasts. So-called ""hybrid creep"" is gaining traction.

Employers are gradually increasing the number of days that workers must show up at the office. For example, this month Intel began requiring staffers to come in at least four days a week, up from three previously. NBCUniversal, Starbucks, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. recently implemented similar mandates.

A new survey of 2,000 full-time US workers found that nearly a third of employers revised their remote or hybrid work policies in the past year. Video-conferencing company Owl Labs, which commissioned the poll and claims it came up with the term ""hybrid creep,"" found that 34% of respondents are now required to be on-site at least four days a week. That is up from 32% in 2024 and 23% in 2023.

""This is the boiling-frog concept,"" Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Boston-based Owl Labs, told Business Insider. Instead of suddenly demanding workers return to the office full-time after several years of hybrid — and before that, fully remote — schedules, they've been taking things slow, he said.

It's likely that employers going with a baby-step approach aren't using stricter return-to-office mandates as a way to nudge workers to resign, said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

""Nobody's quitting now anyway,"" he said.

Instead, companies may be easing staff back into commuting incrementally to avoid stirring resentment, which can hamper productivity. Just because workers aren't handing in resignations as frequently as they used to doesn't mean they're happy with less flexibility, Cappelli said.

Companies generally want workers back at the office so they can monitor them more closely and spur more collaboration. Yet five-day RTO mandates have come with some hiccups, as Business Insider previously reported.

Amazon's shift in January from three to five mandatory office days left workers scrambling for desks and meeting rooms, while Dell's March orders for employees living near an office to come back full time resulted in uneven compliance. Some workers at the tech company resumed eight-hour office days, while ""coffee badgers"" showed up only briefly.

Still, returning to a fully in-person workweek may result in some employees resigning, even in today's job-hugging economy, because of child- or elder-care needs, said Pace University management professor Andrew Coggins.

Returning to fully in-person schedules ""can be a big jump,"" he said.

Owl Labs's survey suggests that more workers are warming up to office life. Some 21% of respondents said they'd like to be on-site as many as four days a week, an increase from 17% in last year's report. Yet nearly half of workers polled said they still lack the overall work flexibility they want, and 37% said they'd decline a job offer from a company that doesn't allow flexible working hours.

It's possible that hybrid creep is a sign that the era of flexible work is coming to an end — at least at some companies. ""I think employers would prefer five days,"" said Coggins. ""They have more control.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here are the jobs most and least likely to be transformed by GenAI, according to a new index from Indeed","https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-index-indeed-skills-jobs-change-roles-immune-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Generative AI is steadily rewiring the DNA of work, radically transforming some jobs, while other professions remain relatively immune.

That's according to a new analysis from Indeed, a job-listings platform, that created an index to track these workplace changes.

Indeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index measures how much generative AI could change the way different skills or jobs are performed. Instead of measuring whether this technology will fully replace human workers, it examines how skills may be applied going forward and how human involvement with those skills and tasks could evolve.

The study and index assessed the cognitive and physical demands required across nearly 2,900 work skills and the capacity of generative AI to perform them. Indeed focused on two particular criteria:

Problem-solving ability: The degree to which a skill requires cognitive reasoning, applied knowledge, and practical judgment, and how well generative AI can replicate this.

Physical necessity: Whether a skill requires physical execution. Until general-purpose robotics advances significantly, these tasks remain mostly human-exclusive, according to Indeed.

Based on this evaluation, skills were grouped into four distinct categories based on their potential to be transformed by generative AI: minimal transformation, assisted transformation, hybrid transformation, and full transformation.

Under this framework, Indeed found the following:

When Indeed ran an initial version of this analysis a year ago, no skills were rated as ""very likely"" to be fully replaced by GenAI. Today, 19 skills (0.7% of all skills analyzed) were assessed to be ""very likely"" to be fully replaced by GenAI, still small in absolute terms, but a significant signal of progress.

""GenAI has gotten (and continues to get) smarter,"" Annina Hering, senior economist at Indeed's Hiring Lab, and Arcenis Rojas, a data scientist at the lab, wrote. ""As long as physical execution is not required — an admittedly big caveat — and GenAI capabilities continue to grow, more skills are likely to cross the threshold into realistic automation as work continues to evolve.""

The latest findings reveal that childcare, nursing, and construction are the least likely to be transformed by generative AI.

Meanwhile, software development is most likely to be transformed by generative AI. Eighty-one percent of the skills involved in these jobs will experience a hybrid transformation in which GenAI leads and humans provide oversight, according to Indeed's index.

Data & Analytics and accounting were second and third, behind software development, as most likely to be transformed by GenAI.

The overall message is pretty blunt: no job is entirely immune, but not all jobs are equally exposed. Technical and information-heavy roles will feel the brunt of automation, while jobs grounded in physical presence and human touch will remain mostly shielded.

For businesses, that means redesigning workflows and training pipelines. For workers, it means leaning into uniquely human strengths, such as physical dexterity, informed oversight, and empathy, that AI still can't replicate well.

Here's the full breakdown of jobs and skills:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","If you're planning to quit your job, here's how to do it right","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-you-should-quit-job-right-future-employers-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:46:00 GMT","

You might call Alan Stein a connoisseur of quitting.

Stein, who's in his early 50s, has had 31 jobs. Other than a handful of instances where he got canned, Stein has given notice a couple of dozen times. That means he knows what it's like to leave an employer well — and not so well.

""Disassociate your emotions from your actions. This is something I have not done well in my career, and I'm continuing to work on,"" said Stein, CEO of Kadima Careers, which offers coaching for landing six-figure jobs.

The most basic reason to do this, he said, echoes the don't-burn-a-bridge speech your parents delivered: ""You very likely may come across several of these people that you work with in your future,"" Stein told Business Insider.

In 2025, quitting might be something you only dream about when work piles up or you get the side-eye from your boss. Many employees are simply holding on to their jobs because, for the first time since 2021, there are more people in the US looking for work than there are open roles.

The lackluster job market is yet another reason that it pays to quit well. Here are three things to consider:

If you're having a lousy time at work, don't quit on a bad day, said Laura Labovich, who runs an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.

""A lot of people run away from a bad workplace, but they have nothing to run towards,"" she told Business Insider.

Instead, Labovich said, create a plan for leaving. Unless you're in a toxic work environment, considering what you want to do next is often a lot easier while you still have a paycheck and benefits.

Sketching out a strategy before you pull the ripcord also doesn't mean you have to stay forever. Most workers don't. Younger baby boomers held an average of 12.9 jobs from ages 18 to 58, the Labor Department reported. It also found that the oldest millennials — those born in the early 1980s — had nine jobs, on average, from age 18 to their mid-30s.

If you're heading for the door, it's wise to show gratitude, thank your boss and others for the opportunity, and explain why the role might no longer be an ideal fit for you, said Jim Detert, a professor at the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration.

One way to frame it, he said, is to focus on advancement opportunities. That's not threatening to those you're leaving behind, and it allows them to say that there wasn't a great fit for your growth or passions at your employer, Detert said.

""That doesn't make people angry at you,"" he told Business Insider.

Detert said that if you're departing for a management position, for example, you can credit your boss with that by saying they've inspired you, by being a solid mentor, to go into leadership.

In any case, Detert said, it's often wise to give credit.

""You can say things like, 'The whole reason I'm at this stage now of being so ready for X, is that you have given me so many opportunities up to this point,'"" Detert said.

An exit interview could be one of the last big things you do in your job. So, just as you want to consider how you leave things with your boss, it's smart to do the same with an exit interview, Detert said.

He cautioned against firing off a litany of complaints about the organization. That's because if leadership wasn't listening to you before you said you were leaving, it's unlikely to start doing so when you depart, Detert said.

""I don't think I've ever heard of a case where exit interviews were the basis of any meaningful change,"" Detert said.

One reason, he said, is that HR staffers tend to conduct exit interviews, rather than senior execs. That means there's a lower likelihood of a big payoff from carrying out ""a therapeutic purge,"" Detert said.

He said that in his many years of studying the impact of speaking out, there are two key considerations: Is it safe, and is it worthwhile? If you're leaving, you don't have to worry about a boss withholding a promotion, for example. Yet, Detert said, you still might meet colleagues at future employers. It's another version of the don't-burn-a-bridge idea.

""If you think that, 'Now I'm leaving and it's safer,' you may be mistaken,"" he said.

In this article

Google-owned YouTube on Tuesday said it will soon allow previously banned accounts to apply for reinstatement, rolling back a policy that had treated violations as permanent.

The change applies to channels removed for posting Covid-19 or election-related misinformation, according to a letter from Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan to House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Previously, those types of offenses carried lifetime bans.

""Today, YouTube's Community Guidelines allow for a wider range of content regarding Covid and elections integrity,"" Donovan wrote.

YouTube wrote on X that it will be a limited pilot project open to a subset of creators as well as channels that were terminated under policies the company has since retired. YouTube also said its new reinstatement program will launch soon.

Among channels previously banned under those rules were some associated with Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It's not yet clear whether those channels will be reinstated.

This move follows mounting Republican pressure on tech companies to reverse Biden-era speech policies on vaccine and political misinformation. In March, Rep. Jordan subpoenaed Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, alleging YouTube was a ""direct participant in the federal government's censorship regime.""

In 2021, YouTube said it would remove content that spread misinformation about all approved vaccines.

Donovan wrote that during the pandemic, senior Biden administration officials pressed the company to remove certain Covid-related videos that did not technically violate YouTube's policies.

In the letter, Donovan said this pressure was ""unacceptable and wrong.""

YouTube ended its stand-alone Covid misinformation rules in December 2024, according to Donovan's letter.

YouTube ""will not empower third-party fact-checkers"" to moderate content and will continue to enable ""free expression"" on the platform, Donovan wrote. While Donovan writes that YouTube has not used fact-checkers, the platform has produced programs that are meant to label context on videos.

Similarly, Meta said in January that it had eliminated its fact-checking program on Facebook and Instagram.

YouTube has a feature that will display information panels with links to independent fact checks under videos. The feature says it provides more context on videos across YouTube with information from third-party sources.

In 2017, Google launched a fact-checking tool that would display labels on search and news results.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday noted that asset prices, a category that typically includes stocks and other risk instruments, are at elevated levels.

During a speech in Providence, Rhode Island, the central bank leader was asked how much emphasis he and his colleagues place on market prices and whether they have a higher tolerance for higher values.

""We do look at overall financial conditions, and we ask ourselves whether our policies are affecting financial conditions in a way that is what we're trying to achieve,"" Powell said. ""But you're right, by many measures, for example, equity prices are fairly highly valued.""

In the run-up to last week's policy meetings, stocks and other assets rallied strongly as conviction grew that that the Federal Open Market Committee would be lowering its benchmark overnight borrowing rate. Stocks have continued to climb, setting a succession of record highs for major averages, since the decision Wednesday to cut by a quarter percentage point.

""Markets listen to us and follow and they make an estimation of where they think rates are going. And so they'll price things in,"" Powell said in part of the conversation dealing with mortgage rates.

Though Powell noted the lofty equity values, he said this is ""not a time of elevated financial stability risks.""

Stocks took a turn lower after Powell's comments, with major averages all trading in the red.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that weakness in the labor market is outweighing concerns about stubborn inflation, leading to a decision he backed to lower the central bank's key interest rate last week.

The Federal Open Market Committee's first cut of the year came amid signs that both supply and demand of workers is waning at the same time that near-term impact from tariffs has pushed inflation higher.

At such times, Powell said, during a speech to business leaders in Providence, Rhode Island, the Fed's job is to ""balance both sides of our dual mandate"" for stable prices and low unemployment.

""Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation,"" he said. ""Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path.""

The conditions Powell described in the speech are consistent with stagflation, in which growth slows and inflation is high. While the current situation is far less severe than what the U.S. encountered in the 1970s and early '80s, it nonetheless has presented a policy challenge for the Fed.

Powell, however, said he is comfortable with the central bank's current policy path though he indicated the possibility of additional cuts should the FOMC see the need to be more accommodative.

""The increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals,"" he said. ""This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.""

Stocks took a turn lower during Powell's presentation as he said during a question-and-answer period that assets are ""fairly highly valued.""

On the labor market, Powell noted ""a marked slowdown"" in supply and demand. ""In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen,"" he said.

Indeed, payroll growth has slowed dramatically, averaging below 30,000 during the summer months while benchmark revisions showed nearly a million fewer jobs created in the 12 months prior to March 2025.

At the same time, inflation has cooled substantially since hitting a more than 40-year peak in 2022 but is still considerably above the Fed's 2% goal. Commerce Department data to be released Friday is expected to indicate that personal consumption prices rose 2.7% on an annual all-items basis and 2.9% when excluding food and energy, Powell said.

Adding to uncertainty is the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The president continues to negotiate with major U.S. trading partners about the ultimate level for the duties, with a key deadline with China coming up in early November. Fed economists for now are viewing the tariffs as mostly a temporary rise in prices, though that could change.

""Uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high,"" Powell said. ""We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.""

Powell is presiding over a Fed that has come under intense criticism from the White House and is seeing an unusually wide dispersion in views among officials. The FOMC meeting concluded with participants narrowly split, 10-9, over whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be appropriate this year. Trump appointee Stephen Miran has pushed for a much more aggressive course, but his term as governor ends in January.

Earlier Tuesday, Governor Michelle Bowman warned about the dangers of moving too slowly to address the labor market. Bowman, also a Trump appointee, said ""we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.""

""I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration,"" she said.

While Powell has not provided his expectations for future rate moves, Bowman said she hopes the recent action is ""the first step"" in an ongoing move back to a neutral interest rate level.

In this article

Eli Lilly on Tuesday said it will spend $6.5 billion to build a manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, to boost production of the company's pipeline of so-called small molecule drugs, including its closely watched experimental obesity pill. 

It is the second in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the drugmaker. Eli Lilly announced in February that it would spend at least $27 billion to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. 

Eli Lilly said it will announce the two remaining U.S. sites this year. The company expects to begin making medicines at all four facilities within five years. 

That added production capacity for Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, is crucial as the company races to bring it to market and tries to maintain its dominance in the booming market for GLP-1s. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have previously faced supply constraints with their existing weekly injections, as demand skyrocketed in the U.S. 

""Our new Houston site will enhance Lilly's ability to manufacture orforglipron at scale and, if approved, help fulfill the medicine's potential as an obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment for tens of millions of people worldwide who prefer the ease of a pill that can be taken without food and water restrictions,"" Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said in the release. 

Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. as President Donald Trump threatens to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. Trump has said those levies will encourage companies to re-shore production after domestic drug manufacturing shrank dramatically over the past decade.

In a release Tuesday, Eli Lilly said the new Houston plant will focus on manufacturing orforglipron and the company's pipeline of other small molecule medicines across different disease areas, including cardiometabolic health, oncology, immunology and neuroscience. Small molecule drugs, which often come in pill form, are more convenient for patients to take than injectable medications and are generally easier and cheaper to manufacture at scale.  

Eli Lilly said the site will bring 615 jobs to the Greater Houston area, including highly skilled engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, and 4,000 construction jobs.

President Donald Trump mocked the United Nations' headquarters in a speech to the General Assembly, recalling his failed bid to renovate the building in New York.

""Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J. Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex,"" Trump told the GA during wide-ranging remarks that questioned the purpose of the UN.

""I said at the time that I would do it for $500 million, rebuilding and everything, it would be beautiful,"" Trump said.

""I used to talk about, 'I'm going to give you marble floors, they're going to give you terrazzo,'"" he recalled. ""'I'm going to give you the best of everything, you're going to have mahogany walls. They're going to give you plastic.'""

""I realized that they did not know what they were doing when it came to construction,"" Trump said.

He said that the UN ultimately decided to go in ""another direction,"" which was ""much more expensive at the time"" and ""produced a far inferior product.""

Trump began his speech reading from paper notes because the teleprompter was not working.

The escalator at the UN also stopped working when he and First Lady Melania Trump stepped on it, fueling his attacks on the headquarters.

""These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,"" Trump cracked.

A United Nations official said later Tuesday that a person traveling with Trump inadvertently hit the stop lever on the escalator, causing it to come to an abrupt halt, according to the Associated Press.

The official also noted that the president's team was responsible for operating the teleprompter, the AP reported.

In 2005, Trump asked a U.S. Senate committee to allow him to manage renovations of the UN, a request that was ultimately denied.

In his speech to world leaders on Tuesday, Trump criticized their global organization, accusing the UN of operating with ""empty words, and empty words don't solve wars.""

""The UN has such tremendous potential, I've always said it,"" Trump said.

""It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential,"" he said in his address, which lasted nearly an hour.

""All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter, and then never follow that letter up; it's empty words,"" he continued.

Trump's speech came as he has withdrawn the United States from a number of different UN bodies and slashed funding for the organization.

Trump, who has long been critical of the UN, said its member countries ""are being ruined"" by immigration.

He also called climate change ""a con job.""

Trump urged the UN to trust his vision for policy, saying that he's ""really good at predicting things.""

""During the campaign, they had a hat. The best-selling hat, 'Trump Was Right About Everything,'"" he recalled.

""And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true,"" Trump said.

In this article

Morgan Stanley is months away from offering crypto trading to retail customers through its E-Trade division as the Wall Street giant embraces what it called a transformative moment for the wealth management industry.

The firm is working with the startup Zerohash — which Morgan Stanley also took an investment stake in — for liquidity, custody and settlement around crypto trading, according to a memo obtained by CNBC.

""We are well underway in preparing to offer crypto trading through a partner model to E-Trade clients in the first half of 2026,"" Jed Finn, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said in the memo.

Morgan Stanley is among the most aggressive of big banks in embracing crypto after the U.S. government's stance toward the technology flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Wealth management accounted for nearly half of Morgan Stanley's total revenue last year, making it more reliant on the industry than its other big bank peers.

The move is the latest sign of crypto adoption by financial incumbents. In an earlier wave about four years ago, banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs began offering bitcoin funds to their wealthy clients. That gave clients exposure to the asset class though crypto firms including Galaxy Digital that managed the funds.

But what Morgan Stanley is doing now is preparing to offer direct ownership of crypto, which cuts out some third-party management fees and comes with greater risks. Morgan Stanley will first offer bitcoin, ether and solana trading, according to Bloomberg News.

Morgan Stanley is preparing for a future in which wealthy clients expect to see traditional and digital assets managed in the same environment, Finn said in the memo.

The bank is working on a wallet that will allow it to be the custodian for clients' digital assets, a key part of its overall strategy, he said.

""Offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg,"" Finn said.

The bank expects to help clients hold not just crypto, but also tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, according to the memo.

Tokenization — or creating a digital representation of assets including cash, stocks, bonds and real estate on a blockchain — will ""significantly disrupt"" the wealth management industry, Finn said.

""Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet,"" Finn said. ""The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency.""

""We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around DLT and tokenization more broadly,"" he said, using the acronym for distributed ledger technology, the concept underpinning blockchain.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday cancelled a planned meeting with the two top Democrats in Congress to address issues holding up a funding deal that could avoid a federal government shutdown.

Trump scrapped the sit-down set for Thursday just a day after people familiar with the situation said that his meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would happen.

Trump's move increases the likelihood of a shutdown.

The two New York lawmakers are insisting that any stopgap deal to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown include protections for health-care programs, including by extending Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits.

Those credits, which are usable for health insurance plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces, are due to expire at the end of the year.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.""

Jeffries quickly tweeted in response: ""Trump Always Chickens Out.""

""Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,"" Jeffries wrote.

""The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America,"" the Democratic leader wrote.

Schumer, in a statement, said, ""Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there.""

""While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job,"" Schumer said.

""Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.""

In a letter requesting the talks on Saturday, Schumer and Jeffries wrote, ""We do not understand why you prefer to shut down the government rather than protect the health care and quality of life of the American people,"" they wrote.

Trump, in his post on Tuesday, slammed Democrats' demands, accusing them of seeking to fund an array of ""Radical Left Views and Policies"" related to health care, immigration, and crime.

""The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way,"" Trump wrote.

""I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation,"" he wrote. ""We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed.""

""I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter,"" the president wrote. ""To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court.""

While close to 150 world leaders prepared to descend on Manhattan for the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. Secret Service was quietly dismantling a massive hidden telecom network across the New York area — a system investigators say could have crippled cell towers, jammed 911 calls and flooded networks with chaos at the very moment the city was most vulnerable.

The cache, made up of more than 300 SIM servers packed with over 100,000 SIM cards and clustered within 35 miles of the United Nations, represents one of the most sweeping communications threats uncovered on U.S. soil. Investigators warn the system could have blacked out cellular service in a city that relies on it not only for daily life but for emergency response and counterterrorism.

Coming as foreign leaders filled midtown hotels and motorcades clogged Manhattan, officials say the takedown highlights a new frontier of risk: plots aimed at the invisible infrastructure that keeps a modern city connected.

The network was uncovered as part of a broader Secret Service investigation into telecommunications threats targeting senior government officials, according to investigators. Spread across multiple sites, the servers functioned like banks of mock cellphones, able to generate mass calls and texts, overwhelm local networks and mask encrypted communications criminals, officials said.

""It can't be understated what this system is capable of doing,"" said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office. ""It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? .... You can't text message, you can't use your cell phone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city.""

Officials said they haven't uncovered a direct plot to disrupt the U.N. General Assembly and note there are no known credible threats to New York City.

Forensic analysis is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries — used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point.

""We need to do forensics on 100,000 cell phones, essentially all the phone calls, all the text messages, anything to do with communications, see where those numbers end up,"" McCool said, noting that the process will take time.

When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with SIM cards. More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network's capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and SIM cards alone.

The operation had the capability of sending up to 30 million text messages a minute, McCool said.

""The U.S. Secret Service's protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled,"" the agency's director, Sean Curran, said in a statement.

Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. In this case, he said, attackers would have been able to force that kind of shutdown at a time of their choosing.

""Could there be others?"" said McCool, ""It'd be unwise to think that there's not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States.""

In this article

BYD has a backup plan if it gets cut off from the Nvidia chips it currently uses in its cars, a top executive at the Chinese electric carmaker told CNBC on Tuesday.

Stella Li, executive vice president at BYD, said the company had not received any directive from the Chinese government to stop using Nvidia chips — but if it did, it has a plan B.

""Everybody has a backup. BYD has [a] backup,"" Li told CNBC's Dan Murphy.

Li declined to expand on what the plan is, but she pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic during which there was a global shortage of semiconductors which badly affected the auto sector. BYD had ""no issue"" at the time because it developed a lot of its technology in-house, he said, so it was able to source alternatives quickly.

Indeed, BYD has sought to have control over large parts of its supply chain, from manufacturing its own cars to developing its own batteries.

""We have a lot of strong ... even deeper technology in-house, so we always have backup,"" Li said.

Nvidia, whose chips underpin much of the world's artificial intelligence development, has been caught in the crossfire amid U.S.-China tensions. The company's H20 AI chip — designed specifically to comply with U.S. export restrictions to China — was first banned, then permitted to be sold in China this year after a revenue-share deal between Washington and Nvidia.

Now, China has reportedly been discouraging local tech firms from buying Nvidia's AI chips.

Nvidia designs an entirely different set of semiconductors for cars, however.

One of Nvidia's systems, Nvidia Drive AGX Orin, is designed to enable cars to carry out some driving tasks autonomously. BYD is a customer of this product.

There is no indication so far that the Chinese government is looking to ban this Nvidia system.

Li said BYD had not been told to stop using any Nvidia products, adding it was unlikely that Beijing would ban the U.S. firm's auto chips.

""I don't think any country will do that, because this automatic will kill Nvidia,"" Li said. ""So Nvidia now is the highest market value company, so if they lose the big market from China ... nobody wants to see this.""

In this article

Crypto infrastructure startup Zerohash has raised $104 million in funding with backing from financial firms including Morgan Stanley and SoFi, CNBC has learned.

The Series D round was led by Interactive Brokers, the global automated trading firm, and includes strategic investors who are also clients of Zerohash, founder and CEO Edward Woodford told CNBC in an interview. The company is valued at $1 billion, he said.

""We wanted to raise from the largest, most trusted brands in the world and have that be the bridge into this new technology,"" he said.

Funds managed by Apollo also participated in the round, according to Zerohash.

The startup is among a wave of firms, both publicly traded and privately held, taking advantage of the more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump.

After Trump took office this year, the government flipped from being highly skeptical of crypto under former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to embracing it as a nascent technology.

Suddenly, the CEOs of financial firms including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were expressing confidence that they would get involved. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto told CNBC in April that he was ready to bring crypto trading back after the regulatory shift.

Founded in 2017, Zerohash provides banks and fintech firms with the ability to offer blockchain-based products in three major areas: crypto trading, stablecoins and tokenization, according to Woodford.

""Part of this raise is obviously accelerating [adoption] across all three of those verticals with a range of customers who are also investors,"" he said.

Interactive Brokers already uses Zerohash for crypto trading and custody and will launch a stablecoin product with the firm, Woodford said.

While Woodford said he couldn't comment on whether Morgan Stanley and SoFi were also clients, he suggested announcements will be coming. Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and SoFi declined to comment.

""These groups aren't VCs,"" Woodford said. ""You can assume that there's obviously a couple of announcements coming down the road with these other investors.""

Later Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said in a memo obtained by CNBC that it was close to offering crypto trading though its E-Trade division with the help of Zerohash.

Tom Brady struck a partnership with robotic massage device maker Aescape to provide the company with exclusive rights to his recovery and longevity protocols, Aescape announced on Tuesday.

As part of the deal Brady has been given the title of chief innovation officer for the company. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Brady's business partner Alex Spiro will also join Aescape, as a strategic advisor. They will support both product development and Aescape's growth into capital markets, the company said.

Brady, a 7-time Super Bowl champion, played in the NFL until age 45 and is arguably one of the best quarterbacks to ever play in the league. He attributes much of his success and longevity to his training and recovery efforts. Aescape will work with the MVP to integrate his daily routines into its personalized robotics platform.

""After 23 years playing professionally, there's no way I could have accomplished what I did professionally without all the massage work and recovery protocols,"" Brady told CNBC. ""The reason why I'm still able to do what I love to do is because of the bodywork, the care that I received on a daily and weekly basis, and I want to try to make that available for everybody.""

Aescape was founded in 2017 by entrepreneur Eric Litman. The New York-based company uses AI technology to provide a fully automated and customizable massage. It has more than 100 locations and has delivered more than 25,000 massages using its automated robots.

Aescape's partners include high-end fitness company Equinox and select Four Seasons, Marriott, and Ritz-Carlton hotel properties across North America. The company is backed by $130 million in funding from investors that include Valor Siren Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, BroadLight Capital, Crosslink Capital and AlleyCorp.

""Our bodies are these machines that need significant ongoing maintenance, and with better maintenance and better care, they can last substantially longer,"" said Litman, Aescape's CEO.

Litman said he has seen firsthand the growth of massages in consumers' habits. He said Aescape is an attractive option for many customers because it's lower in cost (starting around $30 per service), you don't have to shower before or after a session, and treatments can be shorter than a traditional massage.

For Spiro, an investor and attorney, the focus is on Aescape's scale and growth plan — whether it's in the football training room, internationally or one day getting massage robots into people's homes.

""As the machine's price comes down and this company becomes better known, it will democratize access so that everyday people can use it, get their backs better, return to work, and allow us to do something really good for society,"" he said.

In this article

Amazon and the Federal Trade Commission are squaring off in a long-awaited trial over whether the company duped users into paying for Prime memberships.

The lawsuit, filed by the FTC in June 2023 under the Biden administration, alleges that Amazon deceived tens of millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription program and sabotaged their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.

The trial is being held in a federal court in Seattle, Amazon's backyard. Jury selection began Monday and opening arguments are slated for Tuesday, with the trial expected to last about a month.

Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. Data has shown that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.

Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos famously said the company wanted Prime ""to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.""

Regulators argue Amazon broke competition and consumer protection laws by tricking customers into subscribing to Prime. They pointed to examples like a button on its site that instructed users to complete their transaction and did not clearly state they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription.

""Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent, but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers,"" the agency wrote in a court filing last week.

The FTC says the cancellation process is equally confusing, requiring users to navigate four webpages and choose from 15 options — a ""labyrinthian mechanism"" that the company referred to internally as ""Iliad,"" referencing Homer's epic poem about the Trojan War.

Amazon has argued that the Prime sign-up and cancellation processes are ""clear and simple,"" adding that the company has ""always been transparent about Prime's terms.""

""Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,"" the company wrote in a recent court filing. ""Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.""

The FTC notched an early win in the case last week when U.S. District Court Judge John Chun ruled Amazon and two senior executives violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by gathering Prime members' billing information before disclosing the terms of the service.

Chun also said that the two senior Amazon executives would be individually liable if a jury sides with the FTC due to the level of oversight they maintained over the Prime enrollment and cancellation process.

Amazon's Prime boss, Jamil Ghani, and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in its health division who previously oversaw Prime's technology and business operations, are named defendants in the complaint.

Russell Grandinetti, Amazon senior vice president of international consumer, is also named in the suit, but Chun argued he had ""less involvement in the operation of the Prime organization"" compared with Ghani and Lindsay.

Chun also scolded attorneys for Amazon in July for withholding thousands of documents from the FTC and abusing a legal privilege to shield them from scrutiny. Among the documents was a 2020 email where Amazon's retail chief, Doug Herrington, said ""subscription driving"" was a ""shady"" practice and referred to Bezos as the company's ""chief dark arts officer.""

Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay told CNBC in a statement, ""The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong — we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.""

The company also faces a separate lawsuit brought by the FTC in 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. That case is set to go to trial in February 2027.

The Prime case is part of the FTC's broader crackdown on so-called dark patterns, which it began examining in 2022. The phrase refers to deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward buying products or services or giving up their privacy.

The agency brought a similar dark patterns lawsuit against Uber in April, accusing the ride-hailing and delivery company of deceptive billing and cancellation practices tied to its Uber One subscription service. Uber has disputed the FTC's allegations.

Earlier this year, it reached settlements with online dating service Match and online education firm Chegg over claims that their subscription practices were deceptive or hard to cancel.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin had kind words for Coinbase's incubated L2 Base on Tuesday, saying the network is “doing things the right way.”

Buterin argued the network has been using its centralized aspects to provide better UX for users while still relying on Ethereum's decentralized base layer for security.

“I feel like many people have been confused by recent cynicism and think that things like L2Beat are a weird sort of nerd-sharia compliance authority,” Buterin added. “This is NOT what is going on. The security that L2s provide, that L2Beat measures, reflects concrete properties that protect you as a user from being rugged.”

An L2, or layer-2, is a network built on top of another blockchain—in this case, Ethereum. They're designed to process transactions in batches off of a mainnet, usually faster and cheaper, and then send confirmation back to the L1.

After debuting in August 2023, the network has grown to hold $15 billion worth of assets. That's not an all-time high, though. In January, May, and a few times over the summer, the total value of assets on the network has inched above $16 billion.

Other popular Ethereum L2s include Arbitrum and Optimism. In fact, Base was built with the OP Stack, which is the open source tech framework developed by Optimism.

Despite using an open source tech stack, Base has still been criticized for having been incubated by a centralized exchange. One of the common narratives has been that because it's centralized, Base could theoretically steal all user funds.

Base is doing things the right way: an L2 on top of Ethereum, that uses its centralized features to provide stronger UX features, while still being tied into Ethereum's decentralized base layer for security.

Base does not have custody over your funds, they cannot steal funds or… https://t.co/0EMdThg4gU

— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) September 22, 2025



“Base CAN instantly steal ALL user funds,” wrote CyberCapital founder and CIO Justin Bons in response to Buterin's praise on X. “The SC admin key is controlled by a “security council.”

Buterin highlighted the popular L2 analytics project, L2Beat, which tracks security, throughput, and active users on L2 networks. When Base proponents have used data on the site to defend the network, detractors instead turned to criticizing the L2 data project.

“This is what we mean when we say that L2s are non-custodial,” Buterin said, “they are extensions of Ethereum, not glorified servers that happen to submit hashes.”

The Ethereum price is back in the spotlight as market analysts and ETH's own founder, Vitalik Buterin, outline bold predictions for the asset. While experts forecast that Ethereum could surge to $33,000, Buterin draws parallels between the cryptocurrency's future role in finance and Google's dominance in search. As a result, the ETH founder has suggested that low-risk Decentralized Finance (DeFi) may become Ethereum's breakthrough “Google Moment.” 

Ethereum Price Projected To Soar To $33,000

A recent chart analysis by prominent market expert Egrag Crypto paints an optimistic picture for Ethereum's long-term price trajectory. Based on the analyst's chart, ETH could potentially rise to $33,000 before the end of 2025. 

Egrag Crypto notes that ETH has a history of overshooting measured targets once it breaks out of major continuation patterns. This trend has been visible across previous market cycles, lending weight to his previous projection that the next ETH rally could be monumental.

In Ethereum's earlier cycles, key formations, such as the Bull Flag and the Rectangle Continuation Pattern, produced extraordinary gains that exceeded expectations. The Bull Flag pattern overshot its target by 145%, while the rectangle continuation exceeded projections by an even greater 181%. 

Now, ETH is forming what Egrag Crypto identifies as a Descending Broadening Wedge, a setup that typically signals bullish continuation once the breakout is confirmed. According to the expert, the measured move from this wedge suggests an initial price target of $12,300. However, when factoring in Ethereum's historical tendency to overshoot by an average of 163%, he sees the cryptocurrency skyrocketing as high as $33,000. 

Low-Risk DeFi To Unlock ETH's ‘Google Moment'

In a report published on September 21, Buterin describes what he sees as Ethereum's upcoming Google moment. Just as Google secured long-term dominance by finding its core economic driver in search and ads, the crypto founder argues that Ethereum now has the opportunity to anchor its ecosystem with low-risk DeFi and unlock comparable growth. 

Buterin also emphasized the growing importance of sustainable applications within the Ethereum ecosystem. Historically, ETH has struggled to balance two distinct categories of applications—those that generated significant revenue like NFTs and meme coins, and those that aligned with Ethereum's broader vision, such as decentralized identity and privacy protocols. 

Buterin notes that the underlying issue was that revenue-generating applications often lacked long-term sustainability, while mission-driven projects lacked economic weight. He believes that low-risk DeFi could be the solution that bridges this gap. By enabling global, permissionless access to stable wealth-building mechanisms such as interest-bearing assets, bonds, and currencies, the crypto founder highlighted that Ethereum could achieve economic sustainability. 

He also expressed hope that Ethereum could potentially surpass Google's legacy. Buterin mentioned that Google was often criticized for straying from its core mission and becoming an antisocial, profit-maximizing corporation. However, ETH is fundamentally different, with decentralization embedded deeply at both technical and social levels.

Oops, something went wrong

Morgan Stanley is joining with crypto and stablecoin infrastructure firm Zerohash to enable customers of the Wall Street giant's E*Trade online brokerage platform to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the company confirmed to Decrypt on Tuesday.

New York-based Morgan Stanley may expand to other digital assets and is planning to offer wallet services. The bank referred Decrypt to an article by Bloomberg, which first reported the news. Crypto trading services are expected to begin in the first half of 2026, according to the report.

“The underlying technology has been proven and blockchain-based infrastructure is obviously here to stay,” Jed Finn, Morgan Stanley's head of wealth management, told Bloomberg. ""Clients should have access to digitized assets, traditional assets, and cryptocurrencies, all in the same ecosystem that they're used to.”

Morgan Stanley has been among a number of traditional finance firms aiming to bolster their crypto offerings in recent years. In January, the firm's CEO and Chairman Ted Pick told CNBC  that the bank would work with regulators to see how they could offer crypto services safely.

Last year, Morgan Stanley greenlit financial advisors promoting the then-fledgling spot Bitcoin ETFs to clients, and in 2021 offered wealthy clients access to Bitcoin investment funds.

In its second quarter this year, online trading platform Robinhood generated $160 million in crypto trading revenue during the second quarter, a 98% increase from a year ago, despite headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's global trade war.

Last year, brokerage and advisory Charles Schwab's then incoming CEO Rick Wurster said that the firm planned to enter the spot crypto market once U.S. regulations provided clearer pathways. Schwab currently offers exposure to crypto via ETFs and mutual funds.

In a statement shared with Decrypt, Zerohash CEO Edward Woodford said that ""Morgan Stanley's strategic stake in Zerohash underscores the critical role infrastructure plays... in digital finance.""

""This partnership represents a major step forward in bringing digital asset technology into the mainstream, and we're proud to unlock its potential for institutions and their clients around the world,” Woodford said.

In a statement, Zerohash CFO Adam Berg said that financial giants are lining up to dive into crypto.

What the $1.25 Billion Bitcoin Futures Flush Means for Markets

“Every financial institution is looking to provide access to the crypto asset class and innovate with this technology at scale,” said Berg. “I've recently met with multiple large bank CEOs and financial services executives, many of whom said that they are spending more than 50% of their time driving on-chain innovation at their firms.""

Separately, Morgan Stanley was among multiple investors to participate in a $104 million Series D venture capital round for Hashdex, according to a press release.

Hashdex has raised a total of $275 million over multiple rounds. Brokerage Interactive Brokers led the latest round, with participation from SoFi and Jump Crypto along with Morgan Stanley and others.

The crypto market has experienced a notable downturn over the past week, and is trading flat on the day. However, a handful of altcoins are defying this move, with some even posting double-digit gains on the day.

The biggest winner of the day is Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, which climbed 12.1% on the day to a $5.9 billion market cap as the 37th largest cryptocurrency. The double-digit jump follows Mantle's partnership with centralized exchange Bybit, which offers higher leverage rates and better loan terms for institutional investors.

Another notable altcoin winner is Avalanche, which jumped 10.7% on the day and 12% over the past week to a $14.5 billion market cap, making it the 15th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko. It comes the day after a Bitcoin mining firm rebranded to AVAX One and bought $550 million worth of the token in a digital asset treasury pivot, causing its stock to leap 200%.

On top of this, Avalanche recorded $4.29 billion in trading volume on Monday and $4.46 billion on Friday, the highest for the token since December 2023, per CoinGlass. On Monday, AVAX experienced a spot daily inflow of $6.67 million and a futures daily inflow of $80.44 million.

No other top 100 cryptocurrency outside of Mantle and Avalanche has made a double-digit move.

Another cryptocurrency posting significant gains is Aster, a new perpetual futures decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, which has been tipped to rival the ever-popular Hyperliquid. Its ASTER token has jumped 7% in the past 24 hours, taking it to a $2.8 billion market cap and making it the 56th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko.

Aster's move appears to be tied to the exchange's total value locked spiking from $378 million last week to $1.46 billion at the time of writing, per DefiLlama. It also claims to have hit $6 billion in perp trading volume on Monday.

Users of Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, believe that Aster has a 67% chance of continuing its move upwards from $1.70 to $2 by the end of the month.

The fourth largest gainer of the day is AI project NEAR (up 4.2%), followed by Cronos' CRO (up 4.2%), and layer-1 network Stellar (up 3.3%).

Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading flat following a dramatic start to the week which saw $1.6 billion worth of liquidations across the crypto market on Monday.

This article breaks down five key altcoins — Ethereum, Solana, Ripple (XRP), Litecoin, and one emerging name — that financial advisors should have on their radar. You'll learn what makes these projects stand out in terms of utility, institutional interest, and long-term potential, and why understanding them helps advisors speak to clients with confidence in a market that extends well beyond Bitcoin.

When most clients think of crypto, they think of Bitcoin. And for good reason: it's the original, the largest by market cap, and the “digital gold” narrative is widely understood.

But the crypto market isn't a one-asset story anymore. Beyond Bitcoin, there's a over trillion altcoin universe, and your clients have heard of it. They're reading about Ethereum staking, seeing news about Ripple's bank partnerships, or asking about Solana's speed.

For advisors, that means one thing: you need to know the big names, and what they actually represent.

Here are five altcoins every advisor should understand — and how they might fit into conversations about allocation, risk, and opportunity.

If Bitcoin is digital gold, Ethereum is digital infrastructure.

Ethereum is not only a cryptocurrency but a platform behind decentralized finance (DeFi) and a growing web of blockchain-based applications. Developers build on Ethereum the way startups once built on the internet. Financial institutions can use it to issue assets (debts, money market funds…) or equivalent of cash (stablecoins) as tokens. This is also the infrastructure used by many secondary networks (such as Sony's Soneium, Coinbase's Base, Sam Altman's World) to settle their transactions, which makes it essential to the development of the ecosystem. 

For advisors, two points stand out:

Clients who want to go “beyond Bitcoin” often start with ETH, and advisors who can explain why it matters will lead those conversations.

Think of Solana as Ethereum's faster, cheaper rival.

Solana's claim to fame is transaction speed and cost efficiency. It can process thousands of transactions per second with low fees, making it attractive for payment networks, decentralized apps, and next-generation DeFi.

It's also volatile: the network has faced outages and critics. But Solana has rebounded strongly, attracting big-name projects and even interest from traditional finance.

For advisors, Solana represents:

Like Ethereum, Solana is used by financial institutions, notably to issue securities and stablecoins. 

Ripple is unique because it's trying to connect banks, not to replace them.

XRP, Ripple's token, is used in cross-border payments and settlement solutions, targeting inefficiencies in the SWIFT system.

For advisors, the key talking points are:

Clients might ask if XRP is “the banker's crypto.” Advisors should know enough to say: it's a bridge asset aiming to improve how global payments work.

Litecoin has been around since 2011 and it's easy to dismiss it as “old news.” But LTC has staying power. It's technically similar to Bitcoin (a capped supply, proof-of-work), but designed for faster and cheaper payments.

Why advisors should care:

For conservative clients exploring altcoins, Litecoin might be one of the least controversial entry points.

Finally, advisors should keep an eye on emerging names that are gaining developer and institutional traction. That's where Sui (SUI) comes in.

Launched by former Meta engineers from the team that developed the Diem blockchain project, Sui is designed to tackle two of crypto's biggest pain points: scalability and user experience. Its architecture enables parallel transaction processing — meaning it can handle a huge number of operations at once  and offers fast finality (transactions are confirmed in seconds). This is critical for applications like gaming, payments, and NFTs, where speed and smooth UX are non-negotiable.

It's an ecosystem being built with institutional-grade standards in mind.

Bitcoin will always be the anchor of most crypto discussions. But clients don't stop there — and neither should advisors.

Understanding Ethereum, Solana, Ripple, Litecoin, and one or two emerging names such as Sui allows advisors to:

Advisors don't need to recommend every altcoin under the sun  but knowing the five that matter most builds credibility and opens the door to better, more confident crypto conversations.

Altcoins are facing a crucial test after the broader crypto market experienced a sharp selloff triggered by leveraged liquidations. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, slipped below the $4,200 level, signaling weakness across the sector. Meanwhile, Solana and several other major altcoins shed more than 10% of their value within hours, underscoring the speed and intensity of the correction.

This wave of liquidations has fueled debate among investors and analysts about whether the market is entering a deeper corrective phase or simply resetting before another leg higher. With billions of dollars wiped from altcoin valuations in a single session, the event has heightened uncertainty and left traders on edge.

Top analyst Maartunn highlighted that the Altcoin flush accelerates, pointing to the scale of liquidations as evidence that overleveraged positions are being forced out of the market. While painful in the short term, such resets are often viewed as healthy for long-term price stability, flushing out excess speculation.

According to data shared by top analyst Maartunn, altcoins faced one of their most severe flushes in months as $8.0 billion in open interest was wiped out in a matter of hours. By comparison, Bitcoin saw a much smaller reduction of around $1.5 billion, highlighting the disproportionate impact the selloff had on altcoins. This means that traders, many of whom were highly leveraged, bore the brunt of the liquidation event.

The scale of the wipeout is telling. Altcoin open interest losses were more than five times greater than Bitcoin's, suggesting that speculative positions in the sector were far riskier and more vulnerable to sharp downside moves. While Bitcoin remains the market's anchor, the gap between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market is beginning to close, reflecting a shift in positioning and risk exposure.

For investors, this raises important questions. On one hand, such a dramatic flush often clears excess leverage from the system, paving the way for healthier price action in the medium term. On the other hand, the sheer scale of the altcoin losses could signal lingering fragility and the potential for further volatility if confidence does not return quickly.

The coming days will be decisive. Analysts are watching closely to see whether altcoins can stabilize around key support levels or whether bearish pressure will drive another leg lower. With Bitcoin showing relative resilience, altcoins must now prove they can withstand the shock and rebuild momentum in a market still reeling from billions in liquidations.

The chart of the total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 coins shows that the altcoin sector is at a decisive moment. Currently valued at around $305 billion, the market has recovered significantly from the lows of 2022 and 2023 but remains far from its historical peak above $600 billion.

Price action highlights that after a prolonged consolidation, altcoins have established a steady uptrend, supported by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are now sloping upward. The 200-day moving average has flattened and begun to turn positive, further signaling improving structure in the broader market. Still, the recent rejection near the $320 billion resistance shows sellers remain active at higher levels.

The market's ability to sustain above $280 billion will be critical for maintaining bullish momentum. A break below could trigger deeper retracements, but holding above this zone suggests strength and potential for expansion.

Excluding top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this index reflects rising investor appetite for smaller-cap projects. The resilience of this sector despite recent volatility signals that risk appetite is returning. If broader conditions improve, altcoins outside the top 10 could lead the next phase of market growth.

Fnality, a fintech firm building tokenized versions of major currencies collateralized by cash held at central banks, has raised $136 million in a Series C round to expand its blockchain-based wholesale payment systems, the London-based firm said Tuesday.

The investment was led by WisdomTree, Bank of America, Citi, KBC Group, Temasek and Tradeweb, with existing backers including Goldman Sachs, UBS and Barclays also participating.

Fnality raised $95 million in 2023, a round led by Goldman and BNP Paribas. The firm's settlement infrastructure runs on distributed ledger technology and allows sterling payments to be processed on-chain with central bank money. 

The new capital will go toward rolling out similar systems in other currencies, enhancing liquidity management tools and supporting settlement of tokenized assets such as securities and stablecoins, according to a press release.

The firm's offering enables real-time settlement of trades, delivery-versus-payment for digital securities, and payment-versus-payment for foreign exchange. For banks, that could mean fewer intermediaries, faster settlement and more efficient use of capital. For example, a repo trade that typically takes a day to settle could close instantly, freeing up cash for other transactions.

Fnality CEO Michelle Neal said the funding marks a step toward “a hybrid future of global finance,” where traditional institutions interact seamlessly with decentralized markets. Backers such as WisdomTree and Bank of America framed the investment as part of a broader shift to modernize financial infrastructure for tokenized assets.

 Centralized deepfake detectors are failing against crypto scams. Blockchain-based detection networks offer the only scalable defense against AI fraud. 

Opinion by: Ken Miyachi, founder of BitMind

Centralized deepfake detectors are structurally misaligned, brittle and falling behind. The crypto industry needs a crypto-native defense — decentralized detection networks that reward many independent model providers for catching real-world fakes and record those judgments onchain. 

The result: Transparency and composable use across exchanges, wallets and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Q1 alone saw $200 million stolen through deepfake scams, with over 40% of high-value crypto fraud now attributed to AI-generated impersonations. 

As criminals use deepfakes to bypass KYC processes and impersonate executives in fraudulent transfers, the crypto industry faces an existential threat that centralized detection systems cannot solve.

The core failure is architectural. 

Centralized detectors are conflicted and siloed, with vendor-locked systems detecting their model outputs best while missing others. When the same companies build both generators and detectors, the incentives become blurred. These detectors are static and slow as opposed to their decentralized counterparts, and train against last month's tricks as adversaries iterate in real-time.

Crypto cannot outsource this to the same closed systems that deepfakes outpace without expecting the same pitfalls. It's time to change that mentality and shift to decentralized detection networks.

Law enforcement agencies across Asia dismantled 87 deepfake scam rings, which used AI-generated deepfakes to impersonate figures like Elon Musk and government officials. The scams have evolved to include live deepfake impersonations during video calls, where fraudsters pose as blockchain executives to greenlight unauthorized transactions. 

For example, Strategy executive chairman, Michael Saylor, last year warned that his team removes approximately 80 fake AI-generated YouTube videos impersonating him daily, promoting bogus Bitcoin giveaways via QR codes, highlighting how persistent these attacks are on social platforms.

Bitget CEO Gracy Chen said it herself, “The speed at which scammers can now generate synthetic videos, coupled with the viral nature of social media, gives deepfakes a unique advantage in both reach and believability.”

When traditional detection tools achieve only 69% accuracy on real-world deepfakes, it creates a massive blind spot that criminals exploit. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently warned of an “impending fraud crisis” because AI has “defeated most authentication methods.” The crypto industry needs solutions that evolve as quickly as the threats themselves.

These vulnerabilities even extend to emotional manipulation, as seen in AI-powered romance scams where deepfakes and chatbots fabricate personal relationships to extract funds. 

The fundamental problem lies in trusting major AI companies to self-regulate their own outputs amid political and economic pressures. Google's SynthID only detects content from its own Gemini system, ignoring deepfakes from competing tools. Conflicts of interest become inevitable when the same companies that create generative AI also control detection systems.

A March 2025 study found that even the best centralized detectors dropped from 86% accuracy on controlled data sets to just 69% on real-world content. These static systems train once on existing databases and expect to work forever, but criminals adapt faster than centralized authorities can respond.

Decentralized detection networks represent true blockchain principles applied to digital security. Just as Bitcoin solved the double-spending problem by distributing trust, decentralized detection solves the authenticity problem by distributing verification across competing miners. 

Platforms can enable this approach by creating incentive mechanisms where AI developers compete to build superior detection models.

The crypto-economic rewards automatically direct talent toward the most effective solutions, with participants compensated based on their models' actual performance against real-world deepfakes. This competitive framework has demonstrated significantly higher accuracy on diverse content compared to centralized alternatives, achieving results that static systems cannot match.

A decentralized verification approach becomes essential as the generative AI will become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, requiring scalable authentication mechanisms that match AI's rapid development. 

Conventional methods are easily altered or bypassed, while centralized databases are prone to hacks. Only blockchain's immutable ledger provides the transparent, secure foundation to combat the projected surge in AI-driven crypto scams.

Deepfake scams could represent 70% of crypto crimes without decentralized detection protocols by 2026. Attacks like the $11 million OKX account drain via AI impersonation demonstrate how vulnerable centralized exchanges remain to sophisticated deepfake attacks. 

DeFi platforms face particular risk since pseudonymous transactions already complicate verification.

When criminals can generate convincing AI identities for KYC processes or impersonate protocol developers, traditional security measures prove inadequate. Decentralized detection offers the only scalable solution that matches DeFi's trustless principles.

Regulators increasingly demand robust authentication mechanisms from crypto platforms, with decentralized detection networks already offering consumer-facing tools that instantly verify content. Why not work alongside the companies providing auditable, transparent verification that even satisfies the regulatory requirements while maintaining the permissionless innovation that drives blockchain adoption?

The blockchain and cryptocurrency sector faces a critical juncture: either stick to centralized detection systems that inevitably trail criminal ingenuity or adopt decentralized architectures that transform the industry's competitive incentives into a powerful shield against AI-fueled fraud.

Oops, something went wrong

Forget fridge magnets, American Express (NYSE:AXP) is letting users turn their travels into blockchain collectibles that never fade.

​

U.S. cardholders can now earn ""beautifully designed"" digital collectibles that visually represent the countries they visit when they use their cards abroad, Amex announced on Sept. 15. The so-called stamps can be customized with trip highlights and shared with friends and family via text, the company said.

​

Amex said the stamps are stored as NFTs on the Coinbase-incubated (NASDAQ:COIN) Ethereum Layer 2 Base, but have no monetary value and cannot be transferred. It is Amex's second collaboration with Coinbase in recent months. In June, Coinbase announced the Coinbase One Card, an Amex-powered credit card offering users up to 4% cash back in Bitcoin.

​

Meanwhile, Institutional digital asset custody solution provider Fireblocks said that it is the wallet-as-a-service provider for Amex Passport stamps, ""enabling Amex to provide Card Members with a blockchain wallet behind the scenes.""

​​

Amex Digital Labs Vice President Colin Marlowe told Benzinga that the company chose to use NFTs for its travel stamps to ensure durability of the collectibles. He also told Benzinga that Amex is covering blockchain fees on behalf of customers without detailing how.

The Amex Passport stamp is part of Amex's effort to enhance the travel experience of its users. The company launched the Amex Travel App on Sept. 18, allowing users to plan and book their trips in one place.

​​

A survey which informed the Amex Travel App showed that 73% of respondents wanted more ways to digitally commemorate their travels and 56% miss receiving passport stamps.

​

But the Amex Passport stamps are also accessible in the standard Amex mobile application.​ The Amex Passport stamp offers yet another instance highlighting Web3's subtle integration into the mainstream.

This book review is a web exclusive for the Fall 2025 issue of The Independent Review.

Policymakers and commentators increasingly propose central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to address shortcomings in the payments system. In leading models, the currency is a direct liability of the central bank, which acts as the main intermediary over state-run payment rails. Advocates argue that CBDCs would address several issues with the traditional monetary system, especially financial exclusion and delayed settlement.

The shortfalls of modern payments closely resemble issues often noted with social media. Social media platforms exclude users and throttle content—delaying “settlement” with the public. Despite these parallels between payments and posting, calls for state-run payment infrastructure far exceed those for state-run social media. Indeed, I have never seen a proposal for a state-run social media platform. What explains this asymmetry?

The asymmetry, I suspect, springs from an uneven sensitivity to risk and potential abuse. A highly centralized government platform for speech is a nonstarter. But such a platform for spending—what could go wrong? Digital Currency or Digital Control, Nicholas Anthony's new volume, offers a needed corrective to idealistic CBDC proposals that overpromise and would likely under-deliver. Anthony is perhaps uniquely situated to evaluate the rise of CBDC technology, in all its forms and guises. He maintains the Human Rights Foundation's CBDC Tracker, which “documents CBDC development and civil liberties concerns around the world.” In Digital Currency or Digital Control, Anthony subjects CBDCs to sustained scrutiny. The result is fair, rigorously argued, exhaustively researched, and highly readable.

The book offers an overall introduction to and evaluation of CBDCs. It describes the different kinds and defining characteristics of CBDCs, evaluates their alleged advantages, and examines their potential consequences. In the opening chapters, Anthony characterizes CBDCs as direct claims on the central bank. Their designs vary depending on whether and how they route retail transactions over state-controlled digital payment systems (Chapters 1 and 2). He then argues that CBDCs would fail to make good on their promises of improved financial inclusion, faster payment settlement, and more effective monetary policy (Chapter 3). The later chapters argue that CBDCs pose serious risks to financial privacy (Chapters 4 and 7), individual liberty (Chapter 5), market integrity (Chapter 6), and even central banking itself (Chapter 8). He concludes cynically, but plausibly, that “the only ‘benefit' of CBDCs accrues to governments seeking to solidify their control over money and finance” (87). The final chapter ends with a call to raise awareness and pass legislation that prohibits CBDCs. Sample legislative language appears in one of the three informative appendices.

Against the pro-CBDC argument from financial inclusion, Anthony correctly notes that CBDCs would not “bank the unbanked” since CBDCs exist to facilitate payments, not banking services (17). Anthony also cites FDIC survey data to argue that few of the unbanked would find a CBDC attractive. For example, many cite a lack of trust in private banks as a reason for self-exclusion from banking services. So how would a CBDC help? Overall people tend to trust the government even less than private banks (18 ff.).

On whether CBDCs would improve transaction settlement, existing infrastructures already enable near-instant payments for retail users, leaving little for CBDCs to improve. Stablecoins, in particular, provide near-instant settlement over global, permissionless payment networks that operate 24/7/365 with low fees. They require neither minimum balances nor documentation—common obstacles to financial inclusion according to FDIC survey data. It's not clear that the government could build an equally performant system without substantial cost or repealing current rules that require customer documentation. In 2023, the UK's HM Treasury advertised a listing for the Head of Central Bank Digital Currency with a salary range between £61,260-£66,500. Could such a salary attract top talent?

Proponents of CBDCs often claim that central banks could use them to spur spending through negative interest rates and fine-tune the economy at the level of individuals. The thought is that governments could use the threat of diminishing value to induce payments for goods and services. But we now have access to alternative savings vehicles like foreign currencies, stablecoins, and Bitcoin. So, as Anthony notes, governments would likely need to ban on-ramps to these for negative rates to work as intended. Moreover, using CBDCs for targeted interventions would require collecting user-level financial data. This would threaten financial privacy and alienate many of the unbanked, who cite “financial privacy” as their second-most common reason for avoiding private banks (FDIC). Although the White House in 2022 claimed that a CBDC could “safeguard the privacy of sensitive data,” the next sentence says that a CBDC “could support the effectiveness of sanctions.” These goals stand in tension with one another.

To appreciate the threat CBDCs pose to financial privacy, consider how uneasy we already feel about the separate buckets of personal data harvested by social media and AI companies. Now imagine consolidating all that data into a single honeypot on government servers—exploitable by malicious hackers, rogue bureaucrats, and authoritarian politicians. CBDCs would expose citizens in similarly dangerous ways.

As Anthony argues, our payments data tell detailed stories about the whats, whos, wheres, whens, and whys of our economic lives. In a single-tier system where the central bank both issues the currency and settles retail transactions, the government would need to collect user data for exactly the same reasons private banks and payments processors do, to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act and various Know-Your-Customer and Anti-Money Laundering rules.

Cypherpunk Nick Szabo famously says that trusted parties are security holes. But they are nonetheless also security buffers, as Anthony argues in Chapter 7. By consolidating several trusted parties into one—the central bank—CBDCs consolidate potential points of failure. The centralization of data and network functionality exposes citizens to data breaches and outages. Many CBDC proposals also include built-in programmability for restricting locations, times, and types of transactions. This centralization of power also exposes citizens to government abuse. Even if today's officials act responsibly, the historical record offers no assurance that tomorrow's will.

A single-tier CBDC would also compete with private banks and payments providers. Here, Anthony presents William Luther's “CBDC tradeoff”: insofar as CBDCs prove useful, they drain banks of liquidity; but insofar as they prove useless, they waste public money. A potentially useful system, then, would need to survive the gauntlet of the banking lobby. Any CBDC that survives Congress would likely emerge limping, scorched, and missing a few parts.

Perhaps, then, governments should integrate the existing banking system into CBDCs. Some scholars, such as Easwar Prasad, have proposed such a two-tiered model where the currency remains a direct liability of the central bank while private entities serve customers and collect their data (“Central Bank Digital Currencies and the Future of Central Banking,” Cato Journal 41, no. 2 (Spring/Summer 2021): 237–246.). Such a system might sound like the best of all worlds, with banks serving as safeguards for financial privacy and a buffer against government attempts to control and censor. It would also more likely survive Congressional debate since banks would theoretically retain liquidity.

Like Anthony, however, I'm skeptical whether governments would invest in a system that does not ultimately expand their surveillance and control over retail transactions. I'm also not convinced that a proposal like Prasad's would improve enough on leading stablecoins to justify the costs of developing a new payments system. Even if it did in the abstract, governments recently have a poor track record when they try to bring plans into reality. The 2021 US infrastructure bill, for example, reserved $42 billion for high-speed internet access. Years later, zero households have been connected. Or consider FedNow, the Federal Reserve's real-time payments network. Development took five years, and it still processes less volume and fewer payments than the private RTP network.

My only substantial disagreement concerns Anthony's evaluation of Bitcoin's own security against mining attacks, especially so-called 51% attacks. A coalition with 51% of the network's hashrate can double-spend Bitcoin, produce empty blocks, or rewrite recent blocks. Anthony suggests that Bitcoin users could fork the Bitcoin software to create a new network, leaving the old, vulnerable network behind. I'm less convinced now than I once was about the promise or even the wisdom of such a measure. I suspect a significant portion of the network would refuse to migrate either out of principle or from a desire to avoid the appearance of centralization. Splitting the network also carries significant risks—if the market disagrees about which of the resulting networks host the “real” Bitcoin, such a move threatens to weaken Bitcoin overall. I disagree with little else in the book.

Overall, Digital Currency or Digital Control is a concise and forceful critique of CBDCs. Anthony's analysis is especially timely, as governments around the world continue to advance their own designs. With crisp prose and sharply reasoned arguments, the book is brisk, engaging, and well worth reading. I recommend it without reservation—especially to CBDC proponents, who owe it serious attention.

Speaking at a Bloomberg Future of Finance event in Frankfurt, Cipollone said the effort to create a digital euro had a “major breakthrough” last week when relevant finance chiefs reached an agreement on how to set customer holding limits, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The effort now has momentum, Cipollone said, according to the report.

The European Parliament, whose legislation is required to enable the digital euro, is set to receive a progress report on the initiative on Oct. 24 and could vote on the required legislation by May 2026, Cipollone said, per the report.

It was reported Sunday (Sept. 21) that European Union finance ministers agreed on a roadmap for launching a digital euro backed by the European Central Bank and that their input was considered crucial to assuage fears that a digital currency could lead to a run on traditional bank deposits.

In February, it was reported that the European Central Bank was hoping that progress on legislative approval for a digital euro would be spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of dollar-pegged stablecoins.

The European Commission put forward digital euro legislation in June 2023, but progress had been sluggish.

Cipollone said in the February report that Trump's support for stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar introduced another American-driven financial tool and increased the urgency to move forward with a digital euro.

In March, it was reported that European Stability Mechanism Managing Director Pierre Gramegna said that Europe's monetary autonomy and financial stability could be threatened by the Trump administration's interest in cryptocurrencies and dollar-denominated stablecoins.

Gramegna said that in light of the change in the U.S. perception of digital currencies, the ESM believed that “this digital euro is today more necessary than ever.”

Cipollone said Sept. 4 that the European Union should accelerate its efforts to introduce a digital euro, in part because this technology would support resilience and inclusiveness.

A digital euro would complement physical cash, which remains essential for resilience and inclusion, and would provide another universally accepted means of payment, Cipollone said.

“In an increasingly digital world exposed to new geopolitical and operational risks, we must protect the euro's availability for all Europeans at all times,” Cipollone said.

Peter Smith is a former operations manager in online casinos and a consultant for several crypto projects. With deep expertise in crypto, blockchain and iGaming, he writes insightful content on crypto, gambling trends, and player safety.

Stellar blockchain advances significantly by using Hyperledger Cacti to connect with Hyperledger Besu, opening pathways to SWIFT's CBDC sandbox and DTCC's tokenized collateral platform.


        Stellar has traditionally been known for cross-border payments and retail money transfers, but recent developments show the network is expanding into much bigger territory. The blockchain is now positioning itself as serious infrastructure for institutional finance and enterprise-level tokenization systems.
    


        As noted by DoubleAgent-XLM, these connections transform Stellar from a niche blockchain into potential backbone infrastructure for institutional tokenization and settlement systems. The blockchain is quietly securing its place in the infrastructure that could power the future of global finance.
    


        This isn't just a technical upgrade - it fundamentally changes where Stellar fits in the financial world. The network is evolving from handling retail payments to becoming part of the core infrastructure for global finance. Integration with SWIFT and DTCC gives it credibility in regulated markets and positions it for long-term growth as tokenization expands into trillion-dollar markets.
    


        Hyperledger Cacti Integration - Stellar now uses Hyperledger Cacti as a bridge to connect with Hyperledger Besu. This connection, developed by Cheesecake Labs and the Hyperledger Foundation, allows assets to move between Stellar's Soroban and Besu networks. Cacti simplifies the technical complexity, letting developers build applications without worrying about each blockchain's unique architecture. For Stellar, this means it can now work with enterprise Ethereum systems where Besu is already widely used.
    


        SWIFT CBDC Sandbox Access - Through the Cacti bridge, Stellar can now tap into SWIFT's central bank digital currency (CBDC) testing environment. This sandbox has been experimenting with multiple digital currencies including Singapore dollars, Taiwan dollars, Thai baht, and Hong Kong dollars, all running on Besu infrastructure. SWIFT handles the standardized messaging through ISO 20022 protocols. With Stellar connected, XLM could potentially serve as a neutral bridge currency for cross-border CBDC transactions.
    


        DTCC Tokenized Collateral Platform - The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation recently launched a real-time tokenized collateral management system built on Hyperledger Besu. This platform is designed to increase liquidity, speed up collateral movement, and bridge traditional finance with digital assets for high-value institutional flows. Stellar's new connection to Besu creates a direct pathway into this institutional-grade tokenization infrastructure.

Coinbase Derivatives has unveiled a groundbreaking financial product, the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,' marking a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and digital assets. This innovative futures contract offers investors a unique blend of exposure to the dominant ""Magnificent 7"" technology stocks, Coinbase's own equity, and two leading cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) – the iShares Bitcoin Trust and the iShares Ethereum Trust. The introduction of this product is set to reshape investment strategies, providing diversified opportunities within a single, regulated instrument and accelerating the institutional adoption of digital assets.

On September 22, Coinbase Derivatives officially launched its 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures,' a product meticulously designed to bridge the gap between established tech giants and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market. This new index future is composed of ten equally weighted components, which are rebalanced quarterly to maintain balanced exposure. The components include the seven technology titans known as the ""Magnificent 7"": Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Additionally, the index incorporates Coinbase's own stock (NASDAQ: COIN) and two prominent cryptocurrency ETFs: the iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT) and the iShares Ethereum Trust (NASDAQ: ETHA), both managed by BlackRock (NYSE: BLK).

This launch is not merely an expansion of product offerings but a strategic move that addresses a growing demand from institutional investors for regulated, capital-efficient avenues into the digital asset space without the operational complexities of holding individual assets. By combining the stability and growth potential of leading tech stocks with the dynamic, high-growth characteristics of cryptocurrencies, Coinbase Derivatives is providing a streamlined investment vehicle that offers enhanced market diversification. This is the first U.S.-listed futures product to merge such distinct asset classes, signifying a maturation of the digital asset market and its increasing integration into mainstream financial products. The initiative solidifies Coinbase's position as a crucial conduit between traditional financial markets and the Web3 ecosystem.

The significance of this product cannot be overstated. It offers investors a single instrument to gain exposure to two distinct, yet increasingly interconnected, market segments. Tech stocks are often influenced by economic cycles, interest rates, and earnings reports, while crypto assets respond to a different set of drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and network adoption. The integrated approach of the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' allows for more sophisticated risk management and portfolio construction strategies, appealing to a broad spectrum of institutional and sophisticated retail investors seeking to capitalize on innovation across both traditional and digital economies.

The introduction of Coinbase Derivatives' 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' is poised to create significant shifts in market dynamics, producing clear winners and potentially challenging existing players. At the forefront of the beneficiaries is Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) itself. This product not only diversifies its revenue streams but also reinforces its strategic importance as a regulated gateway for institutional capital into the crypto market. By facilitating a more accessible and familiar investment vehicle, Coinbase is likely to attract increased trading volumes and solidify its reputation as an innovator in the financial derivatives space.

Another significant winner is BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), the asset management giant behind the iShares Bitcoin Trust and iShares Ethereum Trust. The inclusion of their ETFs in such a prominent, diversified futures product enhances their visibility and legitimacy within both traditional and digital asset communities. This integration could lead to increased interest and liquidity for their crypto ETF offerings, further validating their strategic foray into the digital asset market. Investors seeking diversified exposure and capital efficiency will also benefit, as the product simplifies portfolio management and risk allocation across previously disparate asset classes. The ""Magnificent 7"" stocks, while already widely held, could see ancillary benefits from increased trading interest from investors leveraging this new index for broader market exposure.

Conversely, some traditional financial institutions that have been slow to adapt to the evolving digital asset landscape might find themselves at a disadvantage. Their inability to offer similar hybrid products could lead to a loss of market share as investors gravitate towards more integrated and efficient solutions. Similarly, highly specialized, niche crypto funds that focus solely on digital assets might face increased competition from a product that offers regulated crypto exposure alongside established tech equities, potentially siphoning off some institutional capital. Purely traditional equity funds might also experience a subtle shift in capital allocation as some investors opt for the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' to achieve diversification that spans both traditional and digital growth sectors.

The launch of the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' represents a crucial step in the ongoing evolution of financial markets, signaling a deeper integration of digital assets into the global financial ecosystem. This event fits squarely within the broader trend of financial institutions seeking to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), offering regulated pathways for institutional capital to flow into cryptocurrencies. It underscores a growing industry consensus that digital assets are not merely a fringe phenomenon but an increasingly integral component of modern investment portfolios.

The ripple effects of this innovation could be substantial. Other exchanges and financial institutions are likely to observe the market's reaction closely, potentially inspiring the development of similar hybrid products. This competitive response could accelerate innovation in derivatives markets, leading to a wider array of cross-asset investment vehicles. The product's success could also set a precedent for future regulatory approaches, demonstrating that complex combinations of traditional and digital assets can be structured and offered within existing regulatory frameworks, thereby fostering greater clarity and confidence for institutional participation.

Historically, the introduction of new derivatives products has often served as a catalyst for market expansion and increased liquidity. Just as early futures contracts for commodities or currencies opened up new avenues for risk management and price discovery, the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' could pave the way for a new generation of sophisticated financial instruments. This product validates the notion that digital assets, when packaged appropriately, can appeal to a broader investor base, moving beyond early adopters to attract mainstream institutional interest and capital.

As the 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' enters the market, several key indicators will warrant close attention from investors, analysts, and industry observers. In the short term, monitoring the trading volumes and liquidity of the new futures contract will be crucial. High trading activity and tight bid-ask spreads would signal strong market acceptance and institutional uptake, indicating that the product is effectively meeting investor demand for diversified exposure. Initial reactions from major institutional players and how they integrate this product into their existing portfolios will also provide valuable insights into its immediate impact.

Looking further ahead, the long-term performance of the index relative to its individual components will be a significant measure of its success. Investors will be keen to assess whether the combined exposure truly offers enhanced diversification and risk-adjusted returns compared to investing in the ""Magnificent 7"" stocks and crypto ETFs separately. The development of similar products by competitors, particularly from other major exchanges or financial powerhouses, will also be a key area to watch, as it could signal a broader industry shift towards hybrid financial instruments. Furthermore, any evolving regulatory responses or guidance related to these combined asset class products could significantly shape the market's trajectory.

From a strategic perspective, this new futures product opens up fresh market opportunities and challenges. It enables new arbitrage strategies between the futures and underlying spot markets, as well as more sophisticated portfolio construction techniques for managing exposure across traditional tech and digital assets. It also presents opportunities for enhanced risk management, allowing investors to hedge against volatility in either segment through a single instrument. Potential scenarios include a rapid increase in institutional capital flow into crypto, driving further innovation in the digital asset space, or a more gradual integration that steadily reshapes traditional investment paradigms.

The launch of Coinbase Derivatives' 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' is a landmark event, representing a significant stride towards a more integrated and diversified financial landscape. This product offers a sophisticated and regulated tool for modern portfolio management, effectively bridging the chasm between the established world of technology equities and the dynamic realm of digital assets. By packaging exposure to the ""Magnificent 7"" tech leaders, Coinbase's own stock, and leading crypto ETFs into a single futures contract, Coinbase has created a compelling offering for investors seeking both growth and diversification in an increasingly interconnected global economy.

This initiative underscores the irreversible trend of digital assets becoming an integral part of global financial strategies. It serves as a powerful testament to the growing maturity and institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, moving them from niche investments to mainstream financial instruments. The 'Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures' is more than just a new product; it is a symbol of financial innovation that caters to the evolving needs of investors in a rapidly changing market.

Investors should closely watch the adoption rates and performance of this new futures contract in the coming months. Its success could not only pave the way for further innovation in hybrid financial products but also influence regulatory frameworks and long-term asset allocation strategies across the industry. The future of investment is increasingly diversified and technologically driven, and Coinbase Derivatives has just provided a powerful new tool to navigate this evolving landscape.","{'href': 'https://markets.financialcontent.com', 'title': 'FinancialContent'}","cryptocurrency"

SEOUL, South Korea: World Liberty Financial will roll out a debit card and retail application “very soon,” co-founder Zak Folkman said during a panel at the ongoing Korea Blockchain Week 2025.

The products are pitched as a way to plug the project's stablecoin USD1 into everyday payments, including Apple Pay integration.

The retail app is meant to merge peer-to-peer transfers with trading features. Both products are expected to form the core of World Liberty's push into consumer markets.

Separately, World Liberty said had it signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korean exchange Bithumb to explore business opportunities, though details of the tie-up remain unclear.

 The new Solana-based Evo stablecoin pegged to Kazakhstan's national currency, the tenge, aims to bridge the crypto market with traditional finance. 

Kazakhstan's central bank launched a pilot project with a new stablecoin pegged to the local fiat currency in collaboration with Solana and Mastercard.

The National Bank of Kazakhstan announced the launch of the stablecoin project within the framework of its Digital Assets Regulatory Sandbox, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Tuesday.

The new Evo (KZTE) stablecoin is pegged to the Kazakhstani tenge currency and is issued by sandbox participant Intebix crypto exchange and local lender Eurasian Bank, with assistance from Solana and Mastercard.

Based on the Solana blockchain, KZTE is immediately live within the central bank's regulatory sandbox, and Mastercard is set to connect KZTE with global stablecoin issuers, Intebix founder Talgat Dossanov told Cointelegraph.

Kazakhstan's Evo stablecoin is described as a “national stablecoin” designed to connect crypto innovation with traditional finance.

Use cases for the KZTE stablecoin include expanding the crypto-fiat channel, enabling cryptocurrency exchange and supporting transactions through crypto cards.

“The project is part of the National Bank's strategy to build a national digital asset ecosystem, fostering innovative digital tools and the development of Kazakhstan's digital asset market,” the announcement noted.

While the Evo stablecoin is technically issued by Intebix and the Eurasian Bank, the National Bank of Kazakhstan is participating in the project by providing a regulatory regime to allow its issuance and testing.

“It's still the first case where the central bank is taking a proactive role in the issuance of the stablecoin,” Dossanov told Cointelegraph.

“Today, we are launching Kazakhstan's first stablecoin denominated in our national currency, the tenge, within the National Bank's regulatory sandbox,” National Bank Governor Timur Suleimenov reportedly said during the Evo opening event on Tuesday.

Suleimenov emphasized that the digital age presents both challenges and opportunities, with digital assets and blockchain technology playing a central role in delivering new services, enhancing financial inclusion and driving the country's overall advancement.

Kazakhstan's Evo stablecoin launch comes in line with the country's ambitious digital asset agenda, including exploring the concept of a state-run crypto reserve.

In early September, Kazakhstan's Astana Financial Services Authority officially authorized the use of USD-pegged stablecoins including Tether USDt (USDT) for payment of license and supervision fees.

Kazakhstan has also emerged as a global leader in Bitcoin (BTC) mining, becoming one of the biggest BTC mining countries by the mining hashrate distribution in 2022, with a share of 13%.

Kazakhstan has also been making moves with a central bank digital currency (CBDC), launching the digital tenge in November 2023. The initiative has brought significant improvements to VAT reimbursement processing, the National Bank's chief digital officer said last year.

 Major RWA tokenization platform Securitize has partnered with Ripple to enable RLUSD stablecoin off-ramps for tokenized funds by BlackRock and VanEck. 

Ripple and the tokenization platform Securitize have integrated the Ripple USD stablecoin as an off-ramp for tokenized funds by major crypto investment firms BlackRock and VanEck.

Ripple and Securitize launched a smart contract allowing holders of BlackRock's USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) and VanEck's Treasury Fund (VBILL) to exchange their tokenized shares for the Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin.

The smart contract allows BUIDL and VBILL investors to instantly exchange their shares for RLUSD at any time, enabling additional onchain transfers.

“Partnering with Ripple to integrate RLUSD into our tokenization infrastructure is a major step forward in automating liquidity for tokenized assets,” Securitize co-founder and CEO Carlos Domingo said.

Launched by Ripple in early 2025, the RLUSD stablecoin is designed for enterprise focus and has been accepted by some global authorities for asset tokenization.

In June, the Dubai Financial Services Authority approved RLUSD support in the Dubai Land Department's real estate tokenization initiative.

“Making RLUSD available as an exchange option for tokenized funds is a natural next step as we continue to bridge traditional finance and crypto,” said Jack McDonald, Ripple's senior vice president of stablecoins, adding:

The integration of RLUSD for BlackRock and VanEck's tokenized funds came as tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Securitize accumulated to about $4 billion, according to its website.

BlackRock's BUIDL was the first tokenized fund issued by the firm in March 2024, allowing qualified investors on Securitize to earn US dollar yield by subscribing to the fund.

In one year after launch, BUIDL surpassed $1 billion in assets under management, marking a significant milestone in the growth of the tokenization ecosystem.

VanEck's VBILL fund launched in May 2025, offering investors exposure to tokenized US Treasury-backed assets, initially available on Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum and Solana blockchains.

According to the Securitize website, VBILL currently supports Circle's USDC (USDC) stablecoin and the US dollar for payments of fees and returns.

Cointelegraph approached Securitize for comment regarding other supported off-ramps for the funds, but had not received a response by publication.

 E*Trade will let clients trade Bitcoin, Ether and Solana in 2026, marking Morgan Stanley's entry into crypto with Zerohash support. 

Morgan Stanley's E*Trade will launch cryptocurrency trading in 2026 through a partnership with digital asset infrastructure provider Zerohash — underscoring Wall Street's deepening push into digital assets amid a wave of supportive legislation from the Trump administration.

E*Trade clients will be able to buy Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in the first half of 2026, a Morgan Stanley spokesperson told Reuters.

The announcement confirms a May 1 Bloomberg report that the brokerage planned to add crypto trading next year. At the time, Cointelegraph reported that the initiative was still in early stages as E*Trade sought partnerships with infrastructure providers.

E*Trade was acquired by Morgan Stanley in 2020 for $13 billion. At the time of the deal, the discount brokerage had more than 5.2 million users and offered a retail-focused platform for trading regulated financial securities, focused mainly on US residents. 

Zerohash is not a household name in crypto, but Fortune reported Tuesday that it raised $104 million at a $1 billion valuation in a round led by Interactive Brokers. The company provides crypto trading, tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure for financial institutions and other blockchain adopters. Morgan Stanley also participated in the funding round.

As Bloomberg noted, Zerohash will build a full wallet solution for E*Trade clients.

Perhaps E*Trade's biggest rival in the discount brokerage crypto space is Robinhood, which has rapidly expanded its footprint by offering crypto trading and, more recently, acquiring exchange Bitstamp in a $200 million deal.

While E*Trade's crypto rollout represents one of Morgan Stanley's first direct retail forays into digital assets, the bank has already been deepening its presence in the space.

Since August 2024, Morgan Stanley has allowed its wealth advisers to actively pitch spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds to eligible clients. Earlier this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, CEO Ted Pick said the bank is also exploring the transactional side of crypto.

Interestingly, Morgan Stanley was not among the Wall Street companies reported in May as weighing a joint stablecoin initiative. According to The Wall Street Journal, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were exploring the idea.

Nevertheless, a 2024 paper by Andrew Peel, Morgan Stanley's head of digital asset markets, argued that stablecoins could reinforce the US dollar's global dominance — a view that aligns with recent regulatory efforts to establish clear stablecoin legislation.

That perspective gained traction with the passage of the GENIUS Act, signed into law by US President Donald Trump, which established a comprehensive framework for stablecoin issuers.

 Hackers breached UXLink's multisignature wallet to steal about $30 million in assets and mint 10 trillion UXLINK tokens, but later got nabbed in a phishing scam. 

AI-powered Web3 social platform and infrastructure UXLink saw its crypto token collapse by over 90% after a malicious actor minted billions of unauthorized tokens. 

On Tuesday, the project announced that it had identified a breach involving its multisignature wallet. The company said a significant amount of crypto was being illicitly transferred to centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

UXLink said it had reached out to exchanges to freeze suspicious deposits and reported the incident to law enforcement. In another update, the company confirmed some of the funds had been frozen with the help of exchanges. 

“A large portion of the stolen assets has already been frozen, and collaboration with exchanges remains strong,” UXlink said. 

After confirming the breach, UXLink flagged that the attacker had started the unauthorized minting of tokens. 

Blockchain security company PeckShield said the hacker initially minted 1 billion UXLINK tokens, warning traders to refrain from interacting with the crypto asset. PeckShield said the attackers minted another 1 billion tokens after the first mint. 

After these initial mints, the hacker kept minting UXLINK tokens. Onchain analysts at Hacken estimated that the hacker minted almost 10 trillion tokens.

Despite the massive mint, Hacken said the attacker swapped 9.95 trillion tokens for 16 Ether (ETH), worth about $67,000. The company estimated overall losses from the incident at more than $30 million.

In response to the unauthorized token mints, UXLink publicly reached out to centralized exchanges (CEXs) to temporarily suspend trading of its token. The company also said it will initiate a token swap plan to protect its ecosystem.

As the security incident transpired, the UXLINK token saw a steep decline, dropping 90% from $0.33 to $0.033. At the time of writing, the token had recovered to $0.11. 

Meanwhile, onchain analysis company Lookonchain flagged that while the attacker was busy minting tokens, they lost over 500 billion UXLINK tokens through a phishing attack.

In an update, the company said there were no signs of individual wallets being affected by the attack. However, UXLink urged users to stay alert and follow only the official communication channels as their information source. 

The company said it's working on the token swap plan and will announce it soon. “Further details and instructions for the token swap will be announced shortly,” UXLink wrote. 

In its latest update, UXLink said it had submitted a new smart contract for a security audit. The company said the new contract will have a fixed supply, ensuring that no new tokens will ever be created. 

The company also said it is preparing a comprehensive incident report in collaboration with its security partners.

This Blazing Exoplanet Breaks All the Rules about Alien Atmospheres, JWST Finds

Hot, small and old—exoplanet TOI-561 b is just about the worst place to look for alien air. Scientists using JWST found it there anyway

By Elise Cutts edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

New research suggests a rocky “lava planet” orbiting very close to its star likely carries an atmosphere.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Astronomers found an atmosphere where they least expected it—clinging to an exoplanet that's too small, too hot and too old to have air, at least in theory.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the blazing-hot lava planet TOI-561 b suggest not only that it has a thick atmosphere but also that it may have had one for billions of years. This is the strongest evidence yet for air around a hot rocky world that isn't just a temporary veil of hydrogen and helium left over from planetary formation. The discovery, posted on the preprint server arXiv.org, will soon appear in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

“It's super old and ultrahot. It's the worst conditions,” says the preprint study's co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “This should not have an atmosphere. And it has one.”

Planetary scientist Joshua Krissansen-Totton of the University of Washington, who wasn't involved in the study, agrees. “It is definitely surprising and exciting to find a substantial atmosphere on this hot rocky planet,” he says.

In our solar system, atmospheres obey a simple rule: bigger, cooler worlds hold onto their air, and smaller, warmer ones don't. But TOI-561 b weighs in at just two Earth masses and is very, very hot; the planet orbits so close to its orange dwarf star that its years last less than an Earth day, and its estimated temperature is a rock-melting 2,300 kelvins. TOI-561 b is also about twice as old as our solar system, so its sunblasted atmosphere would have had plenty of time to escape. But researchers suspected the planet might be more than a bare ball of magma because of its unusually low density. And scientists previously spotted air on a bigger hot super-Earth called 55 Cancri e, though the data were “messy and weird,” Krissansen-Totton says.

To check for alien air, the research team used JWST to take TOI-561 b's temperature. The planet is tidally locked, so one side bakes in ceaseless sunshine while the other is always dark. The scientists found that TOI-561 b's sun-soaked dayside was cooler than they had expected for a naked rock—most likely because gas was there to spread the heat around.

The team is “confident” that an atmosphere is the best explanation for the data, says exoplanet astronomer and study co-author Johanna Teske of Carnegie Science. But finding an unexpected atmosphere “is the kind of result that generates more questions than it answers,” she adds.

For one, scientists don't know what TOI-516 b's air is made of or how it survived eons of hellish heat. Lichtenberg thinks the atmosphere most likely bubbled up from the planet's magma ocean. Every planet in our solar system was once molten like TOI-561 b, he points out; this unexpected atmosphere could have a lot to teach us about the origins of our own air.

For Indigenous Infants, This Devastating Virus Finally Meets a Formidable Foe

American Indian and Alaska Native infants experience the highest rates of RSV-related hospitalization in the U.S., but a breakthrough immunization is helping to close the gap

By Suzette Brewer edited by Emily Bazar

Ethel Branch, a citizen of the Navajo Nation (whose people are known as the Diné in their language), faced the dangers of RSV when her son, Patro, battled the virus at age two. She now works to raise awareness about RSV and its effects on the reservation.

King Lawrence

This article is part of “Innovations In: RSV,” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from MSD, Sanofi and AstraZeneca.

At first, Ethel Branch thought her two-year-old son, Patro, had a cold or maybe the flu. But on a chilly day in November 2022, a seemingly common childhood ailment took a hairpin turn that nearly sent him into respiratory failure.

That day, fever, congestion and lethargy set in to the point that Branch took Patro to an emergency room in Winslow, Ariz., where he was diagnosed with croup, given steroids and released.

But the following day, his temperature climbed and his chest began to cave in with each breath. Frantic, Branch rushed Patro to the larger Flagstaff Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), placed on oxygen and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.

“My son got COVID, and it was not that bad,” Branch recalls. “In fact, he didn't even really present symptoms. But with RSV, I couldn't have waited any longer before taking him into the ER because his chest was depressed.”

Patro left the hospital after four days, but his recovery was far from over. Three years later, he still goes to the emergency room for oxygen and breathing treatments every winter.

For Branch, a Harvard-trained lawyer and former attorney general of the Navajo Nation, her son's encounter with RSV was eye-opening. She realized that the dangers of RSV were largely unrecognized—not just by her or the health care workers who initially misdiagnosed him but across her tribal community as well.

Over time, she also learned that her son's experience was shockingly common among Native Americans, especially those on reservations, where lack of infrastructure and multigenerational households make them uniquely vulnerable to this and other illnesses. As a result, American Indian and Alaska Native infants bear the tragic distinction of experiencing the highest rates of RSV-related hospitalization in the country.

After Patro contracted RSV, he spent four days in the pediatric intensive care unit at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona in 2022.

King Lawrence

But one year after Patro's RSV scare, scientific breakthroughs emerged that have begun to bend the RSV curve among young children in Native communities: a monoclonal antibody and a maternal vaccine that can dramatically cut RSV-related hospitalizations among infants.

With a population of more than 400,000, the Navajo Nation (whose people are known as the Diné, pronounced Din-EH, in their language) is the largest federally recognized tribe in the U.S. And its reservation—home to more than 165,000 residents—is the largest in the country, encompassing roughly 27,000 square miles in northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah. With a rich heritage, a distinct language and cultural traditions rooted in family and ties to their land, the Diné remain one of the strongest, most vibrant Indigenous communities in the world.

Throughout their history, the Diné—like many other tribes—have endured devastating epidemics, including smallpox, mumps and pneumonia in the 17th and 18th centuries, which decimated their population. Their forced removal from their lands in 1864, known as the Long Walk, led to deadly outbreaks of measles, dysentery and pneumonia at the Bosque Redondo internment camp at Fort Sumner, N.M. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 3,000 Diné, roughly one quarter of the tribe, according to the Navajo Times.

In his seminal history on the pre-Columbian Americas, author Charles C. Mann noted that none of the major infectious diseases—including smallpox, measles, typhoid, leprosy, bubonic plague, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, diphtheria, influenza and cholera—existed in the Western Hemisphere prior to European contact.

Recognizing the lethality of these diseases, the Europeans turned to biological warfare to destroy and subjugate Native communities by giving them smallpox-infected blankets, clothing and other “gifts,” deliberately spreading the deadly illness among Indigenous populations, according to medical researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece.

Because of their lack of exposure and immunity to these pathogens, scientists and geographers estimate that by the beginning of the 1600s, infectious disease brought to the Americas killed more than 56 million Indigenous people, representing roughly 10 percent of the entire global population at the time. This was one of the deadliest demographic collapses in human history. In some cases, entire tribes became extinct, and their languages, histories and cultural ways died with them.

When COVID arrived in early 2020, tribal nations across North America immediately understood the threat and implemented strict prevention measures, including lockdowns, checkpoints, temperature checks, masking and other methods to protect their communities.

When vaccines became available, tribes became national public health leaders by testing and vaccinating their own members and opening their clinics and hospitals to the general public.

Despite these efforts, tribal communities from Alaska to Maine still experienced some of the highest rates of COVID infection and death in the country. As of January 1, 2025, the Navajo Nation has recorded 93,980 confirmed cases and 2,334 deaths, according to the Navajo Epidemiology Center, and at one point it claimed the highest per capita infection rate nationwide.

But even as COVID captured global attention, a quieter but relentless virus continued to stalk tribal communities, striking Native American infants and toddlers with unmatched severity: RSV.

RSV hospitalization rates among Indigenous infants and toddlers are up to 10 times higher than the rate in the general population.

RSV has been a persistent threat among all tribes. Among them, its effect has been devastating in Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, the Navajo Nation and the White Mountain Apache Reservation in Arizona, where pediatric hospitalization rates are among the highest in the world.

RSV spreads rapidly through droplets, which can be transmitted from person to person via coughing or sneezing, direct human contact such as touching or kissing or contact with a contaminated surface. RSV can survive on hard surfaces for hours.

The virus's spread is often accelerated by living conditions and other socioeconomic factors on Native lands, such as overcrowded housing, limited access to health care and clean water, environmental hazards and barriers to transportation.

These stark disparities have been driven largely by generations of displacement, broken treaties and systemic neglect. As tribes were forced by the federal government into isolated and under-resourced reservations in the late 1800s, these conditions became the norm.

The legacy of those policies continues to shape the health of their communities, resulting in higher rates of infectious diseases such as RSV, according to public health experts and tribal epidemiologists.

“Water alone is a huge public health issue for us because roughly 30 percent of the households on our reservation have no running water,” Branch says. “And it's very expensive for our people to haul their own, and they have to ration, which has had a direct impact on the health of the Navajo Nation.”

Access to basic resources and challenging living conditions have created environments where infectious diseases thrive—which highlights how health outcomes are tied to social inequities, says Laura Hammitt, director of Infectious Disease Programs at the Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health.

American Indian and Alaska Native children have some of the highest rates of RSV transmission, hospitalization and mortality in the country.

“Social determinants of health are really the root cause of the elevated RSV disease burden among Native American children,” Hammitt says. “This is a disease of poverty.”

Even though the disparity has been well documented in medical research over many years, that information has rarely reached Native families themselves. That's partly because the symptoms of RSV are similar to those of other respiratory illnesses, such as the flu and the common cold. And there haven't been culturally relevant public health campaigns about RSV on Native lands, according to public health experts.

“I was doing a lot of advocacy relating to COVID at the time [of the pandemic], because I was leading the Navajo and Hopi Families COVID-19 Relief Fund, a mutual aid nonprofit,” Branch explains. “So I had a hyperawareness of things like this. But even so, I had no idea what RSV was.”

After her son's hospitalization, Branch began researching RSV and was shocked to learn that high transmission rates on the Navajo Nation reservation had been a serious problem for years.

As COVID cases began to decline and lockdowns eased on the reservation, she realized a public health crisis was emerging as people began to gather again, spreading germs. RSV surged among the tribe's children, so Branch penned a column in the Navajo Times about her son's experience and began educating other parents and caregivers about the risks and warning signs of RSV.

Meanwhile frontline health workers, armed with experience from COVID, were building better systems to track and fight infectious diseases, laying the groundwork that continues to shape the Navajo Nation's response to RSV and other medical threats.

When pediatrician Amanda Burrage arrived at the Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation on the Navajo Nation reservation in 2018, the facility had no coordinated effort to track and monitor RSV cases and admissions. But the emergence of COVID served as a catalyst for transforming the public health apparatus.

Burrage led the efforts at Tuba City's hospital by organizing a comprehensive response, including data collection, contact tracing, community outreach, disease surveillance, testing, vaccination campaigns and staff training. Once that infrastructure was in place, Burrage and her team could apply these same tools to other infectious diseases such as RSV.

“Prior to COVID, we did not have anybody on staff at Tuba City focused on the data or tracking the RSV tests that were positive and cases that were hospitalized,” says Burrage, who serves as the facility's medical director of public health. She splits her time between her clinical practice and public health efforts aimed at improving disease surveillance, prevention and response across the region.

Amanda Burrage, a pediatrician and public health expert, is leading the efforts at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation on the Navajo Nation reservation to ensure children receive nirsevimab immunizations against RSV.

As COVID cases began to recede, RSV transmission and hospitalizations started to spike at Tuba City, signaling the virus's aggressive return after people stopped isolating.

RSV primarily attacks the respiratory tract, inflaming the small airways and making it difficult for infants and children to breathe. The virus can cause a severe buildup of mucus that blocks airflow, reducing oxygen levels in the blood. For some children, this can quickly spiral into pneumonia or bronchiolitis, requiring hospitalization and sometimes intensive care. Because young children have more fragile immune systems and lungs, RSV can overwhelm their bodies quickly, making it one of the most dangerous respiratory viruses for infants and toddlers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Once RSV is present, there is only supportive care,” Burrage says. “There is really no treatment, and it becomes about management of symptoms and monitoring for complications.”

In 2019, before COVID emerged in the U.S., a multidisciplinary team of physicians, epidemiologists, public health professionals and national research institutions joined forces in a monumental global effort to study the efficacy of a new immunization that helps to prevent severe RSV infections in infants and children.

Nirsevimab, under the commercial name Beyfortus, is a monoclonal antibody that provides infants passive immunization from RSV. Developed jointly by AstraZeneca and Sanofi, it's not technically a “vaccine” but an immunization that works by delivering antibodies that target the RSV-F protein, offering the strongest protection in the weeks after it is administered.

Native Americans played a small but crucial role in a clinical trial of nirsevimab known as the MELODY study. Hammitt, who served as the lead investigator for the Indigenous portion of the trial, worked closely with the Navajo Nation to recruit participants and monitor the outcomes, ensuring the research was conducted in a culturally respectful and collaborative way.

The initial phase of the trial was postponed during the first year of the pandemic but started again in 2021, according to Hammitt. Out of 1,490 global participants in that phase, approximately 83 Navajo infants were enrolled at Fort Defiance, Ariz., and at Shiprock and Gallup in New Mexico.

The study's integration of Indigenous communities provided critical data on the immunization's efficacy in a high-risk group. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices subsequently endorsed nirsevimab for all infants under eight months born during or entering their first RSV season. The committee made a special recommendation that American Indian and Alaska Native children aged eight months to 19 months receive a second dose for their second RSV season.

When the trial began, prior to COVID, “we had pretty comprehensive data on what RSV looked like in a prepandemic setting,” Hammitt says. “We found that the Navajo Nation's rate of serious RSV infection and hospitalization was about five times higher than the general U.S. numbers.”

The results from the first phase of the trial were dramatic and immediate and showed that nirsevimab was about 75 percent effective at preventing RSV illness that required medical attention, says Hammitt, who has spent decades partnering with tribes in the U.S. Southwest and Alaska to study the impact of infectious disease on their communities.

“We were a small but important part of the MELODY trial because of the need to really demonstrate that immunizations that are licensed and recommended work in the populations that need them the most,” she explains.

After nirsevimab's approval in 2023 by the Food and Drug Administration, public health officials at the Navajo Nation set their new public health apparatus in motion, reaching out to parents with eligible babies. Pfizer's RSV vaccine for pregnant people, Abrysvo, was also approved that year and offered parents another option to protect their babies. A single dose administered between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation confers protection to the fetus through the placenta and lasts for about six months after birth.

“We were very proactive in reaching every family who had a child that was eligible,” says Burrage, whose staff worked overtime on parent outreach at Tuba City. “We sent letters, made phone calls. And whenever a parent is in for a well-child visit or at prenatal checkups, we certainly offer it.”

Burrage reports there has been a small increase in the number of parents who are hesitant to accept the shot because of the influence of antivaccine groups and misinformation. But given the risks and high prevalence of RSV among Navajo children, she says, the vast majority are choosing to immunize their children. A second antibody injection, Enflonsia, was approved by the FDA for infant use in June 2025. “We certainly recognize this to be a game-changer for us in our community,” Burrage says. “Many people know somebody who's had severe illness that was admitted [to a hospital] with RSV—an older sibling, a niece or nephew. People recognize that it can be severe for young children and have almost universally accepted it.”

After Patro's hospital stay, Branch began educating other parents and caregivers about the risks of RSV in the Navajo Nation. She encourages all Indigenous parents to get their children immunized against the virus.

Branch, who now serves as deputy county attorney for the Coconino County Attorney's Office in Flagstaff, Ariz., hopes her son's story will serve as a wake-up call regarding the dangers of RSV.

Patro fell ill before any prevention measures were available. Every winter she has to whisk him to the emergency room if he shows signs of wheezing or labored breathing, a vestige of his serious brush with RSV in 2022.

“You don't want your kid to get RSV—ever,” Branch says. “So get that vaccine so you can save yourself and your child the trauma of having it in the first place, which is a horrible experience for everyone. There are long-lasting effects, and you don't want to have to go into the ER every winter with your child.”

Large aquatic lizards used to populate the planet's oceans–and you can find their fossils in suburban New Jersey.

Over the past 18 years, the Edelman Fossil Park and Museum in New Jersey has yielded over 100,000 fossils belonging to more than 100 species. That's a pretty remarkable fossil hotspot–especially considering it's an unassuming quarry nestled behind a Lowe's shopping center. 

The site, discovered by Kenneth Lacovara, Ph.D., houses so many fossils thanks to the extinction layer that stretches across the quarry. Lacovara spent years searching the world for the particular layer of sediment that holds clues about the mass extinction that occurred when an asteroid struck Earth millions of years ago, but it happened to be right near his home in New Jersey all along.

But out of all the hundreds of different species found in the quarry over the years, Lacovara has a clear favorite: the Mosasaur.

Popular Mechanics spoke with Lacovara to learn more about the prehistoric marine lizard that roamed the Earth's oceans during the Cretaceous Period.

Drinking too little water could increase our vulnerability to stress-related health issues, according to a new study from scientists at LJMU.

People who drink less than the recommended daily fluid intake experience a greater stress hormone response, which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.

A new study, published recently in the Journal of Applied Physiology, found that individuals who drank less than 1.5 liters of fluid – or seven cups of tea – per day had a cortisol response to stress that was over 50% higher than those who met daily water intake recommendations.

Study lead Professor Neil Walsh, a physiologist in LJMU's School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, said: ""Cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone and exaggerated cortisol reactivity to stress is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.""

""If you know you have a looming deadline or a speech to make, keeping a water bottle close could be a good habit with potential benefits for your long-term health.""

Poor long-term health 

With the project funded by Danone R&I, Neil and his team divided healthy young adults into two equally sized groups, representing the lowest and highest 25% for daily fluid intake. The 'low fluid' group consisted of individuals who typically drank less than 1.5 liters of fluid per day (water, hot drinks etc.). The 'high fluid' group included individuals who regularly met the daily water intake recommendations – 2 liters for women and 2.5 liters for men. Both groups were matched for key factors known to influence stress responses such as psychological characteristics and sleep.

Participants maintained their usual drinking habits for one week, during which hydration levels were monitored in blood and urine samples. Then participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test, widely used to simulate real-world stress through a mock job interview and a mental arithmetic task.

Dr Daniel Kashi, a member of the study team, said: ""Both groups felt equally anxious and experienced similar increases in heart rate during the stress test. However, only the 'low fluid' group showed a significant increase in saliva cortisol in response to the stress test.""

He added: ""Although the low fluid group did not report being thirstier than the high fluid group, they had darker and more concentrated urine, clear signs of poor hydration. An important observation was that poor hydration was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to the stress test. Exaggerated cortisol reactivity to stress has been associated with poor long-term health.""

""If you have a stressful schedule, keeping a bottle of water close could be a good habit.""

Dr Daniel Kashi, physiologist, LJMU

Why is dehydration harmful? 

The answer lies in the body's water-regulation system, which is closely connected to the brain's stress-response center. When the body senses dehydration, whether due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid loss, it triggers the release of a hormone called vasopressin. Vasopressin acts primarily on the kidneys, promoting water reabsorption to maintain blood volume and electrolyte balance. This conservation mechanism comes at a cost. Sustained vasopressin release places additional strain on the kidneys, which must work harder to concentrate urine and manage electrolyte balance.

Vasopressin also acts on the brain's stress-response center, the hypothalamus, where it can influence the release of cortisol. This dual role for vasopressin helps maintain blood volume and electrolyte balance but also increases cortisol.

The researchers say that while further long-term studies are needed, the findings reinforce current water intake recommendations – approximately 2 liters of fluid each day for women and 2.5 liters for men.

Hydration helps us manage stress 

""Being hydrated may help your body manage stress more effectively,"" added Dr Kashi. A practical way to check your hydration status is to monitor your urine colour -- light yellow typically indicates good hydration.

""If you know, for example, that you have a stressful schedule, maybe a looming deadline or a speech to make, keeping a water bottle close could be a good habit with potential benefits for your long-term health.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Can meditation apps really reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia?","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922075000.htm","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 04:11:58 GMT","

Do you have a meditation app on your smartphone, computer or wearable device? Well, you're not alone.

There are now thousands of meditation apps available worldwide, the top 10 of which have been collectively downloaded more than 300 million times. What's more, early work on these digital meditation platforms shows that even relatively brief usage can lead to benefits, from reduced depression, anxiety, and stress to improved insomnia symptoms.

""Meditation apps, such as Calm and Headspace, have been enormously popular in the commercial market,"" said J. David Creswell, a health psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of a review paper on meditation apps, published today in the journal American Psychologist. ""What they're doing now is not only engaging millions of users every day, but they're also creating new scientific opportunities and challenges.""

One huge boon provided by meditation apps for users is access.

""You can imagine a farmer in rural Nebraska not having many available opportunities to go to traditional group-based meditation programs, and now they have an app in their pocket which is available 24/7,"" said Creswell, who is the William S. Dietrich II Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience.

Meditation apps also provide scientists with opportunities to scale up their research.

""Historically, I might bring 300 irritable bowel syndrome patients into my lab and study the impacts of meditation on pain management,"" said Creswell. ""But now I'm thinking, how do we harness the capacity of meditation apps and wearable health sensors to study 30,000 irritable bowel syndrome patients across the world?""

Combined with products that measure heart rate and sleep patterns, such as Fitbit and the Apple Watch, meditation apps now also have the capacity to incorporate biometrics into meditation practices like never before.

The biggest takeaway, though, is that meditation apps are fundamentally changing the way these practices are distributed to the general public. Scientific studies of use patterns show that meditation apps account for 96 percent of overall users in the mental health app marketplace.

""Meditation apps dominate the mental health app market,"" said Creswell. ""And this paper is really the first to lay out the new normal and challenge researchers and tech developers to think in new ways about the disruptive nature of these apps and their reach.""

Meditation apps challenge users to train their minds, in small initial training doses

As with in-person meditation training, meditation apps start by meeting users where they are. Introductory courses may focus on breathing or mindfulness, but they tend to do so in small doses, the merits of which are still being debated.

According to the data, just 10 to 21 minutes of meditation app exercises done three times a week is enough to see measurable results.

""Of course, that looks really different from the daily meditation practice you might get within an in-person group-based meditation program, which might be 30 to 45 minutes a day,"" said Creswell.

The a la carte nature of meditation through a smartphone app may appeal to those pressed for time or without the budget for in-person coaching sessions. Users may also find it comforting to know that they have access to guided meditation on-demand, rather than at scheduled places, days, and times.

""Maybe you're waiting in line at Starbucks, and you've got three minutes to do a brief check-in mindfulness training practice,"" said Creswell.

Finally, as meditation apps continue to evolve, Creswell believes integration of AI, such as meditation-guiding chat-bots, will only become more common, and this will offer the option of even more personalization. This could mark an important development for meditation adoption at large, as offerings go from one-size-fits all group classes to training sessions tailored to the individual.

""People use meditation for different things, and there's a big difference between someone looking to optimize their free-throw shooting performance and someone trying to alleviate chronic pain,"" said Creswell, who has trained Olympic athletes in the past.

The elephant in the room

Of course, with new technology comes new challenges, and for meditation apps, continued engagement remains a huge problem.

""The engagement problem is not specific to meditation apps,"" said Creswell. ""But the numbers are really sobering. Ninety-five percent of participants who download a meditation app aren't using it after 30 days.""

If the meditation app industry is going to succeed, it will need to find ways to keep its users engaged, as apps like Duolingo have. But overall, Creswell said the market demand is clearly there.

""People are suffering right now. There are just unbelievably high levels of stress and loneliness in the world, and these tools have tremendous potential to help,"" he said.

""I don't think there is ever going to be a complete replacement for a good, in-person meditation group or teacher,"" said Creswell. ""But I think meditation apps are a great first step for anyone who wants to dip their toes in and start training up their mindfulness skills. The initial studies show that these meditation apps help with symptom relief and even reduce stress biomarkers.""

Access to water is crucial for all aspects of life. Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD.

In late 2017 and early 2018, the city of Cape Town, South Africa, was threatened by an unprecedented water scarcity crisis, known as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), triggered by an exceptional 3-year rainfall deficit that started in 20151. This event was characterized by the lowest river flows recorded since 19042 in the Sonderend River and drained the largest reservoir3, Theewaterskloof, to critical levels. The vulnerability and scale of the population exposure made it one of the most extreme multi-year droughts on record, leading to severe water restrictions and socio-economic consequences4,5. The long duration of the drought and the high water demand made the situation dire, especially for a city relying for 96% on surface water and only 4% on groundwater6. Although Cape Town ultimately avoided reaching DZD, due to the slightly above-average rainfall in winter 2018 and subsequent wetter years, this event remains the major urban drought in recent history. Similar crises occurred in cities like Chennai in 20197, while other cities like Los Angeles8 remain highly vulnerable. These cases highlight the growing global concern over urban water security and serve as a wake-up call to the risks of water insecurity.

Traditional droughts, meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological, are typically assessed in isolation based on deficits in precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow. In contrast, water scarcity is a multidimensional event arising from insufficient quantity, compromised quality, and unmet environmental flow requirements, constraining the sustainable availability of water sources for human and ecological systems9. This study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, driven by anthropogenic supply-demand imbalances. However, DZD represents an acute water scarcity triggered by the simultaneous occurrence of multi-year precipitation deficits, river flow depletion, and high-water demand, leading to a critical depletion of reservoirs. Therefore, DZD is a multi-year compound extreme event arising from the concurrent occurrence of several interdependent events10. A compound extreme event refers to a simultaneous occurrence of multiple extreme events that can have drastic effects on a large scale, far greater than the impact of an individual event11,12. Multi-year meteorological drought, driven by insufficient precipitation and potentially exacerbated by global warming, can lead to hydrological droughts characterized by abnormally low river flows, reducing water availability. Such combined events considerably increase the risk of water scarcity when the available supply is less than the demand. Hence, the simultaneous occurrence of several climate extremes can lead to more severe impacts13 on water supply14 and subsequently on society and ecosystems15, highlighting the need for integrated drought assessment frameworks that account for compound events.

Intensive water consumption due to economic development, population growth, and modern agriculture, heightens the risk that water resources, depleted by drought, will not be able to meet sectoral water demands. On a global level, future climate projections indicate that global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the water cycle variability16, leading to more severe wet-dry fluctuation periods17, enhancing evapotranspiration18, and reducing precipitation and surface runoff16 in many regions. These changes are expected to increase the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological water stress19,20,21,22. Despite the distinct nature of drought and water scarcity, their relationship is crucial in the hydrological system23. Climate change and socioeconomic development drive global freshwater scarcity24,25,26, affecting numerous populations27. However, the risk of future global water scarcity, caused by anthropogenic climate change and rising water demand across all sectors, and its impacts28,29 remain poorly understood due to the complexity of its socio-economic and physical interactions.

Few studies have focused on understanding the DZD drivers, and then mainly for Cape Town, South Africa1,2,4,30,31,32,33. The event was caused by a wet-season rainfall deficit and long-term decline in the frequency and intensity of rainy days, making the rainy season shorter than the dry season34,35. Anthropogenic climate change contributed to DZD36,37 and is expected to increase its future likelihood33. However, global-scale assessments of the emergence and attribution of DZD-like events under global warming remain limited. Understanding where and when such compound events will emerge is crucial for local and global water security strategies.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have assessed the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of extreme events such as unprecedented hydrological drought38 and water scarcity39, under human-induced climate change. For instance, Liu et al.39 estimated the ToFE of water scarcity and its potential disappearance based on a per-capita water availability metric. However, the understanding of ToFE of water scarcity driven by the compound effects of hydrological drought and socio-economic growth remains limited. Here, water scarcity arises when freshwater demand exceeds the available supply, including reservoir storage, under compound drought conditions. Reservoirs are essential for managing local water availability and assessing the severity of water scarcity under climate change40. However, reservoir feedback41,42 due to reservoir dependence can increase vulnerability to water shortages during prolonged drought, as increased storage capacity encourages greater water consumption. Reservoirs help mitigate hydrological extremes, but over-reliance can mask water stress and delay adaptation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for in-depth research on reservoir-related water security risks to achieve water-related sustainable development goals.

This study assesses the characteristics of global physical water scarcity caused by hydrological drought in anthropogenic climate change using a probabilistic framework based on large-ensemble model simulations. Our study specifically addresses water scarcity that arises when prolonged drought reduces water supply below demand. To investigate the emergence of extreme drought-driven water scarcity, we use 100 ensemble members of climate projections with the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) under the SSP3-7.0 scenario for probabilistic analysis. We also include the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios for the sensitivity of our results, using 10 ensemble members for each scenario to ensure consistency. The CNRM-based analysis is solely for the sensitivity of the ToFE due to its coarser spatial resolution relative to CESM2-LE. We evaluate the global ToFE of prolonged drought-driven water scarcity, such as DZD, using a method based on the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) of the joint probability of compound extremes, incorporating reservoir and lake levels. We apply the FAR to quantify the increase in the likelihood of DZD events due to human-induced climate change, attributing the risk to the anthropogenic forcing. Our study focuses on DZD as an acute water scarcity event due to a long period of unprecedented compound extreme events in water supply shortage and rising demand under a warming climate. We identify when and where anthropogenic DZD first emerges, how long these events will last, and how many people will be exposed to DZD.

We investigate drought-driven water scarcity as a compound extreme event characterized by the concurrent exceedance of thresholds of four indicators: the 48-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), and the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), as illustrated in Fig. 1, and Time for Reservoirs to Dry (TRD, Supplementary Fig. 6). Although SPEI is widely used for capturing atmospheric water demand through Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), it does not reflect actual water losses from the land surface, which actual evapotranspiration better represents. Nonetheless, PET-based indices remain suitable for detecting climate-driven drought in long-term, large-scale studies due to their broader data availability and methodology.

The first column panel shows the ensemble mean of water stress for the pre-industrial period (1850–1899), which is considered as the baseline period, the second column panel for the near future (2020–2050), and the third column panel for the far future (2070–2100). a–c Present the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), indicating long-term climatic water balance at a 48-month timescale. d–f Show the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), capturing hydrological drought conditions at a 48-month timescale. g–i Depict the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), reflecting the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption at a 48-month timescale. Each panel represents the ensemble mean, illustrating the spatial pattern and severity of compound water stress indicators over time. Negative values of SPEI48 and SRFI48 indicate increasingly dry conditions, while lower SWSI48 values (i.e., supply-to-demand ratios below normal) signal intensifying water scarcity driven by growing demand. Together, these projections reveal areas at high risk of compound, long-term water stress under future climate and socio-economic scenarios.

Our results quantify the spatial distributions of water stress and suggest that some regions will encounter unprecedented regional drought conditions due to global warming under the SSP3-7.0 scenario (Fig. 1). Regarding the SPEI48 and SRFI48 indices, most regions are expected to experience unprecedented severe multi-year hydrological droughts, especially towards the end of the twenty-first century under anthropogenic climate change. SWSI48 shows the emergence of regional water scarcity in future periods.

Towards the end of the twenty-first century, almost all regions are at high risk of severe and pronounced persistent drought (i.e., SPEI48, Fig. 1c) in the far future. Our findings align with a previous study43 indicating a persistent increase in severe multi-year drought in the future over southern Africa, northern South America, the Mediterranean Region, Australia, and Chile. Conversely, regions like Argentina, East Africa, and high-latitude Russia are projected to experience wetter climates.

Similarly, the spatial distribution of SRFI48 (Fig. 1e, f) indicates an increase and intensification of severe multi-year river flow extremes in the future44. This is projected to intensify in the far future45,46. A substantial decline in the Yangtze River water level is projected in the near future, followed by a slight increase in the far future. The increase in streamflow in the far future is driven by increased snowmelt47,48 and precipitation49, which could lead to water level rises. Notably, anthropogenic climate change is projected to also alter the world's largest river flow systems, such as the Amazon River. However, an increase of a high risk of the occurrence of extreme floods50 is projected in the far future for the biggest rivers, such as the Rio de la Plata, Nile, Congo, and Yellow Rivers.

The SWSI48 addresses the multi-year impact of increasing water demand with a decrease in water supply in a warming world. Our results show the emergence of acute water scarcity in the future (Fig. 1h, i), with total water demand exceeding total water supply. The expansion of regions impacted by water scarcity shows the intensification of SWSI48, particularly in the western United States of America, Mediterranean regions, northern Africa, southern Africa, India, northern China, and southern Australia.

Consequently, our results state that several regions will at the same time encounter severe dryness, as indicated by SPEI48 less than −1.5, persistent reduction in river discharge, by SRFI48 less than −1.5, and chronic acute water scarcity, defined by SWSI48 less than 0.6. Therefore, these simultaneous occurrences of multiple water-related stress factors driven by long-duration rainfall deficits, increased evapotranspiration, depleted river flow, and increased water consumption are projected to intensify jointly under a warming climate scenario, CESM2-LE SSP3.7-0. This compound pattern of multi-year water stress underscores an increasing prevalence of extreme water stress26,38,45,51 and scarcity52 in the future, especially in already drought-prone regions.

This study defines ToFE as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) for DZD exceeds 0.99, indicating a 99% likelihood that human activities caused the onset of these unprecedented compound drought-scarcity events. ToFE is assessed relative to pre-industrial conditions (1850–1899), which serve as the baseline for detecting anthropogenic emergence. The focal hotspot regions affected by unprecedented DZD, with their respective decade of ToFE and the distribution of the ToFE, are shown in Fig. 2. Our results indicate that anthropogenic climate change is projected to trigger the onset and occurrence of DZD, primarily due to severe and persistent compound multi-year hydrological droughts, reservoir depletion, and high-water demand.

Colored shading indicates the first decade during which DZD becomes statistically attributable to anthropogenic climate change, defined as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk is greater than 0.99 (FAR ≥ 0.99). Gray regions indicate grid cells where no DZD event attributable to anthropogenic climate change is projected to emerge before 2100. For regions with reservoirs, the ToFE is considered to be the first decade after the year of completion (Supplementary Fig. 6) of their respective reservoirs, when all DZD criteria are simultaneously met.

The color scale indicates the percentages of grid cells (land areas) experiencing their ToFE distribution in each decade from 1900 to 2100. It provides a temporal overview of how the ToFE is distributed over time and the trends in DZD emergence.

About 14% of the global reservoirs from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRand) database (Supplementary Fig. 5, see Methods for more information regarding the reservoirs) would dry out due to a high risk of DZD during their respective ToFE, as shown in Fig. 2a. The 74% of regions covered by DZD are projected to experience an unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, under the SSP3-7.0 scenario of CESM2-LE. Moreover, almost 35% of those regions are facing the emergence of water scarcity, including their reservoirs, between 2020 and 2030 (Fig. 2b). This will threaten the local freshwater availability in DZD-prone regions (Supplementary Fig. 7). Declining precipitation and river flows, combined with rising water demand, can dry up the reservoirs and cause water scarcity across sectors, heightening the risks of water, food, or socio-economic insecurity.

The ToFE of DZD is influenced by the severity of the precipitation deficit and increases in evapotranspiration (SPEI48), river drought (SRFI48), and water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa (Supplementary Fig. 10). In parts of Asia and America, increased water consumption can influence the early emergence of DZD compared to other factors. This rise in water consumption is associated with population growth and socio-economic development, encompassing expanded water use across domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining sectors. These findings emphasize the importance of jointly considering all four drivers: climate, hydrological supply, event duration, and human demand, since no single factor can fully characterize a compound hydrological extreme event like DZD. Furthermore, the lower the thresholds applied to define the DZD, reflecting more severe and rare events, the later the ToFE will emerge, underscoring the complex relationship between event severity and its anthropogenic emergence (Supplementary Fig. 10). This compound approach highlights that water scarcity can be triggered by various drivers rather than a single stressor. For instance, a precipitation deficit without strong demand pressure may not induce water scarcity, while excessive demand alone may not trigger a water crisis if demand remains below supply. However, unsustainable consumption driven by population growth and socio-economic development alone can also trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource. Therefore, the simultaneous occurrence of these factors can lead to the emergence of an unprecedented acute water scarcity.

In addition, reservoir characteristics, specifically the Time for Reservoir to Dry (TRD), play a crucial role in detecting the ToFE of DZD. TRD serves as a proxy for how long a reservoir can sustain water supply under drought conditions when river inflow is the only source of water. The longer it takes for an unprecedented drought to drain water in reservoirs, the later the ToFE will occur, particularly in Mediterranean regions. An increase in TRD, quadrupling the TRD, will affect the ToFE of the 8% of the DZD-prone regions, causing later emergence than in Fig. 2a (Supplementary Fig. 11, Methods). Therefore, the duration of drier conditions, combined with rising human water consumption, can dry the reservoirs and trigger severe DZD, including reservoir-dependent regions. However, excluding both drought duration and TRD increases the event occurrence in both historical and future periods and raises their probability. This will delay the human-induced signal (FAR ≥ 0.99), leading to later ToFE compared to Fig. 2, particularly in the Mediterranean regions (Supplementary Fig. 12). In contrast, DZD emerges earlier in other regions because the probability of future events exceeds the pre-industrial baseline earlier, enabling earlier detection of FAR ≥ 0.99. Therefore, including the multi-year drought duration and TRD makes these events unprecedented versus pre-industrial conditions, highlighting their importance for understanding the emergence and magnitude of anthropogenic water scarcity and the critical role of reservoirs in water crisis vulnerability. These insights underline the need for future work research integrating dynamic reservoir operations and adaptive water management strategies where region-specific data is available.

Furthermore, the ToFE of unprecedented water stress and scarcity can be dependent on model structure and scenario pathways38,39. To address this, we use data from the CNRM model under two scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0. Both scenarios project that 51% of DZD-affected regions will face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020-2030 (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). The influence of the scenario on DZD ToFE is region-specific (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c, f) due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Both high (SSP3-7.0) and moderate (SSP2-4.5) scenarios can advance, delay, or have no change on DZD emergence, depending on the region. Model structure also drives spatial discrepancies (Supplementary Fig. 21a, b, d, e): CESM2-LE projects broader DZD regions in northern Africa, while CNRM highlights other regions such as South America and Australia. Nonetheless, both models consistently identify the Mediterranean, parts of southern Africa, and North America as key emerging hotspots.

The recurrence and persistence of compound drought events are critical to understanding future water risk. In this context, we assess the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated as the number of months a DZD event lasts. Both factors can importantly exacerbate the societal and ecological impact of DZD because its continuity is destructive and costly, especially when the waiting time is short and the duration is long. The duration plays a crucial role in determining the event's extremeness and affects the exposure and vulnerability of society. Short waiting times between successive events limit the recovery period, thereby amplifying stress on water systems.

The spatial distribution and the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of DZD duration and waiting time across hotspot regions reveal distinct regional variations in the magnitudes and the distribution (Fig. 3). The heavy-tailed PDFs, with the 99th percentile exceeding 48 months, suggest that climate change can cause long durations of DZD events, although such extremes remain rare events due to long waiting times between events. However, short waiting times and durations of less than 48 months are more likely to occur, as illustrated by the shape of their PDFs and their spatial distribution (Fig. 3a, b). Moreover, the probability of having a waiting time above 48 months for all regions affected by DZD is above the 90th percentile. In terms of duration, the likelihood of an event lasting less than 48 months is above the 90th percentile, except for the Mediterranean Region, Southern Africa, Asia, and Australia, indicating shorter tails of waiting times and longer tails of duration. Thus, in these regions, the DZD tends to last longer with shorter waiting time periods. These prolonged DZD can dry up the reservoirs, heightening the risk of long-term acute water scarcity with a large-scale impact during the twenty-first century. This will be exacerbated by climate change in the future, cascading to “zero water” as many reservoirs will not have enough water to meet the demand of the projected population. Altered precipitation and river flow patterns can prolong the dry conditions and reduce the volume of inflows to freshwater systems, exacerbating water shortages. Increased evapotranspiration and water consumption deplete water sources (water available in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) more quickly and prolong DZD duration. The volume of water that reservoirs can retain will decrease due to prolonged periods of stress caused by both climate change and human activities. As ecosystems are weakened and less capable of retaining water, even brief periods of rainfall may be insufficient to end a drought or replenish water supplies, limiting the recovery period before the next DZD event.

The central spatial map shows the spatial distribution of the ensemble-mean waiting time (a) and duration (b) of DZD events, respectively, following the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) at each grid point of DZD-prone regions across the globe. c represents the spatial distribution of the frequency (%) of extreme DZD events, defined as those where the event duration exceeds the waiting time, indicating prolonged water scarcity impact and short recovery period. The accompanying inset circular diagram of c illustrates the distribution of these events, with the color scale indicating the proportion (percentages) of grid cells experiencing such conditions. This visualization highlights where and how frequently extreme DZD conditions with long duration and short waiting time emerge. The surrounding paired panels depict the Probability Density Function (PDF) of waiting time and duration for DZD events across seven DZD-prone regions. Colored lines represent the PDF of each ensemble of 100 CESM2-LE, while the black line is the ensemble mean of the respective PDF. The vertical dashed lines mark the ensemble mean (black), 90th percentile (blue), and 99th percentile (green) for each region. The red dashed line represents the monthly scale of the compound extreme event, which is 48 months. The period considered for each grid point started from the month after each decade of their respective ToFE and continued until 2100.

The duration distributions vary considerably in the tails compared to the waiting time, determining the likelihood of extreme DZD events with longer durations. The model agreement is high in simulating the waiting time and duration of the DZD. The 90th and 99th percentiles, the extreme upper tails, show some consistency among the ensembles, indicating that DZDs are projected to have a long-lasting duration but can also have long waiting times between events. An upper tail of the waiting time density greater than the duration denotes the possibility of rare DZD to occur in America and Northern Africa.

The localized nature of DZD characteristic is driven by the variation of climate (via SPEI48 and SRFI48), water consumption (via SWSI48), and reservoir capacity (via TRD) across regions, as the climate, the capacity of the reservoirs, agricultural irrigation, industrial development, and population-driven demand differ substantially across regions. To identify where DZD events will be most severe, Fig. 3c shows the DZD-prone regions and their frequency, defined as a case where DZD event duration exceeds its waiting time, indicating short recovery periods and prolonged impact. Almost 47% of the global high-risk regions will experience extreme DZD events with a frequency between 20% and 30%. Around 12% of the DZD-prone regions have a frequency of extreme prolonged DZD events above 50%, indicating that almost half of the events have longer durations than waiting times, suggesting frequent and severe water crisis conditions with substantial socio-economic impacts. Regions with high water demand and strained reservoirs, such as the Mediterranean, exhibit both high frequency and long durations of extreme DZD. In these areas, the compounded effects of hydro-climatic stress and human demands intensify the severity and persistence of DZD, exposing heightened vulnerability to water crises and limiting recovery capacity.

These findings underscore that the duration and waiting time of DZD are shaped by complex, location-specific socio-hydrological feedback. Moreover, the DZD characteristics are crucial for identifying vulnerable zones where adaptive water governance is urgently needed to mitigate future water crises. Understanding these localized dynamics enables more targeted drought preparedness and infrastructure resilience planning.

We quantify the number of people living in each grid cell during the decade in which DZD first emerges (ToFE). We assess the population exposure across the total, rural, and urban populations. Results reveal a disproportionate exposure of vulnerable populations across time, regions, and warming levels (Fig. 4). Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, over 753 million of the total population (Fig. 4a, almost 9% of the current global population) will be exposed to DZD, with populations in urban areas (467 million) more affected than in rural areas (286 million). The urban population is most exposed in the Mediterranean, with 196 million urban and 85 million rural residents at risk. In contrast, rural populations are disproportionately impacted in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Asia (Fig. 4d).

The color scale indicates the total population (urban and rural) exposed when DZD first emerges in each grid cell. b Global distribution of the Global Warming Level (GWL, in °C above preindustrial) corresponding to the ToFE of DZD, providing insight into the warming levels associated with the onset of DZD events. c Circular diagram illustrating the rural, urban, and total population exposure to DZD at the ToFE, spanning the period from 1900 to 2100. d Regional distribution of rural, urban, and total populations affected by DZD, computed as the sum of exposed respective rural, urban, and total population within each regional hotspot (demarcated black box in a) at their respective ToFE. e Distribution of population exposure relative to the GWL at ToFE. Radar plots c–e emphasize the relative contributions of rural and urban populations to total exposure, highlighting disparities in vulnerability and exposure across both time and regions.

In rural areas reliant on rainfed agriculture and surface water, DZD will threaten livelihoods, food security through crop failures, and economic stability. Although urban areas generally benefit from more robust infrastructure, they remain highly vulnerable to DZD over the next few decades (Fig. 4c). As cities expand, rising water demand often exceeds supply, making the area susceptible to energy shortages, restricted domestic water consumption, and socio-economic instability.

The Paris climate goals are expressed in terms of global warming levels (GWL), making it essential to assess the societal impact of DZD related to the warming level at the ToFE of DZD relative to the baseline period. By linking the ToFE of DZD-affected regions to their respective GWLs, we estimate the distribution of exposed populations. The results show that 61% of GWL related to the ToFE of DZD-affected regions are in the range of 1–2.5 °C (Fig. 4b). This indicates that over half of these regions will experience DZD in a 1–2.5 °C warmer world. Notably, more urban population would be exposed to DZD than rural population (Fig. 4e). The future impact on urban DZD-prone regions will be severe under these warming levels due to the higher population densities and escalating demand. Hitting the mark of 1.5 °C represents the maximum of the exposed population (Fig. 4e), with a total population of 488 million, which can be decomposed into 322 million of urban and 166 million of rural population, suggesting the urgent need to limit warming at most 1.5 °C. This study emphasizes how climate change, socio-economic development, and water scarcity interact to increase the DZD risks, particularly affecting vulnerable populations unequally, even before the most extreme warming scenarios are reached.

In addition, the risks of urban DZD are not just a future concern in a warming world, but also a near-term reality, with high population exposure by 2020 (Fig. 4c). These compounded challenges underscore the urgent need for proactive and targeted policy responses, particularly in regions where rapid development, insufficient water infrastructure, and climate vulnerability coexist.

The emergence of DZD highlights the urgent need for proactive, integrated water management within policy frameworks to address the compound risks of climate change and unsustainable water use. Climate policy and water security are tightly interconnected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)53,54, so mitigation and adaptation strategies must align with global targets while fitting regional and community-specific needs for long-term resilience55.

Defining DZD events as water scarcity driven by climate change underscores the challenges in sustainable water supply (SDG target 6.1) and efficient water use under stress (SDG target 6.4). Assessing the ToFE of DZD supports early warning signals (SDG target 13.1) and integration of climate adaptation strategies into water management policies (SDG target 13.2). Empowering communities to design local adaptation strategies fosters equitable and context-appropriate responses56, through water conservation, crop selection, water storage solutions, and efficient cross-sectors water use, context-specific responses in DZD-prone regions.

Building resilience requires integrating local knowledge, adaptive cooperative management57, water governance58, and diversified supply strategies, including the re-planning of water reservoirs, desalination, rainwater harvesting, and wastewater recycling. Climate-resilient infrastructure investments, which have been underfinanced59, need to balance conventional and innovative approaches to ensure sustainable water access in drought-prone regions.

A key limitation of this study is the reliance on the CESM2-LE and a limited number of CNRM simulations for the sensitivity analysis. CESM2-LE provides robust ensemble consistency, suitable for probabilistic analysis, but lacks scenario diversity and structural uncertainties across Earth System Models (ESMs). Conversely, the CNRM model includes more scenarios but has fewer ensemble members and lower spatial resolution, limiting its ability to capture localized extremes. These limitations underrepresent inter-model variability in drought drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration, whose trends may vary among ESMs60,61, limiting our uncertainty assessment.

Moreover, CESM2-LE's land model assumes static aquifer storage, excluding dynamic groundwater variability. This overlooks the critical role of groundwater as a vital buffer during drought, particularly in groundwater-dependent regions. Groundwater contributes to the global water cycle, influencing river discharge and evapotranspiration, while also being altered by both climate change and human activities62. Incorporating dynamic groundwater processes is essential to improve water stress risks assessments. Groundwater is declining globally, leading to dry wells63. Climate change stresses groundwater62 through increased use during droughts and reduced natural recharge, potentially worsening the impacts of continued drought64. Prolonged rainfall deficits can disrupt the hydrological cycle in a warmer world and can lead to groundwater drought65. Despite its important role in water scarcity, global modeled and observed groundwater datasets remain scarce. However, its long-term relationship with atmospheric drought (partially captured by SPEI48; Supplementary Fig. 13) provides insight into its response to hydroclimatic stress.

Notwithstanding anthropogenic global warming, population growth and economics remain the major drivers of the water crisis by increasing demand27,34. Our study considers the socio-physical aspects of water security and excludes factors like national water policies, governance, quality, and environmental flow requirements.

The GRanD database provides valuable reservoir data but lacks information on real-time-varying hydrological dynamic details and includes unverified entries, limiting the number of reservoirs used. Although our study assumes stationary TRD, the static TRD effectively defines the minimum drought duration required to deplete reservoirs below critical storage levels, but it limits the ability to capture the future dynamic reservoir operations during drought. In the era of ongoing dam construction, time-varying TRD is essential for understanding how reservoir strategies influence water scarcity, but such data are currently unavailable. The interaction between socio-physical drivers and reservoir management is essential for defining compound climate extreme events23,66 and assessing DZD impact. Despite data limitations, our approach provides a practical and reproducible framework for vulnerability assessment.

The reconstruction of historical total water consumption data (1850–2009) assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and overlooks historical disruptions like wars, technological innovations, or abrupt policy changes. Moreover, the reliance on a scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. These assumptions affect the accuracy of past water use estimates. Addressing these data gaps will help refine water scarcity risk analysis in the context of climate and socio-economic change.

This study reveals when and where DZD may first emerge under climate change, emphasizing the importance of the compound drought duration and reservoirs40 in driving the severity of long-term drought-driven water scarcity and the unprecedented nature of these events. Excluding these factors delays ToFE, particularly in reservoir-dependent regions (Supplementary Fig. 12). Integrating reservoir response and drought persistence dynamics into future models will improve the relevance and robustness of water scarcity for near- and long-term assessments while considering risk and mitigation benefits. Our findings align closely with Stolte et al.67, highlighting the increase in the likelihood of urban drought in the future, a potential driver of urban DZD. In addition, it is important to consider the impact of upstream land use change, as it can intensify the effects of drought and exacerbate water scarcity in downstream areas26.

Unlike broader water scarcity metrics like the Falkenmark indicator, used by Liu et al.39, which use per capita water availability and relative population demand, our approach incorporates sector-specific water use and regional imbalance between supply and sectoral consumption (via SWSI) under human-induced climate. Note that SWSI on its own can identify water scarcity driven by high water consumption, but that can occur without climate-caused drought conditions. This distinction is important in the context of our study, as we define DZD as a prolonged anthropogenic drought-driven water scarcity caused by socio-physical factors, including water supply, human-made reservoirs, lakes, and sectoral water consumption. Therefore, it is essential to consider multiple indicators for assessing extreme events68, including SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48. Although this study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, incorporating water quality and environmental flows, as highlighted by Liu et al.9, is critical for a holistic understanding of future water risks.

Using the FAR method, we found that the contribution of human-induced climate change to DZD increases throughout the twenty-first century (Supplementary Fig. 9). Identifying ToFE with a very high attribution confidence (FAR ≥ 0.99) of human-induced signal relative to the pre-industrial period (1850–1899) provides robust scientific attribution, but it offers limited practical guidance for planning and adaptation, since most water infrastructure and management systems were designed based on the late twentieth-century (Supplementary Fig. 6) climatic conditions rather than pre-industrial norms. Regions with FAR < 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. 19) may still face DZD in the future, but with weaker anthropogenic attribution.

DZD, which has threatened Cape Town, is a multifaceted crisis that disproportionately affects low-income communities and exacerbates socio-economic inequalities69. It affects the domestic water supply, particularly in urban areas, with cascading effects on public health and societal risk. The impacts of drought vary across regions and sectors, with the least developed countries most vulnerable due to disparities in physical, social, economic, and knowledge-based factors70. In agriculture, DZD can reduce crop yields, threaten food security, and impact livestock through water and feed shortages. The need for sustainable irrigation of economically water-scarce cropland is critical to alleviating food insecurity71. Water-reliant industries and hydropower regions, including mining, can risk operational disruptions, energy shortages, and economic losses. Prolonged drought can degrade freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, compromising water quality, biodiversity, and long-term ecological resilience. These cross-sectoral impacts underscore the need for integrated potential solutions29 and adaptation strategies with equitable water governance and management58 at a regional scale. To support such efforts and reduce uncertainty in water scarcity assessment, expanded hydrological simulations across diverse models and emission scenarios are urgently needed.

We use climate projection data from the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) simulation72. This is a 100-member single-model ensemble simulation using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP3-7.0 scenario covering the period 1850 through 2100. The atmospheric data have a 1-degree spatial resolution, which serves as the reference for the interpolation of all CESM2-LE variables used in this study to ensure the consistency across datasets for the spatial analysis. We use monthly mean data, derived from daily data, including average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and total precipitation from CESM2-LE. We also use river discharge (Supplementary Fig. 2) over land from the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), the CESM2-LE river model component. In addition, we use the same variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5-Land) within the period 1979–2022, as well as river discharge data from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) hydrological time series forced with ERA5 meteorological reanalysis (GloFAS-ERA5). To assess the sensitivity of our results to model structure and emission scenarios, we also include simulations from the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under both SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. For consistency, we analyze 10 ensemble members available for each scenario and consider the same hydroclimatic variables as used with CESM2-LE. Due to the coarser spatial resolution and limited ensemble size of the CNRM simulations relative to CESM2-LE, the CNRM model is used exclusively for sensitivity analysis of the event emergence time. The CESM2-LE large ensemble enables us to compute probabilistic estimates of the ToFE, duration, and waiting time of extreme events. Our 100-member CESM2 large ensemble provides enough data to robustly estimate extreme event statistics. Only CESM2-LE and CNRM provide the variables necessary for our analysis, so other large ensemble simulations cannot be used in our study.

We use the global reservoirs database, which includes information on reservoir location, capacity, and the long-term average discharge (1971–2000) available from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD)73 database. The global reservoir database includes both reservoirs constructed by humans and natural lakes, according to Lehner et al.73. The GRanD database version 1.3 was used due to its highly adaptable geodatabase that offers expanded attribute coverage and spatial precision, making it possible to implement regional or global analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution73,74,75. We assigned reservoirs to the closest grid point in CESM2-LE to facilitate integration with climate model outputs.

The monthly global gridded water consumption data for sectoral water use under SSP3 and SSP2, and the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario, RCP6.0 and RCP4.5, covering the period from 2010 to 2100, were downloaded from Khan et al.76. Both scenarios are available from the same five Global Climate Models (GCMs): GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM. We use the available SSP3-RCP6.0 data due to the unavailability of sectoral water use data for SSP3-RCP7.0. We consider the available water demand data from different sectors, such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, to capture the socio-economic development water use demand. To our knowledge, there are no global historical and observed data for sectoral water consumption, covering in particular domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, for the historical period from 1850 to 2009. This lack of historical and observational data represents a major challenge for the analysis of long-term water demand. Therefore, we reconstruct the water consumption data from 1850 to 2009 using a backward nonlinear logarithmic regression approach based on the Dose-Response Curve (DRC) model in R77. The model is trained with each specific month of future water consumption for the period 2010–2100 and then applied to predict past values. Specifically, the logarithmic curve DRC.logCurve() function is used to estimate water consumption for each month of the year for the period 1850–2009. This approach is implemented for each grid point from the global climate models provided by Khan et al.76 to obtain a monthly gridded long-time series of water demand for the study period, from 1850 to 2100, for each grid. Importantly, to preserve the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, the nonlinear model was fitted independently for each month: for example, the curve was fitted using all January values from 2010–2100 to reconstruct the backward trend for January from 2009 to 1850; this process was repeated separately for each calendar month (January to December), in each grid cell of each GCMs. This method allows us to generate plausible historical estimates that align with the socio-economic trends incorporated in the scenario data, while recognizing the associated uncertainties. We acknowledge that this method introduces uncertainties as it assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and does not explicitly account for unexpected historical disruptions in water use patterns or development pathways, such as technological innovations or abrupt policy changes. Additionally, the reliance on the scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. Despite these limitations, this reconstruction approach offers an estimate of historical water consumption trends, maintaining spatial, temporal, and sectoral variability. The spatial patterns and temporal evolution of water demand, along with inter-period differences, are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 3. These reconstructed datasets serve as structured estimates to support consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial resolution of all data is interpolated to the CESM2-LE and CNRM resolution using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the Climate Data Operator78 (CDO) for their respective analysis.

We also use global spatial population datasets from the history database of the global environment (HYDE), version HYDE3.3 from Klein Goldewijk et al.79, to assess the population exposure from 1900 to 2009 at decadal intervals. In addition to that, we use the global spatial population projections SSP3 scenario obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)80, from 2010 to 2100, at decadal intervals to assess the future population exposure. The population datasets were interpolated to a 1-degree spatial resolution for our study, the same grid as CESM2-LE, using the sum of the source points remapping (remapsum) method from the CDO to conserve the total sum of the population.

The drought index, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), is a widely used indicator for investigating drought characteristics81,82,83,84,85,86, including onset, duration, and magnitude. This study uses the SPEI to quantify and classify drought severity due to its capacity to reflect the change in water deficiency. The index does not account for actual water losses from the land surface but considers potential evapotranspiration (PET), a significant factor87 in the future risk of extreme drought83, making it more robust in categorizing drought and detecting its onset and evolution in the context of global warming88 due to its contribution to the interaction of land-atmosphere conditions and drought87. Thus, the monthly gridded SPEI was obtained through the method proposed by Vicente-Serrano et al.88 using the modified Hargreaves method89 to investigate the importance of the range of maximum and minimum temperatures in drought conditions. Moreover, the SPEI allows comparisons between regions across different climatic conditions and considers the onset and duration of drought. The SPEI can be used to investigate the impact of prolonged multi-year drought trends on hydrological and ecological variables, as well as on water storage deficits90,91. SPEI can effectively be utilized to depict the hydrological drought on a longer time scale91. However, hydrological drought is a complex phenomenon involving various factors92,93,94 such as runoff or stream flow95, water balance, human activities, and water demand. The interaction between precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, recharge, groundwater, and discharge has been known65, but its application to drought is relatively recent. Thus, the causes of hydrological drought are complicated as they involve the atmosphere and hydrological processes that supply moisture to the atmosphere, contribute to water storage, and generate runoff to streams93. In addition, the streamflow drought will be defined as a multi-year insufficient river discharge, as most of the water supply comes in the form of river flow or runoff after all surface physical processes have been completed. In snow-fed river systems, river flow can still act as a water supply independent of immediate precipitation inputs. For instance, during periods of low precipitation, melting snow can sustain river flow. This is where the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI) plays a crucial role, as it captures river drought conditions based on streamflow variations, reflecting both precipitation-driven and non-precipitation-driven water inputs. Therefore, we use a single input standardized drought index, called SRFI, the same as Vicente-Serrano et al.96, to represent and categorize the severity of the river flow resource depletion. The river discharge data was used as the input to calculate SRFI. The concept of the calculation of SPEI and SRFI is made by fitting an empirical cumulative distribution function to reference periods (1979–2014), using the spei() function in R as proposed by Begueria and Vicente-Serrano97. The fitted distribution is then applied to the monthly cumulative precipitation-evapotranspiration (SPEI) or streamflow (SRFI) to obtain cumulative probabilities, which are transformed into a standard normal distribution. This process effectively standardizes the data relative to the reference period (1979–2014), allowing for easy interpretation. Both drought indices, SPEI and SRFI, were computed at a 48-month timescale for each grid cell in every ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, covering the period from 1850 to 2100.

To investigate the degree of water scarcity, we adopt the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI), which is conceptually equivalent to the Supply and Demand Balance Index introduced by Huang and Yin98, to represent the overexploitation of the water resources when the demand exceeds the supply. This index captures the imbalance between water availability and demand by taking the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption. The SWSI with a time scale of 48 months is used. The SWSI was chosen due to its capacity to represent the dynamic processes98 between the interaction of the water supply and demand for domestic usage and production in a region. The SWSI48 is the ratio of the 48-month accumulated total water supply and 48-month accumulated total water demand. The total water supply is estimated as the sum of surface water resources, including river flow and the net water balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration), representing the available freshwater availability. The total water demand is the sum of water consumption from all sectors, such as domestic (dom), irrigation (irrig), industry (ind), electricity (elec), livestock (liv), and mining (min). Therefore, to calculate SWSI48, the total water consumption from the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) provided by Khan et al.76 (GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM) is randomly distributed across the total water supply from the CESM2-LE and CNRM (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for further details).

where TWS is the total water supply, Prec represents the precipitation, E is for evapotranspiration, flow for the river flow, and TWC represents the total water consumption.

The definition of water scarcity from Huang and Yin98 is used for the degree of SWSI48, as extreme lack of water [0,0.3], acute shortage of water [0.3,0.6], moderate water shortage [0.6,0.9], slight shortage of water [0.9,1], and no shortage of water [≥1].

To assess the interdependence among the water stress indicators used in this study, we computed spatial correlations between the ensemble means of the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 derived from CESM2-LE simulations over the period 1850–2100. All-time series were detrended to remove systematic long-term trends associated with climate change and ensure that correlations reflect interdependence among the indicators. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows strong positive correlations across most regions, indicating that the water stress tends to vary together over the multi-year time scales of 48 months. In contrast, the negative correlations between SPEI48 and SWSI48, and between SRFI48 and SWSI48, are generally weak, particularly across Africa, reflecting the influence of non-climatic drivers such as water demand on SWSI48. Overall, both weak positive and negative correlations are observed in many regions, suggesting a more complex relationship between climate-driven drought indicators (SPEI48 and SWSI48, and SRFI48 and SWSI48).

In order to minimize the model errors, this study used a bias correction method to reduce model bias. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows a more detailed structure of the steps in the methods and the processes used in this study. The monthly database from ERA5-Land (1979–2022) was used to calculate ERA5's SPEI48 and SRFI48, with 1979–2014 as the reference period, which is used as the observational drought indices reference to calibrate the drought indices for each ensemble member of CESM2-LE individually. Although observational sources are the best to achieve the ideal bias correction, we opted for reanalysis products because they consistently assimilate a variety of variables in a physically consistent manner, and it is assumed to be close to observed data. This choice ensures global coverage and temporal completeness, particularly important in data-sparse regions or for long historical records where high-quality observational data are unavailable or inconsistent. The ERA5-Land dataset was found to be a trustworthy reference to calibrate CESM2-LE indices. In order to increase our confidence in future extreme drought projections, we applied the univariate Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), as Ansari et al.99 found it to be more robust for the correction of indices. Supplementary Fig. 14 shows that direct correction (post-processing QDM) of the drought indices as a single variable reduces the bias between ERA's SPEI48 and the ensemble mean of the CESM2-LE's SPEI48 and manages to capture the distribution of SPEI48. In addition, Van de Velde et al.100 stated that the simpler univariate BC methods are better to use for climate change impact assessment, as the multivariate BC methods failed to handle non-stationary climate conditions. This approach maintains the model-projected climate change signal while simultaneously correcting the distributional biases. The QDM bias correction method, introduced by Cannon et al.101, is a cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based bias correction method designed specifically to reduce the biases between the modeled and observed distribution of drought indices, while preserving the model-projected climate change signal. The additive form of QDM is applied to bias correct the systematic biases in each quantile of the drought indices calculated from the CESM2-LE and CNRM simulations, using the ERA-derived indices as observational references while preserving the model-projected absolute changes across all quantiles of the distribution. The important concept of QDM is its ability to maintain the trend in all the quantiles within the distribution of the climate model output, which is important when future changes are not uniform across the distribution. It is used to quantile detrend the model projections and adjust distributional biases in model projections, ensuring the sensitivity of the underlying climate model without affecting the distribution101,102,103. The QDM begins by identifying the corresponding quantiles of the observed, model historical (or reference for the calibration), and the model future projection, as a corresponding quantile-based correction derived from the model-observation mapping. Instead of directly fitting the full distribution of the future model, QDM quantifies the change at each quantile between the historical and future period model values at that same quantile level. These changes are then applied to the observed value at the corresponding quantile, retrieved using the inverse CDF of the observed data. This allows distribution biases to be corrected while maintaining quantile-specific climate change signals, thus preserving the sensitivity of the climate model. The univariate bias correction was performed using the QDM method available in the Multivariate Bias Correction (MBC) package in R. For each grid cell, drought indices from each member of the CESM-LE and CNRM are corrected independently, using their quantile location relative to the observed (ERA5) drought indices. Specifically, each value of SPEI48 and SRFI48, computed from each grid cell of every ensemble member of the CESM2-LE and CNRM datasets, within the period 1850-2100, is corrected as a single variable following the direct QDM approach, respectively. To correct the bias in SWSI48, we applied the univariate QDM method to the total water supply (precipitation-evapotranspiration + river discharge) at each grid cell of each ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, treated as a single aggregated time series rather than bias-correcting each individual component (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge). This aggregated variable represents the net variable water and is more relevant for capturing water scarcity as reflected in SWSI48. We could not apply the bias correction of the total water demand (consumption) due to the unavailability of consistent observed sectoral water use data across the historical period at the global scale.

To assess the effect of different bias correction strategies, we evaluated both pre- and post-processing approaches using CESM2-LE under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 14, post-processing (i.e., direct bias correction of SPEI, Supplementary Fig. 14c) better captures the distribution of SPEI from ERA5 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), while pre-processing (i.e., bias correction of precipitation and temperatures prior to computing the index; Supplementary Fig. 14d) tends to introduce additional bias, particularly by amplifying wet conditions. These results support the effectiveness of the post-processing approach in preserving the observed statistical properties of the drought indices.

Furthermore, we evaluated the distributional properties of the corrected indices using Q-Q plots, shown in Supplementary Fig. 14e–j. These plots compared the quantiles of SPEI48 from CESM2-LE (with and without correction) and ERA5, both at the global mean scale and for a representative grid point (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°). The Q-Q plot revealed that the bias-corrected indices closely follow the normal distribution, especially compared to the raw model output. At the grid level (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°), the correction successfully adjusted for extreme droughts and ensured consistency with observed drought characteristics.

Overall, our bias correction method effectively improves the distributional agreement between CESM2-LE and ERA5, while maintaining long-term trends. This provides a more accurate basis for assessing drought characteristics and their implications for water scarcity under historical and future climate conditions. As with most bias correction methods, QDM has limitations, as it assumes that model biases are relative to the present reference dataset, which may change in the future. Although this assumption simplifies the correction process, it may not hold under evolving climate conditions.

An important aspect of drought impacts is the availability of water in reservoirs. The onset of drought conditions and continuing water demand will also affect reservoir water levels. To assess the severity of the drought events, we have to also consider the Time for the Reservoir to Dry (TRD) as the ratio of the maximum capacity and the monthly average discharge at reservoir locations, by considering only the reservoirs with verified, good and fair quality index73, which represents 93% of the GRanD' reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. 5).

For human-made reservoirs, the maximum capacity refers to the maximum value of the storage capacity, and for natural lakes, it is the given lake level by Lehner et al.73. The lack of water level time series in the reservoirs makes it hard to estimate the time scales by which they might run dry. Instead of the available capacity of the reservoir (maximum minus minimum capacity), the maximum capacity was used because it was a readily available parameter for most reservoirs and due to the lack of the points layer of minimum capacity in the GRanD database. Moreover, climate change may alter the future operation of reservoirs, so using the maximum capacity is useful for assessing the suitability of water storage strategies. The TRD is similar to the resident time (time of water spent in reservoirs) and can be considered as the duration to take for a drought event to dry the water in the reservoirs if the only source of the water supply of the reservoirs is the depleted river flow during a drought period. This reflects hydrological drought situations in which rivers continue to flow, albeit at diminished levels insufficient to meet water demand, allowing assessment of how long reservoirs can sustain supply under such stress.

We define the compound multi-year drought, based on the IPCC104 definition of a compound event, as extended periods, often spanning several years (e.g., 48 months or 4 years for this study), during which multiple hydrological indicators, such as long-term rainfall deficiency, streamflow, water demand, and reservoir storage, experience simultaneous and persistent deficits. Here, these droughts are characterized by the concurrent occurrence of below-normal water availability across various hydrological systems, exacerbated by interrelated factors such as reduced precipitation with increased evapotranspiration (SPEI48), increase in water consumption (SWSI48), and depleted river flow (SRFI48). The compound nature of these events indicates the presence of multiple interacting drivers that collectively intensify water scarcity over a prolonged period.

We define “Day zero drought” (DZD) as an acute water scarcity event driven by a compound multi-year hydrological drought, during which water demand exceeds water supply under prolonged drought conditions. DZD occurs due to a critical imbalance between supply and demand, driven both by climate-induced reduction in supply and anthropogenic pressures increasing demand.

In fact, water can be retained in the reservoir through different parts of the hydrological cycle and different resident times (time of water spent in reservoirs) considered similar to TRD. As the river flow contributes to the long-term storage of water in the reservoir, we considered the river discharge to be an appropriate parameter. DZD is the impact of the simultaneous occurrence of a long-term (48-month) critical rainfall deficiency and extreme dearth of water of low-flow river discharge during a prolonged drought in the context of global warming and long duration exceeding the time for the reservoirs to run out of water. This is formalized as follows:

where \({{dur}}_{{ce}}\) is the duration of the compound extreme. The identification of DZD was carried out at each grid cell across each of the 100 members of the CESM2-LE model, offering a comprehensive and probabilistic perspective on future water scarcity risk.

However, global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the variability of the water cycle16, leading to increasingly frequent and severe fluctuations between excessively wet and dry periods17. Warmer climates are projected to enhance the evapotranspiration, resulting in dry conditions18. Additionally, reductions in precipitation and surface runoff are expected in many regions16, further increasing the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological droughts19,20,21,22. Moreover, population growth, economic development, and expansion of modern agriculture drive the rise in water consumption, placing additional pressure on water resources. Therefore, dry conditions driven by anthropogenic climate change and socio-economic development are jointly altering the global balance between water supply and demand, thereby amplifying the risk of DZD. Our concept distinguishes between drought and water scarcity, while also capturing their interaction in driving the DZD event. Drought refers to a reduction in water availability either through decreased precipitation, increased evaporation, or reduced river flow. In contrast, water scarcity arises when water demand exceeds the available water supply. Water Scarcity is often human-driven from anthropogenic pressure, such as population, growth, agricultural expansion, industrial use, and mismanagement of water resources. Water scarcity can occur even in the absence of climate change if water use is unsustainable. In this study, we focused on water scarcity driven by drought, where the reduction of water supply is driven by dry conditions. In this context, the water stress is considered as a result of a compound event due to atmospheric conditions (precipitation and evaporative demand; SPEI48), streamflow conditions (SRFI48), and demand condition (SWSI48) of 48-months occur with important depletion of water supply and increase of water demand; and where the duration of the event is longer than the time of the closest reservoirs to dry (TRD). This study offers a global-scale assessment of DZD emergence and its characteristics, capturing the interactions between climate human-driven factors.

Therefore, DZD is considered as an extreme water scarcity event, characterized by the fact that the water resources available in a region are largely below the limited reservoir's capacity compared to the pre-industrial period. This is attributed to both anthropogenic climate change and an increase in water use. To our knowledge, this study is the first global-scale assessment of the timing of the emergence of Day Zero Drought conditions and its characteristics. DZD is characterized by the concurrent exceedance of critical threshold in four indicators: (1) The standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48) below minus 1.5 (SPEI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviations, signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts to classify the arid atmospheric condition, through prolonged deficits in precipitation and increased evapotranspiration, leading to a long-term surface water stress and can significantly influence the change in groundwater (Supplementary Fig. 13). (2) The Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) below minus 1.5 (SRFI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviation), signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts, to detect the depletion of river flow conditions, representing the state of the severe drought in river flow during dry periods. (3) The Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) below 0.6 (SWSI48 ≤0.6) is used to quantify the imbalance between total water supply and demand and to represent the long-term average insufficiency of resources relative to demand during periods of drought, leading to an acute water scarcity. (4) The duration of the compound event (\({{{{\rm{dur}}}}}_{{{{\rm{ce}}}}}\)) exceeding the estimated time for reservoir depletion (TRD), when reservoirs exist. If no reservoir is present, the DZD is defined by the first three indicators. This framework reflects the reality that water scarcity emerges from the convergence of multiple stressors. Each indicator plays a distinct but interrelated role in defining DZD; therefore, none is weighted as more important than another. Their simultaneous exceedance is necessary to identify a DZD event, filtering out less severe or isolated events. For instance, precipitation deficits alone may not result in a crisis without demand pressure. i.e., in low low-demand case, just as high demand may not lead to scarcity if the supply is still enough. Similarly, even in the absence of climate variability, unsustainable consumption alone can trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource.

To evaluate the CESM2-LE ability to reproduce observed compound drought conditions, we compared the spatial distribution of compound hydrological extremes computed from the ERA5-Land reanalysis and CESM2-LE (ensemble mean of the number of compound hydrological events) data for the period 1979–2022. Specifically, we examined the number of occurrences where both 48-month scales of Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration (SPEI48) and Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) were less than or equal to −1.5. This threshold represents severe to extreme dry conditions. Instead of comparing the ToFE of compound events, we investigate the number of events of joint occurrences with \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5 \cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\). Due to the lack of observed data on total water consumption across all sectors (domestic, irrigation, industrial, electricity generation, livestock, and mining), we were unable to include the 48-month Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) in this observation comparison. The result (Supplementary Fig. 18) indicates that CESM-LE reasonably captures the spatial patterns of compound events defined by \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5 \cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\), as observed in ERA5. Although ERA5 exhibits slightly more compound events overall, the CESM2-LE ensemble mean estimates comparably and even exceeds ERA5 over China and Russia, indicating possible regional differences in model response.

In this study, we use the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) of the joint probability to define the Time of the First Emergence (ToFE) of the DZD. FAR has been found to be effective in identifying the anthropogenic signal behind extreme events105,106,107 such as DZD. According to Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al.105, FAR can be useful for understanding climate change signals, but more useful results are achieved by refocusing attribution questions on changes in impact return value and magnitude across large samples. To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of ToFE of the DZD relative to the anthropogenic signal with a predefined threshold of joint probability by FAR has not yet been carried out. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative method to assess the ToFE of compound extreme events by considering human-induced attribution. Few studies have used different alternatives to define or identify the ToFE when the hydrological drought differs from their past counterparts38. We are aware that even with such different methods, including our method here, uncertainties may arise, for example, due to internal variability108 or the considered scenarios109. By applying the FAR method, we measure the influence of anthropogenic climate change by comparing the probability of occurrence of DZD in the baseline period (pre-industrial period: 1850–1899) with the anthropogenic forcing period. We identify DZD events using a threshold-based approach, as outlined in Eq. (3). This ensures that the events are derived from the indices (SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48) and reflect extreme drought event conditions and acute water scarcity. By applying a threshold-based approach, we transform the continuous drought indices into distinct, binary events (e.g., DZD or no DZD). Which aligns with the requirements for FAR analysis. Once the DZD events are identified, the events are treated as independent occurrences, ensuring that the FAR method is aligned with its intended purpose of analyzing distinct extreme events. The calculation of the probability of the forcing events has been conducted on decadal time scales. The FAR is based on the change in the occurrence of an independent event, which is quantified by dividing the probability of independent DZD events in the future by the preindustrial condition.

Where \({P}_{{preindustrial}}\) represents the probability of the counterfactual scenario, which is calculated as the ratio between the total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensemble members during the preindustrial period (1850–1899) and the total number of samples within the same period (\({N}_{{preindustrial}}\)). While \({P}_{{forcing}}(t)\) represents the probability under the factual scenario, which is the ratio between the decadal total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensembles during each decade from 1900 to 2100 and the total number of samples during that decade (\({N}_{{forcing}}(t)\)). The ToFE of DZD is identified as the first decade in which the FAR is greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. 6). We computed the ToFE by considering the year of construction of a reservoir. Each reservoir has a different year of construction; therefore, if a reservoir existed in the considered grid point, the DZD detection period would extend from the year of completion to 2100. But if there is no reservoir, we use 1900–2100. Hence, we aim to detect events that have not occurred during the preindustrial period, but which will occur and intensify in the future as a result of anthropogenic global warming. In that sense, we identify unprecedented hydrological extreme events.

While the ToFE is an important measure of global warming impacts, its true impact is measured by how long these events last and how soon they will re-occur once they have emerged for the first time. The length of time of a DZD event is defined as the DZD duration, while the waiting time is identified as the time elapsed between the end of the previous event and the start of the next consecutive DZD event, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 8. To quantify these characteristics, we calculate the DZD duration and waiting time at each grid cell globally across the CESM2-LE for all ensemble members. We calculate the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE under anthropogenic influence until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated by the length of a DZD event once it occurs.

In addition, we assess the frequency of extreme DZD conditions, characterized by events that are both frequent and prolonged. Specifically, for each grid point and each ensemble member of CESM2-LE, we identify all DZD events occurring between the decade of ToFE and the year 2100. We then count the number of DZD event where its duration exceeds the waiting time, i.e., cases where the DZD event persists longer than the recovery period before the next event. These counts are aggregated at each grid across all 100 members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100. The frequency of extreme DZD conditions is computed at each grid cell as the ratio of the sum of these events to the total DZD events across all members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100 period. This spatially explicit frequency is then mapped globally (Fig. 3c) to highlight regions most vulnerable to sustained and recurrent DZD conditions.

For each DZD-prone region shown in central spatial map of Fig. 3, we then average the values across all grids located within the regions. To characterize the statistical distribution of these metrics, we fit probability density functions (PDFs) to the distributions of DZD duration and waiting time.

The ToFE depends partly on the used global warming scenario. In order to provide an alternative view, we also estimated the global warming levels at each DZD event emergence. We use the method proposed by Batibeniz et al.110 to calculate the GWL, but for this study, we consider the difference between the global 30-year climatology backward on the analyzed decade (1900–2100) and the global mean temperature of the pre-industrial period (1850–1899). The GWL is the value of the GWL in the decade of ToFE.

We tested the sensitivity of ToFE to six factors. Firstly, the threshold for defining the multi-year compound drought can influence the detection of DZD. Therefore, to test the robustness of the DZD definition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using different thresholds for SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 (Supplementary Fig. 10). First, we modified the SPEI48 threshold to be below −2 and kept SRFI48 below −1.5 and SWSI48 below 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10a, i). The ToFE emerges later than in Fig. 2a, particularly in Africa, where ToFE is sensitive to SPEI48, i.e., to the decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration. Next, we slightly changed SRFI48 to be below −1.6, SPEI48 to be below −2, and kept SWSI48 below 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10b, j). The ToFE remains almost the same, and the ToFE emerges later by increasing the severity of SRFI48 to be below −2 (Supplementary Fig. 10c, k), particularly in the northern part of Africa. Then, as we continued to modify SRFI48 so that it is less than −1 (Supplementary Fig. 10d, l), the ToFE becomes earlier than Fig. 2a, mostly in the northern part of Africa. The ToFE is sensitive to the severity of the streamflow drought in Africa. After that, we repeated the same analysis, but considering SWSI48 less than 1, SPEI48 less than −2, and SRFI48 below −1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 10e, m); while SRFI48 below 1.6 for Supplementary Fig. 10f, n. The results show that ToFE is more likely to start earlier than Fig. 2a in a few regions, meaning that ToFE is more likely to be sensitive to streamflow depletion (SRFI48) and increased water consumption (SWSI48). In the latter case, we kept SPEI48 below −1.5 and SRFI48 below −2 with SWSI48 below 1 for Supplementary Fig. 10g, o; and SWSI48 below 0.6 for Supplementary Fig. 10h, p. The results show the sensitivity of the ToFE to SRFI48 and SWSI48; thus, the ToFE emerges later than Fig. 2a in Africa but earlier in other regions. Therefore, we can conclude that the ToFE of DZD is more sensitive to the severity of decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration (SPEI48), the river flow drought (SRFI48) and increasing water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa, while increasing water consumption solely have an impact on the early emergence of ToFE in some parts of Asia and America, compared to the other factor. The SRFI48 and SWSI48 are more closely related to the actual availability of river flow and water use, respectively. When water demand rises, the available water supply (e.g., river flow, even if unaffected by precipitation) becomes insufficient to meet demand, triggering drought-like conditions (or water scarcity) in terms of availability.

Secondly, to assess whether the treatment of grid cells with and without (as defined in Eq. (3) for DZD) or solely without reservoir (DZD is defined as a compound event of \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\,\cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\cap {{{\rm{SWSI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}0.6\)), introduces inconsistencies in the spatial patterns of ToFE, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing ToFE patterns (Supplementary Fig. 12). The results reveal that spatial differences are negligible in most regions. The most noticeable delays are confined to the Mediterranean region, where major reservoirs constructions were completed mid- to late-twentieth century (Supplementary Fig. 6). As climate change influences the onset of compound events, it is critical for decision-makers to revisit the role of existing water infrastructure in future water security planning. The application of FAR greater than 0.99, combined with localized reservoir adjustment of DZD detection, ensures that the global ToFE pattern represents both high attribution confidence and hydrological realism, without introducing methodological biases between grid cells with and without reservoirs.

Thirdly, the estimation of the TRD may influence the ToFE of DZD. The TRD is considered as the duration to take for a multi-compound drought event to dry the water in the reservoirs if the only source of the water supply of the reservoirs is river flow during a drought period. Our approach seems to be reasonable, and we also checked the sensitivity of our assumption by doubling and quadrupling the TRD time scale (Supplementary Fig. 11). The results show that only a few regions have a small change of one decade with increased TRD. However, the TRD is also influenced by various socio-economic factors, such as water demand and the socio-economic sectoral usage, which we address using the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48). It is important to note that political decisions regarding management were not included in this modeling approach.

Fourthly, we have looked at the sensitivity of the time scale by considering the 36- and 60-month time scales (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16) of long-duration compound events for SPEI, SRFI, and SWSI. Only a few regions, located almost entirely in Africa, show changes in ToFE using a 36 or 60-month timescale of extreme events, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 17.

Fifthly, we look at the sensitivity of the ToFE relative to model structure across the CESM2-LE members. We repeat the analysis, looking at the model uncertainty by looking for the ToFE for each member in CESM2-LE, based on the following formulation of FAR below (Eq. (5)). This allows us to examine the spread of emerging timing of Fay Zero Droughts (DZD) and to evaluate the inter-member agreement as shown in Supplementary Fig. 20. The result exhibit, Supplementary Fig. 20a, substantial variability among ensemble members between 1900 and 1990, reflecting high uncertainty during this early period when the anthropogenic signal is still weak relative to internal variability, showing that structural uncertainty arising from the use of a single model remains an important caveat. However, a strong ensemble consensus emerged after 2000, with most members indicating emergence between 2020 and 2030, and increasing agreement toward the end of the twenty-first century. Individual ensemble members (thin green lines) show very synchronized emergence between 2030–2040. There is a sharp, narrow peak, indicating low ensemble spread and high confidence in ToFE under strong forcing. This coherence across members supports the robustness of our findings in terms of both timing and magnitude of anthropogenic influence on DZD events in CESM2-LE under SSP3-7.0.

Where \({P}_{{preindustrial},i}\) is the probability of the counterfactual for member i, which is the ratio between the summation of the event of the DZD event within the preindustrial period (1850-1899) and the number of samples within the same period (\({N}_{{preindustrial}}\)). While \({P}_{{forcing},i}(t)\) is the probability of the factual for member i, which is the ratio between the decadal summation of the frequency of the DZD event of the member i during each decade from 1900 to 2100 and the number of samples during the decade (\({N}_{{forcing}}(t)\)). The ToFE of DZD has been considered as the first decade of FAR greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs.

Sixthly, to evaluate the influence of model structural uncertainty on the ToFE of DZD events, we extended our analysis beyond CESM2-LE by using hydro-climatic data from the Centre National de Recherche Météorologiques (CNRM) models (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 with 1.4 ×1.4 degrees) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Specifically, we analyzed simulations under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, including monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, and river discharge data spanning 1850-2100. Due to the unavailability of water demand projections under SSP3-7.0, we used water consumption estimates from SSP3-RCP6.0 across the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM, which account for sectoral water use sectors such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, capturing socio-economic development water use demand. We applied the same methodology used for CESM2-LE. Computing the three key indicators, the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applying quantile delta mapping (QDM) bias correction using drought indices ERA5-based references. To ensure methodological consistency and data completeness, we selected 10 ensemble members from the CNRM model that include both atmospheric and river discharge variables across historical and both SSP2-45 and SSP3-7.0 future scenarios: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). We use the methods as structured estimates that enable consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial resolution of the datasets is interpolated to the CNRM atmospheric model resolution (1.4° x 1.4°) using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the Climate Data Operator78 (CDO).

The spatial patterns (Supplementary Fig. 21) reveal pronounced inter-model and scenario differences. Results from the CNRM model indicate that, under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, 51% of DZD-affected regions are projected to face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020–2030 (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Compared to CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 21a), which projects later DZD emergence and a more geographically confined hotspot, especially in the Mediterranean, the United States of America (USA), and Africa, the CNRM model (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c) shows earlier and more widespread emergence. The inter-model comparison (Supplementary Fig. 21d, e) reveals that CESM2-LE and CNRM disagree on the emergence of DZD in 76% of DZD-prone regions, indicating that emergence is detected in only one of the two models in some areas. Notably, 14% of ToFE show later emergence under CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 21d), even under the same forcing scenario (SSP3-7.0), suggesting that CESM2-LE is more conservative in detecting later emergence of compound hydrological extremes. However, CESM2-LE and CNRM agree on DZD occurrence across 24% of the DZD-prone land area, though within this overlap, CESM2-LE projects later emergence over 14% of the area and earlier emergence over 10% compared to CNRM. Moreover, ensemble spread within CNRM (Supplementary Fig. 20b, c) also illustrates the variability among the models to detect the water scarcity. The PDFs of individual members are more dispersed, with multiple peaks and flatter. The thick green line (representing ToFE derived from Eq. (4)) is broader and flatter, indicating the variability in ToFE across ensemble members, reflecting uncertainty in the timing of DZD emergence across members. This variability emphasized the challenge of detecting a robust probabilistic signal from a limited ensemble size. These findings highlight the critical role of model structural differences in shaping projections of hydrological extremes. Importantly, probabilistic attribution methods, such as the FAR, require large ensemble sizes to confidently characterize forced emergence signals. The relatively small ensemble available for CNRM under SSP3-7.0 limits the reliability of such analysis and reinforces the need for larger and more consistent multi-model ensemble frameworks to assess future water scarcity risks.

Finally, to assess the sensitivity of the ToFE of DZD relative to future socioeconomic scenarios, we applied our detection framework to hydro-climatic simulations from CMIP6 CNRM models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. We utilized the same ensemble members of the CNRM model to ensure consistency: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). The analysis incorporated available water consumption projections from five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM under SSP2-RCP4.5. The approach followed the same methodological steps as applied to CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 1). Specifically, we computed the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applied the bias correction method, QDM, using ERA5-based reference indices, and subsequently determined the ToFE. All datasets are interpolated to the CNRM atmospheric resolution (1.4° × 1.4°) using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the CDO. The results (Supplementary Fig. 20c) reveal substantial spread among ensemble members under CNRM SSP2-4.5, highlighting pronounced uncertainty in DZD emergence timing throughout the twenty-first century. Compared to the higher-emission SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 20b), the emergence is delayed and more dispersed, with broader PDFs and later peaks, suggesting that moderate forcings lead to slower distribution and less certain emergence of water scarcity extremes. When comparing the special pattern of ToFE under CNRM SSP2-4.5 with CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 21e), results show that high spatial disagreement of 76% of land areas exhibit uncertain DZD emergence, meaning that emergence is detected in only one of the models. Only 9% of regions show earlier emergence in CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0, while 14% indicate later emergence relative to CNRM SSP2-4.5. By considering the same model, CNRM, under different scenarios, SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 21f), the uncertainty still dominates but decreases to 43% of the land area, and spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios. Notably, the near-equal split between earlier and later emergence in different regions indicates that scenario choice (SSP3-7.0 vs. SSP2-4.5) may affect ToFE more symmetrically but also underscores the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to combined climate and water use stress. The results show that the influence of emission scenarios on DZD ToFE is region-specific, due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP3-7.0), DZD emergence can either advance or be delayed depending on the region. Notably, spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios, with 43% of the land area remaining uncertain between the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios within the CNRM model. However, both scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, agree on DZD emergence across 57% of the DZD-prone land area. Within this overlap, SSP3-7.0 projects later emergence over 17% of the area and earlier emergence over 18% compared to SSP2-4.5, while 22% of the area shows no change in the ToFE between the two scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 21f). These findings underscore the role of both scenario and model structures in shaping DZD emergence. Notably, even under high-forcing SSP3-7.0, CESM2-LE may still project later ToFE than CNRM under moderate forcing (SSP2-4.5), pointing to differences in model sensitivity to hydro-climatic stressors. This highlights the importance of multi-model and multi-scenario assessments when evaluating risks associated with extreme emergence and water scarcity. Furthermore, a probabilistic approach such as the FAR requires large ensembles to ensure robust estimates. The relatively small ensemble size of CNRM limits the confidence in scenario-attribution results, underscoring the need for ensemble expansion and multi-model convergence to improve attribution robustness and risk quantification. Given these model differences, CESM2-LE provides output at a higher spatial resolution (1.25° × 0.9375°) compared to the lower-resolution CNRM model (1.40625° × 1.40625°). CESM2-LE detects finer-scale features and localized extremes that may be overlooked or underrepresented in the CNRM. Therefore, we have not aggregated events across both CESM2-LE and CNRM, since increasing the CNRM resolution to the resolution of CESM2-LE could introduce spatial biases and distort the representation of extreme events.

Pregnant people have long relied on paracetamol for pain and fever. Credit: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty

The painkiller acetaminophen or paracetamol is one of the most widely taken drugs during pregnancy, used by roughly half of all pregnant people worldwide.

But today the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would slap a new warning label on the drug, citing a “possible association” between autism in children and the use of acetaminophen, also called Tyenol in the United States, during pregnancy. 

US President Donald Trump, however, was not as nuanced in his language: “Don't take Tylenol,” he said repeatedly in a widely anticipated announcement about autism. “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.

Autistic people show differences in social communication and interaction, and reported prevalence of autism has risen in some countries in recent decades. But many researchers who study autism caution that there is insufficient data to link autism and acetaminophen and that focusing on such a link is no more than a distraction.

Autism is on the rise: what's really behind the increase?

Autism is on the rise: what's really behind the increase?

“There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.”

At today's announcement, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, acknowledged that autism has many possible causes. FDA commissioner Martin Makary noted that, in some cases, insufficient transport of the nutrient folate into the brain has been linked with traits common in autism. The FDA today announced that it would initiate approval of a form of folate called leucovorin for people with low levels of folate in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. 

But Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, and Trump focused their attention today on two other factors that they said could be linked to autism: acetaminophen and vaccines. Decades of research have repeatedly found no reproducible link between vaccines and autism. 

“The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism,” says Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and executive director of PEAR-Net Society, a nonprofit advocating for maternal fetal health and research. “Suggesting otherwise may fuel misinformation and undermine confidence in safe treatments and immunizations.”

Here Nature examines the evidence for a link between acetaminophen, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism.

Scientists say that the most robust research does not link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy. “The better controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts, “And even then, what we're talking about is a minor association. … We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.”

Working out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of usage is not recorded in medical databases. This means researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable.

Confounding factors are an even bigger problem. Women who take paracetamol in pregnancy are usually in poorer health than those who don't, perhaps because they had an infection or an underlying condition. Any apparent link between acetaminophen and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors rather than the drug itself. Although scientists try to adjust for such confounders in their studies, such adjustments are “rarely sufficient,” Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results.

The study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data on nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country's extensive health records — data on acetaminophen prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses.

The study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy were autistic, compared to 1.33% of children who were not exposed ─ a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist.

The team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), one of whom had been exposed to acetaminophen and one who had not. Siblings share half of their genome, and share a similar upbringing and mother's background health, so any detected difference in autism between siblings is more likely to be due to the drug. The researchers found no association between acetaminophen and autism using this method — which supports the idea that links found in other studies were really explained by confounding factors.

Another large, high-quality study2 from Japan including over 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism.

A review3 of studies published in August in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism spectrum disorder.

“There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced, and unsupported by the most robust methods,” Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a UK press office.

“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” says a spokesperson for Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue Inc. in Summit, New Jersey.

Cell clusters that resemble the uterine lining grow with support cells in a synthetic hydrogel.Credit: Juan Gnecco, Linda G. Griffith

In 2017, Ashley Moffett, a reproductive immunologist, walked to the pharmacy near her laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK, to buy a pregnancy test. But it wasn't for Moffett. Her postdoc, Margherita Turco, had created what she thought might be the first cluster of cells capable of mimicking the tissue of the placenta — a placental organoid. But she needed a way to be sure.

The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health

The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health

“We must do a pregnancy test on them,” Moffett said.

If Turco was correct, the miniature ball of cells she had created would secrete HCG, the hormone that triggers a positive pregnancy test. “I took the stick, put it in, and it was positive,” says Turco, now a reproductive biologist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. “It was the best celebration.”

Scientists make organoids such as this by coaxing stem cells to grow in a jelly-like substance and to self-assemble into clumps of tissue. The typically hollow or solid balls of cells don't look anything like real organs. But they do take on key aspects of the organ that they're meant to represent — liver, brain, lung or stomach, for instance.

The mini-organs have the advantage of being more realistic than a 2D cell culture — the conventional in vitro workhorses — because they behave more like tissue. The cells divide, differentiate, communicate, respond to their environment and, just like in a real organ, die. And, because they contain human cells, they can be more representative than many animal models. “Animals are good models in the generalities, but they start to fall down in the particulars,” says Linda Griffith, a biological engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

Over the past decade, organoid research has exploded. Researchers have used them to study early brain development, test cancer therapies and much more. And these 3D models stand to become even more crucial as US agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, aim to move away from animal testing.

Women's health research lacks funding — these charts show how

Now researchers are using organoids to study female reproduction, an area in which animal models can be especially limited. Lab mice, for example, don't menstruate. And their placentas don't develop in the same way as human placentas do. That challenge, along with a historical lack of funding for women's health research, has left basic questions unanswered.

“I really see it as a powerful model to do science,” says Mirjana Kessler, a cell biologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed an organoid that mimics the fallopian tube1 and a biobank of ovarian cancer organoids2.

Organoids of the placenta, endometrium, ovary and vagina could help to reveal how these organs function, and what happens when things go awry.

 “There's so much work to do to understand the normal biology,” Turco says.

The placenta plays a key part in maternal health during pregnancy. Humans aren't the only species that develops a placenta, but the “human placenta is quite different than most other species, even primates actually, apart from apes”, says Moffett. Mice and humans, for example, both have placentas that invade the uterine lining, but the timing of development and the depth of invasion differ. Exactly what happens during the early days of placental development is still unclear, but problems at this stage can have serious consequences later.

One of the placenta's first jobs is to create a link between the mother and the developing embryo. To do this, the placenta invades the spiral arteries that feed the uterus3. The invasive cells open up the arteries, “essentially making a channel so that mom can provide what she needs through her blood supply”, says Victoria Roberts, a developmental biologist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might have female reproductive organs and might become pregnant. ‘Mother' is used in this article to reflect language used by the field.)

The process can be deadly if it goes wrong. If the placenta invades too deeply, a condition called placenta accreta, the expectant mother can lose too much blood during birth. And if the organ doesn't invade deeply enough, then the fetus might not get enough nutrients to sustain its growth.

Shallow invasion can also impact the mother's health. When the placenta doesn't get enough blood, research suggests it can become inflamed and secrete harmful factors into the mother's blood that trigger pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by protein build-up in the blood and dangerously high blood pressure4. Worldwide, 2–8% of pregnant people develop the condition. “It's a very serious pregnancy complication that goes silent and undetected until very late into pregnancy,” says Quinton Smith, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Irvine. The only way to cure the condition is to deliver the baby, even if that means a preterm birth.

To better understand the condition, Smith, Turco and other researchers are using organoids made of placental cells called trophoblasts to model the molecular processes involved. Turco is focused on the basic biology of how invasion is regulated, a process that seems to be controlled by both the fetus and the mother. “It's got to be a compromise,” Moffett says. “It's an absolute dialogue.”

Organoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases

That dialogue seems to be happening between the placenta and the uterine lining. As a case in point, when an embryo implants somewhere the lining doesn't exist — on a scar left by a previous caesarean delivery or in a fallopian tube, for example — “there's no control of the invasion at all”, Turco says.

Research suggests that immune cells called uterine natural killer cells have a key role in this conversation. The cells don't kill but instead send out chemical signals that help to regulate the invasion of the uterine lining.

When Turco, Moffett and their colleagues exposed the mini-placentas to these chemical signals and analysed which genes the cells expressed, they found that many were associated with pre-eclampsia5.

“I'm sure it's not the whole story,” Moffett says. “But it does show you how you can use those organoids to ask these fundamental questions about human pregnancy.”

Turco's first attempt to create a mini-placenta in 2016 didn't go as planned. The placental tissue she was working with contained not only trophoblasts, but also a few rogue maternal cells from the endometrium, the uterine lining that builds up and then sheds each month during menstruation. Those maternal cells “kept on growing and taking over”, she says. “It was a setback at that time.”

But now Turco sees it as a wonderful discovery, because she instead grew organoids that represent the endometrium6. This, along with another endometrial model published in the same year7, really opened the door for everyone else, says Griffith.

Griffith has been studying the endometrium for more than a decade. The research is personal. When Griffith hit puberty, she developed a debilitating condition called endometriosis. The disease, which affects about 10% of people with a uterus who are of reproductive age, occurs when endometrium-like tissue grows in places it doesn't belong.

Because this tissue is trapped inside the body, it can't be shed properly. Instead, it can irritate surrounding healthy tissue, causing inflammation, pain and scar tissue. Although existing therapies address some of the symptoms, they don't provide a cure.

Organoids are typically grown in Matrigel, a jelly-like substance extracted from mouse tumour cells that allows the cells to assemble into 3D structures. Griffith wanted to put epithelial cells, which compose the uterine lining, with stromal cells that support that lining. In the body, these cells need to communicate with each other to bring about the changes that occur with the monthly cycle. But Matrigel is packed with proteins that can hamper the cell-to-cell communication. So Griffith and her colleagues developed a hydrogel that's entirely synthetic8.

Griffith's team has also been working on the next step, a model of abnormal endometrial tissue that the researchers can use to test therapies for the condition. Because blood vessels are crucial to maintaining this tissue, Griffith knew she wanted to include them. To do this, she and her colleagues placed the organoid on a microfluidic chip surrounded by cells that form blood vessels. “We put all of these cells in together at the beginning in a gel, and the blood vessels form spontaneously,” she says. “So the organoids turn into lesion-like structures,” she adds. “It's actually kind of wild.”

Griffith and her team have created these model systems from the cells of about a dozen people with endometriosis, and they're beginning to use them to test compounds that could be promising therapies for the condition.

Turco, meanwhile, has developed her endometrial organoid into a model of menstruation9. Her team treated the endometrial organoids with hormones to mimic what happens when the endometrial lining is regenerating. Then the researchers stopped the hormones to mimic the start of menstruation. In the uterus, the lining breaks up naturally. In the model, however, the researchers break the organoids up mechanically. When the cells are put back into a gel, the organoids reform. “And you can keep doing this over and over again,” she says.

The circulating blood proteome holds immense potential for biomarker discovery and understanding disease mechanisms. Notable advances in mass spectrometry and affinity-based technologies have been made, but data integration across studies and platforms is hindered by the absence of unified analytical standards. This limitation impedes comprehensive exploration of human biology across diverse phenotypes and cohorts as well as the translation of findings into clinical applications. The disparities between datasets, stemming from a combination of factors related to differences in sample collection, pre-analytical handling, measurement methods and instrumentation, further complicate data integration. In this Perspective, we outline key challenges in blood-based proteomics and propose actionable strategies. Central to our recommendations are high-quality, technology-agnostic reference samples, which can bridge disparate datasets and enable robust cross-study comparisons. By fostering interconnected investigations across proteomic technologies, blood sample collections, clinical phenotypes and different populations, these references will accelerate the field and its translation.

Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases.

Bone marrow is a significant fat storage site across species, ranging from fish to mammals1. Adipocytes are a normal component of the bone marrow microenvironment and collectively form bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), which comprises over 70% of bone marrow volume and ~10% of total fat mass in lean, healthy adults2. BMAT further increases with age and in various pathological and iatrogenic conditions, including osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), radiotherapy, and glucocorticoid exposure2,3,4. Unlike other adipose depots, BMAT also expands in energy-deficient states such as anorexia nervosa and during controlled caloric restriction2,5,6,7,8. The molecular and functional characteristics of BMAT vary based on its skeletal location, with distinct differences between axial and appendicular bones2. Together, these observations show that BMAT is a normal feature of vertebrate anatomy that is altered in diverse pathophysiological contexts and has site-specific properties. However, compared to the study of white and brown adipose tissues, research on BMAT has been surprisingly limited2. Thus, the physiological and pathological roles of BMAT remain largely unknown.

Several methods allow non-invasive measurement of bone marrow adiposity. The gold standards are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with chemical shift-encoding for water–fat separation, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can each quantify the bone marrow fat fraction (BMFF)9,10. This has been done in numerous small-scale human cohort studies, providing some insights into how BMAT changes in specific pathophysiological contexts. A particular focus has been on ageing and related conditions, especially skeletal and metabolic diseases3,11. For instance, higher bone marrow adiposity at the lumbar spine has been linked to morphometric vertebral fractures and lower bone mineral density (BMD) in both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals3,11,12. However, these observational studies have never analyzed more than 729 participants13 and typically follow a case–control design for specific diseases, limiting the ability to detect other associations. Critically, whether BMAT directly influences the development and progression of musculoskeletal, metabolic or other diseases remains unknown.

To address these limitations, we developed a deep-learning algorithm for large-scale analysis of BMFF in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In what is the world's largest health imaging study, 100,000 UKBB participants are undergoing MRI of the brain, heart and whole body, as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure BMD14; imaging of all 100,000 participants was completed in July 2025. Our deep-learning method allows accurate and efficient measurement of BMFF within the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis13,15. These four sites cover the axial and appendicular skeleton and include major sites of fracture burden, ensuring that the BMFF measurements allow detection of site-specific and clinically relevant BMAT characteristics.

We have since applied our deep-learning models to measure BMFF of the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis in over 44,000 individuals15 and used these data for genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to identify the genetic variants associated with altered BMFF at each site15. Moreover, we established the associations between BMFF and age, body mass index (BMI), BMD, regional adiposity, and other physiological and anatomical traits15. Intriguingly, these genetic and anatomical associations often differ for BMFF across the four skeletal sites, underscoring the site-specific nature of BMAT formation and function.

Herein, we use our site-specific BMFF measurements and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from our GWAS to perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), thereby comprehensively identifying diseases associated with altered BMFF. Finally, we use Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) to establish evidence of causality between altered BMFF and human diseases. Together, these findings represent a groundbreaking advance in our understanding of the clinical relevance of BMAT.

The study design is presented in Fig. 1.

A Deep learning was used to segment the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis from MRI scans of participants in the UKBB imaging study, allowing BMFF measurements at each site. Genetic associates of BMFF were identified by genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAS), from which polygenic risk scores (PRS) were established for BMFF at each site. B, C PheCODES were used to classify disease outcomes for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The observational PheWAS (Obs-PheWAS) (B) used BMFF as the predictor, while PRS-PheWAS (C) used PRS as the predictor. D Mendelian Randomization was done, including the Bayesian MR-HORSE method, to assess causal relationships between BMFF at each site and osteoporosis, fracture, and type 2 diabetes.

A total of 10,750 unique International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) and 3113 ICD-9 codes were summarized from hospital inpatient, cancer registry, and death registry data of the UKBB cohort. The ICD codes were mapped into PheCODE groups16, which included 1808 PheCODEs classified into 17 disease categories [e.g., genitourinary diseases = 173 (9.57%); circulatory diseases = 171 (9.46%); endocrine/metabolic diseases = 169 (9.35%); digestive diseases = 162 (8.96%); neoplasms = 140 (7.74%); musculoskeletal diseases = 132 (7.30%); injuries & poisonings = 120 (6.64%); dermatologic diseases = 95 (5.25%); neurological diseases = 84 (4.65%)].

In Obs-PheWAS, the exposure was the rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region, as measured by our deep-learning models13,15. The outcomes were PheCODEs for incident disease cases diagnosed at least six months after participants underwent the MRI scan. Obs-PheWAS sample quality control is shown in Supplementary Data 1, while the PheCODEs used for Obs-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 2. Associations were considered statistically significant after applying FDR correction. The baseline characteristics of the Obs-PheWAS sample for each bone region are summarized in Table 1 (femoral head: N = 45,288; total hip: N = 45,187; diaphysis: N = 44,099; spine: N = 48,427).

In the femoral head Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', but with decreased risk of acute renal failure and osteoarthritis (Table 2; Fig. 2).

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) q value threshold of 0.05.

Labels of disease names are shown for all significant diseases (FDR < 0.05); those in blue font have an odds ratio (OR) < 1, while those in red font have OR > 1. Disease categories are shown on the vertical axis, with categories distinguished by alternating gray/white shading; the widths of these gray or white bars are proportional to the number of diseases analyzed within each category. The disease categories “Congenital abnormalities” and “Pregnancy complications” had zero incident cases and so are not shown. For each region, the dashed vertical lines indicate FDR (0.05) (dashed black line) or the Bonferroni-adjusted P value (dashed orange line).

The list beside the diagram shows the disease names shared for two, three, or all four regions. Further details are in Table 2 and Supplementary Data 2−3.

In the total hip Obs-PheWAS, eleven PheCODEs, spanning nine disease groups, were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. 2). Among these, higher total hip BMFF was associated with increased risk of musculoskeletal diseases (osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage) but decreased risk of nine other diseases (T2D, essential hypertension, obesity, sepsis, septicemia, acute renal failure, cholelithiasis, chronic airway obstruction, and malignant neoplasm of female breast). It is helpful to note that “chronic airway obstruction” maps to ICD-10 codes J44.8/J44.9, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hereafter, we refer to ‘chronic airway obstruction' as COPD.

The diaphysis Obs-PheWAS identified two PheCODEs, increased risk of osteoporosis and decreased risk of T2D, that were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. 2).

In the spine Obs-PheWAS, 40 PheCODEs were associated with higher BMFF. These could be categorized into ten disease groups and included diseases such as osteoporosis, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', spondylosis without myelopathy, spinal stenosis, T2D, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, gout, two benign neoplasms, and several cardiovascular conditions (Table 2; Fig. 2). The strongest effects were observed for COPD and osteoporosis, as well as metabolic diseases such as T2D and hyperlipidemia. Unlike for each femoral region, spine BMFF was also associated with numerous diseases affecting the circulatory system, digestive system, and sense organs (Table 2; Fig. 2). Moreover, whereas femoral BMFF was associated with decreased risk of some diseases, spine BMFF was associated with increased risk of all the identified disease groups.

Among all of the BMFF-associated PheCODEs identified by Obs-PheWAS, six were shared between two or more bone regions (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Data 3). Osteoporosis was the one significant PheCODE with consistent direction of effect for all four bone regions, in each case showing a positive association with BMFF (Table 2; Supplementary Data 3). Another musculoskeletal PheCODE, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', was positively associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, and spine. T2D showed consistent negative associations with BMFF in the femoral head and total hip, but a positive association in the spine. Importantly, both spine BMFF and total hip BMFF remained significantly associated with T2D even after controlling for variation in visceral adipose tissue or overall peripheral adiposity, each of which is an independent risk factor for T2D17,18 (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, these associations between BMFF and T2D are independent of adiposity outside of the bone marrow.

The three remaining PheCODEs shared for two bone regions were COPD, acute renal failure, and osteoarthritis. Intriguingly, each of these diseases was associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head, total hip, and/or diaphysis (Table 2; Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 3). These findings support the concept that the functions and clinical implications of BMAT vary depending on the skeletal site.

For each bone region, we also conducted a sensitivity PheWAS analysis that included both incident and prevalent cases. This identified a total of 35, 43, 14, and 142 significant PheCODEs (FDR q < 0.05) associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine, respectively (Supplementary Data 5; Supplementary Figs. 1–5). This analysis identified additional associations with fracture and site-specific associations with osteoarthritis, several cancers, chronic kidney disease, and various circulatory, digestive, genitourinary, and respiratory conditions. Forty-two PheCODEs were identified for two or more bone regions (Supplementary Data 6), and five PheCODEs showed significant associations for all four bone regions (osteoporosis, fracture of radius and ulna, T2D, gout, and essential hypertension) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The direction of effect for all overlapping diseases was consistent between the main Obs-PheWAS and the sensitivity Obs-PheWAS.

To investigate if any BMFF-associated diseases are sex-specific, we conducted the main (incident cases) and sensitivity Obs-PheWAS (incident + prevalent cases), stratified by sex, for the four bone regions. In males, one significant PheCODE was associated with BMFF in the femoral head, two in the total hip, none in the diaphysis, and 19 in the spine. In females, four, seven, three, and 11 significant PheCODEs were associated with BMFF in these respective bone regions (Supplementary Data 7).

The majority of identified significant diseases were also found in the sex-combined Obs-PheWAS (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7). In the spine, four PheCODEs, including T2D, hypercholesterolemia, other mental disorders, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), were positively associated with BMFF in both male and female groups. ‘Essential hypertension' and ‘iron deficiency anemia' were associated with spine BMFF in males, but not in females or in the sexes combined. All other significant PheCODEs identified for spine BMFF in the sex-sensitivity analysis were also observed in the sex-combined analysis (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7-8).

In contrast to spine BMFF, the incident diseases associated with BMFF at each femoral site were sex-specific, with no overlap between males and females (Supplementary Data 7). When prevalent cases were included, there was some male-female overlap among the diseases associated with each femoral site; for these diseases, the directions of the associations with BMFF were the same in each sex (Supplementary Data 9-10).

To further explore the clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity, we generated PRSs for BMFF at each bone region and used these as the exposures for PRS-PheWAS across the larger UKBB cohort. We generated two PRSs, PRS1 and PRS2, for each bone region (Table 3). PRS1 included all SNPs that passed quality control (Supplementary Data 11). The same SNPs were used in PRS2, except that any SNPs independently associated with BMD were excluded (Supplementary Data 12). The rationale for this is that BMD-associated SNPs could confound the detection of associations between each BMFF PRS and osteoporosis, which was the disease most consistently associated with BMFF in our Obs-PheWAS. The only exception was for diaphysis, in which PRS1 contained no BMD-associated SNPs; hence, PRS2 was not required for this site. The quality control of genetic IVs (SNPs) and samples used to construct PRSs for each bone region is described in Supplementary Data 11–13, with the SNPs (rsid, chromosome, position, beta, R2, F-statistics) used to generate each PRS described in Supplementary Data 14-15. The linear regression of PRS on BMFF in each bone region, stratified by sex, is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. Positive associations were observed, with β coefficients (log OR) ranging from 0.189 to 0.381 (P < 2 × 10−16).

PRS-PheWAS was performed using PRS1 for each of the four bone regions, and PRS2 for femoral head, total hip, and spine, giving a total of seven separate PheWASes. The PheCODEs used for PRS-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 16, while the baseline characteristics of each PRS-PheWAS sample for each bone region are summarized in Table 3. PheCODEs significantly associated with PRS1 or PRS2, after FDR correction, are presented in Table 4.

In the femoral head PRS-PheWAS, nine PheCODEs in four disease categories were associated with PRS1, including negative associations with two neoplastic diseases and positive associations with osteoporosis, fracture of humerus, and viral pneumonia (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the total hip PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs were associated with PRS1. Higher genetically predicted BMFF was associated with lower risk of myeloproliferative disease and ‘other derangement of joint', but with higher risk of three musculoskeletal diseases: osteoporosis, pyogenic arthritis, and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the femoral diaphysis PRS-PheWAS, eight PheCODEs, spanning five disease groups, were associated with PRS1. Positive associations were observed with osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; esophagitis, GERD and related diseases; late effects of cerebrovascular disease; and fracture of the radius and ulna, hand or wrist, and femoral neck. In contrast, diaphysis PRS1 was negatively associated only with spinal stenosis (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the spine PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs demonstrated positive associations with PRS1, including osteoporosis and four PheCODEs for fractures at different skeletal sites; no PheCODEs were negatively associated with spine PRS1 (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

We found a high degree of overlap in significant PheCODEs identified across the two PRSs (Table 4; Fig. 3). PRS2 was associated with the same PheCODEs, with the same effect directions, as PRS1 for each site in the total hip, diaphysis, and spine; there were no major discrepancies in the association effect sizes, with a median OR difference of ~0.001. The only disparities for PRS1 vs PRS2 occurred for the femoral head, for which PRS1 was positively associated with both fracture of humerus and viral pneumonia, but PRS2 was not. Therefore, the BMD-associated SNPs, which were excluded from PRS2, have minimal influence on the PRS-PheWAS outcomes for each bone region.

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components. We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini–Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses. A–D Volcano plots show odds ratios (OR) and −log10(P) values for PheCODE diseases associated with femoral head PRS2 (A), total hip PRS2 (B), diaphysis PRS1 (C), and spine PRS2 (D). For PRS2, each PRS was first calculated based on significant SNPs from meta-GWAS after QC; SNPs independently associated with BMD were then excluded from the instrumental variants selected. PRS2 for diaphysis was not calculated due to the absence of a corresponding BMD GWAS. Each dot represents a disease, with the x axis indicating the OR and the y axis showing the—log10(p) (two-sided). Labels of disease names are shown for all significant diseases (FDR < 0.05); significant associations with OR < 1 are shown as blue dots; those with OR > 1 are red dots; and non-significant associations are shown as gray dots. For each region, the dashed horizontal line indicates the FDR threshold. Forest plots beneath each volcano plot are included to show the OR (red or blue circles) with 95% CIs. Further details are in Table 4 and Supplementary Data 16, 17. Volcano plots for PRS1-PheWAS are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Among all diseases identified by PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, only three were common to two or more bone regions. Higher BMFF-PRS was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis for all four bone regions, with this relationship being stronger for each femoral site than for the spine (Supplementary Data 17). Fracture of radius and ulna was positively associated with each PRS for the diaphysis and spine, whereas ‘other derangement of joint' was inversely associated with each PRS for the femoral head and total hip (Supplementary Data 17). Together, these PRS-PheWAS analyses demonstrate that genetic markers of altered BMFF can be leveraged to further identify BMFF-associated diseases.

In the sex-sensitivity PRS-PheWAS, no significant disease outcomes were identified as male-specific after FDR-q correction, and no diseases were associated with spine PRS1 or PRS2 in females (Supplementary Data 18). However, in females, several diseases were associated with PRS1 for the femoral head, total hip and diaphysis, and these overlapped entirely with the diseases associated with PRS2 for each of these sites (Supplementary Data 18). Among these, only osteoporosis was shared for all three femoral bone regions, for which higher BMFF PRS1 and PRS2 were consistently associated with the increased osteoporosis risk (Supplementary Data 19).

Consistent positive associations with osteoporosis were found for BMFF in all four bone regions in both Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS. In addition, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' were identified with increased disease risk for total hip BMFF (Supplementary Data 20).

The performance of BMFF-PRSs in predicting the risk of osteoporosis was evaluated across the four bone regions (Supplementary Data 21). The corrected C-statistics of PRS1 and PRS2 in each bone region were around 0.771, indicating a moderate-to-good discrimination of individuals with and without osteoporosis. There was no statistical difference in the predictive accuracy between PRS1 and PRS2 (ROC test P > 0.05).

We conducted two-sample MR to test if there is evidence of causality between altered BMFF and three of the diseases identified from our PheWAS analyses (Tables 5–7). Instrumental variables (IVs) were selected under two linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping thresholds (r² < 0.001 or r² < 0.6) to evaluate robustness to variant correlation. Among all the PheCODEs identified from Obs-PheWAS, PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis was the only disease consistently associated with all four bone regions (Supplementary Data 20). Fracture-related PheCODEs were also prominent among the PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS results, while Obs-PheWAS revealed strong associations, in varying directions, between BMFF and T2D in total hip, diaphysis and spine (Table 2). Each of these diseases (osteoporosis, fractures, and T2D) has been a focus of previous BMAT research2,3,4 and each imposes a substantial burden on public health. Therefore, we focused our MR analyses on these three diseases.

In the MR analysis, the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic variants ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions, indicating that genetically predicted BMFF is a robust IV for the MR analysis (Supplementary Data 15, 22, 23 and 24).

The causal association of BMFF genetic predisposition with osteoporosis is summarized in Table 5. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), positive associations with osteoporosis were found for total hip BMFF and diaphysis BMFF based on the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and for diaphysis BMFF based on MR-Horse. Moreover, consistent positive associations were detected for all three femoral sites when the less-stringent LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied (Supplementary Data 25). However, no causal association was found in the spine, regardless of the r2 threshold used. As outlined in the Discussion, the lack of causality for spine BMFF is surprising and could have several explanations, including osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB being driven more by bone loss in the hip than in the spine. The Cochran's Q statistic of MR-Egger and IVW methods indicated heterogeneity (Table 5, Supplementary Data 25). However, MR-Egger intercept in the analysis showed no horizontal pleiotropy for each bone region. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots for these analyses are presented in Supplementary Figs. 8–23. The results were also consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 10, 14, 18, 22; Supplementary Data 22, 26). The association of osteoporosis remained the same in the MR-PRESSO analyses (Supplementary Data 27) after removal of outliers, for the femoral sites. There was no difference in MR-PRESSO outlier correction-adjusted causal estimates. The MR-PRESSO global test indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Distortion coefficients for femoral head, total hip, and diaphysis were non-significant, suggesting more robust estimates after outlier correction.

The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with fractures is summarized in Table 6. Each of the MR methods found no significant causal associations for any of the four bone regions when using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r² <0.001). However, when the more lenient LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied, IVW and MR-Horse showed positive associations with fractures for all three femoral sites (Supplementary Data 28). Horizontal pleiotropy was found only in MR for the femoral head (P = 0.015) when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots are presented in Supplementary Figs. 24–39. The results were consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 26, 30, 34, 38; Supplementary Data 23, 29). MR-PRESSO analyses (Supplementary Data 27) also supported the positive causal associations with fractures in femoral head and total hip. MR-PRESSO global test found evidence of heterogeneity only for the diaphysis when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold.

The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with T2D is summarized in Table 7. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), none of the MR methods found significant causal associations in any of the four bone regions. At the less-stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.6), the findings suggested negative associations with T2D in the total hip and diaphysis, whereas MR-Horse observed a positive association between BMFF genetic liability and T2D in the spine (Supplementary Data 30). Evidence of heterogeneity was detected across all regions, but pleiotropy (Egger intercept) was not significant in most cases (only P-diaphysis = 0.022 for MR using r2 < 0.6), supporting the validity of the causal estimates. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots are presented in Supplementary Figs. 40–55. The results remained consistent in leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 42, 46, 50, 54; Supplementary Data 24, 31). The MR-PRESSO global test (Supplementary Data 27) indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Only the diaphysis region found a significant distortion coefficient under all r2 thresholds, indicating potential influence from outliers. Overall, the association of T2D remained consistent in the MR-PRESSO analyses after removal of outliers.

Finally, to assess whether BMI adjustment introduced collider bias in the MR, we compared MR results (r2 < 0.001) based on IVs from meta-GWAS with and without BMI adjustment15. We found no distinct discrepancies in the comparisons (Supplementary Data 32–34), with the effect estimates remaining directionally consistent between BMI-adjusted and unadjusted analyses (Osteoporosis: median OR difference = 0.027; Fractures: median OR difference = 0.022; T2D: median OR difference = 0.004). Thus, BMI adjustment does not significantly alter the MR results.

Our understanding of the diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity has been based on smaller-scale studies incapable of comprehensively revealing the pathophysiological relevance of BMAT. These have typically used case-control designs addressing specific pathophysiological contexts; have lacked comprehensive healthcare records and genotype data for participants; often focused on only one or two skeletal sites; and have never exceeded more than 729 individuals13. Herein, we have overcome these limitations by using our deep-learning measurements of BMFF at the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 44,000 participants in the UKBB, as well as establishing PRSs for BMFF at each of these sites. Our Obs-PheWAS provides a systematic identification of the clinical conditions associated with altered BMFF at each site, while our PRS-PheWAS demonstrates the utility of genetic markers of altered BMFF for further elucidating clinical associations. These analyses greatly extend the scope of diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity. Finally, our MR studies reveal that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the total hip and femoral diaphysis is causally associated with osteoporosis and suggest that spine and femoral BMFF may also be causally associated with fractures and T2D. Together, these findings substantially advance understanding of the impact of BMAT on human health and disease.

The entire scope of BMFF-associated diseases is too extensive to discuss here in full; hence, below we consider those of particular interest.

Across all the BMFF-associated diseases, the relationship with osteoporosis (PheCODE 743.11) is among the strongest and most consistent. This PheCODE includes ICD-9 code 733.00 (Osteoporosis NOS) and ICD-10 codes M81, M81.0, M81.6 and M81.8, which refer to age-related, localized, or “other” osteoporosis, without current pathological fractures. From our incident Obs-PheWAS, PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis is the only disease associated with BMFF at all four sites. This extends numerous reports of the inverse relationship between bone marrow adiposity and BMD3, including our recent population-scale findings in the UKBB15. The persistence of this relationship in our PRS2-PheWAS is intriguing because PRS2 excludes BMD-associated SNPs, demonstrating that the relationship between genetically predicted BMFF and osteoporosis is independent of genetic markers of altered BMD.

Our PheWAS and MR findings confirm and greatly extend previous observations, as well as strengthen the evidence of causality between increased BMFF and osteoporosis in humans. Intriguingly, the observed causal association exists for BMFF at each femoral site, particularly when using the more lenient LD threshold, but not for spine BMFF. This is consistent with our PheWAS findings, which show weaker BMFF-osteoporosis relationships for the spine than for each femoral site; however, it is surprising given our finding that spine BMFF has a robust inverse association with spine BMD15. This discordance could result from an indirect relationship between BMFF and BMD in the spine: either increased spine BMFF is a consequence, rather than a cause, of lower BMD, or these are independent effects driven simultaneously by other factors. However, another possibility is that osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB are driven more by decreased BMD in the hip than in the spine. Indeed, BMD T-scores across the UKBB population are lower in the proximal femur than in the spine (see UKBB data fields 23300 vs 23205, respectively), echoing observations in other aged populations19. If low spine BMD plays a lesser role in UKBB osteoporosis cases, this may explain our finding that increased spine BMFF has no causal association with osteoporosis, despite its robust association with decreased spine BMD.

Among the femoral sites, the causal association with osteoporosis is strongest for diaphysis BMFF. The biological reasons for this are unclear but may result from site-specific differences in BMAT formation and function2,20,21. For example, bone marrow adipocytes secrete a range of anti-osteogenic and/or pro-resorptive factors2, and this may differ between the diaphysis and the proximal femur. Another theory is that, because BM adipocytes and osteoblasts derive from a common progenitor (the skeletal stem cell), any increase in adipogenesis will necessarily come at the expense of osteogenesis2. Indeed, site-specific differences in human skeletal stem cells have recently been identified22. Thus, another possibility is that the balance between adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis varies across skeletal sites, contributing to site-specific differences in the BMFF-osteoporosis relationship. Notably, relatively few studies measure bone marrow adiposity in the femoral diaphysis, instead focusing on the spine and proximal femur3. These site-specific differences may also help to inform the potential of using bone marrow adiposity to improve clinical management of osteoporosis.

Another key finding is that genetically predicted BMFF is associated with fractures, with MR providing evidence for causality when using the more lenient LD threshold. This is important because fractures impose a huge burden on public health23 and, although BMD is a major determinant of fracture risk, most fractures occur in people without osteoporosis24. This highlights the need for improved fracture prediction, which has motivated research into bone marrow adiposity as a fracture risk factor3. Previous studies show that increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with prevalent vertebral fracture in men, independently of BMD25, and with incident bone loss in elderly women26. However, others report that bone marrow adiposity in vertebrae and the proximal femur does not differ between subjects with and without prevalent fracture27,28,29. Moreover, the largest previous study of bone marrow adiposity and incident fracture included 298 men and women but found no association between vertebral bone marrow adiposity and incident fractures in either sex26. This is similar to our main Obs-PheWAS results, in which there are no associations between BMFF and incident fractures, regardless of BMFF site or fracture type. However, the lack of associations with incident fracture is likely explained by the low fracture rates in the UKBB. Indeed, among all incident fractures, even the most common subtype (fracture of the radius and ulna) has <200 incident cases (Supplementary Data 35), which is below the threshold for inclusion as a PheWAS outcome. This threshold is exceeded for many fracture subtypes in our sensitivity PheWASes (Supplementary Data 36), which show robust positive associations between fractures and BMFF at each site; for spine and diaphysis, this is replicated in our PRS-PheWAS. The associations with fracture in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS may also be due to reverse causality; hence, in the future, it will be important to conduct even larger studies to increase the power to detect associations between BMFF and incident fractures. Nevertheless, our findings highlight roles for diaphyseal BMFF, which previous studies have overlooked, and show that genetically predicted BMFF is positively associated with fracture, independent of genetic predictors of BMD.

As for osteoporosis, our MR results for fracture represent a major advance in knowledge because they demonstrate evidence of causality. These causal associations are stronger for each femoral site than for spine BMFF, echoing our MR findings for osteoporosis. Indeed, it is intriguing that spine BMFF may directly affect fractures but not osteoporosis. This underscores the concept that factors influencing bone quality, beyond BMD, contribute to fracture pathogenesis30,31. However, causality was not observed using the more stringent MR LD threshold (r2 < 0.001), highlighting the need for stronger IVs to test causal associations. It will also be important for future studies to establish how increased BMFF at each site impacts bone quality and thereby contributes to fracture risk, and if bone marrow adiposity, and/or its genetic surrogates, can improve fracture prediction beyond traditional risk factors.

In addition to musculoskeletal diseases, the relationship between bone marrow adiposity and T2D has attracted increasing attention4. Several previous studies report increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in T2D, including obese subjects32,33, non-obese women34, and older men35. In contrast, a recent larger study found only a trend for increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity36, while earlier research detected no differences between control and T2D subjects27,37,38. However, the largest of these studies included only 199 people36, and most have focused only on bone marrow adiposity in the spine, overlooking appendicular bones. Our present observations, therefore, substantially advance understanding of this relationship through large-scale analyses of multiple skeletal sites.

Perhaps our most intriguing finding is that, unlike osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship with T2D is positive for spine BMFF but negative for each femoral site, particularly for the total hip. This divergence between the spine and femur occurs for several other T2D-associated diseases, including obesity and gout39. It is also consistent with recent research from Badr et al., which found that, unlike for vertebrae, proximal femoral bone marrow adiposity is lower in T2D patients vs controls36. One possibility is that these BMFF-T2D associations are confounded by common associations with peripheral adiposity traits. Indeed, T2D is strongly associated with adipose distribution, with excessive visceral adiposity being a major risk factor for this disease17,18. Moreover, we previously demonstrated that spine BMFF is positively associated with total body fat % and visceral adiposity, whereas total hip and diaphysis BMFF are each negatively associated with visceral adiposity and have variable relationships with other adiposity traits15. However, we show that the BMFF-T2D associations for spine and total hip BMFF persist even after controlling for peripheral adiposity. Thus, BMFF at these sites is significantly associated with T2D incidence, independently of adiposity outside of the bone marrow.

The strength of the associations with T2D is further demonstrated by our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS, in which T2D is the most-significant association for femoral head, total hip and spine, and the second most-significant for diaphysis BMFF. Even when focusing on incident cases, T2D is among the diseases most strongly associated with spine BMFF, with an OR similar to that for osteoporosis. Our MR results further suggest that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the spine, total hip, and diaphysis has direct causal associations with T2D that mirror the site-specific PheWAS relationships. Importantly, these causal associations are significant only when using the more lenient LD threshold, again underscoring the need for future, larger-scale BMFF GWAS to allow stronger IVs to be established. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to speculate how femoral and spinal BMFF might exert divergent effects on the pathogenesis of T2D. One possibility is that femoral BMAT is a site of safer, more metabolically inert lipid storage, analogous to gluteo-femoral adipose tissue, whereas spinal BMAT is akin to more metabolically active visceral adipose tissue, releasing metabolites and endocrine factors that promote insulin resistance18. Clearly, it will be important to establish the differences between spinal and femoral BMAT, both on molecular and functional levels, to better understand the relationships between BMAT and T2D.

In addition to osteoporosis and fracture, we reveal further associations between BMFF and other musculoskeletal conditions. One of the most consistent relationships is with ‘Other disorders of bone and cartilage' (PheCODE 733), which is positively associated with BMFF in the spine, femoral head, and total hip. This association is complex to interpret because this PheCODE includes 373 different ICD-10 codes, with diseases as diverse as hypertrophy of bone, osteolysis, skeletal fluorosis, chondromalacia, and physeal arrest. It will be important to determine if the BMFF associations are spread across these conditions or are focused on a subset of diseases within this broad category.

Another common musculoskeletal association is osteoarthritis. Compared to osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship between BMAT and osteoarthritis has received relatively little attention40. Our findings are important because they reveal that osteoarthritis is positively associated with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head or total hip. The latter is consistent with one small human study of osteoarthritic patients, which found that proximal femoral BMFF decreases with increasing disease severity41. In contrast, increased bone marrow adiposity was observed in the tibial and femoral epiphyses in a mouse model of osteoarthritis42. Thus, alternative mouse models may be needed to study the site-specific BMAT-osteoarthritis relationships that exist in humans. Our PRS-PheWAS also shows that monoarthritis is inversely associated with BMFF in the femoral head, suggesting a robust relationship between femoral head BMFF and different forms of arthritis. Understanding whether BMAT directly impacts arthritis incidence and progression will be an important goal for future research.

The earliest studies of bone marrow adipocytes focused on their relationship with hematopoiesis2,43. Therefore, it is notable that our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS identifies associations with several hematological diseases, including anemias and neutropenia. The positive association between these diseases and spine BMFF is consistent with longstanding observations of an inverse relationship between hematopoiesis and BMAT expansion2,43; however, these diseases are also negatively associated with femoral head BMFF. This disparity may result from site-dependent differences in bone marrow adipocyte function, as reported for regenerative hematopoiesis in mouse models2,43. Beyond these diseases, our PheWASes also identify associations with several hematological cancers, as discussed below.

Our findings are also relevant to the links between marrow adiposity and cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that bone marrow adiposity influences tumor development and progression, including for hematological cancers and bone metastases of solid tumors2,44,45. In particular, bone marrow adipocytes secrete factors that promote the migration, viability, and/or survival of multiple myeloma cells, leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia, and metastases from breast or prostate tumors2,44,45,46,47. Bone marrow adipocytes also promote a quiescent state in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, helping them to evade chemotherapy48. For some of these cancers, altered bone marrow adiposity has been reported in smaller-scale clinical studies2,44,45,49,50; however, our study is notable because it identifies associations across such a large population, and for BMFF at multiple sites.

Our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS findings reveal positive associations between total hip BMFF and prostate cancer, and between spine BMFF and both malignant breast cancer and bone metastases. These results are consistent with the above preclinical findings and with one report of increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in breast cancer patients49. The positive association between chemotherapy and spine BMFF, and between ‘effects of radiation' and both spine and total hip BMFF, echoes longstanding reports of increased bone marrow adiposity following cancer treatment2. Thus, the positive BMFF-cancer associations observed in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS could represent confounding effects of cancer therapy and/or reverse causality, with these diseases directly increasing bone marrow adiposity. In contrast to the above cancers, we also reveal a negative association between total hip BMFF and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This extends our previous observation of extremely low femoral BMFF in some people with this disease13. Notably, unlike for the spine, total hip BMFF is negatively associated with malignant breast cancer; hence, it is important to take account of skeletal site when considering BMA-cancer relationships.

In addition to these Obs-PheWAS results, our PRS-PheWAS identifies a positive association between diaphysis BMFF and multiple myeloma. This contrasts with one small study that found a trend for lower axial bone marrow adiposity in multiple myeloma patients50 but extends observations from mouse models that show increased tibial bone marrow adiposity in early-stage myeloma47. Thus, the BMFF-myeloma relationship may vary across skeletal sites. This is important because changes in bone marrow adiposity may identify patients at risk of multiple myeloma progression51. In contrast, we find no associations with leukemias, despite reports of decreased bone marrow adiposity in chronic lymphoid, acute lymphoid, and chronic myeloid leukemia2,44,48; multiple myeloma is also absent from our Obs-PheWAS results. This may reflect insufficient statistical power caused by the low incidence and prevalence of these conditions among the UKBB population52. Despite this limitation, we extend the number of neoplastic conditions that are associated with bone marrow adiposity. Therefore, our findings should inform future efforts to determine if bone marrow adiposity directly influences cancer incidence and/or progression.

Unlike the above disease classes, few studies report associations between bone marrow adiposity and cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. By identifying such associations, our PheWAS results greatly extend the clinical relevance of bone marrow adiposity.

Among these diseases, COPD is notable because its positive association with spine BMFF is stronger than for any other incident disease. In contrast, incident COPD is inversely associated with total hip BMFF. This disparity between spine and femoral BMFF is similar to their relationships with several other diseases, including T2D. Given that T2D itself is associated with COPD53, we speculate that spine and femoral BMFF may have opposing relationships with COPD because of their divergent causal association with T2D.

Several other cardiometabolic diseases are also associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with femoral BMFF, particularly when prevalent cases are considered. Here, essential hypertension is especially striking because it is strongly associated with BMFF at all four sites. This relationship may involve the interplay between BMAT and hematopoiesis, combined with the positive causal effect of lymphocyte count on blood pressure54; if so, BMFF may be associated with hypertension via effects on lymphopoiesis. Finally, the positive relationship between spine BMFF and incidence of several other cardiovascular conditions suggests a more widespread impact of vertebral BMAT on cardiometabolic dysfunction.

Another notable finding is that there are site and sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. As discussed above, the BMFF-disease relationships frequently differ depending on skeletal site, with many diseases associating positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF at one or more femoral sites. While this is perhaps most notable for T2D, our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS reveals similar divergent site-specific associations for many other conditions across multiple disease classes. Many of these are interrelated disease clusters, including cardiometabolic diseases and other age-associated chronic diseases. Thus, BMFF distribution may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of these complex multi-morbidities.

These findings highlight the critical importance of analyzing BMFF at multiple anatomical locations and underscore the concept that the pathophysiological functions of BMAT are skeletal site dependent2,20,21. Indeed, BMAT has been proposed to exist in two broad subtypes, regulated BMAT (rBMAT) and constitutive BMAT (cBMAT), which differ in anatomical location and in their molecular and functional characteristics2,20,21. Thus, cBMAT forms earlier in development, contains densely packed adipocytes, predominates at distal skeletal sites, and is less changeable in response to environmental and pathophysiological variables. In contrast, rBMAT forms later in development, features adipocytes interspersed with hematopoietic red marrow, predominates in the axial skeleton and more-proximal regions of the limbs, and more readily increases or decreases in response to varying environmental stimuli and pathophysiological states. These characteristics are broadly consistent with our observations, with spine BMFF corresponding to rBMAT and femoral BMFF being more cBMAT-like. However, some disease associations are even stronger for femoral BMFF than for spine BMFF, suggesting that cBMAT is not always more inert than rBMAT. The three femoral sites also differ from one another, suggesting that this binary cBMAT/rBMAT classification is an oversimplification. It will be important for future studies to further dissect these site-specific differences on molecular and functional levels.

Disease risk factors, incidence and outcomes also differ between males and females55, including for the relationships between body composition and cardiometabolic health56,57. Our present findings extend understanding of these phenomena by identifying the extent of sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. Many associations occur in both sexes, especially for spine BMFF; in such cases, the direction of the BMFF-disease association is the same in each sex. In contrast, for the femoral sites, there are many more associations in females than in males. Sometimes this is because the disease itself is sex-specific, such as those affecting reproductive organs; this is particularly common when prevalent cases are included. However, most of the sexually dimorphic associations among incident cases occur for diseases that can affect males and females. For example, acute renal failure is identified only in males, while the positive association between BMFF and incident osteoporosis occurs for all four sites in females but none in males, even when prevalent cases are included. The latter is reminiscent of previous observations that vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with incident bone loss in elderly women, but not in elderly men26. Together, our findings highlight sex differences in the clinical impact of bone marrow adiposity.

We acknowledge that our study has several limitations. First, the UKBB MRI data allow fat fraction mapping but do not include spectroscopy, and therefore cannot be used to measure lipid saturation and unsaturation3. This is notable because vertebral bone marrow lipid saturation is positively associated with risk of incident fracture in older adults58 and with prevalent fracture in T2D27. The latter, small-scale study found no relationship between fracture and overall bone marrow adiposity, suggesting that bone marrow lipid saturation is an even stronger driver of fracture risk. Bone marrow lipid saturation is also higher in T2D4; however, whether this has a direct causal effect on diabetes is unknown.

Secondly, while vertebral fractures are estimated to affect up to 25-50% of people over the age of 50, many are asymptomatic, with only 30-40% coming to medical attention59,60. This likely explains why the positive association between BMFF and vertebral fracture is detected only in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS: while reverse causality may play a role, the number of fracture cases in the incident Obs-PheWAS is too few to detect these associations (Supplementary Data 35). Under-reporting of vertebral fractures may also account for our MR results, which show that the causal association of BMFF with fracture is weaker for the spine than for each femoral site.

The challenge of insufficient incident cases also applies to other diseases. The UKBB population is relatively healthy52, which can limit the ability to detect associations and causal effects of BMFF on many health outcomes. As for vertebral fracture, having insufficient cases may explain why many associations, such as multiple myeloma, are detected in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and/or PRS-PheWAS, but not the incident Obs-PheWAS. It may also explain some differences in our sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS. For example, BMFF is associated with osteoporosis in females but not in males; this may result from genuine sex differences in disease pathogenesis but could also reflect males' lower incidence of osteoporosis23, which would limit the power to detect this association. However, it is important to acknowledge that reverse causality may contribute to the additional associations identified when prevalent cases are included. We will overcome the challenge of insufficient cases by measuring BMFF in the remaining ~50,000 UKBB imaging participants and by applying our BMFF PRSs to other large-scale genomic cohorts, including meta-analyses of multiple datasets, to further explore the clinical impact of BMAT.

Thirdly, medication use may influence some of the observed BMFF-disease associations. For example, glucocorticoids are used to manage COPD, and they also increase BMFF2. However, UKBB participant medication history is mostly from self-reported data, with primary care records being available for only a subset of participants; thus, it is not possible to systematically control for use of medications that may influence the observed associations between BMFF and disease outcomes.

Fourthly, we defined PheCODES based on national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) in UKBB, which did not include diagnoses from primary care. This may result in incomplete case ascertainment for conditions predominantly diagnosed and managed in the primary care setting.

Fifthly, we generated PRSs using PRS-CT (clumping + p value thresholding: to generate weighted PRS based on SNP associated with BMFF) because it is more interpretable for causal inference. However, the inclusion of correlated SNPs reduces this advantage. The PRS-CS method, which utilizes a Bayesian regression framework by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes61, would be valuable for future work characterizing the full polygenic architecture of BMFF.

There are also some limitations to our MR analysis. MR relies on genetic instruments (SNPs) associated with BMFF, but the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic instruments ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions. This limited variance suggests potential weak instrument bias, which could lead to underpowered or biased causal estimates; this is particularly true using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), which found causal associations for total hip or diaphysis BMFF and osteoporosis, but not for any other BMFF-disease associations. The MR analysis assumes that the genetic instruments affect the outcome (osteoporosis, fractures, T2D) only through the exposure (BMFF). However, horizontal pleiotropy, where genetic variants influence the outcome through pathways other than BMFF, cannot be entirely ruled out. Our study used MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to test for pleiotropy. MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests suggested minimal pleiotropy, while the presence of heterogeneity across different bone regions suggested some genetic variants may have pleiotropic effects, potentially biasing the causal estimates. However, a major strength of our MR analysis is that we also used MR-Horse, which is protected from bias due to pleiotropy62. Relating to this, a potential limitation of our conservative exclusion of BMD- and T2D-associated variants is that, while this approach reduces the risk of horizontal pleiotropy, it may also lead to a reduction in IVs strength. However, excluding these variants in our MR analyses had minimal impact on overall IVs strength (Supplementary Data 37). Moreover, Steiger filtering63 confirmed correct causal directions for all variants, including those associated with both exposure and outcome (Supplementary Data 38-41). In addition, although the sample overlap between exposure and outcome GWAS was minimal ( < 5%), residual bias cannot be entirely ruled out. We seek to validate our MR findings in the independent dataset once these data are available. A final limitation is that the MR analysis was conducted in a predominantly white European population from the UK Biobank, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups.

Finally, the UKBB imaging study has plans to include repeat imaging of 60,000 participants, but does not yet have longitudinal MRI data. Such data would be necessary to determine whether changes in BMFF precede disease onset or are a consequence of disease progression. This will provide critical insights into the temporal dynamics of BMFF alterations and their role in disease incidence and progression.

Despite these limitations, our study is a breakthrough in understanding the fundamental biology and clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity. Our large-scale MR-PheWAS identifies the overall and sex-specific disease outcomes associated with BMFF and its genetic liability at multiple skeletal sites. To explore the short-term effects of BMFF, we conducted Obs-PheWAS, analyzing 1808 disease outcomes using deep-learning-quantified BMFF measurements obtained at the time of MRI scanning. Complementing this, PRS-PheWAS establishes the long-term effects by evaluating the cumulative genetic risk for elevated BMFF levels. Our Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS not only enhance statistical power and reduce bias but also validate the findings and strengthen causal inference.

The unexpected breadth of BMFF-associated diseases highlights the potential of BMFF as a biomarker for the improved prediction, prevention and treatment of diverse diseases. This includes leveraging our BMFF PRSs as genetic biomarkers, which could benefit clinical practice by eliminating the need for expensive and time-consuming MRI analyses. Our results provide evidence of causality for altered bone marrow adiposity on osteoporosis, fracture, and T2D, which suggests that modulating bone marrow adiposity could be a viable therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Together, our study reveals extensive insights into BMAT function that have the potential to benefit human health.

UKBB has ethics approval from the National Health Service North-West Center Research Ethics Committee (Ref11:/NW/0382). All participants provided informed consent. Data for this work were obtained under an approved UKBB project application (ID 48697).

UKBB is a large population-based prospective cohort study of 502,352 participants aged 40–60 years recruited between 2006 and 201064. In this study, we used participant data from the ongoing UKBB multi-modal imaging study, initiated in 2014, which comprises brain, cardiac, and abdominal MRI, carotid ultrasound scan, and whole-body DXA14.

We developed and validated a light-weight attention-based U-Net model for simultaneous detection and segmentation of tiny structures in large 3D MRI imaging data, to generate volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to bone marrow regions, including femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and the thoracic and lumbar spine (Python code [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13959673]. The segmented VOIs were then applied to the fat fraction (FF) maps. The deep-learning BMFF measurements of the four bone regions were conducted in two batches based on the availability of MRI data released by UKBB (N = 50,226). Method details for deep-learning training, development and validation are described in our previous publication13.

We conducted meta-GWAS analyses (combining the two batches of BMFF measurements) in the population of unrelated white UKBB participants to identify genetic variants associated with the BMFF of each bone region (method details are described in our previous publication15). We generated BMFF polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each bone region using formula 1:

where N is the number of SNPs in the score, βi is the effect size (beta coefficient) of variant i and dosageij is the number of copies of SNP i in the genotype of individual j. We followed the pipeline in UKBB developed by Collister et al.65 and used PLINK 2.066. Each SNP effect estimate derived from our BMFF meta-GWAS is referred to as the ‘βi'. To be specific, the PRS for each bone region was constructed by adding up the number of BMFF-increasing alleles for each SNP, weighted for the SNP effect size on BMFF level (beta coefficients from meta-GWAS).

The quality control of the SNPs and samples used to generate PRS for each bone region is summarized in Supplementary Data 11-13. In SNP quality control, we retained significant SNPs (linkage disequilibrium LD r2 < 0.6, P value < 5 × 10−8) found in meta-GWAS, with missingness <0.05, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test P value > 10–12, non-multiallelic, imputation quality (INFO) > 0.4, and minor allele frequency > 0.005. We further excluded ambiguous AT/CG variants, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). The PRS were first calculated based on 48 SNPs for femoral head, 115 for total hip, 99 for diaphysis, and 119 for spine (Supplementary Data 14). In addition, we conducted a sensitivity PRS analysis, which further excluded SNPs associated with BMD from the instrumental variants selected. LD proxies (r2 > 0.6) for significant SNPs passing quality control were generated using the LDproxy function in the LDlinkR package (https://github.com/CBIIT/LDlinkR (version 1.4.0) with 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 as LD reference panel). We searched the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD of each bone region (BMD GWAS details are presented in Supplementary Data 42). A GWAS for diaphysis BMD was not found. The BMD GWASes for the remaining three bone regions (femoral head, total hip, spine) reported distinct significant SNPs associations (Supplementary Data 43). We cross-compared BMFF LD proxies and BMD SNPs and excluded any overlapping SNPs from the list of instrumental variants to construct the PRS. In the PRS sensitivity analysis, the PRS were calculated based on 46 SNPs for femoral head, 114 for total hip, and 117 for spine (Supplementary Data 15). The PRS for diaphysis was not updated due to the absence of a corresponding GWAS or overlaps of instrumental variants in the remaining three bone regions. The variance explained by genetic instrumental variants (R2) for each PRS was estimated following formula 2:

Here, EAF represents the effect allele frequency and β denotes the SNP beta coefficient67.

In sample quality control, we sub-grouped participants based on their ancestry as ‘White' using the UKBB data-field 22006 (“Genetic ethnic grouping”) and excluded UKBB withdrawals, individuals who were outliers for heterozygosity or missing rates, individuals with a missing rate >0.02 on autosomes, individuals with sex discordance (between the phenotypic and genetically inferred sex), individuals who were not in a maximal set of unrelated individuals up to 3rd degree, and participants included in our meta-GWAS. The study retained 305,313 participants for femoral head, 305,453 for total hip, 306,222 for diaphysis, and 303,066 for spine (Supplementary Data 13).

In summary, we generated two PRSs for each bone region as presented in Supplementary Data 14-15.

We performed a PheWAS to identify disease outcomes associated with BMFF in four bone regions. Disease outcomes were defined based on the PheCODE schema (with 10,750 unique ICD-10 codes and 3113 ICD-9 codes) using national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) until 31 March 2023. The PheCODE schema combines correlated ICD codes into a distinct code based on the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10) and excludes patients with related diseases from the corresponding control groups68. Herein, we defined cases based on the presence of at least one ICD code mapping to each PheCODE, consistent with our previous publications69,70,71,72,73. We translated the ICD codes into PheCODE groups, which included 1808 PheCODEs classified into 17 disease categories70,74,75,76. Further details of the PheCODE schema and application are provided in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Note 1).

In Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was measured by our deep-learning models and is presented as rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region. The quality control of Obs-PheWAS sample is presented in Supplementary Data 1. We used deep-learning BMFF measurements as the exposure and included only incident cases (defined as disease diagnosed after at least six months of undergoing UKBB MRI imaging) in the PheWAS analysis. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging. We performed the analysis only for those PheCODEs with >200 incident cases, the threshold suggested by the power estimates for PheWAS analysis77. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to include both incident and prevalent cases. We corrected the P values for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) q value threshold of 0.0578.

In PRS-PheWAS, BMFF PRS were generated for each bone region. We used genetically proxied BMFF level as the exposure and included PheCODEs with >200 incident and prevalent cases. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components (PC). We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses78.

To investigate sex-specific associations in each bone region, we performed sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS analyses.

The analyses were performed using the ‘PheWAS' package [https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS] (R version 4.4.1).

We conducted two-sample MR analyses to investigate the potential causal associations between BMFF (exposure) and the risk of osteoporosis, fractures and T2D (outcomes). We followed the STROBE-MR (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using Mendelian randomization) guidelines (Please see Supplementary Note 2 in the Supplementary Information file).

We adhered to the three core genetic instrumental variants (IV) assumptions: (1) Relevance: the IV is associated with the exposure of interest; (2) Independence: the IV is independent of any confounders of the exposure-outcome association; and (3) Exclusion Restriction: the IV selected for MR analysis are not associated with the outcome of interest independently of the exposure79. To meet the assumptions, we obtained IVs by filtering for BMFF meta-GWAS genome-wide significant SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8), followed by linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based clumping using the ‘TwoSampleMR' R package with the following parameters: clump_kb = 10, 000, clump_r2 for two thresholds (r2 = 0.001 or r2 = 0.6), pop = ”EUR”, and excluded those SNPs associated with BMD or T2D to ensure that any observed association between IVs and outcomes is mediated through the exposure (BMFF), maintaining the validity of causal inference. The strength of genetic IVs was tested with the F-statistic (https://shiny.cnsgenomics.com/mRnd/). The F-statistic was calculated using formula 3:

Here, β represents the beta coefficient of SNP on the exposure, and SE is the standard error of the beta80. The F-statistic was estimated to assess whether there was a possibility of weak instrument bias. The genetic instruments for each outcome were derived from summary statistics of the most recent publicly available GWASes of European ancestry with the largest sample size, obtained from the MRC IEU GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). The identifier for the osteoporosis GWAS81 is ebi-a-GCST90038656, for the fractures GWAS81 is ebi-a-GCST90038703, and for the type 2 diabetes GWAS82 is ebi-a-GCST90018926. BOLT-LMM coefficients, if reported in the outcome GWASes, were transformed to log-odds scale. Summary statistics of the SNP-exposure association and the SNP-outcome association were combined to estimate the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. SNP effect data for the exposure and outcome were harmonized to ensure consistency in effect direction and allele matching. Harmonization (‘harmonise_dat' function in ‘TwoSampleMR' package) involved aligning the effect alleles across exposure and outcome datasets, correcting for strand mismatches, and excluding palindromic SNPs with ambiguous allele frequencies.

In MR analyses, six methods were employed to examine the causal association between exposure and outcome, including IVW, MR-Horse62, MR-Egger, weighted mode, weighted median, and simple model, among which IVW and MR-Horse were the primary methods83. MR-Horse is a Bayesian model with horseshoe shrinkage that can account for valid instruments, uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy62. Horizontal pleiotropy tests were performed based on (i) MR-Egger regression (intercept close to 0, P value > 0.05: no evidence for horizontal pleiotropy), and (ii) MR-PRESSO (detected and corrected for horizontal pleiotropy by identifying outlier variants)84. The heterogeneity test was estimated based on Cochran's Q statistic. To further assess the robustness of the MR findings, we used the leave-one-out analysis to investigate the influence of outlying and/or pleiotropic genetic variants85. MR results were visualized using scatter plots (to display the consistency of causal estimates across different MR methods, and the overall direction of causality), forest plots (to present the causal effect estimates of individual SNPs), funnel plots (to detect asymmetry, which could indicate horizontal pleiotropy or publication bias), and leave-one-out plots (to test IV outliers on the causal estimates).

In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses using IVs derived from the BMI-unadjusted BMFF meta-GWAS (LD clumping threshold: r²<0.001) to assess potential collider bias in our primary MR results.

All tests were two-sided. MR applied the FDR-Q correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant). The analysis was performed using the ‘TwoSampleMR', ‘MR-PRESSO', and ‘R2jags' packages [https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR] (R version 4.4.1).

Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.

All data for BMFF and BM segmentation volumes have been uploaded to the UKBB (upload ID 5858), where they will be available under UKBB Category 105 to any individuals with an approved UKBB project. Researchers can apply for UKBB access via the UKBB Access Management System (https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/). PheCODEs were generated using data from the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10). PRSs were constructed using data from our previous BMFF meta-GWAS15 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55422-4). To exclude any SNPs independently associated with BMD or type 2 diabetes, we searched GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD or type 2 diabetes; these studies are described in the manuscript. The remaining data are reported in the Supplementary Data files.

Using artificial intelligence (AI), researchers have designed novel viruses capable of killing strains of Escherichia coli. The team used the DNA of a simple bacteriophage called ΦX174 to guide AI models to generate viral genomes with the specific function of infecting antibiotic-resistant strains of E. coli. Researchers used the model's suggested sequences to select 302 viable phages. When put to the test, 16 of these phages could infect E. coli, and combinations of them could kill three strains of the bacterium, a feat the original ΦX174 couldn't pull off.

An influential panel of US vaccine advisers that became controversial after it was abruptly reconstituted by US health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr has come together, with vague results. The panel stopped short of recommending COVID-19 vaccines, but left room for government programmes and private health insurers to continue covering the shots. The group indefinitely delayed its guidance on hepatitis B vaccination for newborn babies. And it overturned its decision, made just the day before, about free measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccines for under-4s. MMRV doses were to have been made available free to some children, but now they won't.

Harvard University scored a victory in court two weeks ago, when a US judge ruled that its research grants should be reinstated and its funding unfrozen. Millions from the US National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health are flowing back to the university, but researchers report that the restoration has been patchy and much damage has been done. On Friday, in a joint status update before a judge, both Harvard and the US government asked for more time to “work through implementation issues” of complying fully with the court order.

A ‘conveyor belt' of atoms arranged in orderly rows could resolve a major stumbling block towards developing a large-scale quantum computer. The new approach uses an array of rubidium atoms inside a high-vacuum vessel, with a gas of more rubidium atoms suspended just below it. Using laser beams called ‘optical tweezers', researchers scooped up atoms from the gas to prepare a second array as a back-up. When the first array loses atoms — an inevitability during quantum calculations — the back-up array can be moved up to interact with and replenish it, which keeps the computer in action.

In The Great Holocene Transformation, complexity scientist Peter Turchin sets out to explain how, over the past 10,000 years, small collectives of farmers and foragers grew into powerhouse societies. His answer, “depressingly and paradoxically, is war”, says science writer Laura Spinney in her review. Turchin has addressed the same question in a previous book, she writes, but “this time, he shows his workings, and he has more data and better tools”. Ironically, this data-driven approach is likely to further repel some of the conventional historians that Turchin has previously failed to win over, Spinney says.

By outfitting cells with the molecular equivalent of flight recorders, scientists can now log, in real time, the signals that cells receive, the paths they travel and the developmental decisions they make — all inscribed indelibly in genomic ink. It is early days, but researchers have used these tools to trace the growth of mouse embryos and capture gene activity in animal brains. Scientists are also exploring how to harness these tools for real-time disease monitoring — by engineering cells that patrol the body and log signs of trouble in molecular memory.

Wood scientist Johannes Huber uses computed tomography (CT) scanning to test the properties of wood samples without breaking them. “Wood has character; no two logs are alike,” he says. Using industrial CT scanners, Huber can create detailed models of the wood's internal structure. “If we can evaluate it non-destructively, we can optimize how we use this material,” he says.

The recent discovery of a sprawling SIM farm operation in the New York City area has revealed how these facilities, typically used by cybercriminals to flood phones with spam calls and texts, have grown large enough that the US government is warning it could have been used not just for crime, but large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure.

On Tuesday morning, the US Secret Service revealed that it had found a collection of facilities across the “New York tristate area” holding more than 100,000 SIM cards housed in “SIM servers,” devices that allow them to be managed and operated simultaneously. Due to the sheer scale of the infrastructure of this single SIM farm—and the fact that it reportedly came onto the Secret Service's radar after it was exploited in “swatting” attacks that targeted US members of Congress around Christmas of 2023—the agency has warned that the operation, which has been at least partially dismantled, posed a serious threat of a disruptive attack on cellular service.

Given the number of SIM cards all under the control of a single operation, it could have “disabled cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cell phone network in New York City,” according to Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service New York field office.

“This network could be used to overwhelm cell towers,” according to a law enforcement source familiar with the Secret Service's investigation, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the ongoing investigation. “To give you an idea of capacity for disruption, this network could be used to send approximately 30 million text messages per minute, meaning it could anonymously text the entire United States in around 12 minutes.”

The source tells WIRED that the Secret Service has confirmed that the SIM farm was used by organized crime, nation-state threat actors, and other individuals known to law enforcement.

Photos of “SIM blocks” discovered by Secret Service agents. These devices can connect around a hundred SIM cards simultaneously.

The Secret Service's Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit seized the equipment found in the SIM farm sites, which the agency described as all being within 35 miles of midtown Manhattan. The Secret Service says its investigation is ongoing as it combs through the calling and texting records of the massive collection of SIMs. No arrests have been made, according to the law enforcement source. In its announcement of the bust, the Secret Service noted that it acted now to head off any potential use of the SIM operation to target the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan this week—though it didn't offer any evidence to suggest that was the operation's intent.

“Given the timing, location and potential for significant disruption to New York telecommunications posed by these devices, the agency moved quickly to disrupt this network,” reads a statement from the agency.

Despite speculation in some reporting about SIM farm operation that suggests it was created by a foreign state such as Russia or China and used for espionage, it's far more likely that the operation's central focus was scams and other profit-motivated forms of cybercrime, says Ben Coon, who leads intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Unit 221b and has carried out multiple investigations into SIM farms. “The disruption of cell services is possible, flooding the network to the degree that it couldn't take any more traffic,” Coon says. “My gut is telling me there was some type of fraud involved here.”

In this case, according to a CNN report on the Secret Service's investigation, the agency got onto the trail of the New York area SIM farm after it was used in a pair of swatting incidents around Christmas Day in 2023 that targeted congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and US senator Rick Scott. Those incidents appear to have been tied to a pair of Romanian men, Thomasz Szabo and Nemanja Radovanovic, who were working with the American serial swatter Alan Filion, also known as Torswats.

Though all three men have since been convicted on swatting-related charges, the Secret Service's McCool noted in his statement that the agency's investigation followed “telecommunications-related imminent threats directed towards senior US government officials this spring.”

The phenomenon of SIM farms, even at the scale found in this instance around New York, is far from new. Cybercriminals have long used the massive collections of centrally operated SIM cards for everything from spam to swatting to fake account creation and fraudulent engagement with social media or advertising campaigns. The SIM cards are typically housed in so-called SIM boxes that can control more than a hundred cards at a time, which are in turn connected to servers that can then control thousands of SIMs each.

SIM farms allow “bulk messaging at a speed and volume that would be impossible for an individual user,” one telecoms industry source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the Secret Service's investigation, told WIRED. “The technology behind these farms makes them highly flexible—SIMs can be rotated to bypass detection systems, traffic can be geographically masked, and accounts can be made to look like they're coming from genuine users.”

The telecom industry source adds that the images of SIM servers and boxes published by the Secret Service indicate a “really organized” criminal operation may have been behind the setup. “This means that there is great intelligence and significant resources behind it,” the person added.

The SIM farm found by the Secret Service, Unit 221b's Coon says, isn't the biggest operation he's learned of in the US. But it's the most concentrated in such a small single geographic area. SIM boxes, he notes, are illegal in the US, and the hundreds of them found in the Secret Service's investigation must have been smuggled into the US. In one case he was involved in, Coon says, the boxes were imported from China, disguised as audio amplifiers.

The “clean, tidy racks” of equipment in a well-lit room shows that the operation may be well-organized and professional, says Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunication and cybersecurity firm Enea. Photos released by the Secret Service show multiple racks of telecom equipment neatly set up, with individual pieces of tech numbered and labeled, plus cables on the floor being covered and protected with tape. Each SIM box, Mc Daid says, appears to include around 256 ports and associated modems. “This looks more professional than many of the SIM farms you see,” says Mc Daid.

Mc Daid notes, however, that he's tracked similar operations discovered in Ukraine—some of which have been as large or even larger than the one revealed on Tuesday by the Secret Service. Over the course of the last few years, law enforcement officials in Ukraine have discovered tens of thousands of SIM cards being used in SIM farms allegedly set up by Russian actors. In one case in 2023, around 150,000 SIM cards were reportedly found. These SIM farms have been used to operate fake social media profiles that can spread disinformation and propaganda.

Additional equipment found in the New York–area SIM farm sites.

In one photo released by the Secret Service, packaging from hundreds of SIM cards belonging to telecom service MobileX is visible. “We are aware of recent reports that MobileX SIM cards, along with those of other providers, were recovered during a federal investigation,” Peter Adderton, the CEO and founder of MobileX, says in a statement. “Our platform is designed to be easy to use and cost-effective, qualities that unfortunately can also attract occasional bad actors.” Adderton adds that MobileX is prepared to work with law enforcement and has systems in place to shut down suspicious activity.

Since SIM farms are typically used for indiscriminate fraud rather than swatting or other more disruptive threats, the unusual use of this particular SIM farm to swat US officials was likely the source of its downfall, notes Allison Nixon, the chief research officer for Unit 221b. “Swatters are also fraudsters, so they know how to use criminal proxy services. The owners of criminal proxy infrastructure make significant investments predicated on the idea that arrest rates for cybercrime are low,” Nixon says. “But they fail to anticipate the fact that cybercrime, allowed to fester, always leads to terrorism. So the first time the feds see this, the operation is already massive.”

White nationalist livestreamer Nick Fuentes finds it very difficult to hide his contempt for his own followers, known as Groypers—even when they are sending him money.

“Can you fuck off and kill yourself and die,” Fuentes muttered during a livestream on the alternative streaming platform Rumble earlier this month. The antisemitic, anti-trans, misogynistic, and racist influencer was responding to a follower who sent him a $10 Super Chat message, offering advice on how to treat the cold Fuentes was suffering from.

Groypers are a group of extremely loyal supporters of Fuentes' white nationalist and Christian nationalist ideology, which he describes as “America First.” Their leader's undisguised disdain for them, which at times edges into outright hatred and name-calling, is part of his appeal. Younger viewers in particular view his unvarnished responses and unwavering views on immigration, Israel, and Donald Trump (he's against them all) as genuine and authentic, especially compared to what other right-wing influencers offer up.

Now, Fuentes is looking to leverage his rapidly growing audience, and a new level of influence among more mainstream figures in the GOP and MAGA movement, to build a nationwide secret society of sorts, which he believes will help bring his vision of an America dominated by white Christians to fruition.

“The country overall, I think, is closer to accepting our position than they were 10 years ago,” Fuentes said in a recent livestream. “I think we're kind of still waiting for that inflection point, and once that happens, I think it happens all very quickly.”

After a decade of livestreaming hate-filled diatribes in which he has said certain types of rape are “not a big deal,” denied the Holocaust, and compared himself to Hitler, Fuentes believes he, and the white nationalist movement generally, have very little to show for it.

But in the wake of the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, things have been happening very quickly.

For the last six years, Fuentes had relentlessly attacked the Turning Point USA cofounder, focusing especially on his support for Israel. Fuentes also repeatedly called out Kirk's unwillingness to debate him. In the aftermath of Kirk's death, Fuentes struck a more conciliatory tone, urging followers not to pick up arms, but also repeated that he believes Kirk was “complicit in the Israeli capture of the right wing for a very long time.”

Rather than damaging Fuentes' popularity, Kirk's death has accelerated it. His X following has grown by almost 175,000 since Kirk's death, and he has seen his following on Rumble increase by more than 100,000.

His livestream commemorating the death of Kirk was among his most watched by far, with over 2.5 million views. His livestream the following Monday discussing who was responsible for Kirk's death also saw a higher-than-normal viewership. In the space of less than an hour, Fuentes earned over $5,500 from the top 50 Super Chat donations made by supporters, according to a review by WIRED.

Fuentes did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

For years, Fuentes was viewed as a pariah by people within the Republican Party and the MAGA movement. “I don't think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes,” then House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said in 2022, days after Trump had dined with the antisemitic musician and fashion mogul Ye and the America First leader at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

But over the course of the last year, coinciding with Elon Musk's decision to reinstate Fuentes' X account, his influence has skyrocketed, despite—or perhaps because of—his criticism of Trump's failed campaign promises around the Epstein case and mass deportations, as well as his support for Israel.

“He is on a generational run. I don't care what anyone says, he is on fire right now,” comedian Vincent Oshana said while appearing on the podcast of right-wing influencer Patrick Bet-David, who interviewed Trump last year. Fuentes has been praised—albeit usually with heavy caveats—by, among others, manosphere star Myron Gaines, right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza, and livestreamer Adin Ross, who hosted Trump during last year's presidential campaign.

Fuentes has also been at the center of a very public fight with mainstream right-wing media figures Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. Carlson called Fuentes a “weird little gay kid in his basement” and suggested he was part of a deep-state plot to undermine real right-wing figures; most observers, especially his own supporters, concluded that Fuentes came out on top.

“Young Trump supporters listen to Nick Fuentes, and if they don't listen to him, they listen to people who have been influenced by him,” says Michael Edison Hayden, an extremism researcher and author of the forthcoming book Strange People on the Hill, which follows a small town's takeover by a white nationalist group. “He's absolutely influential on immigration, on antisemitism and optics—whether establishment Republicans want to admit that or not.”

Born in 1998, Fuentes, grew up in a well-off suburb of Chicago. By the time he was 18, a freshman in Boston University, he was already livestreaming, launching what he would call America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes on YouTube. Having gained a cult following, in February 2017 Fuentes brought his show to the Trump-aligned Right Side Broadcasting Network.

The so-called alt-right of which he was a part, and Fuentes' brand of edgy nihilism specifically, fell apart in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017. At the time, Fuentes wrote on Facebook that the event, which resulted in the death of antifascist activist Heather Heyer, would unleash a “tidal wave of white identity,” something that at the time didn't happen.

Fuentes returned to YouTube before he was banned from the platform in 2020 for violating the company's hate speech policies. He continued broadcasting his show on DLive, an alternative streaming platform, but was once again suspended indefinitely in 2021 after he was in attendance outside the Capitol on January 6, 2021, where he was captured on video speaking to supporters. One of the rioters inside the Capitol on that day was captured on video waving an America First flag.

Fuentes moved his show to a custom platform called Cozy TV that he built in collaboration with Alex Jones. More recently, he has found a welcoming home on Rumble, the alternative media platform that also hosts Donald Trump Jr.'s podcast and has been backed financially by both Peter Thiel and a venture capital fund cofounded by Vice President JD Vance.

Despite being suspended from most major social media platforms, last year Fuentes was reinstated on X by Musk, who wrote that he could stay on the platform “provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes.”

Rather than being crushed, Fuentes has seen his following skyrocket from 168,000 at the time his account was restored in May 2024, to almost 925,000 today.

In a recent interview with Eric Orwoll, one of the founders of a whites-only community in Arkansas, Fuentes complained that for all that has happened since Trump came to power, there are very few groups who are operating right now in the “pro-white” sphere.

He listed Jared Taylor's white nationalist American Renaissance conference, and VDare, a white nationalist group founded in 1999 by Peter Brimelow that has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Fuentes also mentioned his own show, and the antisemitic Culture Wars magazine.

But Fuentes believes that he and the Groyper army can change that.

Despite his growing influence within the GOP and the Trump administration, as well as his rapidly rising support among young white men in America, Fuentes has repeatedly said that in order for his movement to make an impact, it needs to operate in the shadows.

“No rallies, no protests, we don't need to show everybody how many of us there are because the second that we do, they will identify, isolate, and destroy us,” Fuentes said on a recent livestream. “We want them to have no clue how many Groypers there are, where they are, who they are. We want them to be completely in the dark.”

Fuentes says that he travels the country constantly to meet his supporters, who have started different groups and organizations across the country—everything from campus groups to book clubs, all founded on the racist, antisemitic doctrine he preaches on his livestreams.

He described his movement as a “tech startup” and “a patchwork that eventually we're going to knit together … over time,” adding that he saw Orwoll's whites-only community in Arkansas as part of that network.

“There are certainly Groypers within the administration, and I believe [Fuentes] when he says that he has contacts within the administration, including probably pretty high up,” says Hannah Gais, an extremism researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

There are signs that figures familiar with Fuentes' movement play roles in the administration. Back in May, for example, Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia—who at one point allegedly grilled career FBI agents about their loyalty to Trump, according to a recent lawsuit—to head up the Office of Special Counsel. Ingrassia attended an impromptu rally in June 2024 after Fuentes had been denied entry to a Turning Point USA conference. Ingrassia later claimed to have been unaware of who was speaking at the rally; however, he wrote an X post at the time condemning the decision by Turning Point USA to eject Fuentes. It's unclear at this point if a vote to confirm Ingrassia's appointment will happen.

Ingrassia and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

On one livestream earlier this month, a young supporter told Fuentes that he was getting some of his friends into the movement and said it was “growing at an exponential rate,” adding that “you have the youth in this country sold on this movement.”

While this may be an exaggeration, Fuentes' young supporters are sold to the point where they are willing to fund him and his ambitions.

In addition to what he raises with Super Chats, Fuentes also has a subscription service called America First Plus. For $15 a month subscribers get access to the full America First archive. Thirty dollars a month gets you the archive plus “AI powered search.” For the most dedicated Groypers, there is a $100-a-month tier that also gets you access to a group chat that Fuentes is part of.

In a recent video criticizing the people who are part of the group chat, Fuentes claims that he's got 400 subscribers to the $100-a-month tier, which would amount to $50,000 a year.

Fuentes also earns money from his range of America First merchandise, including $40 baseball caps and $25 mugs.

“I'll be honest with you, I made a lot of money this summer,” Fuentes said recently. “And I got a lot of support this month, this year, lots of views, lots of followers.”

Those followers are helping to get the word out. Fuentes livestreams five times a week on Rumble, where his videos typically rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Clips from his shows are quickly spread by supporters on many other platforms, including X, Instagram, and TikTok, where they can quickly amass millions of views.

Fuentes' disdain for many of his supporters appears to have no impact on his popularity, but the 27-year-old is clear that what he refers to as the “grug-level” supporters are not what is needed in order for his movement to take control. Instead, Fuentes speaks about attracting “elite human capital,” supporters who will then become part of an “officer class” of “super intelligent, entrepreneurial” people.

“Once we get 1,000, 5,000 of those guys, those are going to be the party officials, party apparatics as an analogy,” Fuentes said. “I'm kind of interested in inspiring those people, indoctrinating those people. They watch a show, they get the ideas, they get the inspiration, they kind of take a project into their own hands.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Confessions of a Black Looksmaxxer","https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-a-black-looksmaxxer/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Stephen Imeh wanted to make history. He'd never really dreamt of being an influencer, but in April he noticed an opportunity to break through.

There were virtually no looksmaxxers—people who spend enormous amounts of effort to glow up—who looked like him, and he wanted to change that. So he made a plan. Imeh posted a workout video on TikTok, with plans for more, and updated his bio to “FIRST BLACK LOOKSMAXXER.”

But as soon as the 20-year-old Houston-based college student posted the video, he was bombarded by racist comments. “I don't think even an hour went by and I was getting comments like, you're a monkey, you're an n-word hard r,” he says. Another comment suggested Imeh “just be white,” or “jbw” as it's known in incel circles. None of it made sense to him. “I was like, wait, what?”

It wasn't Imeh's first encounter with looksmaxxing, the online movement most prominent among young men that emerged from incel culture and took off on TikTok in 2023, which promotes maximizing your physical attractiveness. In 2022, Imeh was a junior at a predominantly white high school in Texas that only had “three other Black kids,” and he wasn't fitting in. He decided to search for self-improvement tips online. “I googled ‘How to look better' and the number one thing was looksmaxxing,” he says. Suggestions included a tongue exercise called mewing, working out, healthier eating habits, even plastic surgery. Imeh only lasted two weeks before he called it quits. “It was kinda cringe.” But because it happened the year before looksmaxxing blew up on TikTok, he says, “I didn't tell anyone about it.”

In the three years since that experience, looksmaxxing has become more popular than ever, and Imeh, currently studying to be a speech therapist, wanted to give it another shot. Maybe he could be the face of a Black looksmaxxers trend, he reasoned. But he felt the ecosystem had become even more toxic in his absence. “The community before, it wasn't as bad. But it spawned a new wave of people.”

The ordeal in April was a wake-up call. Today, Imeh posts anti-looksmaxxing content to his 36,000 followers. “I'm obviously not included in this community, so why would I keep trying to contribute?” His videos poke fun at the movement's flaws and silly status markers, like being able to “mog” someone, which means you are the better looking person in a side-by-side comparison. (This is his fifth TikTok account after being reported by members of SkinnyTok for also calling out pro-eating disorder content.) “It's so easy to rage-bait” looksmaxxers, he says. “I might post, ‘This is what I do to get my skin clear,' then someone will comment ‘Oh, you can never get your skin clear because you're a Black slur, slur, slur,” he says over FaceTime, repeating the word half a dozen times.

Looksmaxxing, which originated in online forums like 4chan a decade ago, suggests that a man's success in life is directly tied to how good he looks. The purpose of the movement is to increase your overall “sexual market value,” and the more Eurocentric features you have, the higher you are on the “physical sexual looks” scale. On message boards, looksmaxxers use codes to rate other men on their journey. Young men refer to the process as “ascending,” where they work to attain a chiseled jawline, glass-smooth skin, and “hunter eyes” (almond-like contour, deep-set position, low set eyebrows). Those who have earned “Chad” status are considered among the most desirable of the pack. Many of the movement's aims align with the wave of manosphere ideology that is reanimating American society under the Trump administration, where hypermasculinity has become both a performance and a weapon of oppression.

For a trend obsessed with the pursuit of beauty, looksmaxxing is also defined by how ugly it treats maxxers who are not white. Accusations of racism have followed some of its most popular influencers, like Clavicular, who, in multiple TikToks, has recited audio using the n-word and implied Black people have inferior looks. (Clavicular did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Hate speech is also a common occurrence on popular looksmaxxing forums. In December, in a post titled “The reason why have Black genes is a nerf,” members debated why “Blacks also have worse skulls than jews.” (In gaming, “nerf” implies an attempt to weaken an opponent.) Another post suggested that “thugmaxxing”—adopting a stereotypical rapper aesthetic of someone from “the hood” with sagging pants and neck tattoos—was the only kind of “-maxxing” Black people could succeed in. Some have likened the trend to a resurgence of eugenic beauty standards, though as one TikTok user pointed out, “Racism isn't going to make you look better.”

Plastic surgeon Gary Linkov can often tell when a patient has been red-pilled by the movement. The client is typically an obsessive gym bro who asks to “improve their mid-face” or for a chin implant to help with facial symmetry. And for the most part he's happy to fulfill their requests, though he does question the racial archetype on which looksmaxxing is based. “A lot of these movements start with more of a Caucasian influence, and then more minority groups feel like they have to conform in some ways,” says Linkov, who works at Facial City Plastics in Manhattan. “But they have different features and they have their own beauty that should be enhanced and not transformed into a whole different race.”

Nonsurgical cosmetic treatments are on the rise among young men. The most popular include hair restoration, laser hair removal, and body contouring procedures like CoolSculpting, which targets fat reduction and helps tone muscles. Botox injections have also become increasingly normalized among Gen Z youth who want their chin to have a more chiseled look, relying on dermal fillers and collagen skin boosters to treat signs of aging. (These treatments are sometimes called Brotox.) According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, men are undergoing cosmetic procedures at a higher rate compared to years prior to 2020.

Khai Taylor is a 21-year-old Black YouTuber who has found something of a new life thanks to the looksmaxxing movement. Not long ago, he was manning the front desk of the gym where he works when a young woman made note of his eyes. “She was like, ‘I never noticed you have really pretty eyes.' And I was just thinking, this would have never happened to me four years ago.”

Back then, he suffered from severe acne, was an introvert, and had never been on a date. “You have to understand, I had no option in the first place,” he tells me from his Dallas area home over Zoom.

Taylor got serious about looksmaxxing in 2021 and started posting his own content in 2023 because he didn't want young Black men to suffer through the same yearslong process of making the wrong mistakes. His YouTube channel is littered with tips on self-improvement and, as with most looksmaxxing creators, his content is marketed like a series of infomercials. Tutorials include “How to ACTUALLY Lose Face Fat,” “I Transformed My Ugly Subscriber Into A CHAD - And Here's How,” and my personal favorite, “How to Get an Anime Villain Body.”

In November 2023, Taylor posted “I Tried ‘Looksmaxxing' For an Entire Year”; it became his most-watched video to date, with 842,000 views. His inbox was flooded with requests from young men eager to enhance their facial aesthetics. “This was the best presentation of a looksmaxx I've ever seen, without making me feel like shit lol *,” one comment reads. At his peak, Taylor says he was coaching 10 to 15 guys a week over the phone.

It wasn't until he started posting YouTube content that he was faced with hate speech. “It's bad,” Taylor says, but notes that outside of the forums the racism is “not as outspoken and verbal as you think. It's internalized. The way they judge faces is what's the most racist to me because they base it off of white features. They're never going to use a stereotypically Black face as what's the ideal.”

Imeh also faced an intense wave of backlash for his posts. Earlier this year he was doxed and started receiving messages “every five minutes” from people suggesting he kill himself. “They love their community down,” he says.

Taylor admits some of the solutions posed by looksmaxxing are extreme. Medical professionals worry that many young men are becoming too reliant on pseudoscience—techniques like “bonesmashing,” an unproven method to remodel facial bones by breaking them—that can lead to serious complications. “That is where the movement deviates from healthy self-improvement into a territory of self-harm,” says Elaine Kung, a board-certified dermatologist at Future Bright Dermatology.

Many young men find refuge in the looksmaxxing community, Taylor says, because it explains to them why they can't attract women and equips them with the tools to do so. Given his success, I was curious how he navigates the negative associations that come with being a looksmaxxer. “I get where they're coming from because I sort of went through it,” he tells me, adding that the movement gets a bad rap because of how people view incel culture. “If you grew up until you were 22 or 23 without experiencing the touch or intimacy of a woman, being socially isolated, and people made fun of you, you would start to understand why these men are so obsessed with their facial angles and being in this space.”

And the problem is only getting worse, Imeh says. “I really do think they are so bigoted because the top looksmaxxers share their political views.” There is now a “whole world of racist rhetoric, and these young boys are eating it up,” he says, labeling the movement a “right-wing pipeline.”

“The rise of conservatism in America is feeding into their media. It's, ‘I need to have blue eyes, long hair, and bleached skin.' It's sad. There will always be an audience waiting to consume it.”

Taylor wants to counteract that sort of programming. His dream is to become a famous YouTuber. He wants to use his platform to motivate young men in all areas of their life, and he says that looksmaxxing just happened to be where he found his first audience. Most Black looksmaxxers—Austin Dunham, FitxFearless—don't call themselves that. They're lifestyle influencers who also offer advice about dating, finances, and having a “grindset” (grind mindset). It's the kind of brand Taylor wants to build.

Social media has made people hyperaware of their onscreen appearance at the same time that gendered stigmas around cosmetic procedures are disappearing. But that shift has also had harmful repercussions. “The curated, filtered reality of social media often sets an impossible standard,” says Kung, who believes the growing interest in male aesthetics is “a positive step toward self-care” but that certain aspects of looksmaxxing also champion “a very specific and often unattainable male ideal, which can fuel a dangerous obsession with one's appearance,” exacerbating issues such as body dysmorphia.

Taylor has a theory for the recent shift. “Something is happening in Western culture and media where there is an inflation of literally everything. There's a looks inflation. A physique inflation. A height inflation. It's getting to a point where you literally have to be six-foot-four, have a super giga-Chad jawline, and a jacked body just to even be looked at,” he says. “Everybody wants more. Like, nobody just wants to be normal. And it shouldn't be that way.”

Before I end the Zoom call, I tell Taylor I need to know one more thing. He's right, we do seem to be undergoing a looks inflation, but it's also one he's benefited from. He cracked the code. Returning to his earlier anecdote from the gym, I'm curious to know how else his life has improved.

Are you going on dates, having more sex?

He pauses and laughs. “To put it bluntly, yes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","You Probably Should Just Buy the iPhone 17","https://www.wired.com/review/apple-iphone-17/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Next to the flashy redesign of the iPhone 17 Pro and the ultrathin, ultralight iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 may feel quite plain. But I'm here to tell you that I don't think there has ever been a better base model in the annual iPhone lineup.

It helps that the iPhone 17 has many of the features of its pricier siblings, from the brighter screen with ProMotion and Ceramic Shield 2 to the new square-shaped 18-MP selfie camera. No, you don't need to upgrade if you have an iPhone 16 or iPhone 15—maybe even an iPhone 13. But at $799, it remains the iPhone most people should buy, especially considering its cameras and battery life have a leg up over the pricier iPhone Air.

Bear with me for a second, because the most exciting upgrade for the iPhone 17 isn't going to sound very exciting: It's a faster refresh rate. Android phones have had 120-Hz screens for nearly a decade, and while it was exclusive to high-end devices at the start, the capability quickly trickled down. Today, you can find phones under $300 with high refresh rates. Apple limited the feature, dubbed “ProMotion,” to its Pro iPhones for the past four years, but it finally caught up with the rest of the market, adding a 120-Hz display for the iPhone 17.

What exactly does it do? Older non-Pro iPhones have 60-Hz screens—the display is showing you an image 60 times per second. The iPhone 17's screen doubles that, meaning you're seeing twice as many images per second. This will make everything on the screen appear smoother and more fluid, even if you're just scrolling through Instagram.

Even better, it supports a variable refresh rate, dropping as low as 1 Hz when the screen is static, like on the lock screen. That's what enables this iPhone to support the always-on display—by being able to ratchet the refresh rate down to 1 Hz, the display is more efficient and doesn't impact battery life as much. You now have an always-on display (if you want it), and anything you do on the phone will feel smoother. Hooray!

Apple iPhone 17

Rating: 9/10

The screen is slightly bigger now, 6.3 inches, but more impressive is the display brightness, which can hit a peak of 3,000 nits. Even on the sunniest days here in New York City, I had no trouble seeing the contents of the screen. That's perhaps also thanks to the new anti-reflective coating to help cut glare. And Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2, supposedly three times more scratch-resistant than before, protects the screen. Glass is still glass—I already have a tiny scratch on my display. Use a case and screen protector!

I've been very impressed with battery life. After a week of use, I'm consistently hitting more than six hours of screen-on time, and some of those days involved using GPS navigation, music streaming, and hours of doomscrolling on Instagram Reels. I have yet to find myself worried that my phone is going to die. It easily bests the iPhone Air's battery life and comes close to the iPhone 17 Pro, but if you want the absolute best run time, look to the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

If you're coming from a phone older than the iPhone 15 (I hope you are!), remember that the iPhone now has a USB-C port. That means any Lightning accessories you have will require an adapter, but it's a good time to switch everything over to USB-C. The only annoying bit is that Apple limits data transfer speeds to the same 480 Mbps, whereas the iPhone 17 Pro enjoys USB 3 speeds up to 10 Gbps. You probably transfer most of your data between devices wirelessly, so this isn't something that impacts most folks. But other phones in this price bracket support faster speeds, so it's a silly limitation.

The A19 chip powering the whole phone is an excellent performer. Seriously, for the vast majority of apps and games, this processor kills. Folks who routinely download the most demanding mobile games, like Assassin's Creed Mirage, will find it a little limiting. I cranked the graphics to the max, and the game frequently stuttered and even froze a few times. Not to mention the iPhone 17 got really hot and nearly uncomfortable to hold. That's because it doesn't have the vapor chamber cooling system of the Pro models. Most games will be fine—Monster Survivor ran without a hitch—but heavy mobile gamers may want the A19 Pro chip that's in the iPhone 17 Pro.

The iPhone 17 runs iOS 26, and you can find many of the top new features here, most important of which are the call- and message-screening features to limit the number of spam and robocalls. I appreciate that Apple hasn't shoved Apple Intelligence down our throats like it did with the iPhone 16 launch. However, there are some areas I'd like to see it improve. Namely, the voice dictation service. I frequently use voice to type, and Apple's keyboard routinely gets stuff wrong, forcing me to spend more time fixing my messages before I hit Send. Google's Assistant Voice Typing on its Pixel phones is the gold standard, and this feature really needs an upgrade on the iPhone.

The biggest improvement on the camera front is the upgraded 48-MP camera sensor for the ultrawide, as well as the 24-MP selfie camera with a square sensor (binned to 18 megapixels). The latter is most exciting, and it's the same as in the Air and iPhone 17 Pro. Basically, the square sensor makes it so you don't have to manually rotate your phone to capture a landscape selfie. It's paired with Apple's Center Stage feature, which auto-rotates and zooms out to keep subjects in the frame.

Let's say you're snapping a selfie with a friend. Center Stage will automatically widen the camera's field of view to ensure both people are in the shot. Now, if you have more than two people in the frame, it'll switch to landscape orientation so no one is cut off, even as you hold the phone in portrait. (You can manually rotate the camera orientation too.) That means there's less of a chance you'll drop your iPhone as you extend your hand out. It's smart, and I suspect we'll see a similar version of this feature on Android phones in 2026.

I trotted around Brooklyn with the iPhone 17 and the Pixel 10, a direct competitor at $799. For the most part, the iPhone 17's main camera delivered slightly sharper and more natural-looking results than the Pixel 10. The results from the ultrawide were very similar to the iPhone 17 Pro models and were far less noisy than the shots from the Pixel 10. It further demolished the competition in video capture—even trouncing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge—with better stabilization and brighter, sharper footage.

However, one area where phones like the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 have an edge over the iPhone 17 is zoom. Both of those phones have a third telephoto camera that can zoom up to 5X or 3X, respectively. That's a big deal. You'll probably want to zoom in to capture your kid accepting their diploma, or your favorite musician on stage at a concert, or that cute bird sitting in a tree. There is no reason that one of the wealthiest companies in the world can't stuff a telephoto zoom camera in this phone when nearly every other competitor has it.

Barring this, you're left with a smartphone that delivers great battery life, has an excellent screen, top-tier performance, and a reliable dual-camera system with some of the best video capabilities. Apple has also bumped internal storage to 256 GB—high time! I love the color options this year, even if they're not as bright and fun as the iPhone 16 range.

The only question is how long 8 GB of RAM will be deemed “enough,” especially as artificial intelligence features increasingly demand more. It might be that some Apple Intelligence features in two to three years are only available in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro, since they have 12 GB of RAM, but Apple is no stranger to gatekeeping features. I don't think you need to worry about it too much. (How many Apple Intelligence features are you using right now?)

The main thing Apple has proved? Yet again, few people really need to buy Pro.

Searches at the US border are at an all-time high. Between April and June of this year, US Customs and Border Protection says it searched nearly 15,000 devices, outpacing the previous quarterly record by over 2,000. Combined with visitors allegedly being turned away for content on their devices and hours-long detentions at ports of entry, it's reasonable to be a little worried about entering the US.

There's a lot you can do to protect yourself at the US border, but most people have at least some sensitive information they need to keep on a phone or laptop while traveling. That's where 1Password, the password manager, and its Travel Mode feature come into play.

Although it can't remove everything, Travel Mode can erase a lot. The way it works is simple: You organize your logins, notes, attachments, and other sensitive information into a series of vaults. From there, you can choose which vaults are safe for travel and which aren't. When you turn on Travel Mode, your selected vaults aren't only hidden; 1Password claims they're entirely removed from your device.

The legality and scope of device searches at the border are complex. Broadly speaking, CBP can't deny entry to US citizens or green card holders if they don't comply with a device search. But they can make your life really difficult, with longer detentions and device seizures. “You can state that you don't consent to such a search, but unfortunately, this likely won't prevent Customs and Border Protection from taking your phone,” according to the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.

According to CBP's own policies, “Officers may not use the device to access information that is solely stored remotely.” Unfortunately, those policies may not always play out cleanly. “This is essentially a limitless authority that they claim for themselves to search travelers without a warrant and to search the full scope of information people carry on them,” says Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

Travel Mode can't prevent a search, but it could help you store information you'd rather border agents not see. It's for a little extra peace of mind that, in the event of an invasive search, some of your data won't be accessible. It works well for two reasons. First, Travel Mode removes marked vaults from your device completely. You can sign into the 1Password app and do everything else you normally would, but your travel vaults won't be there. It's as if the vaults you marked never existed in the first place.

You'll want to restore these vaults eventually, but border agents won't be able to do that. 1Password says you can only turn Travel Mode on or off from a browser (at 1password.com) that's been authenticated with both your secret key and master password. So, even if a border agent seizes your phone, there's no way to turn off Travel Mode from the 1Password app.

“As a practical matter, a border agent can't search what isn't in your possession when crossing the border,” Bill Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to WIRED in an email. “As a feature that limits the amount of data you carry with you, Travel Mode seems like a good way to protect that data.”



1Password (Single, Yearly)

1Password (Family, Yearly)

It's easy to turn Travel Mode on and off with 1Password, but there's some important housekeeping you should do beforehand.

Mark vaults as safe for travel. When you create a new vault with 1Password, you can mark it as safe for travel. If it's marked, it won't be removed from your device when you turn Travel Mode on. For existing vaults, you can mark them as safe or not safe for travel using the cog icon on the vault at my.1password.com.

Store your emergency kit somewhere safe. 1Password has an emergency kit, which includes your secret key, login email, a setup QR code, and a space to write (or type) your master password. You can generate an emergency kit at my.1password.com with the Manage Account button. You can print this and physically store it somewhere safe, or upload it to an encrypted cloud storage service like Proton Drive; make sure the device you're traveling with isn't logged into that storage service.

In the event you can't log back into your account and turn off Travel Mode, you can get in using any browser and your emergency kit.

Organize your entries into different vaults. 1Password doesn't have a hard limit on the number of vaults you can create, so it's worth spending some time organizing different entries into their own vaults. You can store a lot of information in your 1Password vaults beyond passwords, including documents and passkeys. Separating sensitive documents from your Spotify login will make it a lot easier to toggle on Travel Mode without double-checking all of your entries.

You can remove all of your vaults, but I recommend keeping some essentials available through 1Password. Ideally, you'll turn on Travel Mode before heading to the airport and only turn it off after you're through customs. If you're using a laptop (or other device) you brought with you to turn Travel Mode on and off, that kind of defeats the purpose.

Once that's done, you can turn on Travel Mode following these steps:

Travel Mode goes into effect instantly, and I mean instantly. Even with my 1Password vault opened on my phone, I was immediately returned to an empty vault after enabling Travel Mode on my desktop.

Travel Mode is handy in the context of your phone. But what about your laptop? Technically, CBP isn't allowed to turn off Travel Mode through the browser on your laptop, but that doesn't account for any rogue actors or other, more strict border agencies.

Unfortunately, there isn't a Travel Mode for your laptop, but there are some options if you want to make sure your devices are completely secure. Most laptops come with ways to encrypt data. With Windows, it's through BitLocker, with macOS, it's through FileVault, and Chromebooks are encrypted out of the box. That layer of encryption protects against dumping your PC for later analysis, but if you're forced to enter your password, it doesn't do much.

Enter VeraCrypt. It's a free, open source encryption app that can encrypt full drives, as well as operating system partitions, similar to BitLocker or FileVault. The big feature of VeraCrypt is plausible deniability. There are specific setup steps, but you can store an encrypted partition within an encrypted partition.

When you encrypt a drive with VeraCrypt, it writes random data to any free space available on the drive. Within that free space, you can set up another encrypted volume with a different password. It'll appear as random data, just as if you didn't have anything written in the free space.

VeraCrypt is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Alternatives are available for iOS and Android, as well, but I haven't tested those myself. You shouldn't need to set up VeraCrypt on your laptop, and if you do, you might want to reconsider traveling with it in the first place. But if you need protection regardless of the hassle, it's a good option to consider.

1Password and Travel Mode are great, and VeraCrypt is a useful tool to keep in your back pocket. But there's a lot of other data on your phone that could cause issues that neither of them helps with. Photos, messages, and even apps you have installed could all cause problems, so it's a good idea to either travel with a secondary device or clean up your primary device.

“The general principle of data minimization can go a long way,” Budington says. “Try to thoughtfully consider what is important to take with you, and what can be left behind. Then, try to minimize what you take with you across the border to only the essentials. If you are taking a vacation, do you really need that work laptop with you?”

For data minimization, Budington pointed to removing data from your device. You can use Travel Mode for some of that data, along with “a backup service which is protected by a passphrase you know and can recall if you need to.”

After you're done storing what you need in the cloud, make sure to log out of your account. CBP's official policy is that it can't search data stored in the cloud, but a lot of storage services will keep a local copy when disconnected from the internet. WIRED spoke with several experts about how to protect yourself at the US border in June, and I recommend following their guidance.

If you don't have 1Password yet, you can get started for less with a 1Password coupon code.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Mitigating Certificate Risks To Strengthen Operational Resilience","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/mitigating-certificate-risks-to-strengthen-operational-resilience-179927.html","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:02:53 GMT","

It's Monday morning, and a global bank's customers can't log into their accounts. Trading desks are stalled, wire transfers are frozen, and call centers are overwhelmed. The culprit isn't ransomware, a DDoS attack, or even insider sabotage. It's a single expired certificate embedded in a third-party software library.

What if that same faulty certificate isn't unique to one bank, and is embedded in a widely used third-party software package adopted by dozens of other financial institutions? Within hours, outages ripple across markets. Regulators are on the phone, the press is circling, and the board is demanding answers.

This isn't just a hypothetical scenario. It's exactly what happened to Alaska Airlines last year. What looked like a minor oversight was, in fact, a breakdown in certificate lifecycle governance with widespread operational impact.

The takeaway is clear: the digital certificate supply chain is a systemic resiliency issue. Yet, too often, certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is still treated as a low-level IT task. In reality, it belongs squarely on the board's agenda.

Modern applications resemble Lego sets. Developers pull in third-party libraries, vendor-provided components, and open-source packages at scale. Each of these dependencies carries its own digital certificates. Some are issued by well-known certificate authorities, others are self-signed, and still others may be long-lived or poorly managed.

In theory, certificates guarantee authenticity and trust. In practice, too many organizations lack validation mechanisms. Vendors may provide software signed with certificates that are expired, improperly issued, or even designed to last a century. Open-source packages may rely on self-signed certificates with weak encryption.

These flaws create hidden attack surfaces — entry points adversaries can exploit to infiltrate not just one company, but entire downstream customer ecosystems.

When a certificate expires, the first people to find out are usually the IT operations team, because the outage affects them directly. Websites go down, applications stop authenticating, and customers can't transact. IT gets the emergency tickets, but the root cause often lies upstream in a lack of governance over third-party components and certificates.

That's why calling this an IT issue misses the point. The failure of certificate governance exposes an organization's inability to ensure operational continuity. In industries like financial services, health care, and critical infrastructure, such lapses aren't just inconveniences; they're existential risks. An outage or breach can damage customer trust, invite regulatory scrutiny, and cost millions in lost business.

Operational resiliency ultimately rests with leadership. Just as boards oversee financial controls or supply chain logistics, they must demand accountability for digital certificate supply chains. Without that top-down mandate, organizations remain vulnerable to preventable failures.

So why is certificate supply chain risk so challenging to manage? The answer lies in scale and fragmentation. Large enterprises may have hundreds of thousands of certificates across internal systems, cloud services, APIs, IoT devices, and third-party software. Certificates may be scattered across silos, managed differently by developers, DevOps teams, and security operations, with little coordination.

This lack of visibility creates blind spots. IT may know a certificate is expiring, but not where it sits in the dependency chain or what critical business process it secures. Developers may pull in new open-source libraries without vetting their certificate trustworthiness, leaving CISOs without a central inventory or clear picture of where risks lie.

What makes certificate failures operational problems is that no one has the whole map. Without central governance, an expiring or untrusted certificate can ripple across critical applications, triggering outages, exposing sensitive data, and magnifying risk far beyond the technical domain.

The first step to addressing this problem is visibility. Enterprises need dependency-aware inventories — not just a list of certificates, but an understanding of what each certificate secures, where it originates, and what dependencies it touches.

A dependency-aware inventory reveals:

This contextual understanding transforms CLM from reactive firefighting into proactive governance. It allows CISOs and boards to see certificates not as isolated technical artifacts but as part of the operational backbone of the business.

Visibility alone isn't enough. Once organizations know what certificates they have and what they protect, they must enforce policies consistently. That means:

Just as important, these processes must be automated. Human error is often the source of certificate-related failures, whether it's a missed renewal deadline or an overlooked validation step. Automating CLM ensures that discovery, renewal, revocation, and policy enforcement happen systematically, without relying on manual oversight.

This is where boards should focus: CLM is no longer just about renewing expiring certificates. It is about orchestrating trust across the entire software supply chain. Certificates act as the connective tissue of digital trust.

By redefining CLM as supply chain trust orchestration, organizations can elevate certificate management into a core element of operational resilience. When certificate governance fails, it's not IT that pays the price. It's the business, the customers, and the trust that binds them together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","New DOD Rule May Encourage More Whistleblowing","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/new-dod-rule-may-encourage-more-whistleblowing-179930.html","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:02:13 GMT","

A new rule by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) aimed at beefing up cybersecurity at contractors doing business with the agency could spawn more whistleblowers in the military-industrial complex.

The rule, set to take effect Nov. 10, governs the agency's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program, which verifies that defense contractors are compliant with existing protections for federal contract information (FCI) and controlled unclassified information (CUI) and are protecting that information at a level commensurate with the risk from cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats.

It is largely a response to a series of reports by the DOD's Inspector General from 2018 to 2023, which consistently found that the department's contract officials failed to establish processes to verify that contractors complied with selected federal cybersecurity requirements for controlled unclassified information as required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

With the new rule, the CMMC program introduces an annual affirmation requirement, a key element for monitoring and enforcing accountability of a company's cybersecurity status.

“At a very basic level, the new CMMC Clause Rule increases the risks that a defense contractor will make a false claim to the government, which is the foundation of False Claims Act liability, by falsely certifying compliance with the rule's increased requirements,” explained Mary Inman, a partner with Whistleblower Partners, a law firm in San Francisco.

“With heightened risk of False Claims Act liability also comes increased opportunities for whistleblowers to alert the government to such transgressions and receive a financial reward,” she told TechNewsWorld.

In her Cyber Business Daily newsletter, Kate Fazzini noted that the new CMMC requirements will make cybersecurity compliance and certification explicit terms in many Department of Defense contracts.

“Misrepresentations — whether intentional or negligent — about assessments, controls, or maintaining a ‘current status' will be more easily pursued under the False Claims Act and related statutes,” she wrote. “Contractors who allow lapses in compliance, or misstate their readiness, will face heightened legal exposure — particularly if government investigators or whistleblowers bring those failures to light.”

“The changes to CMMC will make compliance failures harder to conceal and more costly to ignore,” she added. “Cyber controls will no longer be only about defense but long-term viability in a market where insiders have both the means and the motivation to speak out.”

The CMMC rule creates new incentives for cyber whistleblowing by establishing concrete compliance standards that make violations more identifiable and reportable, transforming vague security expectations into specific, measurable requirements that employees can clearly recognize when breached, observed Frank Balonis, CISO and senior vice president of operations at Kiteworks,  a provider of a secure platform for exchanging private data, based in San Mateo, Calif.

“With mandatory third-party assessments and potential False Claims Act liability for contractors who misrepresent their cybersecurity posture on federal contracts, insiders now have stronger legal protections and financial motivations to report non-compliance — particularly given that whistleblowers can receive up to 30% of recovered damages in qui tam cases,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Qui tam lawsuits, authorized under the federal False Claims Act, allow a private individual to sue on behalf of the U.S. government to expose fraud involving federal programs or contracts.

“The rule's emphasis on continuous monitoring and documentation creates extensive paper trails that make it easier for employees to substantiate claims of inadequate security practices or fraudulent certifications, while the high stakes of losing federal contracts incentivize companies to cut corners, creating more opportunities for observant employees to witness and report violations,” he said.

“This combination of clearer standards, stronger legal frameworks, and significant financial consequences transforms cybersecurity compliance from an abstract concept into a concrete area ripe for whistleblower activity,” he added.

Dale Hoak, the CISO at RegScale, a compliance automation software company in McLean, Va., argued that if an organization is doing the right thing and can prove it, whistleblowing isn't a strategic risk.

“Where it could come into play is if internal concerns are raised but ignored,” he told TechNewsWorld. “In that case, employees may feel compelled to escalate externally. The healthier path is to treat internal reporting seriously, so it rarely has to go outside the organization.”

While the new compliance requirements aim to deter adversaries from targeting defense contractors, they could make them more attractive to cybercriminals.

“Just as cybercriminals like Black Cat/ALPHV ransomware group filed SEC reports when victims failed to report cyberattacks, cybercriminal whistleblowers have one more way to threaten organizations that may have thought they met requirements but negligently and accidentally misrepresented their current status,” maintained Karen Walsh, CEO of Allegro Solutions, a cybersecurity consulting company in West Hartford, Conn.

“With the False Claims Act and related statutes being incorporated into this version of CMMC requirements, we see again a burden placed upon smaller contractors,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“CMMC has always and will always place the greatest burdens on small and mid-sized contractors,” she said.

For example, she recalled the early days of the CMMC in 2021, when the training materials noted that contracts would be held to the Christian Doctrine, established in G.L. Christian & Associates v. United States. “This unique contract law doctrine reads compliance requirements into a contract even when not expressly included, holding the contractor responsible for assuming compliance even if the DOD or upstream contractor fails to include it,” she explained.

Nevertheless, Brian Kirk, senior manager for information assurance and cybersecurity at Cherry Bekaert, an accounting and consulting firm headquartered in Raleigh, N.C., argued that the new CMMC rule is necessary to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of the Defense Industrial Base.

“Previous efforts, like requiring compliance with NIST SP 800-171, relied heavily on self-attestation, which proved insufficient,” he told TechNewsWorld. NIST SP 800-171 outlines the security requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in nonfederal systems and organizations — especially those working with the U.S. government.

“Many contractors failed to implement required controls, leaving sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information vulnerable,” Kirk explained. “CMMC introduces third-party assessments and structured accountability to ensure that contractors handling CUI are actually meeting the required cybersecurity standards.”

“With the Pentagon finalizing the CMMC rule, the program is officially moving from policy to enforceable requirements, and this has major implications for the channel,” added Andy Black, co-founder and CEO of Kovr.ai, a company focused on automating cyber compliance for cloud and hybrid environments, in Reston, Va.

“Resellers, managed service providers, and other partners supporting defense contractors now need to ensure their solutions meet CMMC standards, as contractors are increasingly required to flow these requirements through their supply chains,” he told TechNewsWorld.

John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a provider of encryption and access control tools, in Washington, D.C., explained that CMMC 2.0 has been years in the making — streamlined from five levels to three, adjusted to reduce burden on small businesses, and refined through countless comment periods.

“The organizations that come out on top will be those who secured their CUI first with effective, low-time-to-value solutions, then augmented from there,” he told TechNewsWorld. “When contracts start including CMMC requirements, ‘we're working on it' won't be enough.”

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

REDMOND, Wash. — About 5 minutes before each hour, and 5 minutes after it, Microsoft Teams gets busy with people joining meetings early or late. Yes, you know who you are.

Those predictable spikes in demand are an example of a larger infrastructure challenge facing the industry: either build data centers full of chips and servers that sit idle for much of the time, waiting to handle peak loads, or risk performance issues during moments of high demand.

Microsoft has come up with a different approach. The company said Tuesday that it has successfully prototyped new advances in the field of microfluidics that let its servers run hotter and faster — a technique known as overclocking — without the risk of melting down the silicon.

“We've got these really spiky workloads — I would dearly love to be able to overclock … because then we would need way fewer servers and deliver a better experience,” said Jim Kleewein, a Microsoft technical fellow and development director for core Office 365 services, recounting the challenge he originally brought to Microsoft's silicon development teams.

Microfluidics overall is not a new concept. Instead of placing a cooling plate on top of a chip, the approach brings liquid coolant directly inside the processor itself through tiny channels. 

But Microsoft says it has developed a new approach that uses AI to customize the cooling system for the unique heat signatures of different chips running specific workloads.

The design, inspired by biology, ends up resembling the veins in a leaf, delivering coolant with greater precision to a chip's hottest spots. The company says it's up to three times more effective at removing heat than current cold plates, making overclocking more feasible.

Some of the hot spots on a chip “could have the same heat flux as the surface of the sun when you look at the very small scale,” said Husam Alissa, Microsoft's director of systems technology, referring to a technical measure of heat intensity, or density in a specific area. 

While the working prototype was demonstrated on a commercially available Intel Xeon chip, Microsoft says the innovation is part of a broader strategy to improve its entire hardware fleet. As a next step, the company is looking to incorporate the cooling technology into future versions of its own silicon, potentially including its Azure Cobalt chip and Maia AI accelerator.

Those first-party chips, unveiled in 2023, reflect Microsoft's efforts to gain control over the final piece in its cloud platform. The company is competing to efficiently train and run cutting-edge AI models against Amazon, Google, and others, which are also making their own chips.

Microsoft still uses third-party chips, including industry-standard GPUs from Nvidia and other suppliers, but it says a more integrated approach is necessary to meet the challenges of the AI era. The goal isn't to replace partners but to advance the broader ecosystem, said Rani Borkar, the corporate vice president who leads Azure hardware systems and infrastructure.

“The demands of Al are such that, frankly, hardware on its own cannot keep up,” Borkar said during a recent media briefing and tour of Microsoft's Silicon Lab in Redmond. “We really are all about co-designing, co-optimizing every layer of the stack.”

The company made two related announcements Tuesday morning:

As for the newly announced microfluidics advances, Microsoft says it will work with partners and the broader tech community to make the technology an industry standard. 

Longer term, the company sees the cooling technology as a foundational step toward a revolutionary new type of chip architecture: 3D stacking. While stacking layers of silicon dramatically reduces latency by shortening the distance data has to travel, it has been largely unfeasible because of the immense challenge of removing heat from the inner layers.

Microfluidics could eventually solve that by allowing coolant to flow between each layer of the silicon brick, a breakthrough that Microsoft's Kleewein believes could be transformative.

“That is where this could move from, ‘it's an interesting change that the rest of the industry should adopt,' to a ‘holy shit' moment in the evolution of technology,” he said.

Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE

Battery materials startup Sila is starting operations today at its automotive-scale manufacturing facility, located in Moses Lake, Wash.

The plant is producing a silicon-carbon anode material that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries like those used to power electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer devices. Batteries using Sila's Titan Silicon can hold 20% more energy than traditional batteries.

The new plant measures 600,000 square-feet and is situated on a 160-acre site in the arid, Eastern Washington location.

Sila's operations will start at a relatively modest capacity, producing enough anode material for 2 to 5 gigawatt hours of battery capacity. Depending on how much of the graphite is replaced by Sila's product, that initial volume is enough to power tens of thousands of EVs or millions of mobile devices. 

The plan is to scale to 250 gigawatt hours of material by the end of the decade, which would make the Sila plant the largest anode production facility in the world, the company said. Sila has shared news of partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic, and expects to start shipping material to customers as soon as next year. 

The opening of the site comes at a time when the U.S. clean energy sector is battling economic headwinds as the Trump administration has canceled funding and initiatives supporting many climate-related projects.  

The Biden administration created programs to bolster domestic battery production to compete with China, who is the global lead in manufacturing the energy cells. Sila won a $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant in 2022 as part of that effort. 

“This is not just about building a factory. It is about closing the gap between innovation and manufacturing in America,” said Gene Berdichevsky, Sila's CEO and co-founder, in a statement. 

“If we do not execute, innovation will flow to places that can,” he added. “We have to build here in the United States to create a self-sustaining innovation economy, ensuring that our advancements in next-generation battery technology, like silicon-carbon anodes, are not only conceived but also produced domestically at a global scale.”

The company broke ground in Moses Lake less than two years ago and last year raised $375 million to help fund the completion of the plant. Sila has netted more than $1.3 billion from investors. The company launched in 2011 and is based in Alameda, Calif. It has 400 employees, with 100 working at the manufacturing plant. 

“This new facility is a prime example of the domestic innovation needed to end our dependency on foreign countries for advanced battery technology and produce high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that protect our supply chains here at home,” said U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., who represents Moses Lake. 

Sila competitor Group14 Technologies is building nearby, but earlier this year laid off an undisclosed number of employees and delayed its manufacturing start date. Group14 this summer secured $463 million from investors.

California-based OneD Battery Sciences shuttered its pilot manufacturing facility in Moses Lake this past spring, and appears to have ceased all operations.  

Other Pacific Northwest battery materials startups include Ecellix and Emerald Battery Labs, which are based in Seattle, and Oregon's Skip Technologies and ZincFive.   

Sila expects to employ up to 500 people in Moses Lake when it ramps up to full capacity. It's partnering with Big Bend Community College and Columbia Basin Technical Skills Center to support workforce development.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Individuals who fear for their safety — perhaps from a threatening domestic partner, roommate or stalker — might also be afraid to publicly pursue a protection order that can shield them from interactions or harassment from that person.  

So a Seattle-area government program and Microsoft partnered to develop an online portal that makes it much easier for an applicant to file the required legal documents with the courts and connects them with an in-person advocate as needed.

The Protection Order Portal is operated by the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office and has served 17 people per day on average since launching in June 2024.

The completely online process “helps save lives, and it helps people feel more safe in their home environment, in their community, and fewer children are witnesses to domestic violence,” said King County Prosecutor Leesa Manion.

Legislative changes enacted in June further strengthened these protections, including rules that inform survivors when abusers petition to restore their access to firearms or when that right is removed, and it increases the penalties when abusers are found with homemade or “ghost” guns. The law also makes it easier for minors who are guarded by a protection order to continue their coverage when turning 18.

Protection orders encompass scenarios including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, cyber stalking and harassment. The order does not require that a crime has been committed, but applicants must provide evidence supporting their concerns.

When a judge grants an order, prohibited actions — such as contacting or coming in proximity to a protected individual — become illegal and a victim can contact police. The orders can be used to safeguard the petitioners, children and pets.

Melissa Hutchins was harassed by a cyberstalker who threatened violence and was ultimately convicted and given a 9-year sentence. She went on to become founder and CEO of Certifi AI, a Seattle-based startup protecting digital identity. 

Hutchins supports the availability of both in-person and online support for addressing this need. 

“When people are in these positions of needing to file for a protection order, most are operating in an extreme state of fear, urgently seeking answers and support from someone that can help walk through the process with them,” she said via email. 

“It's very encouraging to see the development of this portal, making it easier for individuals to access the legal protections they need,” Hutchins added. 

Before the COVID pandemic prompted the move to online services, “everything was pen-to-paper and parties were required to be in person for every step of the civil protection order process,” said Kelsey Greer, program manager of the Protection Order Advocacy Program.

Applications previously required multiple trips to a King County courthouse, including picking up and filing petition documents and attending three hearings. And most applicants are working without an attorney, which could make it difficult to navigate the legalese in the documents. The new portal includes an easy-to-understand questionnaire that transfers the answers to the official application.

While the process is simpler, the portal doesn't change or weaken the legal standards that must be met for protection, and a judge or commissioner has final say on the order.

Protection order renewals, modifications and terminations are still filed in person.

Requests for protection orders have risen sharply, jumping 26% from 2022 to 2023, King County officials said. The surge was due to changes in Washington law that took effect July 2022 and simplified the petition process.

Reported domestic assault declined 11% from 2019 to last year, according to a survey of 10 sample cities by the Council on Criminal Justice. But violence from intimate partners, including spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, spiked from 2021 to 2022, reports the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Experts point to pandemic-related isolation and financial pressure as potentially contributing to the increase.

The effort to put the protection order service online wasn't so much about saving money, said Manion, as it was about meeting the higher demand.

“We are able to serve more people,” she said. “If we had only in person, everything by paper, I don't think that we have enough hours to serve 17 petitioners a day. So there would be some parts of our community who feel afraid, know they need help, and just don't get it.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon introduced a Nova Act extension to build and test AI agents directly inside integrated development environments including Visual Studio Code, Amazon's Kiro, and Cursor.

The company says the new extension, unveiled Tuesday, addresses a common frustration for developers: the constant back-and-forth between an IDE and a browser when testing agents.

It follows the March launch of Nova Act, Amazon's AI model and toolkit for creating autonomous agents in web browsers. Nova Act was the first release from Amazon's AGI Lab in San Francisco.

Amazon says features of the new extension include natural-language script generation, a notebook-style builder for cell-by-cell execution, live debugging with a unified view of code and browser actions, and an ‘Action Viewer' to compare workflow versions side-by-side.

Nova Act is part of a broader effort by Amazon to compete with rivals including OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google in offering agentic AI tools to developers and businesses, attempting to expand beyond generative AI tools that require active user involvement.

Visual Studio Code dominates the market for code editors, with a large ecosystem of extensions and cross-platform support. Cursor is a popular AI-powered fork of VS Code with natural-language coding and smart search. Amazon's Kiro is an AI coding tool that uses agents to automatically create and update project plans and technical blueprints.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek

MediaTek's chips power over 2 billion devices a year. From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever. As AI moves from the edge to the cloud, MediaTek's high-end chips make intelligent devices even smarter.

Big electric trucks are having a hard time. The Cybertruck is a bust, Stellantis just canceled the Ram 1500 EV, and even sales of Ford's promising F-150 Lightning have been on the decline.

But the United States loves trucks. So is the key to making them love electric trucks… a very small one? 

That's the bet that California-based startup Telo has been making since its inception in 2022. The company has designed a bite-sized truck called the MT1 with an admittedly not-so-small starting price of around $41,000. 

Now, investors want in on that same bet: Telo announced Tuesday it has closed a $20 million Series A funding round. The round was co-led by designer and Telo co-founder Yves Béhar, and Tesla co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who is on Telo's board. Additional investment came from Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, and early stage funds like TO VC, E12 Ventures, and Neo.

In the world of automotive manufacturing, $20 million does not go very far. To contrast, Slate Auto, which is building its own wild take on a small electric pickup truck, has raised more than $700 million, to date. Startups like Fisker Inc., Canoo, and Lordstown Motors also raised hundreds of millions before they all collapsed.

Telo has far more modest goals and a sharper aim than those companies, though. 

“Our hyper-focus is on trucks for the downtowns of cities,” co-founder and CEO Jason Marks told TechCrunch on a video call while bouncing around Telo's 10,000-square-foot San Carlos facility — which shares a backyard with the original Tesla headquarters. 

While Telo may someday embrace other markets — Marks said some small farmers are quite interested in the truck — the company considers those to be secondary. It's cities that Marks wants to conquer first; the CEO said he's spent far too much time circling San Francisco streets looking for parking to focus on any other use case.

Telo is not promising to build hundreds of thousands of MT1s. Instead, it's got a pre-order list of around 12,000, and Marks said Telo initially plans to build around 5,000 per year via contract manufacturing.

“Our whole ethos is, what does it take to get to unit profitability as quickly as possible,” he said. “That's positioned us differently than the other automakers who have come out and said, ‘Hey, we're we need a billion dollars to get to production.'”

The Series A funding will go toward building the final production-intent version of the MT1, homologating the vehicle to U.S. safety standards, and finishing crash testing. Marks said that last piece is key, because the MT1's short front end has understandably inspired many questions about how safe the truck will be.

Telo hopes to deliver its first MT1 by the end of 2026.

To get the most out of the funding, Marks said Telo will stay “as lean as we physically can.” That means keeping its workforce to around 25 employees in the near-term, while leveraging consultants and contractors — many of whom Marks said have long-standing relationships with Tarpenning.

The idea of using outside help is getting another boost with the Series A, as Marks said Telo filled the round with angel investors and smaller companies from across the EV world. “It's a pretty incredible community that just wants to see new architectures for mobility succeed,” he said.

The MT1 is a big idea, but it isn't all about size. Marks said Telo has spent a lot of time making sure the MT1 is useful. For instance, he's oriented the project around the idea of “performance per square foot.”

“We're the only vehicle that can seat five with a five-foot bed,” he said. That means despite the Telo truck's diminutive stature, it squeezes in roughly an extra half-foot of space compared to some of the trucks it might compete with, like the 4.5-foot beds found on the all-electric Rivian R1T and the affordable compact Ford Maverick.

But the biggest part of the MT1's usefulness might be its range. Marks is adamant that the truck will get around 350 miles on a full battery, putting it up there with some of the most capable EVs on the market. Not only does that make the truck capable of longer drives, but it means less charging required for the city-dwellers Telo is targeting.

Telo was able to hit this figure, according to Marks, through a combination of somewhat competing factors. The MT1's small stature helps because it's inherently not as heavy as a normal-sized truck, boosting efficiency. But that made it challenging to package the 106kWh battery pack in such a way that the MT1 wasn't just a pallet of lithium-ion cells with seats.

Marks didn't go into too much detail, as Telo's battery-related patents are still pending. But he said the MT1 essentially gives up some performance (like faster 0-60 speeds) in exchange for making the battery pack work in the footprint of a Mini Cooper.

That robust range figure may be tempting if it ultimately bears out. And the rise in popularity of imported Japanese Kei trucks in the U.S. shows that people are willing to go to great lengths for something in this form factor. 

There are real headwinds against EVs in the U.S. these days, but Marks believes Telo can overcome them.

“You're told, ‘run fast, break things.' It's a very Silicon Valley nature,” he said. “But the other Silicon Valley nature is, how do you do a ton with the smallest amount of capital and the smallest team possible? Do things that big corporations can't do?”

As Google's project manager for developer tools, Ryan Salva has a front-row seat to the ways AI tools are changing coding. Formerly of Github and Microsoft, he's now responsible for tools like Gemini CLI and Gemini Code Assist, nudging developers into the new world of agentic programming. 

His team released new third-party research on Tuesday showing how developers actually use AI tools – and how much progress is left to make. I sat down with Salva to talk about the report and his personal experience with AI coding tools.

This interview was edited for length and clarity.

Every year, Google does a survey of developer trends – but this year's report really focuses on AI tools, and specifically how agentic developers are willing to get in their approach to programming. Was there anything in the research that surprised you? 

One of the really interesting findings was the median date when developers started using AI tools. They found it was April 2024, which corresponds fairly neatly to Claude 3 coming out and Gemini 2.5 coming out. This is really the dawn of the reasoning or thinking models, and around that same time, we got much better at tool-calling. 

For coding tasks, you really need to be able to leverage external information in order to problem solve, so it may need to grep, it may need to compile the code. If the code compiles it may want to run that unit test, and that integration test. I think that tool-calling really is the important piece that gave models the ability to self-correct as they move along.

How are you using AI coding tools personally?

Most of my coding these days is for hobby projects, and I spend most of my time using command line-based tools. So that includes Gemini CLI. Then there's a little bit of Claude Code, little bit of Codex in there. And you don't ever really use a terminal-based tool by itself, so I'm really heterogeneous around the IDEs that I use. I use Zed. I use VS code. I use Cursor. I use Windsurf, all of them, because I'm interested in just seeing how the world works and how the industry is evolving.

On the professional side, product managers tend to live in documents, so the first thing is using AI to help me write the specification and requirements docs.

I'm curious how that works. You're using Gemini CLI to build Gemini CLI, but I would imagine it doesn't just run itself.

A development task will usually start as an issue, maybe it's a GitHub issue that someone's dropped with a bug. Often, if I'm really being honest, it's a fairly under-specified issue. So I'll use Gemini CLI in order to create a more robust requirement doc in Markdown. That will usually create probably about 100 lines of fairly technical, but also outcome-driven specification. Then I will use Gemini CLI to write the code based on that specification and the general preferences in the team documents.

Across the engineering team, we have a couple of different layers of rules and Markdown docs that get consumed by the model, just laying out our way of working: Here's how we do testing, here's how we manage dependencies, and so on. So when it produces the code, it's also working from those documents.

And as Gemini CLI is going through and doing the troubleshooting, I'll have it update my requirements doc saying, “I fixed this step. Now I'm on to the next step,” and so on. Each one of those creates its own commit and pull request in the repository, so I can always rewind or undo.

I would say probably 70% to 80% of my work is me working in the terminal with natural language, trying to use Gemini CLI to craft the requirements, and then allowing Gemini CLI to write most of the code for me, which I will then go review and read with whatever IDE I happen to be using. But mostly I'm using the IDE as a place to read the code, rather than to write the code.

Do you think there's a future for raw computer code? Or will we just move everything into terminal windows?

For three decades, the IDE was where we went to do everything in software development. You had the IDE, you had the browser, and you had the terminal window.  

I think that's still largely the case, but I suspect that over time we'll end up spending a lot more time working with the requirements, and the amount of time spent in the IDE will gradually shrink. And I think that change may actually happen over a pretty long time horizon. 

There's a lot of angst about what that means for software development as a progression. If 10 years from now, we're no longer looking at code, what does that mean for developers? Will there still be a job for them?

I think that your job as a developer is going to look a lot more like an architect. It is going to be about taking big, complex problems and breaking them down into smaller, solvable tasks. You'll need to be thinking about like the bigger picture about what you're trying to produce, rather than the intermediate language in order to express that in machine code.

Meta has raised the stakes in Big Tech's fight against AI regulation. The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports Axios.

Meta's pro-AI PAC, called the American Technology Excellence Project, is the company's latest effort to combat policies it sees as harmful to the development of AI. Last month, Meta launched a California-focused PAC to back tech-friendly candidates in state races.

Axios reports that Meta's new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year's midterm elections. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, told the outlet that the super PAC will focus on promoting and defending U.S. tech companies and leadership, advocating for AI progress, and putting parents in charge of how their children experience online apps and AI technologies.  

The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools. Meta has come under particular scrutiny after leaked internal documents showed the company's chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” chats with kids and whistleblower reports alleged that the company may have suppressed research on child safety. 

Meta has not shared which states its super PAC would focus on, nor how many people the PAC would employ. 

The PAC comes at a time when many states are proposing AI regulations, spurred by a perceived failure of the federal government to address the issue. More than 1,000 bills were introduced in all 50 states related to AI during the 2025 legislative session. In California specifically, two bills passed and are awaiting signature or veto by Governor Gavin Newsom: SB 243, a bill that would regulate AI companion chatbots to protect minors and vulnerable users, and SB 53, a bill that would set new transparency requirements on large AI companies.  

Reached for comment, Meta VP of public policy Brian Rice said the new group would “support the election of state candidates across the country who embrace AI development, champion the U.S. technology industry, and defend American tech leadership at home and abroad.”

Silicon Valley has picked up the pace this year to try to curb states' abilities to pass AI legislation, arguing that such a “patchwork” would be difficult for powerful AI companies to navigate and slow down innovation at a time when the U.S. is racing to beat China in AI development. 

Last month, Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman launched a Silicon Valley super PAC with $100 million dedicated to advocating against AI regulation. Earlier this year, a proposal that would bar states from regulating AI at all for 10 years almost made it into the federal budget, but was ultimately struck down.

Robotics companies often have to deal with a simple but confounding problem: Robots produce a lot of data. Even a simple robot can easily produce up to a terabyte of data per day, since they continuously capture data from cameras and sensors.

Sydney, Australia-based Alloy thinks it can help with that issue: The startup is building data infrastructure for robotics companies to help them process and organize all the data their robots collect from various sources, including sensors and cameras.  

At its core, Alloy encodes and labels the data it collects, and allows users to search through their data using natural language to find bugs and errors. Users can also set up rules to catch and flag issues in the future, similar to how observability tools flag errors in software code.  

“The current pattern is, you look for some kind of anomaly, and then you'll replay the data,” Joe Harris, the founder and CEO of Alloy, told TechCrunch. “They then are spending hours scrubbing through this data, looking for these issues that have been flagged to them, trying to diagnose from that [while] not really having a good view as to whether this has happened before, if it's a high-severity issue or this one-off, edge case.” 

Considering how much data a single robot produces, as robotics companies look to scale, this data problem will continue to compound, Harris added.  

Harris has been fascinated by robotics since he was a kid. But when he graduated from college in 2018, there weren't many opportunities to work in the field, so he instead worked multiple roles across Australian tech companies, including Atlassian and telehealth startup Eucalyptus.  

In 2024, he decided the time was right to launch a robotics company of his own. He originally thought he'd focus on building robots for the agriculture industry due to an interest in vertical farming, but when he started talking to other founders, the issue of managing the data robots produce kept coming up. He figured he might as well solve that problem first.  

“If I need to solve this problem for myself and my robotics company, I will have a great horizontal solution,” Harris said. “Perhaps that would be a more important near-term mission — to help enable other robotics companies to spend less time on data plumbing and more time on getting to that high reliability.” 

Since its launch in February 2025, Alloy has signed four Australian robotics companies as design partners and looks to push into the U.S. market this year.  

“The customers that we found have been most excited about this because they've gone through the pain of building and maintaining it themselves,” Harris said. “They'd much rather have a fantastic tool, like a Databricks just specifically built for robotics.” 

Alloy has also raised a little more than AUD $4.5 million (about $3 million) in a pre-seed round that was led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Airtree Ventures, Xtal Ventures, and Skip Capital, in addition to angel investors from robotics companies.  

The company doesn't have too many direct competitors yet. Many robotics companies are either retrofitting existing data management tools that aren't designed for the multimodal data robots produce, or are attempting to build their own internal data management tools.  

As commercial use cases for robotics continue to increase, Alloy hopes it will be able to capture a good share of the growing market.  

“It's never been a better time to build a robotics company,” Harris said. “I really want to make it possible for the next 10,000, 100,000 robotics companies that don't yet exist, that inevitably will not have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, like every company has.”

WhatsApp is rolling out the ability for users to translate messages into their preferred language, the Meta-owned company announced on Tuesday. 

Now, if users see a message in a different language, they can long-press and tap “Translate.” Users can then select the language they want to translate from or to, and download it for future use. WhatsApp notes that message translations are available in one-on-one chats, groups, and Channel updates. 

Android users have the option to turn on automatic translation for an entire chat thread in order to see all future incoming messages in that conversation translated. 

The company notes that translations occur on the user's device, where WhatsApp cannot see them, which means that messages remain encrypted.

“With more than 3 billion users in over 180 countries, we're always working to keep our users closely connected, no matter where they are in the world,” WhatsApp wrote in a blog post. “But we understand that sometimes language can be a barrier to getting things done or expressing how you truly feel. That's why we're excited to bring message translations to WhatsApp, so you can more easily communicate across languages.”

The move comes a few months after Apple launched live translation in Messages. 

Message translations are rolling out to Android and iPhone users starting Tuesday.

Android users can access translations in six languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic. iPhone users can do so in Arabic, Dutch, English, French, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.

It's unknown when WhatsApp plans to bring message translations to the web or to its Windows and Mac apps.

Some notable constraints: files are immutable, write-once update never. Designed for files at least 2MB in size. Slow at directory creation/deletion. No permissions/access control.

reply

These limits aren't quite as strict as they first seem.Our median file size is 2MB, which means 50% of our files are <2MB. Realistically if you've got an exabyte of data with an average file size of a few kilobytes then this is the wrong tool for the job (you need something more like a database), but otherwise it should be just fine. We actually have a nice little optimisation where very small files are stored inline in the metadata.It works out of the box with ""normal"" tools like rsync, python, etc despite the immutability. The reality is that most things don't actually modify files, even text editors tend to save a new version and rename over the top. We had to update relatively little of our massive code base when switching over to this. For us that was a big win, moving to an S3-like interface would have required updating a lot of code.Directory creation/deletion is ""slow"", currenly limited to about 10,000 operations per second. We don't current need to create more than 10,000 directories per second so we just haven't prioritised improving that. There is an issue open, #28, which would get this up to 100,000 per second. This is the sort of thing that, like access control, I would love to have had in an initial open source release, but we prioritised open sourcing what we have over getting it perfect.

it is essentially copy-on-write exposed to the user level. the only issue is that this breaks hard links, so tools that rely on that are going to break. but yes, custom code should be easy to adapt.

It was a long long time ago that we were only using NFS, it ran on top of a Solaris machine running ZFS. It did its job at the very beginning, but you don't build up hundreds of petabytes of data on an NFS server.We did try various solutions in between NFS and developing TernFS, both open source and properietary. However we didn't name these specifically in the blog post because there's little point in bad mouthing what didn't work out for us.

Historically NFS has had many flaws on different O/S-es. Many of these issues appear to have been resolved over time and I have not seen it being referred to as ""Nightmare File System"" for decades.However, depending on many factors NFS may still be a bad choice. In our setup, for example, using a large SQLite database through NFS turns out to be up to 10 times as slow as using a ""real"" disk.The SQLite FAQs warn about bigger problems than slowness:

For local filesystems, the average PC user shouldn't really care though. Just use whatever your installer defaults. But this story is about a distributed filesystem.I don't have great hopes for one capable of such massive scale being good and usable (low overhead, low complexity, low adminst cost) in very small configurations, but we can always hope.

by Harj Taggar, Jesse Pollak9/23/2025

We believe that it's time to build onchain. The tools have been maturing over the last decade, but with low-cost chains, globally adopted stablecoins, easy-to-use wallets, and growing consumer adoption, the infrastructure is finally ready. And we are already seeing a number of large trends that have huge opportunity for builders around the world.

It starts with the fact that we are at the beginning of a new era in financial technology: Fintech 3.0.

Fintech 1.0 was the initial digitization of finance in the 90s, driven by companies like PayPal. The key unlock here was that consumers became comfortable paying for things online. 

Fintech 2.0, which occurred over the last decade and was driven by companies like Stripe, Plaid, Brex, and Chime, involved building APIs on top of the existing financial system. The key unlock here were banking-as-a-service (BaaS) providers that made it possible for startups to build on top of the legacy financial system. 

Now, we are entering the era of Fintech 3.0. This era will be about building a new financial system with code. A system where payments settle instantly, anywhere in the world, 24/7. A system where users store their assets in digital wallets, which they have full control and custody over, rather than banks. 

For years, the main obstacle to building Fintech 3.0 has been regulatory uncertainty. With the passage of the GENIUS Act—and potentially, the CLARITY Act—we now have a clear crypto regulatory framework in the US that will let founders build generational companies onchain, with confidence. This is the most significant opportunity for crypto startups in years, and at YC and Coinbase, we want to fund and support you to seize it. 

Below, we discuss a few areas we're particularly excited to fund, though this is by no means exhaustive.

Stablecoins are the first major success story for Fintech 3.0.

Stablecoins are an onchain asset whose value is pegged to another asset, like fiat currency or gold, designed to maintain a stable price. Stablecoins are ideal for payments, and offer clear benefits over traditional financial transactions, especially when moving money across borders. Anyone can send a stablecoin anywhere in the world 24/7, for less than 1 cent and in under 1 second, with no foreign exchange fees. This isn't theoretical; trillions of dollars of stablecoin payments have already been settled. 

People are already building stablecoin apps with millions of users. YC alumni like Kontigo, DolarApp, and Aspora are powering instant, low-cost payments and remittances for millions of users across Latin America and South Asia. Coinbase Ventures-backed company El Dorado, a marketplace for sending and receiving stablecoins in Latin America, has processed $200 million for nearly 1 million users in the past year—evidence of the region's growing demand for crypto as a hedge against currency devaluation.

And it's not just startups: Coinbase just launched its open-source Commerce Payments Protocol with Shopify, which enables any traditional online commerce and acceptance flows onchain with stablecoins—providing all of the benefits of crypto payments (lightning fast settlements, near-zero transaction fees) with the security and scale of typical e-commerce features (delayed capture, tax finalization, and refunds). 

The fact that stablecoins have succeeded despite regulatory headwinds speaks to just how strong market demand for them is. Now, their adoption in the US is set to explode after the successful passage of the GENIUS Act, which creates a comprehensive federal regulatory system for stablecoins that mirrors the system for banks. Since the GENIUS Act went into effect, the total market capitalization of stablecoins has grown by over $30 billion and major companies like Amazon and Walmart have expressed interest in launching their own stablecoins.

There are lots of areas to build in the stablecoin space, but we're particularly interested in:

The same rails that make stablecoins work can be used for any asset. This is where Fintech 3.0 gets really interesting. With tokenization, we can radically change what an asset is and who can own it.

Tokenization means representing real-world assets, like a government bond, a share in a startup, a piece of art, or a loan, as a digital token on a blockchain. The value here is that assets that have historically been illiquid and locked behind layers of middlemen can now be owned, traded, and used by anyone, anywhere. 

In practice, this could mean:

This is already starting to happen. Major institutions like J.P. Morgan are bringing their own deposit tokens onchain, and startups like Courtyard are tokenizing physical collectibles. We're also seeing the emergence of new, onchain native assets like creator and content coins being tokenized on Zora and Pump.fun. 

And all of this is leading to a lot of new trading: businesses like YC alumni Axiom are some of the fastest-growing YC companies that we've ever seen.

The core infrastructure is here. We're looking for founders to build the products that will bring every other asset class online. 

We're especially interested in:

Onchain also opens up a new frontier for apps and agents that were not possible on yesterday's internet. One way to think about chains is as a new kind of operating system: a global, shared platform that's 10x better for building apps, that no single company owns, and on which anyone can build without asking permission. And with money-as-software, agents are natively equipped to participate in this new economy.

We think this will lead to an explosion of new apps. Social, finance, collaboration, games—everything. We're already seeing this happen on platforms like Base, where you can use apps to do just about anything: from getting a loan in seconds, to playing a game and making money, to supporting your favorite creators in a way where you earn, too.

And we think that many of these apps will also show up in chat, as agents. AI agents with wallets are superpowered, and will help people navigate and participate in the rapidly growing global economy. They'll simplify and improve user experiences, just like they are doing in other business sectors across the world.

We are so excited to see what you build onchain. If you are building for this new reality—or have an even bigger vision for what this new era unlocks—we want to hear from you. Together, YC, Base, and Coinbase Ventures are excited to support developers building onchain.Apply here for the next YC batch.

Some companies are working to remedy the issue.

Some AI chatbots rely on flawed research from retracted scientific papers to answer questions, according to recent studies. The findings, confirmed by MIT Technology Review, raise questions about how reliable AI tools are at evaluating scientific research and could complicate efforts by countries and industries seeking to invest in AI tools for scientists.

AI search tools and chatbots are already known to fabricate links and references. But answers based on the material from actual papers can mislead as well if those papers have been retracted.  The chatbot is “using a real paper, real material, to tell you something,” says Weikuan Gu, a medical researcher at the University of Tennessee in Memphis and an author of one of the recent studies. But, he says, if people only look at the content of the answer and do not click through to the paper and see that it's been retracted, that's really a problem. 

Gu and his team asked OpenAI's ChatGPT, running on the GPT-4o model, questions based on information from 21 retracted papers on medical imaging. The chatbot's answers referenced retracted papers in five cases but advised caution in only three. While it cited non-retracted papers for other questions, the authors note it may not have recognized the retraction status of the articles. In a study from August, a different group of researchers used ChatGPT-4o mini to evaluate the quality of 217 retracted and low-quality papers from different scientific fields; they found that none of the chatbot's responses mentioned retractions or other concerns. (No similar studies have been released on GPT-5, which came out this August.)

The public uses AI chatbots to ask for medical advice and diagnose health conditions. Students and scientists increasingly use science-focused AI tools to review existing scientific literature and summarize papers. That kind of usage is likely to increase. The US National Science Foundation, for instance, invested $75 million in building AI models for science research this August.

The risks posed when kids form bonds with chatbots have turned AI safety from an abstract worry into a political flashpoint. What happens now?

“If [a tool is] facing the general public, then using retraction as a kind of quality indicator is very important,” says Yuanxi Fu, an information science researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There's “kind of an agreement that retracted papers have been struck off the record of science,” she says, “and the people who are outside of science—they should be warned that these are retracted papers.” OpenAI did not provide a response to a request for comment about the paper results.

The problem is not limited to ChatGPT. In June, MIT Technology Review tested AI tools specifically advertised for research work, such as Elicit, Ai2 ScholarQA (now part of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence's Asta tool), Perplexity, and Consensus, using questions based on the 21 retracted papers in Gu's study. Elicit referenced five of the retracted papers in its answers, while Ai2 ScholarQA referenced 17, Perplexity 11, and Consensus 18—all without noting the retractions.

Some companies have since made moves to correct the issue. “Until recently, we didn't have great retraction data in our search engine,” says Christian Salem, cofounder of Consensus. His company has now started using retraction data from a combination of sources, including publishers and data aggregators, independent web crawling, and Retraction Watch, which manually curates and maintains a database of retractions. In a test of the same papers in August, Consensus cited only five retracted papers. 

Elicit told MIT Technology Review that it removes retracted papers flagged by the scholarly research catalogue OpenAlex from its database and is “still working on aggregating sources of retractions.” Ai2 told us that its tool does not automatically detect or remove retracted papers currently. Perplexity said that it “[does] not ever claim to be 100% accurate.” 

However, relying on retraction databases may not be enough. Ivan Oransky, the cofounder of Retraction Watch, is careful not to describe it as a comprehensive database, saying that creating one would require more resources than anyone has: “The reason it's resource intensive is because someone has to do it all by hand if you want it to be accurate.”

Further complicating the matter is that publishers don't share a uniform approach to retraction notices. “Where things are retracted, they can be marked as such in very different ways,” says Caitlin Bakker from University of Regina, Canada, an expert in research and discovery tools. “Correction,” “expression of concern,” “erratum,” and “retracted” are among some labels publishers may add to research papers—and these labels can be added for many reasons, including concerns about the content, methodology, and data or the presence of conflicts of interest. 

Some researchers distribute their papers on preprint servers, paper repositories, and other websites, causing copies to be scattered around the web. Moreover, the data used to train AI models may not be up to date. If a paper is retracted after the model's training cutoff date, its responses might not instantaneously reflect what's going on, says Fu. Most academic search engines don't do a real-time check against retraction data, so you are at the mercy of how accurate their corpus is, says Aaron Tay, a librarian at Singapore Management University.

Oransky and other experts advocate making more context available for models to use when creating a response. This could mean publishing information that already exists, like peer reviews commissioned by journals and critiques from the review site PubPeer, alongside the published paper.  

Many publishers, such as Nature and the BMJ, publish retraction notices as separate articles linked to the paper, outside paywalls. Fu says companies need to effectively make use of such information, as well as any news articles in a model's training data that mention a paper's retraction. 

The users and creators of AI tools need to do their due diligence. “We are at the very, very early stages, and essentially you have to be skeptical,” says Tay.

NASA's 10 new astronaut candidates are already making history. The 2025 class includes the first person to join the astronaut corps who has previously flown to orbit. It's also the first class in history to include more women than men. To top things off, one of them could be the first to set foot on the Red Planet.

These candidates are joining NASA's astronaut corps at a time when human exploration of Mars is a key objective for the agency. Acting Administrator Sean Duffy introduced the class on Monday at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, reiterating the agency's focus on maintaining its leadership in space by pursuing a “bold exploration plan for the future.”

“One of these 10 could actually be one of the first Americans to put their boots on the Mars surface, which is very, very cool,” acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy said during the ceremony, according to CBS News.

“No pressure, NASA, we have some work to do,” he said. And boy, is that an understatement.

Any of NASA's current astronauts could theoretically go to Mars, but this new class has the best shot. With their tenures just beginning, they're most likely to see NASA reach this ambitious, long-term goal. Still, they'll be waiting a while.

NASA's roadmap to the Red Planet includes a critical pit stop at the Moon. Through the “Moon to Mars” initiative, the agency plans to use the Artemis missions as stepping stones toward sending humans to Mars. In recent years, however, progress has stalled due to repeated Artemis mission delays.

Just last week, the agency's safety advisory panel warned that completion of SpaceX's Starship Human Landing System (HLS)—the lunar lander for the Artemis 3 mission—could be “years late.” Artemis 3, which will return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, is slated to launch by mid-2027. But now, the timing is murky.

Before Artemis 3, NASA still has to tackle Artemis 2, wherein four astronauts will embark on a 10-day trip around the Moon. The agency has already delayed this mission multiple times and now expects to launch in April 2026.

All this to say that NASA faces a really long road to Mars. Though the agency claims it could send astronauts to the Red Planet as early as the 2030s, it's more likely to take decades. Still, Duffy hopes this next generation of astronauts will help usher in a “Golden Age” of space exploration.

NASA's 24th astronaut class will spend the next two years in basic training before embarking on their first missions. The candidates will put their diverse skill sets to the test—some tapping into previous NASA experience to advance toward the next stage of their careers.

The class includes Anna Menon, a former biomedical flight controller in Mission Control at Johnson Space Center; Lauren Edgar, former deputy principal investigator for the Artemis 3 Geology Team; and Yuri Kubo, a former ​​co-op student at Johnson. Menon is the first astronaut candidate with prior spaceflight experience, having flown on SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission in 2024.

All 10 candidates have advanced scientific expertise, with backgrounds in engineering, neuroscience, geology, and other disciplines. Their skill sets will certainly come in handy while conducting research aboard the International Space Station, but it's not yet clear what other flight assignments they'll be tapped for. During Monday's event, NASA officials expressed hope that the new astronauts may embark on later Artemis missions and, of course, go to Mars, but for now, their futures remain uncertain.

Perhaps the only thing worse than having a boss who thinks your job can be replaced by artificial intelligence is having a boss who thinks he can do your job for you with AI and wants to show you his work. Unfortunately, depending on your role at the company, Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski is guilty of both.

Futurism recently highlighted the CEO's unfortunate insistence on vibe coding prototype features with AI and then making his actual, professional engineers review his work and try to implement it.

Siemiatkowski recently appeared on the podcast Sourcery, where he revealed his new hobby of cosplaying as an engineer, using AI tools to write code and then bringing those ideas to the desks of the people he pays to do that job. On the episode, the CEO admits he's never coded before, but he started using the AI-powered code editor Cursor to craft prototypes for new features, which he said takes him about 20 minutes to whip up before he takes them to his engineering team.

“Rather than disturbing my poor engineers and product people with what is half good ideas and half bad ideas, now I test it myself. I come say, ‘Look, I've actually made this work, this is how it works, what do you think, could we do it this way?'” he said.

To Siemiatkowski's credit, he has at least a smidgen of self-awareness about the situation. He joked that he occasionally falls for the AI's sycophancy that tells him all of his ideas are great, and he admitted that playing with code in Cursor has made him think about projects in a new way and forces him to articulate his ideas more clearly when communicating with his team. But does that prevent his engineers from letting out a deep sigh when they see Siemiatkowski coming, ready to make them look at a feature he doesn't actually understand but claims works? Hard to say.

Last year, Siemiatkowski said in an interview with the Financial Times that Klarna might employ as few as 2,000 employees in the years ahead as it utilizes AI support in areas like customer service and marketing. According to the company's most recent SEC filing, the company had 3,098 full-time employees as of December 2024, down from 5,527 in December of 2022, attributed to a strategic decision to “reduce our overall headcount and drive operational efficiency by leveraging AI in our business.” Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported the company was planning to launch a recruitment drive to bring on more support to help ensure customers can always talk to a human.

A spokesperson for Klarna said the company's AI customer service had no impact on headcount as the company's customer service is handled by outsourced providers, and described the company's initiative to hire back humans as “over-stated.” While the company is running a pilot program to bring humans into the customer service process, it has hired two people so far, according to the spokesperson.

There might be a similar effect from his interest in code, seeing as the vibe-coding epidemic has been creating opportunities for humans even as others are replaced. NBC and 404 Media both recently ran stories about the new economy of workers and freelancers brought on to correct the messes made by AI-generated code. A survey by cloud computing company Fastly found that 95% of surveyed developers spend extra time fixing AI-generated code, with some saying it takes more time to fix errors than they save by initially generating the code with AI tools. Research firm METR also recently reported finding that using AI tools actually makes developers slower to complete tasks.

But the CEO feels smarter, and isn't that what really matters?

Our previous looks at It: Welcome to Derry focused on some more grounded, realer evils lurking at the heart of a small town in '60s Maine—cops, racism, sexism, the titular Derry has them all. But now we're getting closer to the show's debut, HBO wants to remind you that things are going to get somehow even worse for the residents of Derry. Much, much worse.

Just over a month before the show hits streaming, today HBO dropped our biggest look yet at It: Welcome to Derry, unveiling a glimpse at the horrors to come when Pennywise (the returning Bill Skarsgård) makes his arrival known.

The trailer starts much like our prior looks at the series, as we follow the arrival of a young Black family, the Hanlons (Charlotte and Leroy, played by Taylour Paige and Jovan Adepo, respectively). But their arrival in the community, at a time when children start going missing, stokes up old hatreds and prejudices… only for things to quickly become much darker than they already seem, not just for the Hanlons but for everyone in Derry, with the arrival of a strange falling comet heralding new, petrifying evils. And that's even before a creepy clown starts showing up!

Inspired by the flashback sequences in Stephen King's beloved horror novel, Welcome to Derry also stars James Remar, Stephen Rider, Madeleine Stowe, Rudy Mancuso, and Chris Chalk. Chalk plays Dick Hallorann, a character with close ties to the flashbacks in It but best known for his roles in two other King novels, The Shining and Doctor Sleep.

It: Welcome to Derry hits HBO and HBO Max October 26.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","'Spider-Man: Brand New Day' Taps 'Into the Spider-Verse' Tombstone Star to Leap Into Live-Action","https://gizmodo.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-marvin-jones-iii-tombstone-spider-verse-2000662821","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:47:44 GMT","

While production is currently paused for Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Sony Pictures is making sure to let us know that the show's not stopping with even more casting announcements.

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse villain Tombstone is making his way to Spider-Man: Brand New Day, as Deadline reports that Marvin Jones III (Black Lightning) will be reprising the animated role in live-action. Deadline further reports that Jones will purportedly return to voice Tombstone once more in the upcoming Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, having skipped the middle entry in the trilogy, 2023's Across the Spider-Verse.

One of many crime bosses in Spider-Man's rogues gallery, Tombstone is usually depicted as an imposing Black person with albinism; he has sharp chompers and granite-like skin that's hard to cut. The creation, by writer Gerry Conway and artist Alex Saviuk, first made his Marvel Comics debut in Web of Spider-Man #36 in March 1988, and has been a staple of Spidey's criminal underworld ever since.

Given Tombstone's recent appearance in the Spider-Verse films, there's no doubt going to be a lot of speculation that Brand New Day could potentially give us the MCU's own take on Miles. The recent casting of Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear) and Trammel Tillman (Severance) also has left fans wondering if the Morales family in some way will be a presence, and of course, Miles' uncle Aaron already appeared in Spider-Man Homecoming, played by Donald Glover.

Whether or not we see Miles or any other Spidey-sona in Brand New Day, Jones is joining a stacked cast of familiar faces that includes Jon Bernthal as the Punisher, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Michael Mando returning as Homecoming‘s version of Scorpion.

Despite its current production delay, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is still currently set to release July 31, 2026.

Step aside, Poor Things, and take Joker: Folie à Deux with you when you go: the first teaser trailer for Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Bride! is here. Anyone who was wondering whether the world has enough bandwidth for two Frankenstein movies in the span of a few months can breathe easy; The Bride! looks like it has an entirely different, far more chaotic energy than what Guillermo del Toro‘s got cooking.

The Bride! has been touted as a musical, but there's just a small hint of that in this teaser. Instead, it leans heavily into what looks to be a wild romance between Frankenstein's monster (Christian Bale) and his newly revived bride (Jessie Buckley):

It's billed as a “bold, iconoclastic take on one of the world's most compelling stories,” and here's the official description:

“A lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travels to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman and the Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!”

The rest of the cast includes Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Penélope Cruz; Maggie Gyllenhaal directs and also wrote the screenplay. The Bride! arrives March 6, 2026.

The Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 is the best QLC SSD we've tested to date.

Surprisingly good performance

Excellent power efficiency

Good capacity range

Poor sustained write performance

Pricing currently high


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Thanks to the performance we see with the Sandisk WD Blue SN5100, the market now has not just one great QLC SSD, but two great QLC SSDs. This turn of events was unfathomable a generation of drives ago, but the components are now mature enough to offer great value for everyday users and storage enthusiasts alike. We were first impressed by Crucial's P310, but the Blue SN5100 has quietly come along to redefine what a QLC drive can do.

Sandisk has followed up on the excellent Black SN7100 and SN8100 with another compelling mid-range Blue drive, bumping performance up from the SN5000. The Blue drives have always been a popular and inexpensive option, but in some cases, the different models felt overlapping, even with some of the lower-end Black drives, such as the SN770. It's almost too much of a good thing. Now, with the SN5100 coming in hot with QLC flash, which the previous SN5000 only used at 4TB, we have a drive designed for everyone.

All of WD's and Sandisk's many Blue NVMe SSDs have been good budget performers to the point that it sometimes gets confusing to discern one from another; the controllers and flash used are scalable in that way. The Blue SN5100 carries on with this tradition, but it's also marking the full transition from TLC to QLC flash. This might horrify some people, but the fact is, this drive performs well for 99% of typical users. You'd have difficulty in a blind taste test between this and the TLC-equipped Black SN7100, and if Sandisk can get the price down to an appropriate level, that's a very attractive reality.

We still prefer the Blue SN5100 as a secondary or game-focused drive, or perhaps as a budget laptop upgrade drive, but we think it's to the point that this drive could work anywhere. It feels like it could replace low-end TLC options without issue. There's something about this drive that puts it ahead of the pack in comparison to some of the older QLC drives, mostly due to the flash. It's power-efficient and has excellent latency, which makes it feel like a high-end drive a lot of the time. It's a shame that QLC flash isn't holding its discount due to enterprise demand because this drive at an optimal price level would be nearly unbeatable. It's still a drive worth keeping an eye on.

The Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 is available in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. QLC flash can be tricky at lower capacities like 500GB, as there are fewer dies with which to interleave. Performance on this drive is best at 1TB and 2TB, but there will be much interest in the 4TB. The drive can hit up to 7,100 / 6,700 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,000K / 1,300K random read and write IOPS.

Pricing at the time of the review was a problem, though, at $54.99, $79.98, and $142.99 for the smaller SKUs. The Sandisk WD Black SN7100 is, in fact, less expensive and, with TLC flash, is the better drive. In fact, that model is an excellent value all around. We suspect the Blue SN5100 will be adjusted below that pricing – that's the only way the Blue and Black monikers make sense relative to one another — which would make it potentially a fantastic budget SSD.

Sandisk backs the drive with a standard five-year warranty, but the write endurance (TBW) is half the normal, at 300TB of write data per TB os drive capacity. This is not unexpected, as base QLC flash tends to be rated for about half the program/erase cycles as the comparable TLC. This does not reflect actual NAND flash endurance, but rather the TBW is chosen for warranty purposes. This drive isn't supposed to be beaten up with tons of writes, and enterprise-like workloads can and will wear the flash worse than normal consumer usage. We don't think this write limit holds back the drive for its intended purpose in any way.

Sandisk has two downloads for its SSDs: the SanDisk Dashboard and Acronis True Image. The former is an SSD Toolbox application previously known as the WD Dashboard – if you see that in our past reviews, know that the new dashboard covers both WD and Sandisk SSDs. This dashboard is roughly on par with Samsung's Magician and is useful for a range of things. Aside from letting you update the drive's firmware, it also allows you to check and monitor drive health and engage features such as TRIM and secure erase. This application is only for Windows, but True Image also works on macOS. True Image is designed for backups and imaging to protect your data when switching drives, which is always a useful feature.

The Blue SN5100 is single-sided with a single NAND flash chip, power management circuitry, and a DRAM-less controller. This drive would work in a shorter form factor. The drive does have a QR code PSID, but it is otherwise uninteresting.

A 4TB SKU is on the way and is also single-sided. With current technology, such a drive would have two NAND flash packages with the standard 1Tb dies, but could theoretically get away with just one with 2Tb dies. There is a performance dip for the 4TB models, according to the datasheet, which would be either from extra memory addressing overhead with the latter solution or an abundance of dies in the former. WD could also choose to use 2Tb dies with two NAND flash packages to take advantage of better yields. One reason to stick with a single package is if there is intent for shorter form factors in an OEM counterpart, particularly as such drives tend to be single-sided.

The Sandisk WD Black SN7100 and Sandisk WD Black SN8100 use the TLC version of this flash and show no performance loss at their maximum capacities at the time of our reviews, but we know the controllers are able to handle that many 1Tb dies without an issue. The Black SN7100 has been updated with a 4TB SKU post-review, which does exhibit a similar performance drop as the SN5100, and in that case, it's due to the use of so many 1Tb dies. To condense this into something understandable: you are going to see some level of performance loss at the highest capacity of these drives. That may impact the upcoming 8TB Black SN8100 as well, unless Sandisk has a trick up its sleeve. This was avoided with the 8TB WD Black SN850X, which utilized newer, denser flash, a strategy later adopted by Samsung with the 4TB 990 Pro.

The A101-000103-A1 is a proprietary controller from Sandisk that is also used on the WD Blue SN5000. This is a simple four-channel DRAM-less controller made to optimally run with 16 dies at 2400 MT/s, which translates to 2TB at 7+ GB/s. BiCS8 is rated for up to 3,600 MT/s, but this is not needed for PCIe 4.0. For PCIe 5.0, this flash with a similar controller, like the Phison E31T, can hit up to at least 10 GB/s. There are advantages other than bandwidth for running at a higher I/O speed, such as slightly better latency. However, running at a lower clock is more power-efficient. The Black SN7100 demonstrates this well by having the best power efficiency we've seen to date.

The Blue SN5100 differs from the Black SN7100 by its use of QLC rather than TLC flash. In practice, this isn't as big a deal as it sounds. In pSLC mode, the flash will perform similarly, and QLC often has optimizations for reads, which might come from native flash. You might never notice a difference between the two. QLC flash does have lower endurance with approximately half the rated amount, depending on the flash and quality, but this is still an immense amount of writes that 99% of users won't ever hit. Nevertheless, performance concerns do remain for the worst-case, which cannot be denied. We cover this in our write saturation test.

QLC flash should be more affordable as a trade-off, but this often has not been the case. One reason is that enterprise demand for QLC flash is higher than ever to handle large data with far better response times than a mechanical HDD provides. This has gotten worse with the AI and LLM booms, especially considering that the YMTC flash, which could alleviate this shortfall to some degree, has been politically problematic for the U.S.

Most inexpensive 4TB drives with QLC use YMTC flash, in fact, while Micron is holding back its QLC for enterprise and its own drives. That would include the Crucial P310 and the OEM Micron 2600. Historically, BiCS has not made a big splash with QLC flash and has been mostly only available in TLC. This completely changes with the Blue SN5100 as a follow-up to the Blue SN5000.

Nvidia wants to make it clear that, despite any deals it's done with certain companies to provide future hardware, it will still ensure all customers get access to next-generation GPUs, as first reported by Bloomberg. This follows the announcement of a $100 billion Nvidia investment in OpenAI, which will see the chip giant give OpenAI money, so that it can purchase Nvidia's GPUs in a circular strategy that has buoyed both companies since the announcement was made.

""Our investments will not change our focus or impact supply to our other customers--we will continue to make every customer a top priority, with or without any equity stake,"" an Nvidia spokesperson told Toms Hardware in a statement.

That may be of some comfort to Nvidia's other customers, but it's also likely to be a strategy to placate them into not looking elsewhere. Nvidia became the world's most valuable company in recent years because of the scramble to buy its cutting-edge GPUs in order to power a new generation of ""AI factories"" and AI training and inference data centers. But that hasn't stopped those same companies from looking for alternative sources lest Nvidia itself become a bottleneck, through chip supply issues or granting favour to one company over another.

Other major chip firms like Nvidia competitor AMD do offer their own AI hardware. It might not be as impressive as Nvidia's and lacks the CUDA ecosystem, which has helped give Nvidia such a near-monopoly in the professional GPU space for many years, but its hardware is capable nonetheless. If Nvidia were unable to meet its commitments, or indeed appears to be favoring one company over another, customers may start to look for alternative solutions in order to give themselves more control over their AI supply chain.

To that end, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and others are all developing their own AI-accelerating hardware to give them some independence from Nvidia, even if it seems unlikely any of them will be able to offer a competitive product to Nvidia's GPUs any time soon. Chinese firms have also been making major efforts to untether themselves from Nvidia amidst ongoing trade negotiations and tariff talks with the United States.

Other Nvidia investments, which are likely to give other actual or potential customers pause, include the Intel deal, which will see Nvidia work together with the CPU giant to fabricate new chips that combine their hardware into a single chip. Nvidia's recent investment and pseudo-takeover of GPU networking hardware firm Enfabrica also smacks of Nvidia shoring up its near-monopoly in the AI hardware space.

But with the world rushing to develop AI infrastructure as fast as possible, there seems likely to be plenty of scope for competition to find purchase. AMD is one such potential alternative, but Qualcomm is working on its own accelerators, and if Chinese innovation in the space has shown us anything in the past couple of years, it's that they can surprise with their speed and capabilities. They may well do so once again if they can solve certain bottlenecks.

Many gamers were disappointed by this move.

Several gamers have had their Lenovo Legion Go 2 pre-orders canceled by the company after it said that it could not ship its latest handheld console on time. Many had been asking about the delay on the handheld, and the company answered the issue on its AMA Reddit post, saying, “The truth is pre-orders for the Legion Go Gen 2 has substantially exceeded our projections, leading to unforeseen delivery range extensions.” It also added, “That said, we will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com. We don't believe in holding onto customer payments for products we can't ship in a timely manner.”

This disappointing news has hit several gamers, who won't be getting their handheld at all, at least for the foreseeable future. Despite that, a few users will still receive their consoles, but at a much later date. According to TechPowerUp, there are reports that device shipments have been moved from the original early-October shipping date, as promised on the pre-order form, to early to mid-November. The company did offer a 10% discount coupon to affected users, but they can only use it for their “next Lenovo purchase.”

The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is the company's follow-up to its original gaming handheld and is powered by a Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip replete with an OLED screen. It's a direct competitor to the upcoming Asus ROG Ally 2, which doesn't have a release date yet, although Asus is expected to deliver the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X on October 16. MSI also has its own AMD Z2 Extreme-powered handheld in the Claw 8, which has outperformed the Intel chip in the previous iteration of its handheld and is scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks.

All this pre-order brouhaha is bringing back memories of electronics shortages, particularly with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and the various problems consumers faced when buying the latest GPUs. Thankfully, Nintendo seemed to have solved the problem with the launch of the Switch 2, which beat the Switch 1's opening month by a million units in just four days. Lenovo said that it's working to deliver consoles to retailers and customers, so availability should improve in the coming weeks. Hopefully, this will materialize so that we can avoid scalpers taking advantage of the situation and selling the gaming handheld at ridiculous markups.

Seemingly unshackled from Microsoft, OpenAI's major drive towards a high-value IPO begins.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Following its joint announcements of major UK investments last week, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has kicked off this one with a slew of new deals to enhance its own capabilities and increase its valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The company struck a deal for Nvidia hardware worth upwards of $100 billion, a deal with Chinese firm Luxsure to begin building consumer AI devices, and there are several negotiations said to be ongoing with other Chinese Apple suppliers, according to CNBC.

The story of OpenAI in 2025 has been one of aggressive expansion and incredibly optimistic projections about where the industry is headed and the significant role OpenAI is expected to play in it. Despite the company being structured as a non-profit and its yearly revenue projections topping out at just under $13 billion (following a $5 billion loss in 2024), it has announced investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure. These include the US-based Stargate scheme and the Stargate UK project, amongst other international investments.

For these kinds of investments to be possible, OpenAI needs to restructure as a for-profit company, which it can now do after the recent progress in its Microsoft negotiations. It also needs the cash generated from a potential IPO, with some estimates already valuing the company at over $500 billion, despite its lack of any kind of actual profitability.

In reality, the bulk of that valuation comes from the confidence of other major tech companies. Microsoft is already one of the largest OpenAI investors, but now Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI too. Though that may well be a form of circuitous, parasitic relationship where Nvidia invests money in OpenAI, so it can, in turn, purchase Nvidia hardware for its various data center projects.

Crucially, however, this deal also marks OpenAI as one of the first customers for Nvidia's next-generation hardware. This deal will see Nvidia invest an initial $10 billion once the deal is agreed upon, with the first Nvidia hardware set to be delivered in late 2026. These chips will be Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, likely offering significant performance and efficiency advantages over existing Blackwell GPUs.

More Nvidia investment will be forthcoming as further gigawatts of computing power are set up, with the final project said to equate to around 10 gigawatts of AI compute power. The electricity use alone would be enough to power over 8 million homes.

 




This deal further raises the spectre of the AI industry somewhat funding itself while driving up the valuations of each of the involved companies. No matter how you look at it, it hints at a bubble, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accepts is very real.

""On the one hand [this deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, via Reuters. ""On the other hand, the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.""

Nvidia, Microsoft, Intel, OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and a range of other multi-billion and trillion-dollar companies have all announced major investments in each other's companies and services over the coming years. Although there are very real services these companies can offer each other, the kind of AI projects they all want to launch will require incredible infrastructure development, which will require Herculean levels of investment. This raises concerns about whether the funds will be available when the time comes to actually pay up.

There is the very real potential of the AI industry becoming an unsustainable bubble. When those have burst in the past, they tend to take entire companies with them. If anything like that happens before OpenAI (and others) can realize their goals, they could be left with enormous promises and balance sheets that are deep in the red.

Alongside its drive towards IPO cash generation, OpenAI is also looking to diversify as it searches for a viable profit model for its soon-to-be for-profit company. One of those could be hardware development. It hired the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses project in November last year to head its consumer devices and robotics divisions. It's also alleged to be in talks with Goertek, a Chinese company that builds Apple's AirPods and other smart devices.

In a more tangible endeavour, it's now struck a deal with fellow Chinese Apple supplier, Luxshare, to build a smart-speaker-like device to use with ChatGPT. Similar to the smart speakers made by Apple, Amazon, and Google for their Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant smart assistants, OpenAI sees ChatGPT as a direct competitor for these kinds of tools and seems set to build out smart devices that can leverage the technology in a more physical sense.

According to The Information, Luxshare is already working on prototypes with a plan to launch a viable gadget in late 2026 or early 2027.

OpenAI previously partnered with Apple product-design icon, Jony Ive, lending further credence to the idea of OpenAI pivoting towards hardware as a potential avenue towards increasing both its profitability and physical presence in people's everyday lives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Ozempic may help protect against diabetes-related blindness","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/ozempic-semaglutide-may-help-protect-against-diabetes-related-blindness-retinopathy","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:21:24 GMT","

According to the International Diabetes Federation, about 11% of the world's population lives with diabetes, with 90% having type 2 diabetes. 

Researchers estimate that as much as 40% of all people with diabetes also have diabetic retinopathy — a potentially blinding eye condition caused by blood vessel damage in the eye's retina. 

There is currently no cure for diabetic retinopathy. The condition is often managed through injections of anti-VEGF medications into the eye, surgery, and blood sugar monitoring and control. 

Past studies also show that anti-VEGF injections may help prevent diabetic retinopathy and its complications, as well as healthy lifestyle factors like managing blood pressure, lowering cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal Pharmaceutics has found that semaglutide — the active ingredient found in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss — may help protect the eyes from diabetic retinopathy. 

For this lab-based study, researchers used samples of human retinal endothelial cells that were treated with different concentrations of semaglutide. The cells were then placed in a solution with both a high glucose level and high level of oxidative stress — where there is an imbalance of antioxidants and free radicals — for 24 hours. 

Past studies show that oxidative stress plays a role in the formation of diabetic retinopathy. 

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that the retinal cells treated with semaglutide were twice as likely to survive than cells that were untreated. Additionally, the treated cells were found to have larger stores of energy. 

Scientists also found that three markers of diabetic retinopathy were decreased in the semaglutide-treated retinal cells. First, the levels of apoptosis — a form of cell death — decreased from about 50% in untreated cells to about 10% in semaglutide-treated cells. The production of the free radical mitochondrial superoxide decreased from about 90% to about 10% in the treated retinal cells. 

Researchers also found the amount of advanced glycation end-products — harmful compounds that can collect in people with diabetes and are known to cause oxidative stress — also decreased substantially. 

Lastly, scientists reported that the genes involved in the production of antioxidants were more active in the semaglutide-treated cells when compared to untreated cells. Researchers believe this is a sign that semaglutide may help repair damage to the retinal cells.

“Our study did not find that these drugs harmed the retinal cells in any way — instead, it suggests that GLP1-receptor agonists protect against diabetic retinopathy, particularly in the early stages,” Ioanna Anastasiou, PhD, molecular biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the National and Kapodistrian University in Greece, and lead author of this study, said in a press release.

“Excitingly, these drugs may be able to repair damage that has already been done and so improve sight. Clinical trials are now needed to confirm these protective effects in patients and explore whether GLP-1 receptor agonists can slow, or even halt, the progression of this vision-robbing condition.”— Ioanna Anastasiou, PhD

Medical News Today spoke with Benjamin Bert, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. 

“We've known with any of these medications that are able to reduce the blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, have been shown to be beneficial long-term for the health of the microvasculature that exists in the eye,” Bert said. 

“What was unique about this study is that it was showing that maybe with the semaglutide-type medications that it may help to protect from oxidative stress. And so this could potentially be a different mechanism that it's able to protect the eye with, so that's a fascinating hypothesis and finding of this particular study.” — Benjamin Bert, MD

If semaglutide can help protect against oxidative stress, Bert said it may even be able to help with other eye conditions. 

“A lot of the damage that happens to our bodies is from the oxidative stress and free oxygen radicals,” he explained. “We've been hearing for many years about antioxidants and how important antioxidants are to the continued health of our bodies, and all the different molecules, minerals and vitamins, and things that you can take that help as antioxidants.” 

“So if the GLP-1 medications also have this type of impact on our cellular function, then that would be another great way to be able to reduce this particular potentially damaging process,” Bert added. 

MNT also spoke with Jonathan Gloth, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist and retina specialist, Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Ocean University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. 

“I have seen reduced diabetic retinopathy in patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists; therefore, the study results were consistent with what we've been seeing clinically in our diabetic patients,” Gloth commented. “It is imperative that GLP-1 medications are rigorously studied as they are so commonly prescribed and their usage has increased exponentially over the past few years.”

“I would like to see retina-specific studies that compare the response to our current retinal therapies — eye injections, laser procedures, and surgery — in those patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists vs those who are not,” he added.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recently released its 2025 guidelines for the management of myocarditis, which also includes extensive discussion of pericarditis and the wide range of overlap between these types of cardiac inflammation. The guidelines were presented at the ESC Congress 2025 in Madrid and simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.

Myocarditis is most likely underreported and underdiagnosed because of its nonspecific symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and fever and its potential for spontaneous recovery, said Leslie T. Cooper, Jr, MD, a US-based expert on the condition and past chair of cardiology at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Acute myocarditis is typically seen in younger people, with a median onset between ages 30 years and 45 years and is more common in men than in women. While most cases resolve without complication, the condition carries a risk for sudden cardiac death that can strike even healthy, athletic individuals, Cooper told Medscape Medical News. According to data cited by the Myocarditis Foundation, up to 20% of sudden cardiac death cases in young adults are linked to myocarditis. Among young athletes, myocarditis has been called a “silent killer.”

Recommendations in the new ESC guidelines are largely consistent with those of the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on managing myocarditis, and a 2025 joint ACC/American Heart Association scientific statement on return to participation for athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities.

“New in the current guidelines is the ability to make a definitive diagnosis without a biopsy, using cardiac magnetic resonance,” said Cooper, vice-chair of the writing committee for the ACC's expert consensus statement on myocarditis. Cardiac imaging is superior for distinguishing between myocardial and pericardial inflammation and fibrotic tissue, the guidelines state. Data show late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance is one of the strongest independent predictors of sudden cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality.

“We recommend endomyocardial biopsy mainly for high-risk or treatment-refractory cases,” said Gianfranco Sinagra, MD, head of cardiothoracovascular medicine at the University of Trieste in Trieste, Italy, and a task force member for the ESC guidelines.

“Our guidelines also introduce a new diagnostic paradigm for classifying myocarditis as definite, possible, or unlikely/rejected. This shift may facilitate earlier diagnosis and risk stratification for routine clinical practice,” Sinagra told Medscape Medical News.

The ESC guidelines coined “inflammatory myopericardial syndrome” (IMPS) as an umbrella term covering the overlap between myocarditis and pericarditis that can serve as a “temporary, initial diagnosis” and address mixed forms such as myopericarditis. “Managing IMPS necessitates a dual approach,” Sinagra said. “We need to address the pericardial inflammatory component while surveilling for complications suggesting myocardial injury, such as ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias.”

Treatment of myocarditis/pericarditis is aimed at the underlying etiology — viral, toxic, parasitic, or autoimmune — and types of infiltrating cells. For a first episode of acute myopericarditis, European and US guidelines affirm the use of colchicine in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In acute myocarditis, data show that omitting colchicine and failing to taper high-dose steroids are risk factors for recurrence or a chronic course of disease.

How soon a person with cardiac inflammation can resume physical activity has been a source of ongoing debate. Exercise and elevated heart rate can aggravate myocardial and pericardial inflammation and increase the risk for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in the acute phase.

However, prolonged inactivity also has implications for mental health and quality of life. “In my practice I often see young athletes who are paralyzed with fear when faced with a potentially life-threatening cardiac diagnosis,” Cooper said. “Our data have shown that nearly 44% of people with myocarditis have clinically significant symptoms of depression.”

While the decision should be individualized, current evidence supports a minimum rest period of 4 weeks, according to both US and European guidelines, after which patients with a mild course and low risk for complications can gradually return to activity. Monitoring should include assessment of symptoms, laboratory analysis for prognostic biomarkers, and imaging.

A key difference between US and European guidelines is in how they classify myocarditis. European guideline staging is time-based:

• Acute: first 4 weeks

• Subacute: 1-3 months

• Chronic: lasting more than 3 months

Complicated cases are characterized by reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50%), unstable arrhythmias, heart block, heart failure, or shock.

The ACC consensus statement offers similar definitions for acute and chronic myocarditis but adds a letter system to characterize severity:

Stage A: At risk based on exposure or genetic predisposition

Stage B: Subclinical: the presence of inflammation or injury without symptoms

Stage C: Active symptomatic myocarditis

Stage D: Advanced: fulminant or end-stage disease

Recognizing at-risk patient groups is important. This population includes an expanding number of patients receiving cardiotoxic drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. Monitoring troponin levels in the second and third week of clozapine therapy is indicated to prevent this highly fatal form of myocarditis, Cooper said.

Many cases of myocarditis probably slip through the cracks, due to socioeconomic gaps in access to care and availability of advanced diagnostic technology, Cooper added. However, clear, updated guidelines for diagnosis and management can ideally help to prevent sudden cardiac death and long-term complications like heart failure.

Cooper reported receiving consulting fees from Moderna, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cardiol Therapeutics, and Foresee Pharmaceuticals and equity ownership in Stromal Therapeutics.

Sinagra reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

The first revision of the McDonald criteria in nearly a decade could improve diagnostic speed and accuracy in multiple sclerosis (MS), reducing the period of uncertainty and permitting earlier start of treatment, the authors of the criteria reported.

Developed by an international panel of more than 50 experts, the updated criteria incorporate an array of more recently identified or validated biomarkers and place an emphasis on neuroimaging to allow diagnostic criteria across a variety of presentations, including no outward manifestations of disease.

“These revisions represent an important step forward for the field. By integrating novel biomarkers and rigorous consensus methodology, the updated criteria strengthen diagnostic accuracy and become more globally applicable,” Bruno Stankoff, MD, PhD, president of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) said in a statement. 

ECTRIMS and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the US cosponsored the committee that developed the criteria, which were published in the October issue of The Lancet Neurology.

The criteria — developed by a committee cosponsored by ECTRIMS and the US National Multiple Sclerosis Society — are already shaping the conversation. At the Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) 2025, which is currently underway, several sessions will focus on their impact.

“This balance between sensitivity and specificity is essential — and now ensures that people with MS can be identified earlier, equally across all ages, and that misdiagnosis is reduced,” added Stankoff, who also is professor of neurology at Université Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, Paris.

Despite their release more than halfway through 2025, the new criteria are officially known as the 2024 revisions of the McDonald criteria. The deliberations began in late 2023 and were led by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS. 

As reported by Medscape Medical News, elements of the new criteria were previewed at the 2024 ECTRIMS conference, the 2025 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers meeting, and other major medical conferences. 

The latest version of the McDonald criteria — which were first published in 2001 and arrived shortly before the start of the 2025 ECTRIMS meeting — reflects “substantial” changes, Steven L. Galetta, MD, New York University School of Medicine, New York, and Jeffrey L. Bennett, MD, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, wrote in an accompanying commentary. 

Among the highlights in the new version are the addition of the optic nerve as a fifth topographic sign of disease activity and the inclusion of central vein sign (CVS) and paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) as novel MRI biomarkers.

While they consider the addition of the optic nerve as the “most notable” change, they also consider the new criteria a reorientation.

Representative of a greater “global perspective on early diagnosis of multiple sclerosis,” the new criteria place “a strong emphasis on neuroimaging, CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] analysis and paraclinical tests,” the authors wrote.

The need for standardized criteria led the authors to include a pragmatic approach in places where access to imaging and laboratory tests is limited. However, the accelerated time to diagnosis that the new criteria make possible depend largely on paraclinical testing, including specialized neuroimaging techniques. This includes detection of not only lesions on the optic nerve but also CVS and PRLs. 

As the fifth topographic site of MS activity, lesions on the optic nerve join lesions on the spinal cord and in the periventricular, infratentorial, and the intracortical/juxtacortical regions for providing evidence of dissemination in space (DIS). For the optic nerve, strategies of detection include optical coherence tomography, MRI, and visual evoked potentials. 

By adding a fifth topographic site, the new criteria make an MS diagnosis easier to reach, according to the authors. This is noteworthy because the new criteria preserve the 2017 requirement of showing both DIS and dissemination in time. 

Similarly, the CVS or the presence of PRLs are now confirmatory biomarkers. Neither is required for a diagnosis, but both can be used to make a probable diagnosis in the context of other signs and symptoms, a change that might be particularly helpful in patients presenting with atypical features, according to the authors of the new criteria.

This applies to asymptomatic patients. In patients with radiologically isolated syndrome, meaning incidental discovery of white matter T2-weighted hyperintensive foci, fulfillment of DIS criteria now allow those with “select 6” (at least six lesions that exhibit the central vein sign) or positive CSF to be diagnosed with MS. 

MS experts have endorsed the new criteria, noting potential to improve outcomes by speeding diagnosis.

“For people everywhere with MS, the revisions offer a clearer and faster path to diagnosis, giving them the chance to begin treatment sooner and move forward with greater certainty,” Lydia Makaroff, MD, PhD, chief executive at the MS International Federation, Cambridge, UK, said in a statement. 

The president and chief executive officer of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the US, Timothy Coetzee, PhD, also praised the new criteria for accelerating the diagnosis, which he expects will lead to earlier treatment and the potential for better outcomes.

“Decades ago, it could take years to diagnose MS. Now it's down to months,” he said in a press release.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, a study testing the newly proposed criteria will have an impact. In this cross-sectional study of 166 patients with an atypical presentation and 25 with a radiologic-only presentation — none of whom would have met criteria for an MS diagnosis under previous guidance — 32% and 28% of these groups, respectively, received a probable diagnosis.

Even with additional and more sensitive biomarkers for making disease diagnosis, MS remains a diagnosis of exclusion, noted Xavier Montalban, MD, PhD, director of the Center for Multiple Sclerosis of Catalonia, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain, and leader of the committee that developed the criteria.

There is still no definitive sign, symptom, or finding that eliminates all alternative diagnoses. As a result, Montalban and his co-authors warned that risks for misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis cannot be ignored.

The signs and symptoms of MS “should be reassessed periodically” regardless which criteria were fulfilled, they suggested. Warning that other demyelinating syndromes might better still account for the symptoms over time, the suggested that it is prudent to remain sensitive to the potential for other underlying pathology.

An alternative regimen of intravenous methylprednisolone plus methotrexate with lower-dose oral prednisone was as effective in treating giant cell arteritis as the standard-of-care regimen of high-dose oral prednisone, with reduced glucocorticoid exposure and fewer related complications.

“Although these results should be prospectively assessed in clinical trials and larger cohorts of patients with GCA [giant cell arteritis], the initial treatment with high doses of IVMP [intravenous methylprednisolone] during 3 days followed by reduced doses of prednisone plus MTX [methotrexate] could be a reasonable GC [glucocorticoid]-sparing therapeutic strategy for remission induction and maintenance in patients with GCA, especially those at higher risk for GC toxicity,” the authors of the study wrote. 

This study was led by Adriana Soto-Peleteiro, Hospital Universitario de Cruces, Bizkaia, and José Hernández-Rodríguez, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, both in Spain. It was published online on September 16, 2025, in Rheumatology.

Drug dosages varied across the treatment protocols. The small number of patients made it difficult to assess efficacy and toxicity of different doses of intravenous methylprednisolone. The follow-up period was relatively short.

Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency had a higher risk for all-cause mortality than the general population or control individuals without the condition, with cardiovascular disease being a major cause of death. The risk for mortality was slightly higher among those with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

""[The study] findings underline the need for optimization of GC [glucocorticoid] replacement therapy and improvement of residual risk management, such as cardiovascular prevention and prevention of adrenal crisis,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Konstantinos Dalakas, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. It was published online on September 12, 2025, in the European Journal of Endocrinology.

The meta-analysis exhibited high heterogeneity, which limited the comparability of studies and warranted cautious interpretation. Preplanned analyses of time trends and causes of death were not feasible due to insufficient data. Most studies were conducted in Scandinavian countries or the UK, potentially limiting generalisability.

This study was supported by the Swedish government through the ALF agreement. Some authors reported serving as consultants, receiving lecture fees, and having other ties with pharmaceutical companies.

A new generic oral anticoagulant in orodispersible film formulation has won regulatory support in Europe, potentially broadening access and ease of use for patients requiring anticoagulation across multiple indications.

In its September meeting, the European Medicines Agency (EMA)'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use issued a favorable recommendation for Rivaroxaban Koanaa (Koanaa Healthcare Spain), a generic version of Xarelto, which has been authorized in the EU since 2008. The therapy is intended for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE), treatment and prevention of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and risk factors, and for the treatment and prevention of VTE in children and adolescents. 

It will be available as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg orodispersible films, broadening administration options for patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.

Rivaroxaban works as a selective, direct factor Xa inhibitor within the antithrombotic drug class. This mechanism blocks factor Xa activity, disrupting both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. The inhibition prevents thrombin generation and clot formation.

Complete usage recommendations will appear in the summary of product characteristics, published on the EMA website in all official European Union languages once the European Commission grants marketing authorization.

Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a groundbreaking diagnostic tool that could transform the way acute leukemia is identified and treated. The tool, called MARLIN (Methylation- and AI-guided Rapid Leukemia Subtype Inference), uses DNA methylation patterns and machine learning to classify acute leukemia with speed and accuracy. This tool has the potential to significantly improve patient care by allowing faster and more precise treatment decisions.

Acute leukemia is an aggressive blood cancer that requires accurate diagnosis to guide treatment. Current diagnostic methods, which rely on a combination of molecular and cytogenetic tests, often take days or even weeks to complete. MARLIN, however, can provide results in as little as two hours from the time of biopsy. By providing rapid and detailed insights into leukemia subtypes, MARLIN could enable clinicians to make treatment decisions sooner and with more complete information.

Ultimately, we envision that methylation-based acute leukemia classifications will complement standard-of-care diagnostic tests to provide more comprehensive and timely information to pathologists, clinicians, and patients.""

Dr. Volker Hovestadt, computational biologist at Dana-Farber, associate institute member at Broad Institute and co-senior author of the study

The findings were published in Nature Genetics.

To develop MARLIN, the research team first created a large reference database of DNA methylation patterns from over 2,500 patient samples, representing a wide range of leukemia subtypes. This revealed 38 distinct methylation classes across disease subtypes in adults and children. ""Our analysis confirms many established molecular categories in acute leukemia but also reveals new classes that are best seen through the lens of epigenetics,"" said Mr. Til Steinicke, co-first author of the study.

Using this reference dataset, the team trained a neural network (MARLIN) to identify methylation classes in bone marrow and blood samples from patients with acute leukemia. When paired with long-read nanopore sequencing technology, which permits DNA methylation profiling from clinical samples, MARLIN demonstrated high accuracy for disease classification in both retrospective and prospective samples. ""We adapted our machine learning approach to use very small amounts of data as input, which allowed us to quickly generate classifications after just a few minutes of sequencing,"" said Dr. Salvatore Benfatto, co-first author of the study.

In real-time tests, MARLIN correctly classified leukemia samples in under two hours from the time of biopsy receipt, a dramatic improvement over the timelines of current diagnostic workflows. ""As our work continues, we hope MARLIN will greatly accelerate treatment planning, reduce medical complications, and ease patient worries in the future,"" said Dr. Evan Chen, a collaborator on the study and Dana-Farber medical oncologist in the Division of leukemia.

The researchers also found that MARLIN could resolve diagnostic ""blind spots"" missed by conventional methods. For example, it successfully identified cryptic genetic events such as rearrangements involving the DUX4 gene that are associated with favorable clinical outcomes. Additionally, MARLIN revealed novel predictive signatures, such as HOX-activated subgroups, which could inform future treatment strategies.

""We believe that our framework paves the way for future developments in epigenetic classification of acute leukemia, machine learning-assisted diagnostics, and methylation-based predictive biomarkers of drug response,"" said Dr. Gabriel Griffin, a cancer researcher, Dana-Farber pathologist, associate institute member at Broad Institute and co-senior author of the study.

The researchers now aim to develop MARLIN into a tool that can be provided to patients in the clinic to accelerate disease classification, inform treatment selection in real-time, and generate a resource for the cancer research community to study the role of DNA methylation in leukemia.

Background and goal: A recurrent barrier to Medicare annual wellness visits, which provide preventative medicine guidance for older and disabled patients, occurs when patients introduce medical concerns to physicians during these preventative visits. In this study, researchers scheduled combined visits in a single, longer slot with patients' regularly seen clinicians and used allowed billing rules so both visits could count to see if they could increase the percentage of annual wellness visits completed and the quality measures captured. 

Study approach: A family medicine department with five clinics ran a nine-month quality improvement effort for patients aged 65 and older on Medicare. The department team started booking longer 40-minute ""combined"" appointments so patients could complete the Medicare annual wellness visit and, if needed, have regular medical issues handled in the same visit with their regularly seen physician. The team then tracked, month by month, how many eligible patients got a wellness visit, how often people missed appointments, and how many screenings, tests, and vaccines were ordered, comparing results with the nine months before the change to see what improved.

Main results:

Medicare wellness visits increased from 8.4% to 50.8% over nine months.

No-show rates were lower for combined visits than annual wellness-only visits (11.9% vs 19.6%).

Patients had lower no-show rates for annual wellness visits with their regular physician than a different clinician.

Orders and screenings increased across many measures, including depression, falls, pain, breast/cervical/colorectal/lung cancer, DEXA, A1c, urine microalbumin, Hep C, HIV and pneumococcal.

Why it matters: The findings suggest scheduling longer, combined visits with patients' usual physicians may help increase the completion of annual wellness visits, reduce no shows, and close screening gaps, while still fitting within existing Medicare billing rules.

Science has confirmed what sports lovers have always known from experience: exercise is good for the brain. It increases blood flow, inhibits stress hormones, and stimulates the release of 'feel good' endorphins. One way by which exercise is thought to yield these benefits on the brain is through a chain of processes that ultimately results in the release of the hormone BDNF. Produced by the liver, brain, skeletal muscle, and fat tissue, BDNF is known to promote the growth, survival, and maintenance of nerve cells.

Previous studies have suggested that the starting signal for this physiological chain is a high level in the blood of lactate, a by-product of the conversion inside muscle, the liver, and the blood of carbohydrates into energy when oxygen is limited – for example during high-intensity exercise. Now, a study in Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience has found that the physiological benefits of exercise may be partly mimicked by a simple IV infusion of lactate.

Here we show for the first time that such an infusion leads to levels of lactate in the blood which are characteristic of medium to intense exercise. Ultimately, this boosts levels of the precursor molecule of BDNF, likely released by the skeletal muscle.""

Dr. Marcus Moberg, lead author, senior lecturer at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, Stockholm

The authors did a so-called 'randomized crossover study' on 12 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 40 years old. After fasting overnight, these were invited to lie down while either receiving a one-hour long IV infusion of sodium lactate and then, seven to 30 days later, a one-hour long infusion of saline solution; or receiving these treatments in the reverse order. Blood was taken from each volunteer every 10 minutes during both treatments, as well as 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes afterwards. A leg muscle biopsy was taken before and immediately after each infusion with lactate, as well as 60 and 120 minutes later.

A control group of six additional volunteers exclusively underwent a treatment with saline solution, and likewise donated blood samples and four muscle biopsies.

The researchers measured the lactate concentration in each blood or muscle tissue sample. They further quantified the levels of pro-BDNF, a biologically active precursor molecule of BDNF, in addition to its mature molecular form mBDNF, in blood plasma, serum, and platelet-poor plasma – that is, plasma from which most platelets have been removed.

As expected, the concentration of lactate in blood increased during infusion, peaking at values similar to those normally obtained after high-intensity exercise. Importantly, the concentration of the prohormone pro-BDNF increased 15 min after the end of lactate infusion and stayed high for two hours afterwards. In contrast, neither the level of pro-BDNF in muscle nor that of mBDNF in plasma or serum changed during or after lactate infusion.

The authors concluded that IV infusion with lactate is sufficient to boost the levels of pro-BDNF in the bloodstream, but without affecting those of mBDNF. In other words, lactate infusion alone is enough to mimic some, but not all, of the physiological effects of high-intensity exercise. It is expected that such an increase of pro-BDNF will have similar beneficial effects on brain health, irrespective of the mechanism behind it.

Is this good news for those among us who loathe exercise? Possibly one day, but for now the authors strongly caution against skipping the exercise step and relying on lactate infusion alone.

""We speculate rather that the intensity of exercise is important if brain health is the desired goal. High-intensity exercise a couple of times per week, thus exposing the brain to high levels of lactate, should be recommended for healthy neurological aging,"" said Moberg.

""In the future, these findings can aid in the targeted, individualized prescription of exercise in clinical settings, especially for populations with compromised brain health.""

""Also, since lactate is known to exert hormonal-like effects, there is a potential for pharmacological interventions. This would require additional research to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which lactate controls BDNF metabolism in humans.""

Hidden in plain sight, dried fish are an overlooked yet vital nutrient-packed superfood helping to feed millions of people across Africa, a new study reveals.

And new evidence quantifies for the first time the essential nutrients in sun-dried and smoked fish in Africa, suggesting they could play an important role in tackling malnutrition across the tropics – provided the right policies are in place, researchers argue.

Dried fish are an affordable and readily available food across the tropics. Yet despite this prevalence, because they are often produced by small-scale fisheries, and are usually traded informally, little was known about how widespread this food is produced, consumed or even how nutritious it is. Until now.

In the first large-scale investigation of dried fish consumption, an international team of researchers led by academics at Lancaster University, provides evidence that dried fish contributes significantly to the recommended nutrient intakes for young children and women - underlining their importance for global food security and nutrition.

Using modeling based on data from the multinational Living Standards Measurements Study conducted in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, the scientists behind the findings estimate that dried fish are eaten weekly by a third of households in these countries, and are even consumed by 54% more people than fresh fish.

Dried fish are particularly important to the diets of those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centres. This, researchers say, reinforces the importance of protecting fish catches for local consumption, rather than for international markets.

But the question remained - just how nutritious are dried fish?

The researchers examined the nutrient content of some of the most readily available dried fish in East and West Africa, as well as the Indian Ocean, to determine their importance in providing nourishment.

They analyzed 19 species of fish, including freshwater fish from the Great Lakes (such as the Lake Victoria sardine) and marine species from West Africa (including the Madeiran sardinella) and the Indian Ocean (such as rabbitfish).

Analysis of sun-dried and smoked fish revealed that dried fish are packed with nutrients: even small amounts of dried fish contribute significantly to recommended nutrient intakes for young children and women.

Processing of fish by sun-drying and smoking concentrates essential nutrients into smaller, shelf-stable portions, such that all dried fish forms were found to have a higher nutrient density than fresh fish, for equivalent portion sizes, especially for key minerals for public health such as iron and zinc.

The study reveals that small portions of dried fish contribute more than 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients including calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamins B12 and D.

Nutrients are not equal for all fish. Powdered and smoked marine species, for example, have high iron and omega-3 fatty acid concentrations, whereas freshwater species from Lake Victoria have relatively higher calcium and zinc concentrations.

Dr. James Robinson, Leverhulme Research Fellow at Lancaster University's Lancaster Environment Centre, said: ""Until now, the role and scale of dried fish in supporting food security and nutrition has often been undervalued and hidden, limiting our understanding of how dried fish contribute to healthy diets.

""Fish caught in oceans, lakes and rivers across Africa and Asia are dried, smoked or fried, providing large supplies of affordable and nutritious foods that can be stored for long periods of time and easily transported.

""The widespread prevalence of highly-nutritious dried fish show these foods play critical roles in food security and nutrition, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children, households close to fisheries, and even in places distant from fisheries.""

Following these new insights, the researchers say their findings suggest dried fish could be used to prevent micronutrient deficiencies in women and young children in Africa.

Dried fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, iodine and selenium could be powdered and mixed with other food products to produce highly nutritious meals for infants that can be used to treat and prevent malnutrition, the researchers add.

Dr. Rucha Karkarey, of Lancaster University and co-author, said: ""Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps in seasonal seas, such as reef fish in Lakshadweep Islands that are caught and dried before the southwest monsoon. But here and across the tropics, policies are needed to protect supply for coastal communities against competing international markets.""

High-quality analytical data on small processed fish is presently lacking in most African food composition tables, which limits our ability to fully understand and utilize their nutritional potential. This paper is an important step towards filling that gap, generating robust data that is essential for developing knowledge-based dietary guidelines and ensuring these nutrient-rich foods are used to improve public health.""

Marian Kjellevold, research professor, Institute of Marine Research, Bergen

Dr. Shakuntala Thilsted, Senior Nutrition Expert, CGIAR said ""Many countries look towards biofortification of staple crops as a means of boosting micronutrient intakes. The results presented in this paper show that these nutrients are concentrated in dried small fish. Therefore, we must ensure that dried fish are included in food-based dietary guidelines. We must also use dried fish products in complementary feeding of young children, treatment of malnourished children, school feeding and food assistance programmes.""

The findings of the study, which was supported by the Royal Society and the European Research Council, are outlined in the paper 'Dried fish provide widespread access to critical nutrients across Africa', published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America (PNAS).

Researchers on the study include: James Robinson, Antonio Allegretti, Rucha Karkarey, Tim Lamont, Sarah Martin, Sophie Standen, Nicholas Graham and Christina Hicks of Lancaster University; Eva Maire of Lancaster University and the University of Montpellier; Johnstone Omukoto, Christopher Aura, and Naftaly Mwirigi of Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute; Richard Ansong of the University of Ghana, Kendra Byrd of the University of Greenwich; Kathryn Fiorella and Lydia O'Meara of Cornell University; Marian Kjellevold of the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen; Jessica Gephart of the University of Washington, and Shakuntala Thilsted of CGIAR.

For undergraduates, a trip to the dentist can reflect more than oral health. Those who kept up with dental exams were also more likely to schedule eye and physical exams, carry health insurance, and rate their overall health more positively, according to new study. 

We can think of primary care as a kind of gateway to other preventive care and specialized services. When students maintain the habit of seeing one type of provider regularly, it seems to spill over into how they approach their health more broadly."" 

Vanessa Alvarez, study's lead author and second-year MPH Epidemiology student at George Mason University's College of Public Health

Alvarez conducted the study with renowned obesity researcher Lawrence Cheskin, professor of nutrition at George Mason. Cheskin is co-principal investigator of Mason: Health Starts Here, the university's landmark cohort study following students across their four undergraduate years. 

The dental care study analyzed data from 349 first-year students enrolled in the cohort. The research found that: 

Students who had a dental exam before college were much more likely to keep up the habit two years later. 

Health insurance predicted dental visits at baseline, and students who got one type of preventive exam (dental, eye, or physical) were more likely to get the others. 

Students who had dental exams, more parental financial support, and higher levels of hope also rated their overall health more positively. 

Dental exam rates held steady from before to after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Researchers also noted a complex relationship with anxiety. Students reporting mild anxiety were sometimes more likely to seek dental care, but higher anxiety correlated with avoiding preventive exams. ""It's not a straight-line relationship,"" explained Cheskin. ""If you're a little bit anxious, it may motivate you to see a doctor. If you're very anxious, you may avoid it."" 

The dental study is just one slice of Mason: Health Starts Here, the university's first-of-its-kind longitudinal study tracking the health and habits of undergraduates. Since 2019, more than a thousand George Mason students have enrolled and completed detailed surveys, with some taking physical exams. Researchers monitor everything from diet and exercise to sleep, mental health, and substance use, returning health feedback to participants along the way. 

Findings from the cohort data so far have shed light on links between discrimination and disordered eating, how loneliness affects diet and physical activity, and the intersection of firearm access and substance use, among other topics. 

Several new studies are now underway. As a companion to the dental research, Alvarez is now leading a study on eye exams, while other researchers are looking into gynecological care among female students. Cheskin says future work will also focus on how diet and exercise habits changed from pre- to post-pandemic, and on mental health trends such as depression and hopefulness.

A research team at the Terasaki Institute, led by Dr. Vadim Jucaud in collaboration with Dr. Jing Yong Ye from the University of Texas San Antonio, has developed a new microfluidic-based biosensing platform that allows monitoring cellular secretion of monoclonal antibody in real time. This approach can make monoclonal antibody production more efficient, ultimately lowering manufacturing costs so these important biotherapeutics become more accessible to patients.

Monoclonal antibodies have become essential for treating various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory conditions, infectious diseases, respiratory diseases, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. The global demand for monoclonal antibodies, with over $240 billion in sales in 2024 alone, requires large-scale manufacturing with efficient, precise, and cost-effective monitoring of their production processes. Currently, monoclonal antibody production monitoring relies on end-point assays that fail to capture the real-time cellular secretion.

Dr. Jucaud's team has developed the first biosensing platform to rapidly and cost-effectively track live antibody secretion dynamics. The microfluidic design minimizes culture volume, concentrates antibodies, and positions hybridoma cell lines directly above a PC-TIR biosensor-originally developed by Dr. Ye's group at the University of Texas San Antonio. This setup enables characterization of antibody secretion within one hour, providing a powerful tool for comparing cell lines, optimizing production methods, and selecting high-secreting clones to advance monoclonal antibody manufacturing while lowering costs.

This work exemplifies how advanced biosensor technologies can revolutionize biomanufacturing.""

Dr. Danial Khorsandi, first author

""With this biosensor, we can spot the true 'powerhouse' cells that secrete antibodies at the highest rates per cell. This precision lets us identify and prioritize the best producers early in the process,"" added Dr. Vadim Jucaud, Principal Investigator. ""Because antibody secretion rate is directly tied to manufacturing efficiency, selecting these powerhouse cells could transform how we scale up monoclonal antibody production, ultimately driving down costs and making life-saving immunotherapies more affordable for patients.""

Dr. Jucaud's team anticipates that the platform's rapid, accurate, and scalable design will support fundamental research and industrial-scale biomanufacturing, helping meet the global need for antibody-based diagnostics and therapies. Overall, this new platform provides a way to streamline production, reduce unnecessary costs, and expand the availability of these therapies to more patients.

Routine blood samples, such as those taken daily at any hospital and tracked over time, could help predict the severity of an injury and even provide insights into mortality after spinal cord damage, according to a recent University of Waterloo study. 

The research team utilized advanced analytics and machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to assess whether routine blood tests could serve as early warning signs for spinal cord injury patient outcomes. 

More than 20 million people worldwide were affected by spinal cord injury in 2019, with 930,000 new cases each year, according to the World Health Organization. Traumatic spinal cord injury often requires intensive care and is characterized by variable clinical presentations and recovery trajectories, complicating diagnosis and prognosis, especially in emergency departments and intensive care units. 

 Routine blood tests could offer doctors important and affordable information to help predict risk of death, the presence of an injury and how severe it might be.""

Dr. Abel Torres Espín, Professor, School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo

The researchers sampled hospital data from more than 2,600 patients in the U.S. They used machine learning to analyze millions of data points and discover hidden patterns in common blood measurements, such as electrolytes and immune cells, taken during the first three weeks after a spinal cord injury. 

They found that these patterns could help forecast recovery and injury severity, even without early neurological exams, which are not always reliable as they depend on a patient's responsiveness. 

""While a single biomarker measured at a single time point can have predictive power, the broader story lies in multiple biomarkers and the changes they show over time,"" said Dr. Marzieh Mussavi Rizi, a postdoctoral scholar in Torres Espín's lab at Waterloo. 

The models, which do not rely on early neurological assessment, were accurate in predicting mortality and the severity of injury as early as one to three days after admission to the hospital, compared to standard non-specific severity measures that are often performed during the first day of arrival to intensive care. 

The research also found that accuracy increased over time as more blood tests became available. Although other measures, such as MRI and fluid omics-based biomarkers, can also provide objective data, they are not always readily accessible across medical settings. Routine blood tests, on the other hand, are economical, easy to obtain, and available in every hospital. 

""Prediction of injury severity in the first days is clinically relevant for decision-making, yet it is a challenging task through neurological assessment alone,"" Torres Espín said. ""We show the potential to predict whether an injury is motor complete or incomplete with routine blood data early after injury, and an increase in prediction performance as time progresses. 

""This foundational work can open new possibilities in clinical practice, allowing for better-informed decisions about treatment priorities and resource allocation in critical care settings for many physical injuries.""

Background and goal: Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), uninsured and low-income adults were less likely to have a usual source of care due to cost, coverage, and access barriers. This study evaluated changes in the prevalence of usual sources of care and the reasons for lacking one before and after ACA implementation. 

Study approach: Researchers analyzed 2010 to 2017 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Component (MEPS-HC), a nationally representative survey of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The study sample included 36,738 adults ages 18 to 64 and was divided into pre-ACA (2010-2013) and post-ACA (2014-2017) implementation. The primary outcome was self-reported usual source of care status and, if none existed, the main reason why. 

Main results:

The national usual source of care rose from 67% to 68% after the ACA, with the largest gains among low-income adults in both rural (+4.96 percentage points) and urban (+2.45 percentage points) areas. Reports by urban high-income adults declined slightly (-1.98 percentage points) while rural high-income adults showed no significant change.

After the ACA, reasons for lacking a usual source of care shifted in urban areas: affordability and insurance-related barriers decreased across income groups, accessibility increased across all income groups, and individual-preference reasons increased for low- and middle-income adults.

Why it matters: The findings suggest that while low-income adults reported gains in usual sources of care, insurance expansion alone may not ensure consistent access to care, especially given persistent non-financial access challenges.

Ovarian cancer (OC), one of the three most common gynecological malignancies, is characterized by low early detection rates and poor prognosis. Patients with OC face a high risk of developing transcoelomic metastasis—the spread of cancer cells within the abdominal cavity—during the early stages of the disease, a process strongly linked to poor survival outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms of how OC cells spread from the primary tumor to distant sites have remained elusive.

In a recent study published in Genes & Diseases, researchers from Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics, and Nankai University, employed CRISPR-based large-scale genetic screening alongside an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model with gene knockout cells to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying OC.

Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach combined with patient-derived transcriptomic datasets, researchers identified neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1) as one of the most critical genes promoting transcoelomic metastasis. NBL1 was found to be significantly overexpressed in metastatic ovarian tumors, with expression levels strongly correlating with advanced clinical stage and poor survival outcomes.

Further experiments by the team revealed that NBL1 promotes OC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis through dual mechanisms: i) direct activation of Jak/Stat3 signaling via physical interaction and ii) suppression of anti-tumor immunity by limiting T cell infiltration. Notably, the Stat3 inhibitor Wp1066 was shown to block NBL1-driven metastasis, reversing its effects on cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both in in vitro and in vivo models.

In conclusion, this study reveals a previously unrecognized oncogenic role of NBL1 in OC metastasis through Jak/Stat3 pathway activation. Its strong association with poor prognosis, combined with reversibility by Stat3 inhibitors, positions NBL1 as both a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target.

Background and goal: This study examined whether adding pharmacy technicians to primary care teams relieved clinicians and nurses of medication-access tasks and improved perceptions of burden, quality of care and patient access.

Study approach: Researchers conducted a retrospective, mixed-methods study one year after deploying five primary care pharmacy technicians across 11 clinics in a large urban safety-net network. They analyzed electronic health records (EHR) from June 2023 to May 2024 to track the number and type of medication tasks the technicians handled. Clinic staff were surveyed. The survey included a 0 to 10 ""pain point"" rating of medication access work before and after technician deployment; estimated hours saved per month; perceived impact on work experience, quality of care and patient access, and open-ended responses.

Main results:

In 12 months, five pharmacy technicians handled 43,782 medication items (65% refills, 18% medication problems, 17% prior authorizations).

Average ratings of ""medication access work as a pain point"" (0 to 10 scale) decreased from 8.3 before to 3.6 after pharmacy technician deployment.

Themes from open-ended questions described pharmacy technicians dealing with prior authorizations, communicating with pharmacies, timely medication access for patients, expertise of pharmacy technicians, and reduced task burden/ greater efficiency.

Why it matters: The findings from this study suggest pharmacy technicians can be an asset for team- based primary care, bringing expertise in efficiently managing medication access processes that benefits clinician and nurse work experience and patient access to medications.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a dangerous malformation of the lungs and diaphragm that causes almost a third of affected babies to die from underdeveloped lungs. So far, there have been no concrete options for treating this malformation with medication. Now, in an international study, pediatric scientists at the University of Leipzig Medical Center have shown that inflammatory cells play a previously underestimated role in the underdeveloped lungs of children with diaphragmatic hernia – both before and after birth. The findings lay the foundation for potential new treatment approaches and have been published in the renowned American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is one of the deadliest malformations in newborns. The main problem is the underdevelopment of the lungs. The condition also involves a hole in the diaphragm, which pediatric surgeons repair during the first week of life. However, even after a successful operation, many children with diaphragmatic hernia still die as a result of their underdeveloped lungs. So far, so-called pulmonary hypoplasia has scarcely been amenable to therapeutic intervention. Researchers in pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center therefore set out to discover which molecular mechanisms cause this malformation – and whether they might be specifically targeted for treatment.

In our current study we were able to show in human lungs that certain inflammatory cells – particularly macrophages – appear in increased numbers both before and after birth. This may influence the development of lung structure as we see it in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.""

PD Dr. Richard Wagner, lead investigator of the study in Leipzig

""We also confirmed several parallels in the inflammatory processes of diaphragmatic hernia between animal models and human samples – a crucial step towards potentially translating future therapies to humans,"" says the senior physician and research group leader for pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center.

The latest scientific analyses of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, carried out in collaboration with researchers in Mannheim, Paris, Winnipeg and Boston, show that the inflammatory signalling pathways of the immune system are overactivated. One striking finding was the so-called macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which is associated with disruptions in lung development.

For the study, state-of-the-art research methods were used, including proteomics technology to analyse a wide range of proteins in foetal lungs. Specialised microscopic staining and cell-measurement techniques were also applied. The results were then examined using bioinformatic tools and compared with findings from a stem cell model and animal models. In an earlier study, PD Dr Jan-Hendrik Gosemann, executive senior physician and research group leader in pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center, had already demonstrated in animal experiments that increased numbers of macrophages are found in the lungs of unborn rats with diaphragmatic hernia.

""The current results of our study have the potential one day to be translated into new treatment approaches. If we succeed in specifically reducing the heightened inflammation during pregnancy, we may be able to promote lung development and thereby improve both the survival prospects and the quality of life of affected children. The hope is to develop an additional drug therapy that could be administered before birth,"" says PD Dr. Wagner.

To pursue this approach further, the Leipzig team is currently establishing a major research programme funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Planned steps include testing various anti-inflammatory substances in animal models as well as in patient-derived stem cells, with the long-term aim of preparing clinical trials for prenatal treatment. ""So far, our studies are still at the level of molecular and cellular observations. But our ongoing research and the findings published in earlier and current studies provide strong indications that increased inflammation is a central driver of this severe malformation,"" says pediatric surgeon PD Dr. Wagner. ""I am especially delighted that Ms Katinka Sturm, a doctoral researcher in our department, is joint first author of this study – a wonderful recognition for such a young researcher.""

A new study found that families experienced greater difficulty affording adequate food and household expenses after states began to lift emergency SNAP benefits that were provided to families at the start of the pandemic.

The US Congressional Budget Office estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will cut $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next decade, sparking concerns among health experts about how this reduction in funding will affect food and economic security among the 47 million families who rely on this critical assistance.

As these changes begin to unfold, a new study builds upon a growing body of data that capture the detrimental consequences of reducing SNAP assistance. 

Published in the journal Preventive Medicine, the study explores food insufficiency and financial challenges among families after multiple states stopped providing emergency allotments of SNAP benefits provided during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. SNAP benefit reductions were associated with increased difficulty affording both food and household expenses among SNAP-participant families, particularly among those with children.

The risk of food insufficiency-a narrow measure that indicates that a household has not had enough food to eat within the past seven days-increased by five percentage points after several states ended their emergency allotments in 2021, compared to states that ended this assistance later. Similarly, the risk of difficulty affording household expenses increased by eight percentage points after the emergency allotments ended.

These findings demonstrate the vital role of SNAP, which is the largest food and nutrition assistance program in the country, and the research team hopes that these data can inform future policies and discussions around the adequacy of the SNAP benefit amount to support the health and well-being of families.

Our study found that states choosing to end the SNAP emergency allotments early created more pressure on family budgets, not just for affording food but also spillovers to difficulty affording other expenses. Households with children faced a greater increase in food insufficiency than those without, foreshadowing what we may expect with SNAP cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Dr. Paul Shafer, study senior author, associate professor of health law, policy & management

For the study, Dr. Shafer and colleagues utilized data from the nationally representative Household Pulse Survey to measure and compare changes in the risk of food insufficiency and difficulty affording household expenses among 5,685 people living in four states that ended SNAP emergency allotments in 2021 (Florida, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota) and 10,773 people living in eight states that ended these allotments in 2022 (Iowa, Arizona, Kentucky, Wyoming, Indiana, Georgia, Alaska, South Carolina, and South Carolina). The expanded SNAP assistance ended nationwide when the federal government lifted the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023. 

Food insufficiency was assessed with questions about the type of food households consumed within the last seven days, as well as how often families had enough to eat. Difficulty affording expenses was determined based on whether households were able to pay for standard expenses such as rent or mortgage, car payments, and medical expenses. 

Beyond physical health and development, even brief disruptions in access to food can affect mental and emotional health, particularly among children, the researchers emphasize. 

""Participating in SNAP helps in ways that go beyond just food on the table,"" Dr. Shafer says. ""Being food insecure is associated with higher rates of stress and depression. SNAP assistance supports the health of families and their housing, and helps avoid developmental risks in children.""

In addition to funding cuts, the OBBB implements several changes to SNAP eligibility, including expanded work reporting requirements for older adults, parents of children over age 14, parents, veterans, and the unhoused, as well as significant shifting of benefit and administrative costs from the federal government to the states. 

How states choose to respond will be key, says Dr. Shafer.

""States could cut eligibility or opt out altogether, or have to cut other state programs to offset the cost,"" he says. More people being subject to work reporting requirements, including 55-64 year olds, veterans, and unhoused people, will yield an estimated 2.4 million Americans falling through the cracks. Furthermore, food pantries-which are already overburdened-won't be able to absorb the additional need, which means even more people will face food insecurity and hunger.""

Tracking how these major changes to SNAP benefits and to the structure of the program affect families' health and their ability to make ends meet will be essential going forward, says study coauthor Dr. Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, research associate professor of health law, policy & management. 

""Tariffs, inflation, and growing unemployment are additional stressors on the purchasing power of SNAP that will be important to evaluate in real time,"" Dr. Ettinger de Cuba says. ""Given what we already know from past changes to the program, I am concerned that SNAP will not be able to respond as it was designed-to grow during hard times and shrink in good times-ultimately increasing hardship for everyday people.""

While many families found comfort and companionship in their lockdown puppies, new research shows that the joy often came with safety risks, added stress, and uneven benefits across children and caregivers.

Study: More than just one man and his dog: The many impacts of puppy acquisition on the mental health of families including children in the UK. Image credit: Nina Buday/Shutterstock.com

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple families got puppies, mainly to help them with their mental health. A recent study in PLOS ONE examines how children and dogs interact in these families, using a three-phase online survey.

About 1.6 million UK homes have one or more dogs. Dogs are part of the family in these homes, and multiple family members consider themselves the dog's owner. This contrasts with the common misconception that one person, usually an adult, owns the dog.

A prior study showed that 38% of people in the UK who currently own a dog acquired it during the pandemic, resulting in “pandemic puppies.” The pandemic years were marked by lockdowns, periods of severely restricted physical social interactions, and widespread fear of severe illness and death. Rising rates of mental ill-health, coupled with the belief that having a dog in the household would help counter emotional negativity, led to the pandemic puppy trend.

Very little is known about the benefits of pet ownership for children or adults, which has prompted this current study. The researchers conducted an online survey in three parts. They compared households that got a dog in 2019 with those that got a dog during 2020-21. Since few people responded in the 2019 group, statistical comparisons were underpowered, and the qualitative analysis pooled both groups rather than treating them separately.

The responses came from 382 caregivers and 216 children. In most cases, dog care appeared to be women's work, with half the women being 45-54 years old. For just under half, this was their first dog. Two-thirds said they researched their decision before acquiring a puppy.

More than half the families got a dog to boost their spirits and bring joy back into the house. Over half the children in the study were female, with a median age of 13. Slightly less than a quarter of caregivers had children with a mental health diagnosis, with 82% of these blaming the pandemic, in part.

A third of caregivers found living with a puppy more challenging than expected, especially when it was their first dog. The greatest challenge was ensuring everyone remained safe around the dog, especially the children.

Other challenges included always looking after the dog, especially when other family members were less involved. Some mothers felt their children were less involved in dog walking and feeding,  though others noted more involvement than anticipated. First-time dog owners were more likely to find their children less involved in care than expected.

Many caregivers reported stress involved in ensuring safe dog-child interactions. Concerningly, over half of the children were permitted to engage in multiple activities known to increase bite risk (17/25 listed interactions). About half the children had eight risky interactions with the family pet. For instance, children not only patted their dogs but hugged and kissed them in 90% or more families. Over a third of families allowed children to play with the dog during its mealtimes, a known risk for biting behavior. Obvious misbehavior, like pulling the dog's ears or tail, was allowed in <7% of families.

Both children and adults found that having a dog had multiple positive aspects, especially the close physical interactions between children and the dog. The impact of having a dog was different for different people in the same family. Its presence could change the operation and mood of the whole family.

In almost all families, at least one member has benefited from the dog's positive effects as a playmate, confidant, friend, comforter, and safeguard. Children particularly “owned” the dog.

The lockdown was associated with very bad memories, which many caregivers and children recalled being eased by the presence of a dog. Not only did the children enjoy cuddling, hugging, or sharing a bed with their dogs as an expression of their affection, but this also provided an emotional boost when they were sad, lonely, or anxious.

The family was often bonded by caring for a dog, keeping it physically engaged, and by the companionship and humor the dog brought into their lives. Dog walking also separated the children from virtual interactions and brought them out of their bedrooms to engage with the family.

Conversely, children sometimes resent taking care of the family pet, are jealous when the dog appears to prefer others or receives more attention, and dislike the dog's asking for attention when they are otherwise engaged. The caregivers are often unaware that their children do not like these behaviors or do not appreciate having to give up much of their free time to look after the dog.

Recognizing signs of aversion, distress, fear, or aggression in a dog is vital for dog owners. It should be taught wherever possible, even via literature or other media, if not physically.  

“These findings underscore the importance of involving all household members in human-dog research and highlight the unpredictability of whether acquisition motivations will align with outcomes.” “Pandemic puppies” did not always improve the mental health of the children in the families that owned them, and this should not be the reason for getting a puppy.

Children often love having a dog as a companion and playmate, but they should be trained to avoid behaviors that increase dog bite risk. Families need access to resources to help them safely settle in the new puppy, especially considering the additional caregiver mental burden placed on the woman who typically undertakes dog care and maintains safe dog-child boundaries, in addition to her other responsibilities in the home.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","UCLA to co-lead a large-scale randomized trial of AI in breast cancer screening","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250923/UCLA-to-co-lead-a-large-scale-randomized-trial-of-AI-in-breast-cancer-screening.aspx","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:01:00 GMT","

UCLA and UC Davis will co-lead a newly funded, multi-institutional clinical trial to evaluate whether artificial intelligence (AI) can help support radiologists in interpreting mammograms more accurately, with the goal of improving breast cancer screening and reducing unnecessary callbacks and anxiety for patients. 

The study, known as the PRISM Trial (Pragmatic Randomized Trial of Artificial Intelligence for Screening Mammography), is supported by a $16 million award from the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The study will involve hundreds of thousands of mammograms interpreted at academic medical centers and breast imaging facilities in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Washington and Wisconsin. The AI support tool studied will be Transpara by ScreenPoint Medical with clinical workflow integration provided by the Aidoc aiOS platform.

""This is the first large-scale randomized trial of AI in breast cancer screening in the United States,"" said Dr. Joann G. Elmore, Dual Principal Investigator and lead of the Administrative Coordinating Site, and professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and of health policy and management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. ""We're looking carefully and objectively at whether AI helps or hinders - and for whom. Expert radiologists remain in the driver's seat for all interpretations.""

Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death among women in the U.S. While routine mammography screening reduces mortality through early detection, it also has drawbacks - including false positives that can lead to unnecessary testing, anxiety and costs, and missed cancers.

""AI has great promise, but it also raises real questions,"" said Elmore, who is also an investigator at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center and serves as director of the UCLA National Clinician Scholars Program. ""We want to know whether AI helps radiologists find more cancers, or just flags more exams that ultimately turn out to be normal.""

What makes PRISM different is its emphasis on patient-centered research. The trial was developed in close partnership with patient advocates, clinicians, health system leaders and policymakers.

Each participating facility will continue routine screening as usual, with no changes to the patient experience. Mammograms will be randomly assigned to be interpreted either by a radiologist on their own or with assistance from an FDA-cleared AI support tool. In all cases, a radiologist reads the exam and makes the final decision. 

There's never been a trial of this scope looking at AI in breast cancer screening in the U.S. The results will help inform not just clinical practice, but also insurance coverage, technology adoption, and patient communication."" 

Dr. Hannah Milch, Co-Principal Investigator and UCLA Site PI and assistant professor of radiology at UCLA

""There is a lot of hope that AI will make care better, but very few rigorous trials have actually evaluated its real-world effects,"" said Elmore. ""This is our opportunity to generate trustworthy evidence, with the patient perspective front and center.""

In addition to analyzing cancer detection and recall rates, the study will include focus groups and surveys to capture how patients and radiologists perceive and trust AI-assisted care.

The PRISM trial brings together seven leading academic medical centers:

Elmore emphasized that the goal is not to replace human expertise but to understand how AI might complement it. ""Our expert radiologists will continue to make the final call. AI may be a useful co-pilot - but it's the radiologist who holds the wheel.""

The trial is expected to inform future policy decisions, best practices in screening, and how to most effectively integrate emerging technologies into patient care.

Izzy Engle netted a hat trick in her second collegiate game. She scored two more times in her third. The next four games all featured at least one goal or assist too.

By the time Notre Dame's 2024 regular season ended, Engle had produced 15 goals. She then scored in four consecutive postseason games — one in the ACC Tournament and three in the NCAA Tournament — as Notre Dame knocked off No. 1-seed Mississippi State and reached the Elite Eight. The awards and honors came pouring in: ACC Freshman of the Year. All-ACC first team. Top Drawer Soccer Freshman of the Year. United Soccer Coaches second-team All-American.

She has picked up in 2025 right where she left off.

Engle's eight goals in eight games this season are tied for the most in the ACC and tied for the sixth-most in the country through Sunday's games. She opened the scoring last week against No. 3 Duke, leading the Fighting Irish (7-0-1) to a 3-2 win, which pushed Notre Dame to No. 1 in the nation for Top Drawer Soccer and No. 2 in the most recent United Soccer Coaches poll.

Engle is living a dream. Her parents, aunt and uncle all went to Notre Dame, so she grew up attending Fighting Irish football games. Playing soccer for the school was always the goal, but she was determined to keep an open mind during her college recruiting process. Coaches knew Notre Dame was her dream school and would ask her if they even had a chance. She would tell them “yes.” And she meant it.

She liked the schools she visited. But in the end, they just weren't Notre Dame.

The Edina, Minnesota, native arrived in South Bend in the summer of 2024 ready to embrace the challenge ahead of her. She knew she would encounter adversity, so she braced herself for it as best she could, trying not to take anything for granted.

“My high school and club experience coming into Notre Dame for sure prepared me very well,” she said in a recent appearance on Sports Spectrum's “What's Up” podcast. “I was used to adversity. I had some injuries that you had to battle though. Having those experiences, I knew the season was not going to be easy and nothing's going to be given.”



Her freshman year was a season of incredible highs, as well as some difficult moments. Engle's strong faith in God helped her avoid getting caught up in the hype and push through the struggles.

“When things were going well, I knew who to give glory to,” she said on the podcast. “I knew it was not on my own. When things didn't go well … I knew that those valleys, they're temporary. I've got God and I've got my teammates to get me through it.”

Growing up in a Christian family, Engle is grateful for what she described as a “boring” testimony. Jesus has always been part of her life, and she specifically prayed that she would find ways to grow in her faith at Notre Dame. That prayer has been answered in ways that even she didn't expect.

“Having that foundation and knowing that no matter what I go through, no matter if I feel alone, I'm never alone and God is always with me. When you're going into something so new and so unfamiliar, knowing that everything else might be changing but He is unchanging, that was for sure something that I leaned on,” she said.

Engle was immediately invited to church by teammates and is part of a team Bible study. She is also part of an organization called Notre Dame Christian Athletes and is taking on more of a leadership role now as a sophomore.

This summer, Engle — who also has Brazilian citizenship through her mother — helped the U.S. women's U-20 national team qualify for the 2026 World Cup and served as captain in the semifinals of the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship against Canada. The U-20 World Cup will take place in Poland next September.

As hectic as her life is, Engle still manages to find little moments to reflect and think about how grateful she is to be playing the sport she loves at her dream school in an environment that helps her grow closer to the Lord.

“It's been really special to see what God's been doing in this place, working in my team, working in me, and working in some of the other girls,” she said on the podcast. “It's also cool to be becoming more of a leader in my faith and having the courage to step out and allow myself to grow and see who God created me to be.”

Notre Dame hosts No. 11 North Carolina (7-3) in its next game Wednesday. Kickoff is at 6 p.m. ET.

The Orlando Pride averaged 1.12 points per game in their first seven seasons as a National Women's Soccer League franchise (2016-2022). They made the playoffs once and never won a postseason game. In January 2023, they selected center back Emily Sams (née Madril) with the third overall pick in the NWSL Draft.

Since Sams arrived, they are averaging a league-high 1.93 points per game. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there is no question that Sams has been a central figure in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in recent memory in any major sports league.

>> Subscribe to Sports Spectrum Magazine for more stories where sports and faith connect <<

Sams was well aware of Orlando's history as she went through the draft process, and wanted to be picked by a team that had a better track record of success.

“I was trying to talk to my agents and see if there was something we could do, but Orlando said, ‘No, we're drafting you and you are coming here,'” she said in a recent interview for the Summer 2025 edition of Sports Spectrum Magazine. “So at first I thought, ‘All right, just gotta make the best of it.' But now I'm so thankful. I feel I have also been placed here for a reason, so it's just been incredible.”

Her impact was immediate. Sams started every regular-season game as a rookie and led the Pride in minutes played. Orlando narrowly missed out on the playoffs, but it was clear the team was headed in a positive direction under head coach Seb Hines, who was hired in November 2022.

Yet no one could have predicted what was coming next. The Pride opened the 2024 season with a 23-game unbeaten run, resulting in a 60-point campaign that included 18 wins — all NWSL records. They also collected the first two trophies in franchise history: the NWSL Shield as the team with the best regular-season record, and the NWSL Championship.

Sams won NWSL Defender of the Year and was an alternate on the U.S. team that won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She officially made her U.S. women's national team debut on Oct. 27, 2024, in a friendly against Iceland, and has earned three more caps since.

— National Women's Soccer League (@NWSL) November 21, 2024



Orlando is off to another strong start this year, sitting in second place as the season approaches its halfway point. The strong bond between players has played an important role in the team's success, and an active Bible study has helped build a strong foundation of faith in the locker room.

Sams is a regular participant in the Bible study, and teammates who have played for other teams have emphasized to her how special the present culture of faith in Orlando is.

“Everyone who has had previous experience [in the NWSL] is saying, ‘This is incredible. This is not very common. This is a sacred time and a sacred place,'” Sams said in the magazine feature. “So I definitely feel very blessed to be a part of this group. I would just say we're all very committed to meeting.”

Sams grew up going to church and was involved in Bible studies while in college at Florida State, but does not feel like she truly took ownership of her faith until last year. The defining moment came during a team Bible study when they were reading an introduction to a book that discussed spiritual warfare.

“It talked about how our souls our being fought for,” Sams said. “I can't remember the specific moment, but we were reading that, and for whatever reason it just clicked in my head, and I would say that is the moment I got saved. God just revealed Himself to me in a way that I had never experienced before.”

On New Year's Eve, Sams reflected on her incredible year in an Instagram post. Her caption was the only way she could explain everything that happened: “Only by the grace of God.”

Orlando (8-3-1) is back in action against Racing Louisville (5-5-2) at 8 p.m. ET on Friday. Sams was also included on the U.S. women's national team roster for its upcoming games against Ireland (June 26 and 29) and Canada (July 2).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Becky Sauerbrunn adds new role to ever-expanding portfolio","https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com/story/sports/uswnt/2025/09/23/becky-sauerbrunn-joins-men-in-blazers-starts-new-podcast/86294981007/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:03:00 GMT","

When starting a conversation with Becky Sauerbrunn these days, there is only one appropriate opening.

""Congratulations,"" I say. ""On ... everything.""

There is a lot for the longtime U.S. women's national team captain to celebrate right now.

Sauerbrunn announced her retirement in December after a decorated career for club and country. She followed that up by starting as an analyst for TNT Sports and then, just for good measure, announced she and her partner Zola Short are expecting their first child in October.

And now there's even more: Sauerbrunn is joining The Women's Game full time, and will be hosting her own show: ""Teaming Up with Becky Sauerbrunn.""

Sauerbrunn has already been working with The Women's Game, which is part of the Men in Blazers Media Network. The 40-year-old joined the “Good Vibes FC” show alongside Sam Mewis and Lynn Biyendolo last year, and is now expanding to a solo venture of her own.

""Whenever an athlete retires it's kind of like, what's going to be next?"" Sauerbrunn tells Pro Soccer Wire. ""We didn't make walking-away money, so a lot of us know that we're going to be picking up a second career, a third career.

""Luckily, I had been doing 'Good Vibes' with Sam Mewis and Lynn Biyendolo last year, and continued to do that this year. And then adding the new podcast onto this made things less scary, because I knew I had something to really look forward to.

""And then I decided to throw in some broadcasting stuff and get pregnant. Why not?""

Though she may have a lot on her plate, Sauerbrunn is diving headfirst into her new show, which will launch on Monday, Sept. 29. Actress Elizabeth Banks, who is also an investor in NWSL expansion side Boston Legacy FC, will be the first guest.

The show will swerve away from on-field affairs and focus on stories of people around the sport including owners, coaches, activists, commentators, sports psychologists and more.

Sauerbrunn says that the show will ""really elevate their roles and what they do to push the sport along, but does it in a way that gets more to their story and what brought them to the game.""

Other guests include former USWNT star Lauren Holiday, and broadcasters Rebecca Lowe, Mina Kimes, and Katie Nolan.

""I really hope that when people listen to the podcast, they feel like they made a new friend,"" Sauerbrunn adds. ""They just heard this person's story and they realize this community is building and we're just adding all these new people.""

Fans of Sauerbrunn's work on ""Good Vibes"" need not worry, though.

""Sam Mewis and Lynn Biyendolo, they're not getting rid of me,"" Sauerbrunn says. ""We're definitely still doing 'Good Vibes.'""

TNT Sports also won't be getting rid of Sauerbrunn, who says she will be continuing her role on television.

""They are very different mediums,"" the two-time World Cup winner says of podcasting and television. ""Both are very challenging but very fun at the same time. I've been really fortunate that both those groups are willing to work with each other and with me, so that I can do both.""

Amid all of the different hats Sauerbrunn is wearing, there is actually one role she is happy to have off her plate: professional soccer player.

""I think what surprised me the most is I thought I was going to miss it so much more,"" she admits.

After a 16-year international career and a club career that spanned nearly two decades, Sauerbrunn is realizing in hindsight that the grind was wearing her down.

""I watch a lot of games now, and I'm just kind of like, 'Wow. I can't believe I did that for as long as I did,'"" she says.

""Just kind of the physical stress, the emotional, the psychological, all of it. For me to have done it for that long, I think I look back now and I'm just kind of like, 'Wow, good for you for being able to do that.'""

The psychological element of the game is something Sauerbrunn is looking to delve further into during her new show. According to Men in Blazers founder and CEO Roger Bennett, she's the perfect person to moderate those kinds of discussions.

""Becky Sauerbrunn was one of the most intelligent footballers to ever pull on a U.S. jersey,"" Bennett said.

""She was not only a towering defensive force, she was also a natural leader who became the moral heart of the national team in their pursuit of glory, and their even greater fight for equal pay.""

Though she may not miss playing as much as she thought, Sauerbrunn is more than happy to add another soccer-adjacent position to her portfolio.

""My days are busy, but happy busy, and I'm really excited about what we're doing with Men In Blazers and The Women's Game,"" she says. ""And so I'm still very much connected to the women's soccer world, which also makes me really happy.""","{'href': 'https://prosoccerwire.usatoday.com', 'title': 'Pro Soccer Wire'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT's Reyna invests in USL's Fort Lauderdale","https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/46349959/usmnt-gio-reyna-buys-stake-usl-ft-lauderdale-united","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

United States men's national team and Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Giovanni Reyna has joined the ownership group of Fort Lauderdale United FC.

Fort Lauderdale United currently has a women's team in the USL Super League, with the organization set to add a men's team that will compete next season in USL League One. The latest round of investment in the club also includes other individuals besides Reyna, and according to majority owner Tommy Smith, brings the club's valuation to $55 million.

""We are incredibly proud to welcome Gio Reyna to the Fort Lauderdale United family,"" Smith said in a prepared statement. ""This investment not only reflects our club's immense potential but also solidifies our position in the American soccer landscape. With our strong youth program and state-of-the-art facilities, we are proud of our ability to create signature professional pathway on both the men's and women's sides.""

Fort Lauderdale United currently has youth teams from U-11 on up -- with plans to have younger teams next year -- and is using the old Miami Dolphins training facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University as hub for the organization, featuring a 7,000-seat stadium.

In addition to soccer, the club also fields teams in youth volleyball, and has plans to field a women's professional volleyball team in 2027. Smith said that all told, there are 1,400 youth players affiliated with the organization.

""Just bringing in outside money, it's the smart thing to do. I pretty much invested all my own capital to build the stadium, the clubs, the teams, the fields, the partnership with NSU,"" Smith said in an exclusive interview with ESPN.

""Especially someone like [Gio Reyna] that has been involved in soccer, not necessarily really the money aspect of it, but ultimately kind of a proof in concept that like, 'Hey, we're doing this revenue, we have these teams, we have these clubs, building it up.'""

Another one of the club's owners, Hassan Pinto, knew Gio's father, Claudio, from his days playing youth soccer in New Jersey, and the two were teammates in their youth with the Olympic Development Program (ODP) Region I team. Pinto also was classmates with Claudio Reyna's wife, Danielle, at UNC-Chapel Hill. That connection helped pave the way for getting Gio Reyna to invest in the club.

The expectation for Reyna, 22, is that it will give him an initial foray into sports business, the better to accumulate knowledge for a possible career after his playing days end.

""What truly sold me on Fort Lauderdale United was the ownership group's comprehensive vision. They're not just creating two professional teams; they're building a complete ecosystem for player development, from the youth level all the way to the pros,"" Reyna said in a statement.

""Combining that with the fantastic South Florida location and state-of-the-art facilities, it became clear this was a perfect opportunity to not only invest in the club's success but also to help develop the future of American soccer.""

Reyna follows in the footsteps of international teammate Tyler Adams in terms of investing in professional clubs, with Adams joining the investment group of IUSL League One side Westchester SC earlier this year.

But for Fort Lauderdale United president of soccer Tyrone Mears, having Gio Reyna on board goes beyond the professional setup.

""I know there's been quite a few of the American players investing into clubs over here, so it's fantastic,"" he told ESPN. ""Gio, he's got a fantastic name. He's obviously playing in Europe, but to get that connection, I think especially with the younger demographic, Gio's really going to help with that.""

Fort Lauderdale United lost in the USL Super League playoff final in the league's inaugural season last year, and is currently in second place this season after four games played.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

As the United States Men's National Team moves closer to next summer's World Cup, individual performances will receive more and more attention as players jockey for a place in Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino's final squad.

Last Friday, midfielder Tanner Tessmann scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his club team, Lyon, in their Ligue 1 match against Angers.  While the goal can only help Tessmann's prospects of catching Pochettino's eye, it's equally as possible that the 23-year-old midfielder's chances of landing a spot on the World Cup squad may have already come and gone.



“Pochettino was so high on [Tessmann] at first and then over the summer, he didn't get called in [to the Gold Cup] and it feels like other guys are just moving ahead of him” said former U.S. Men's National Team star Landon Donovan on the latest edition of Unfiltered Soccer.

Despite captaining the American Olympic team at the 2024 games in Paris, Tessmann failed to make this summer's Gold Cup squad.  He was then also passed over for the USMNT's recent September camp including two friendlies against South Korea and Japan.  Donovan cited that September absence as the one that could spell doom for Tessmann's chances of securing a spot at the World Cup.

“From what I heard internally and a little bit externally, that September camp, the Japan-South Korea games, were the last time Pochettino was ‘looking and evaluating players.'

“It feels like the ship has sailed a little with [Tessmann].'”

Meanwhile, in Italy, U.S. star attacker Christian Pulisic appears to be starting the season on the right foot as the 26-year-old scored twice and assisted on another over the weekend in AC Milan's 3-0 win against Udinese.  For Pulisic, the brace moved him ahead of Clint Dempsey for the most goals scored by an American in Europe's top 5 leagues (English Premier League, La Liga in Spain, the German Bundesliga, Ligue 1 in France and Serie A in Italy).

“He'll continue to smash that record,” said former U.S. Goalkeeper and Unfiltered Soccer co-host, Tim Howard.  “I mean, he'll probably get to, I would think, at least one hundred.”

When Thomas Tuchel said the Club World Cup handed the advantage to Liverpool and Arsenal in the Premier League title race, he had not reckoned on the latter signing Noni Madueke and Chelsea going all the way in the competition.

Madueke has become the latest star to have played at this summer's Club World Cup to be ruled out after suffering an injury that is expected to sideline him for around two months, which may have diluted some of the advantage Tuchel attributed to Arsenal's non-participation.

The Club World Cup has already seemingly taken its toll on winners Chelsea and Manchester City, with seven players who appeared in the tournament for both clubs currently out injured and Cole Palmer managing a groin problem that has reduced his minutes.

Arsenal now also have a a Club World Cup casualty in Madueke, despite not taking part in the competition, and the injuries suffered by English clubs – as well as those at Paris St-Germain, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid – will only increase the fears of Tuchel, Enzo Maresca, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp.

Madueke returned one week early from his delayed holiday to start work at Arsenal following his move from Chelsea, having played all the way to the semi-final at the Club World Cup before skipping the final in anticipation of his transfer.

According to Opta, Madueke has since played 306 minutes of Premier League football for Arsenal this season, as well 89 minutes in the Champions League and 76 minutes for England.

Stephen Smith is the CEO and founder of Kitman Labs, a leading sports performance intelligence company set up to reduce injury risk who work with the Premier League and EFL. Speaking to Telegraph Sport, he said: “It's impossible to state definitively that these injuries are as a direct result of the Club World Cup. We know there is a heightened chance of injury with an increased number of games and Chelsea and Manchester City have clearly been doing things to offset the demands of the Club World Cup, and putting a lot of strategies in place.

“Arsenal have not had to do that across the board and Madueke has played almost 400 minutes for the club, so far, while an average Chelsea player sits at somewhere closer to 200 minutes. It will probably create more fear around the Club World Cup, but people are already worried about it, so now's the time to get ahead of this and start trying to do something about player health and safety rather than burying our heads in the sand.”

Back at the start of June, Tuchel had said: “I think it [the Club World Cup] will have a huge impact and it will give Liverpool and Arsenal a huge advantage in the next season to not be there.”

The England manager has already seen his own World Cup preparations impacted, as Palmer and Jude Bellingham, who delayed shoulder surgery to play at the Club World Cup for Real Madrid, were unavailable for his last squad to face Andorra and Serbia.

Palmer may well be a doubt again, while Madueke will now miss the Wales and Latvia games. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who Real paid a fee to Liverpool for to allow him to play in the Club World Cup, will not earn an England recall after suffering a hamstring injury. Chelsea central defender Levi Colwill will miss most of the season.

Tuchel is short of in-form strikers other than Harry Kane, but Chelsea's summer signing Liam Delap is out until Christmas with a hamstring injury. Delap is so unaccustomed to hamstring problems that it is understood he initially assumed he had cramp when he pulled up against Fulham.

Ahead of Tuesday night's Carabao Cup trip to Lincoln City, Chelsea head coach Maresca was without six players who had appeared at the Club World Cup. He said: “We are in a new situation for us because of the Club World Cup, so we don't know how this season will be in terms of injury. I don't think it is random, the amount of injuries we have, and we need to try to learn and try to manage the situation.”

Chelsea returned to pre-season training on Aug 4, three weeks after their Club World Cup success, which gave them just 13 days of preparation from their opening league game against Crystal Palace.

The club had been prepared for some resulting turbulence through the first few games and so it has proved with injuries piling up and Chelsea dropping points against Palace, Brentford and Manchester United, as well as losing to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.

Chelsea and City have been trying to manage the situation through rotation, with both teams using 22 players in the Premier League so far this season. Only Wolverhampton Wanderers have used more.

City are without three of their Club World Cup players, Omar Marmoush, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki, who all missed the draw with Arsenal in which Guardiola further mitigated the physical demands on his players by parking the bus.

Guardiola's team have taken one point fewer than Chelsea from their opening five league games, having lost to Tottenham Hotspur and Brighton, but did start with a win against Napoli in the Champions League.

It was after the Club World Cup that Guardiola had said: “Game by game, month by month, we will see. And maybe in November, December, January, ask me, Pep. I may say: ‘So listen, we are a disaster. We are exhausted. The World Cup destroyed us.' I don't know, but it's the first time in our life that that's happened [the Club World Cup]. So we will see.”

European champions Paris St-Germain and Bayern Munich have already counted the cost of their participation in the Club World Cup, which former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp labelled “the worst idea ever.”

Klopp said: “It's all about the game and not the surrounding events – and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard.

“It's a pointless competition. Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they'll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league. There are people who have never been involved in the day-to-day business of football and are now coming up with ideas.”

Kitman Labs work with over 2,000 elite performance clients in over 26 countries and, as well as operating in football, are partnered with the NFL, the RFU and the IRFU.

Smith said: “We've been banging our hands on the table and saying there needs to be involvement from leaders around the game. It has to be a collaborative effort between all the leagues, the governing bodies and the broadcasters. We need to be documenting the injuries that are happening and the game exposure, and perform research in it to implement solutions.

“The NFL have been doing this for years, running long-term injury surveillance research and they've made huge changes as a result to improve player health and safety. That needs to happen in football and then you can give managers the power to say ‘well ok, within the framework and rules we have to protect players, this is what we can do'.”

Noni Madueke, the former PSV Eindhoven forward, has played the majority of his games this season off the right flank, which is where Tuchel also started him for England. He has caught the eye with his direct running and attempts to beat his full-back on the outside in attacking areas.

Fortunately for Arteta, the Spaniard has Bukayo Saka returning from injury to step in as a like-for-like replacement. Saka was forced off with a hamstring injury in the second match of the season, against Leeds, and made his comeback against City at the weekend.

While Saka was out, he missed the September international break with the England camp which is where Madueke seized his chance to impress and played a key role in the 5-0 win over Serbia that put England within sight of the World Cup in America last season.

Arteta also has summer-signing Eberechi Eze pushing for a place in the frontline or as No10, with both roles supporting Viktor Gyökeres up front. Gabriel Martinelli has started two Premier League matches this season and staked his claim to play regularly with his equaliser against City.

Arsenal will face London derbies against rivals Spurs, West Ham, Fulham and Crystal Palace in the next two months after travelling to Newcastle at the weekend, while in the Champions League they face Bayern Munich on November 26.

FIFA received 145 reports relating to “human rights concerns” at the Club World Cup in the U.S., “many of which were complaints submitted by supporters through the governing body's own grievance mechanism portal,” according to Adam Crafton of THE ATHLETIC. 

The highest number related to fans “expressing concerns about U.S. government policies or their enforcement,” with the second-most coming from fans who “suffered from extreme heat during the tournament.” Crafton notes the grievance mechanism is in place for supporters who wish to express concerns about the organization or the experience at FIFA-led events. Some reports were “received via the portal, some fans used FIFA's human rights email address, and others were made on-site by venue teams reporting into FIFA.” These included 37 complaints categorized as being “related to federal policies or enforcement.” 

Among the other complaints submitted by supporters were “concerns about extreme heat -- a repeated controversy during the tournament.” FIFA opened 25 investigations following reports about “conditions deemed unsafe by fans due to the heat.” Other investigations included “20 or more complaints about accessibility issues and discrimination.” FIFA also opened a dozen complaints “relating to workers' rights, as well as just under 10 safeguarding issues.” There were five investigations into “harassment,” as well as four in the “freedom of speech category and alleged excessive use of force.” Three complaints were made about an “alleged failure to provide for freedom of religion” (THE ATHLETIC, 9/23).

The Egyptian Pyramids might cross paths with Palmeiras, Flamengo, or São Paulo in the Intercontinental Cup, FIFA's new annual Club World Cup, in December.

This Tuesday (23), the African Champions League winner defeated the Saudi Al-Ahli, the current Asian Champions League winner, by 3 x 1 at King Abdullah Sports City in Saudi Arabia.

By taking the title of the Africa-Asia-Pacific Cup of the Intercontinental Cup - Pyramids had already dispatched Auckland City in the playoffs on the 14th.

Fiston Mayele, a striker from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, scored all three goals for the African team.

Al-Ahli managed to equalize with Toney, from a penalty, but could not overcome a competent rival when they had the ball.

They had Brazilians Ibañez and Galeno among the starters. Matheus Gonçalves was brought on at 84', after Mayele's third goal.

Pyramids now await the winner of the match between Cruz Azul, who won the last Concacaf Champions Cup, and the future winner of the 2025 Libertadores.

On December 11 last year, the Glorioso took the field three days after winning the Brasileirão and was defeated by Pachuca 3 x 0, exiting the tournament early.

The first semifinalist of the current edition will be known soon.

Racing and Vélez Sarsfield will face each other starting at 7 PM (Brasília time), after the Avellaneda team won away by 1 x 0.

Wednesday (24) will have Palmeiras x River after Verdão won in Buenos Aires by 2 x 1.

Thursday (25) will start with São Paulo x LDU with the Ecuadorian team having the advantage after the 2 x 0 in Quito.

An estimated 2.7 billion fans across the globe watched the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, preliminary data shows.

Post-tournament analysis by Nielsen Sports shows the huge audience across all forms of media supplemented the 2.5 million supporters who attended the 63-match event held in the United States from June 14 till July 13, 2025.

English club Chelsea were crowned the world club champions after a 3–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

The audience analysis included those who watched games through DAZN – the competition's exclusive global broadcaster — sublicensees, other media, and at watch parties held around the world.

New Zealand fans were able to watch games streamed live and free through DAZN, including Auckland City's matches against Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.

Research showed 80% of football fans worldwide were aware the competition was taking place.

During the tournament, ‘FIFA Club World Cup' became the most searched-for term among sports competitions on search engine Google.

The tournament's official social media accounts gained nine million followers, and DAZN's social channels delivered more than 10 billion impressions.

DAZN streamed all 63 matches live and for free and achieved record reach and engagement throughout the tournament.

The global sports entertainment platform gave fans a transformative viewing experience that extended beyond live match broadcasts. Its digital-first coverage delivered premium and on-demand features, DAZN's unique interactive FanZone, and bespoke shoulder content.

As a result, 80% of viewers on DAZN also engaged with non-live content during the tournament, underscoring the growing appetite for immersive, multi-format football storytelling and DAZN's status as the premier destination for football content.

“These preliminary figures confirm that the FIFA Club World Cup has been a global success and a game-changer,” said FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström.

“From the incredible atmosphere in the stadiums in the United States to 2.7 billion people engaging around the world, the tournament has exceeded expectations. FIFA promised to take this tournament to the world, and there's no doubt that the world took to the tournament. We thank our global broadcast partner DAZN for their support in delivering this success.”

DAZN Group chief executive Shay Segev said: “The numbers demonstrate the extraordinary global appetite for accessible, high-quality football content. Our partnership with FIFA for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 has set a new global benchmark for experiencing football and the tournament has shown just how powerful the sport can be when presented through a digital-first, fan-centric lens.

“Together with FIFA, we are proud to have set new standards for global reach and engagement and to have connected fans around the world to one of football's most exciting tournaments”.

As the exclusive global broadcaster, DAZN also sublicensed broadcast rights to a network of more than 100 partners worldwide. The linear figures from numerous individual markets show impressive results.

In Brazil, where all four teams progressed out of the groups and captured hearts on and off the field, reports show that more than 131 million people across the country watched the tournament on television — the equivalent of 62% of the population.

Brazilian network TV Globo recorded its three highest audiences of 2025 during the tournament. CR Flamengo's game against FC Bayern München was watched by 37.3 million people, while Palmeiras' games against Inter Miami CF and Botafogo recorded their second- and third-highest viewing figures of the year, respectively.

In Spain, 49% of the population (around 24 million people) watched the competition, while in Italy, 48% of the population (around 28 million people) tuned in.

In Portugal, it was reported that more than 60% of the population tuned in to watch the competition across DAZN and sublicensee TVI. The most popular match (between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain) and the match between Inter Miami CF and FC Porto gave TVI its highest and second-highest ratings of 2025 at the time of broadcast, respectively.

In Saudi Arabia, fans flocked to their screens and devices to catch the action. The closely-fought match between Manchester City and Al Hilal achieved significant market share across the Kingdom, with 77.9% of people watching television at the time of broadcast tuning in.

In Argentina, the match between Boca Juniors and Benfica was watched by more than 9.1 million people, representing an audience share of 84.2% — the highest in the country since the 2023 CONMEBOL Libertadores final.

Meanwhile, their cross-city rivals River Plate recorded an 87% share of the entire television audience during their game against Monterrey.

Home > Headlines > Spain To Fight  to Host 2030 World Cup Final

Spain will organize the World Cup 2030 alongside Morocco and Portugal.

Rabat – Rafael Louzan, President of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), seeks to secure the right to host the 2030 World Cup final.

He made his remarks in an interview with Marca, where he said that Spain “must aim” to host the final, which he believes could be the “best World Cup in history.”

Spain will organize the World Cup 2030 alongside Morocco and Portugal.

“We are facing a benchmark event. There will be three continents and six countries involved, with Spain in the lead,” he said. Speaking highly of the prestigious tournament, Louzan said that the World Cup is enormous as it will create 185,000 jobs, as well as modernizing infrastructure.

Louzan also commended the opportunity of “sharing the sage with Morocco,” according to Marca. He said that the event will allow Morocco to modernize not only sports facilities but also its communities.

“Spain will act as the engine for companies experienced in major events,” he said.

Louzan also spoke of the candidate cities, including those for the final match.  

“Valencia has strong chances because it will have the most modern stadium in Spanish football for that World Cup,” he said, adding that Spain is ready to provide up to 12 stadiums for the tournament.

Speaking on the final game of the potential host city, he acknowledged that “there is still a long way to go.”

“Spain will fight to host it,” he said. He added that shortlisted options include Madrid, Barcelona, and Morocco's Casablanca.

“Spain accounts for 55% f of the organization's weight and must aim to host the final of what I hope will be the best World Cup ever,” he added.

Morocco is also rallying to host major matches during the tournament, including the final.

Fouzi Lekjaa, President of Morocco's Football Federation (FRMF), refuted reports that Santiago Bernabeu was selected to host the final.

“Decisions related to the World Cup are not made by club presidents, but the organizing committees of the three countries in coordination with FIFA,” he said.

For Lekjaa, the press is free to publish what it wants.

“But what is certain, until now, is that Morocco, Spain, and Portugal have earned the honor of organizing this global event.”

Morocco is readying multiple complexes for the tournament, including the giant Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium that was inaugurated in a friendly game between Morocco and Niger on September 5.

Morocco also seeks to host the tournament's games in Fez Stadium, Marrakech Stadium, Ibn Battouta Stadium in Tangier, as well as in the Hassan II Stadium in Casablanca and Adrar Stadium in Agadir.

Hello! Ousmane Dembele is the best men's player in the world. This time last year, we'd never have said that.

On the way:

🏆 Dembele's Ballon d'Or glory

✍️ 145 FIFA complaints

Advertisement

🇫🇷 An actual French title race?

🚪 Monchi exits in fresh Villa unrest

Ousmane Dembele spent almost a decade carrying the reputation of a busted flush. He was an overpriced error when Barcelona paid £88million ($118.8m) to buy him from Borussia Dortmund in 2017. He was equally dubious value when PSG gave him a route out of Barca by signing him for £42m six years later.

Dembele differed from Aitana Bonmati, the recipient of the women's Ballon d'Or last night for the third year running. Bonmati has been the best player in the world consistently. Dembele landing the men's trophy yesterday wrong-footed most of us. It's a deserved award, no question — just not an award in any way foretold.

Take this stat, for instance: last season, when Dembele scored 35 goals during PSG's surge to the Ligue 1 title, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, it was the first time in nine years that he'd hit double figures in a league campaign. You had to go back to Rennes in 2016 to find the previous instance. Dembele, as Tom Williams recalls, aspired to Lionel Messi standards of dribbling rather than Messi standards of finishing. And truth be told, he didn't light fires on either front.

Even in 2024-25, when with blinkered hindsight it feels like PSG could do no wrong, he was an awkward fit for parts of it. Luis Enrique dropped him for a Champions League tie at Arsenal after Dembele pitched up late for training. He got it in the ear again after a red card against Bayern Munich. Luis Enrique called that dismissal a “serious mistake” — a phrase which defined the money spent on Dembele all over.

But then it clicked: the 28-year-old surging towards and beyond the 30-goal mark, with 27 of them materialising in 22 games. Football won't remember him as its top men's player per se — Lamine Yamal, who came second last night, should ultimately make greater waves — but in one mesmerising purple patch, Dembele definitely was.

Luis Enrique impact, change in position



For all Luis Enrique's sporadic criticism of the forward, he's a long-time Dembele enthusiast. Their periods at Barca didn't overlap — the former stepped down as head coach in the summer when the latter joined — but the Spaniard had been following him at Rennes, convinced the hype around Dembele was worth taking seriously.

Advertisement

At PSG, in 2023, Luis Enrique went out and bought him — for a modest return initially. Dembele churned out three whole league goals in 2023-24, but the revelation last season — the first campaign for PSG with no out-and-out superstar such as Messi, Kylian Mbappe or Neymar — was his insertion as a false nine, the deep-lying centre forward role made fashionable by Messi in his pomp.

As Dembele got on a spectacular roll, his club did, too. It was almost a clean sweep for PSG in Paris yesterday. Beyond the main prize, Luis Enrique was named coach of the year, PSG took the team of the year prize, and Gianluigi Donnarumma (since departed for Manchester City) picked up the Yashin Trophy as best goalkeeper. There was no arguing with any of it.

But Dembele it was who took centre stage and crowned a glorious renaissance. All it took was him finding the sweet spot of a coach who believed in him, a position that suited him, and the departure of superstars who were otherwise suffocating him. Nobody saw those stars aligning, and perhaps Dembele least of all.

🏆 We've got the full list of winners from the 2025 awards for you. It's a rare year when the men's top 30 looks just about right. And in Full Time, our women's soccer newsletter, Tamerra Griffin asks if Bonmati was actually Ballon d'Or-worthy.

While PSG killed it on stage in Paris, they could have done with Dembele and others elsewhere. A postponed trip to Marseille in Ligue 1 ended in a 1-0 loss, courtesy of Nayef Aguerd's scrappy header (above), tempting the division to think — and whisper this extremely quietly — that it might have a title race on its hands.

Luis Enrique's line-up fell well short of full strength, and it showed. Dembele is injured and several weeks short of a comeback (he streamed footage from Marseille at the Ballon d'Or ceremony). Desire Doue has fitness problems, too, and with Bradley Barcola also out, Achraf Hakimi pushed up into PSG's front three, embarking on a fruitless shift. Hakimi might be “more than a full-back”, as we once wrote, but he has some natural limits.

Ligue 1, therefore, looks like this: Monaco top by virtue of goals scored, level on 12 points with PSG, Lyon and Strasbourg. I'm not deluded; the cavalry will return for PSG soon enough, and they'll still win the league most likely. But what harm in clubs around them being made to feel like it's worth turning up?

When FIFA set up a portal for the submission of human rights complaints, it must have hoped the influx would not be huge. In actual fact, Adam Crafton discovered that no fewer than 145 compelled the world governing body to launch investigations in the aftermath of the Club World Cup.

The complaints related to a range of issues, from U.S. government enforcement and policies — many concerning controversial immigration laws — to the extreme weather that hampered the competition. Others concerned discrimination following an event in which FIFA abandoned plans for widespread anti-discrimination messaging.

FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, saw no evil over the summer, saying the Club World Cup passed without “one single incident”. If nothing else, at least the organisation now knows the invitation to the public to hold it to account will be accepted by more than a token few.

We're getting used to random celebrities appearing at random football games, so wrestler Bret ‘The Hitman' Hart sitting through Kaiserslautern versus Preussen Munster in Germany's second division last week was perfectly on trend.

I did laugh, though, at this question from a perplexed TV interviewer who collared the WWE hall of famer and, with no formalities, cut to the chase by asking: “Bret… what the hell are you doing here?”

Chelsea have made a shaky start to the season, winning 2 of their 6 games and with injury and fitness issues bubbling up already.

On the London is Blue podcast they discussed the issue, with presenter Dan Dormer pointing out that this was all very predictable – and perhaps even justified, given our performance at the Club World Cup.

“I'm not surprised that we're struggling at this moment,” he said.

“We didn't have a real preseason. We played later into the summer than any other team did. We did not necessarily buy a bunch of starters to come in and replace several of the players who had been playing a ton of football. Chelsea are behind in their conditioning and fitness relative to several other teams in the league. And you're seeing that in slower starts in games, and in starters needing to come in potentially at the end of a game to go and get a result.

“It's not necessarily a bad thing, considering what we did this summer, which was to go and win the Club World Cup. Not a lot of other teams in the world – none, in fact – are able to say that.”

While it's clear we didn't have a good preparation for the season and it could affect the rest of the campaign, at this stage we've played enough games that the players are all fit – in fact, some have played too much. We disagree that at this point we're significantly “behind” in conditioning – the problem will be later in the year when we're overplayed.

What's much more of a concern is what he says about our transfers – it's true that a lot of the players we bought are not “starter” quality.

That's fine in games like tonight's, where we face Lincoln, but becomes a problem in the Premier League when changing out team makes it weaker.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Fox News' CB Cotton reports the latest on the high-profile campaign for New York City mayor amid calls to narrow the field to Mamdani vs. Cuomo.

New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is once again calling for cheaper tickets to the World Cup. 

Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, appeared on the ""Pablo Torre Finds Out"" podcast last week, where he discussed the ticket prices for World Cup games in New York City, one of the host cities for the finals.

""What we're seeing is that FIFA's approach to the ticket process of the World Cup is both without precedent in their own administration of previous World Cups and is also an approach that will price out so many New Yorkers from actually being able to be in the stands,"" he said.

Mamdani, a self-professed fan of the Arsenal Football Club in England, noted that a ticket to the final game when the global soccer tournament was last in the United States in 1994 cost less than $200 in today's dollars.

""We are now, at face value, seeing tickets for more than $6,000,"" he said. ""It's absurd.""

Mamdani recently called for 15% of tickets to be set aside at discounted prices for residents and asked FIFA, soccer's governing body, to reverse a plan to set ticket prices based on demand.

Fox News Digital reached out to FIFA for comment but did not immediately hear back.

The World Cup will be played across 16 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. Eight matches, including the final, will be held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York.

FIFA's plan to adopt a dynamic pricing model has sparked backlash among some fans, The Associated Press previously reported.

Tickets will start at $60 for group-stage matches and increase to $6,730 for the final, officials said earlier this month. However, pricing could fluctuate under the demand-based pricing model.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

A group of United Nations experts called upon FIFA and UEFA on Tuesday to suspend Israel from international competition, arguing the action is a ""necessary response to address the ongoing genocide in the Occupied Palestinian Territory"" amid the Israel-Hamas War.

The experts said the suspension should target state teams rather than individual athletes to avoid discrimination based on nationality. Currently, Israel's men's national team is taking part in UEFA's World Cup qualification tournament ahead of the 2026 World Cup hosted in North America, while Maccabi Tel Aviv qualified for this season's edition of the UEFA Europa League and begin playing league phase games on Wednesday.

""Sports must reject the perception that it is business as usual,"" the experts said in a statement. ""Sporting bodies must not turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations, especially when their platforms are used to normalize injustices.""

The experts are advocating for a ban upon the conclusion of the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem and Israel, which wrapped up ahead of this week's United Nations General Assembly meetings in New York. FIFA and UEFA have both a moral and legal obligation to act, the experts argued, because of international human rights law that is in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

""They must fulfill their obligations not to provide aid or assistance that would help maintain the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,"" the experts said. ""We support the calls for action that aim to encourage the implementation of the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice and impose consequences on the State of Israel for breaching international law.""

Eight United Nations experts are cited in Tuesday's call to action: Alexandra Xanthaki, the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights; K.P. Ashwini, the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; Francesca Albanese, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967; and Pichamon Yeophantong (Chairperson), Damilola Olawuyi (Vice-Chairperson), Fernanda Hopenhaym, Lyra Jakulevičienė and Robert McCorquodale, Working Group on business and human rights.

The UN experts are the latest to call upon FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel because of their conduct during the Israel-Hamas War, which would not mark the first time a country received such punishment. Both FIFA and UEFA suspended Russia in February 2022 following the country's invasion of Ukraine, with Russian teams still ineligible for international competition. In February of this year, meanwhile, FIFA banned the Congolese Football Federation for third-party interference in its operations and the Pakistan Football Federation for its inability to adopt a revision to its constitution that would enable ""truly fair and democratic elections.""

FIFA has fielded multiple requests to suspend Israel from international competition over the years, most notably when the Palestinian Football Association did so at the annual FIFA Congress in May 2024, the first such meeting since the Israel-Hamas War began in October 2023. The organization said at the time it would seek independent legal advice and in October 2024, FIFA announced the start of two investigations. One will focus on the PFA's accusation of discrimination by the Israel Football Association and the other will look into the claim that Israeli teams operate in land that belongs to Palestine.

UEFA's executive council next meets on Dec. 3 in Nyon, Switzerland, while the next meeting of the FIFA Congress will be on April 30, 2026 in Vancouver, Canada.,

The Gaza Health Ministry says at least 65,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war, according to CBS News, though did not say how many were civilians or combatants. The United Nations considers the Health Ministry's figures as the most reliable estimate of casualties during the war.

A nation could miss the 2026 World Cup if FIFA decides to sanction them for a major infraction. 

Next summer's World Cup will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

The main host country of the matches is USA, with New Jersey's MetLife Stadium set to stage the final - while Canada and Mexico will be the auxiliary hosts.

Nations across the world are in the process of qualifying for the tournament that begins on June 11, 2026.

Advert

Among the countries looking to book their spot in the competition is South Africa, who have not appeared at a men's World Cup since they hosted the tournament in 2010.

As things stand, South Africa are top of Group C in the African qualification phase after eight games with two left to play - against Rwanda and Zimbabwe.

South Africa have 17 points on the board, three points clear of second-placed Benin and six clear of Nigeria and Rwanda, who both have 11 points.

Advert

In total, there are nine African qualification groups, with the winner of each one automatically qualifying for the World Cup.

And only the four best second-placed nations get a chance to enter a play-off round, with only one additional nation securing a place at the tournament.

So, finishing top is crucial.

Despite South Africa sitting at the top of Group C, their hopes to qualify for the World Cup has suddenly become perilous.

Advert

According to The Athletic, South Africa fielded an ineligible player by fielding Teboho Mokoena in their 2-0 win over Lesotho in a group stage qualifier in March.

Per the report, the midfielder was not permitted to play because he received two yellow cards previously in qualification, which equals an automatic one-match suspension - with Equatorial Guinea falling foul of FIFA regulations.

South Africa Football Association (SAFA) chief executive Lydia Monyepao said that they had received correspondence from FIFA on the matter.

Advert

""We are preparing our response to the FIFA disciplinary committee because that is what ultimately is required from us as an association,"" she said.

South Arica could be hit with a 3-0 loss if they are punished by FIFA.

Its disciplinary code says: ""If a team fields a player who is not eligible to participate (due to suspension, registration issues, nationality, etc.), the match is automatically forfeited. The default result is a 3-0 loss, unless the actual result was even more disadvantageous to the offending team.""

If FIFA imposed the 3-0 forfeit, then it would throw Group C wide open.

Advert

South Africa would be level on points with Benin if they were sanctioned by FIFA.

They resume their qualifying campaign next month when they face Zimbabwe.","{'href': 'https://www.sportbible.com', 'title': 'SPORTbible'}","soccer"

WSB Now



ATLANTA — We got our first look in March at the poster that will attract fans to Atlanta for the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Channel 2's Jorge Estevez got a closer look at the poster with the artist, Jose Hadathy, who is also Atlanta United's design manager.

Channel 2 is also celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month with a look at the inspiration behind the team's Somos Atlanta clothing collection.

The Somos Atlanta collection continues to foster a sense of community and cultural pride among Atlanta United fans, offering them a way to celebrate their heritage and the city's diversity through fashion.

“Making clothing has always been a passion of mine as well, making something that fans can not only see, but hold, wear, kind of represent in their daily lives. And so I get to do that now for the club,“ Hadathy said.

The collection's highlight piece, which is debuting this month, incorporates indigenous symbols and geometric patterns. Hadathy explained that he was inspired by these patterns and thought, “Could I make letters out of this?” which resulted in a unique design.

”And the idea is Somos Atlanta is inclusive. So obviously if you're Hispanic, Latino, you feel a part of Atlanta, but it can include anyone. You know, we wanna celebrate the whole city,” he said.

The annual Somos Atlanta collection allows fans to connect with the club and the city through wearable art. Hadathy expressed his excitement about seeing people wear his designs.

“When you see people wearing this in the stadium or in the city, it's incredible,” he said. “What you wear is the ultimate representation of who you are initially, and so for people to wear your designs is a huge compliment.”

Atlanta is one of 11 North American cities that will host the World Cup next year.

As the Uruguayan great's production has declined, he will have a tough decision to make when his contract expires in November

There is a TV segment in which Jamie Carragher is outlining the faults of Casemiro at Manchester United. The former Liverpool center back offers his analysis, picks at the Brazilian's faults, and then ends it with a phrase that has since become part of soccer canon: 

""Leave the football before the football leaves you. The football has left him, at this level."" 

Carragher wasn't wrong about Casemiro. And his words have since become prophetic elsewhere. Numerous others, in the Premier League and across the world, have left the game gracefully, stepped away at the right moment. 

Inter Miami's Luis Suarez is right in that danger zone. The Uruguayan has seen his form dip this season, and in a mixture of both controversy and failing knees, the once great South American is truly starting to show his age. There was, perhaps a year ago, a certain charm to Suarez's aging legs. He was squeezing every last ounce of footballing juice out of those feet - which still have a little magic in them. 

But as he returns from a suspension stemming from a silly incident following the Leagues Cup final, his future remains something of a question. The football might be leaving Suarez, and with the season winding down, his presence for Inter Miami - at least in the long term - is up for debate.

Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler captured their second title of the season on Tuesday at the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open.

The top seeds moved past Nicolas Barrientos and David Pel 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match, during which they saved the only break point they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. With their victory, Cabral and Miedler improved to 22-11 as a team after making their debut in Marrakech in April this year.

“Thanks for another great week. We've been doing great things,” Cabral said to his team. “I'm very, very happy about our second title, and there are still a few tournaments to go until the end of the year, so we're just happy to get the chance to play again in Tokyo next week.”

By claiming his fourth tour-level title, Cabral tied Joao Sousa (4 in singles) for most ATP Tour trophies by a Portuguese man in the Open Era. Cabral and Miedler are up three spots to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.

After making their team debut in Gstaad in July, the German-Dutch duo is now 8-3 at tour-level. They saved two match points in their first-round clash against Rohan Bopanna and Takeru Yuzuki before sealing their championship-match victory in 78 minutes.

“Thank you Robin for playing with me, for picking up the phone two weeks ago,” Frantzen, who captured his first tour-level title, said to Haase. “I'm very happy that I called you. It's my first title and I'm very happy to do it here in Chengdu.”

The 38-year-old Haase, now a 10-time ATP Tour doubles champion, is the second-oldest Chengdu champion after 40-year-old Jonathan Erlich in 2017.

The Chilean qualifier saved two championship points on serve at 5-6 in the third set and then rallied from 1/4 in the deciding-set tie-break to become the second-lowest-ranked ATP Tour champion this season.

“I just had to stay there mentally and physically,” Tabilo said. “I was so happy to make those first serves on match points. It was an incredible effort from the team also. It has been a long two weeks and I am just so happy.”

Tabilo lost his opening six matches of the year and missed two months of the European clay swing due to a wrist injury. Arriving in Chengdu with a 5-13 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Tabilo found his best level to triumph at the ATP 250 event.



In a tight final against Musetti, Tabilo struck eight fewer winners (29-37) and committed 21 more unforced errors (44-23) than the Italian, but found the bigger shots down the home straight to record victory after two hours and 37 minutes in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

Musetti was aiming to capture his first tour-level title since Naples in 2022, but failed to convert his opportunities in the third set. Tabilo saved the first match point with a forehand winner and the second when Musetti hit long off a rally ball. Tabilo sealed victory on his first match point, with his girlfriend and team rushing onto court after he sealed his third Top 10 win.

Tabilo is now a three-time tour-level titlist, having won in Auckland and Mallorca last year. He is up 40 spots to No. 72 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to return to the Top 100 for the first time since June.

Musetti leaves Chengdu up one spot in seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The Italian is aiming to make his debut on home soil at the Nitto ATP Finals in November and join countryman Jannik Sinner, who has already qualified for the prestigious year-end event.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Tennis world farewells Niki Pilic","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/niki-pilic-2025-obituary","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 18:54:42 GMT","

Nikola Pilic, who has passed away Monday in Rijeka aged 86, left an indelible mark on the tennis world as a player, coach, captain and tournament director.


Such is Pilic's legacy that there will be those today who remember the high point of his playing career as a 1973 Roland Garros finalist, at a time when Pilic found himself into the middle of a sporting and political storm resulting in the Wimbledon boycott, one month later.


Or the cherished memories as a Davis Cup winning captain for Germany, Croatia and Serbia; his role as a long-time Tournament Director and reformer, which has helped future generations, or as a mentor and coach to the likes of Boris Becker, Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic, and his influence in the development of a young Novak Djokovic, now a 24-time Grand Slam champion.


ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Niki Pilic, a true pioneer of our sport. His contributions across many roles left a lasting impact on players, fans and the game itself, and hold particular significance in the history of the ATP. He will be greatly missed. On behalf of the ATP, we extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones.”

Pilic achieved so much across eight decades. It wasn't until Pilic was 13 years old, in the summer of 1952, that he started to play tennis: first at the Firule club, then between his studies in shipbuilding and later government administration. Within four years, he represented Yugoslavia's junior team and claimed five national singles and seven doubles titles with a big serve and forehand that became feared weapons.

In a playing career, bridging the amateur and Open eras, Pilic was world-class, reaching the 1962 Wimbledon doubles final with Boro Jovanovic, beating Roy Emerson en route to the 1967 semi-finals at the All-England Club. As the sport went open to amateur and professional players, Pilic joined the ‘Handsome Eight' of Lamar Hunt's group, World Championship Tennis (WCT), in 1968, alongside Dennis Ralston, John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Cliff Drysdale, Earl Buchholz, Roger Taylor and Pierre Barthes. The tall left-hander also teamed up with Barthes for the 1970 US Open doubles title (d. Emerson/Laver).

Yet in May 1973, Pilic and the right of all players to choose where and when they competed came to a head, when the Yugoslav Tennis Federation suspended Pilic for nine months for failing to play in a Davis Cup match against New Zealand in Zagreb.

Just as Pilic stepped off court at Roland Garros, having finished runner-up to Ilie Nastase in the final, it was announced that the International Tennis Federation had upheld the suspension. An emergency meeting reduced the suspension to one month, taking in the Italian and German Opens, and the first week of Wimbledon.

In the build up to The Championships, it was clear that the Association of Tennis Professionals' attempt, as British journalist David Gray wrote, to “assert Pilic's liberty of action by seeking an injunction to restrain the All-England Club and the ITF from barring him,” may fail. It did.

Compromises were suggested, but ultimately 81 male players voted to withdraw from Wimbledon, as the membership of ATP, formed only in September 1972, wanted a more professional approach to the organisation of the tournament circuit. It was the making of the player-led Association of Tennis Professionals, which would later join forces with tournament directors in 1990 to form the ATP Tour.

Stan Smith, the 1972 Wimbledon champion and early ATP President, told ATPTour.com, “Obviously he was the trigger point for the boycott at Wimbledon. We felt as a fledgling ATP that players should be able to play where they want, when they want. We backed him not because of who he was, but because he was a member of our association, who was not being allowed to play for what we felt was not a good reason.”

Having retired from competition, Pilic became a coach, helping guide Germany to three Davis Cup trophies in 1988, 1989 and 1993. He was also on hand as captain for Croatia and Serbia in their respective 2005 and 2010 title-winning runs.

""Niki was a very talented player, with his serve and forehand being great weapons,” Smith said. “He was also a good thinker and he came close to winning some big tournaments.

""Off the court, he had an opinion on about almost any subject and seemed to have experience and knowledge in many areas. I was on an airplane with him one time and he said that the engine didn't sound normal and that this could be dangerous. I asked him what he knew about airplanes and he said, 'I know these engines'.""
Cliff Drysdale, a founding member and President of the ATP, remembers Pilic fondly. ""Niki was a friend and I found him to be one of the most interesting players on tour to talk to. He was smart, well-read and a man of principle. In one of the discussions we had that I scoffed at he said that Yugoslavia would fall apart. He proved to be right.  
""He was part of the Handsome Eight and was very much a part of the early creation of the ATP. The Wimbledon walkout was a catalyst that turned us from a bunch of guys running around like chickens with our heads cut off to a solidified ATP. 
""The boycott was never about the money. It was about Niki's ability to play Wimbledon because he was qualified to play.""

Pilic operated a tennis academy in Oberschleißheim near Munich, establishing a strong reputation for discipline and his tactical insight, which helped him as a talented player. In 1999, Djokovic's first coach, Jelena Gencic, sent her 12-year-old pupil to train there for three months.

Pilic married Serbian actress Mija Adamovic. Five years ago, he was awarded the Golden Medal of Merits of Republic of Serbia.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Can Alcaraz join elite list of champions on Tokyo debut?","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-tokyo-2025-debut-feature","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 07:17:49 GMT","

 There has been no shortage of iconic winners throughout the history of the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships. 

 Of the 29 No. 1s in PIF ATP Rankings history, 12 have lifted the trophy at the Tokyo hard-court event since it was first held in 1972. Five members of the ATP No. 1 Club — Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — triumphed at least once in the Japanese capital while competing as World No. 1. 

 Recently returned to top spot following his US Open triumph, Carlos Alcaraz will this year aim to join that stacked list when he makes his Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships debut. Ahead of the 2025 edition of the ATP 500, ATPTour.com reflects on the No. 1s that have gone all the way in Tokyo.

 Record Holder Edberg 
No man has had more success on the hard courts of Tokyo than Stefan Edberg. The Swede racked up a record four titles and 27 match wins across six appearances at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships. After his victories in 1987, 1989 and 1990, Edberg competed as World No. 1 in Japan for the first time in 1991, and he lived up to his newfound status with another commanding run to the trophy. 

 The then-25-year-old Edberg defeated two fellow members of the ATP No. 1 Club in three sets — Jimmy Connors (in the third round) and Ivan Lendl (in the final) — to clinch his fourth and final Tokyo crown. He also overcame Michael Stich and Michael Chang in straight sets en route to becoming the first reigning No. 1 to win the title in tournament history. 

 Sampras Takes Over 
Tokyo holds a special place in Pete Sampras' career. In 1993, the American's maiden title run in Japan sealed his rise to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. Sampras made just two other appearances at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, in 1994 and 1996, both as World No. 1. He lifted the trophy each time and remains the only man to have won the Tokyo event twice while atop the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Sampras defeated a fellow American in each of his three Tokyo finals. In 1993 he downed Brad Gilbert to ensure he would become World No. 1 the next day, 12 April. A year later, Sampras defended his title by sinking then-No. 9 Michael Chang, while in 1996 he saw off Richey Reneberg in the championship match to close his Tokyo career with a perfect 15-0 record.

 Federer's Tokyo Moment 
Federer may have only made one appearance in Tokyo, but the Swiss icon certainly made the most of his time in the Japanese capital in 2006. He dropped just one set — to Japanese wild card Takao Suzuki in the quarter-finals — en route to his ninth title of a standout year. 

 Competing in the heart of his still-record 237 consecutive weeks as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Federer eased past Tim Henman in the championship match to seal the trophy. It was the last of 13 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings between the two players, and Federer's Tokyo triumph ensured he held a 7-6 lead when Henman retired in late 2007.

Rafa Reigns 
Like his great rival Federer, Nadal made quite an impact upon arriving for his maiden Tokyo campaign as World No. 1. The Spaniard lit up the 2010 edition of the ATP 500 with a series of commanding performances and he began by downing Go Soeda, Milos Raonic and Santiago Giraldo in straight sets. 

 His semi-final against Viktor Troicki was a different story. Nadal was forced to save two match points in the third-set tie-break before escaping with a 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(7) triumph. That proved to be the lefty's biggest hurdle that week in Tokyo, where he subsequently eased past Gael Monfils 6-1, 7-5 to claim the trophy. A year later, the then-No. 2-ranked Nadal again reached the championship match, where he fell to Andy Murray, in what would prove to be his final Tokyo appearance.

 Djokovic Shines 
Djokovic ensured that each member of the ‘Big Three' triumphed on Tokyo debut with an imperious run in 2019. The Serbian World No. 1 only dropped more than four games in a set once across five matches in Japan to bounce back impressively from the shoulder injury that had forced him to withdraw during his fourth-round match at the US Open a month earlier. 

 Quickly acclimatising to conditions at the Ariake Coliseum, Djokovic motored past Alexei Popyrin, Soeda, Lucas Pouille, David Goffin and John Millman to claim his Tokyo title.

 Can Carlos Join The Club? 
Could Alcaraz be the sixth reigning World No. 1 to triumph in Tokyo? The Spaniard will certainly arrive in good shape. He is 23-4 for the season on outdoor hard courts, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, although he will be wary of a strong cast of rivals in Japan that includes former champion Taylor Fritz as well as Holger Rune, Casper Ruud and Frances Tiafoe.

Jannik Sinner will face Marin Cilic at the China Open in his first appearance since his US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. The top-seeded Italian leads the field in Beijing and learned his fate following Tuesday's draw.

Sinner has fond memories at the ATP 500 hard-court event, having lifted the trophy in 2023. The 24-year-old, 37-5 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, will meet 2011 finalist Cilic in his opener and could play home wild card Zhang Zhizhen in the second round.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Scouting Report: Alcaraz, Fritz lead Tokyo; Sinner, Zverev headline Beijing","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/beijing-tokyo-2025-scouting-report","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 07:31:32 GMT","

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are among the sport's biggest stars who are in action this week. 

The Spaniard leads the field at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, where Taylor Fritz is seeded second in Tokyo. Sinner returns to the China Open in Beijing, where five Top-10 players are set to compete, including Alexander Zverev.

The two ATP 500 events also serve as a pivotal period for Nitto ATP Finals hopefuls seeking to amass as many PIF ATP Ranking points as possible, with aspirations of qualifying for the season finale in Turin.

ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event:

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN TOKYO:
1) Alcaraz makes event debut: Tokyo, the longest-running ATP Tour tournament in Asia, will welcome the World No. 1 Alcaraz for the first time. The winner of seven titles this year, Alcaraz boasts a season-leading 61-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He will look to strengthen his claim as World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, a position he reclaimed following his US Open triumph.

2) Former champ Fritz: The American holds fond memories in Tokyo, where in 2022 he secured his Top 10 debut following a title run in Japan's capital city. Now World No. 5, Fritz is bidding for his third title of 2025 (Stuttgart, Eastbourne), which would match his career-best title haul in a year, tying his 2022 season.




3) Turin outsiders: With less than two months until the Nitto ATP Finals, every week is extraordinarily crucial for those outside the top eight in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin vying for a spot at the prestigious tournament. For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event.
4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively. Each of those players, besides Tiafoe, have won at least one title this season and seek to add to their trophy cabinet in Tokyo. Shapovalov, who won the ATP 500 in Dallas and Acapulco, is competing for the first time since marrying longtime partner Mirjam Bjorklund.
5) Top seeds Harrison/King seek third ATP 500 crown this year: At eighth in the PIF Live Doubles Race To Turin, Christian Harrison and Evan King are seeking a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, a prize that would reward their dream season. At the ATP 500s in Dallas and Acapulco, the Americans advanced through qualifying en route to lifting the trophy. But gone is the role of underdog, Harrison and King are the Tokyo top seeds.

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BEIJING:
1) Sinner returns, seeking third title of 2025: In action for the first time since his runner-up finish at the US Open, Sinner is back in Beijing for the third consecutive year, amassing a 9-1 record in his previous two outings. Last year, the Italian narrowly fell to rival Alcaraz in one of the most memorable matches of the 2024 season. Sinner will aim to go one step further and return to the winner's circle, which he reached in 2023.
2) Three-time semi-finalist Zverev: The German is making his sixth appearance in Beijing and just his second since 2020. Zverev has routinely gone deep in those outings, including three semi-final runs. The second seed leads Sinner 4-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and could have another showdown with the Italian in the championship match.

3) Top 10 stars: The Beijing field is stacked with five Top-10 players, including Sinner, Zverev, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov. De Minaur was a quarter-finalist at the season's final major. Musetti arrives after a strong start to the Asian hard-court swing in Chengdu. Khachanov, No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is closing in on tying his career-high No. 8, which he reached in July 2019.
4) Fan favourites Rublev, Medvedev and Bublik: Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev are among the seeded players at the ATP 500. Rublev, a two-time quarter-finalist in Beijing, won an ATP 500 hard-court title earlier this year in Doha. Medvedev reached the Beijing final in 2023 and semi-finals last year. Ahead of Hangzhou, Medvedev shared that he is working with a new team, consisting of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. Alexander Bublik is also in Beijing. The Kazakh has been one of the most in-form players the past three months, arriving in Beijing following his Hangzhou run.

2) Former champ Fritz: The American holds fond memories in Tokyo, where in 2022 he secured his Top 10 debut following a title run in Japan's capital city. Now World No. 5, Fritz is bidding for his third title of 2025 (Stuttgart, Eastbourne), which would match his career-best title haul in a year, tying his 2022 season.






3) Turin outsiders: With less than two months until the Nitto ATP Finals, every week is extraordinarily crucial for those outside the top eight in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin vying for a spot at the prestigious tournament. For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event.
4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively. Each of those players, besides Tiafoe, have won at least one title this season and seek to add to their trophy cabinet in Tokyo. Shapovalov, who won the ATP 500 in Dallas and Acapulco, is competing for the first time since marrying longtime partner Mirjam Bjorklund.
5) Top seeds Harrison/King seek third ATP 500 crown this year: At eighth in the PIF Live Doubles Race To Turin, Christian Harrison and Evan King are seeking a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, a prize that would reward their dream season. At the ATP 500s in Dallas and Acapulco, the Americans advanced through qualifying en route to lifting the trophy. But gone is the role of underdog, Harrison and King are the Tokyo top seeds.

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BEIJING:
1) Sinner returns, seeking third title of 2025: In action for the first time since his runner-up finish at the US Open, Sinner is back in Beijing for the third consecutive year, amassing a 9-1 record in his previous two outings. Last year, the Italian narrowly fell to rival Alcaraz in one of the most memorable matches of the 2024 season. Sinner will aim to go one step further and return to the winner's circle, which he reached in 2023.
2) Three-time semi-finalist Zverev: The German is making his sixth appearance in Beijing and just his second since 2020. Zverev has routinely gone deep in those outings, including three semi-final runs. The second seed leads Sinner 4-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and could have another showdown with the Italian in the championship match.

3) Top 10 stars: The Beijing field is stacked with five Top-10 players, including Sinner, Zverev, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov. De Minaur was a quarter-finalist at the season's final major. Musetti arrives after a strong start to the Asian hard-court swing in Chengdu. Khachanov, No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is closing in on tying his career-high No. 8, which he reached in July 2019.
4) Fan favourites Rublev, Medvedev and Bublik: Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev are among the seeded players at the ATP 500. Rublev, a two-time quarter-finalist in Beijing, won an ATP 500 hard-court title earlier this year in Doha. Medvedev reached the Beijing final in 2023 and semi-finals last year. Ahead of Hangzhou, Medvedev shared that he is working with a new team, consisting of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. Alexander Bublik is also in Beijing.

Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.

Note: No. 11 seed Elina Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into Svitolina's position as the No. 33 seed. Bianca Andreescu, Linette's original first-round opponent, will now face qualifier Anna Bondar.

The draw for the China Open, the ninth WTA 1000 event of 2025, is out. Iga Swiatek, fresh off her third title of the year in Seoul, is the No. 1 seed, while defending champion Coco Gauff is No. 2. Another key storyline will be the return to action of hometown hero Zheng Qinwen, playing her first tournament since undergoing right elbow surgery in July.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Zheng, the No. 7 seed, has not competed since her first-round exit at Wimbledon to Katerina Siniakova. She will open against either Suzan Lamens, a quarterfinalist last week in Seoul, or compatriot Wang Yafan. Her section of the draw doesn't get any easier from there: the 22-year-old is projected to face No. 26 seed Linda Noskova in the third round. Potential fourth-round opponents include No. 10 seed Clara Tauson, Montreal champion and No. 21 seed Victoria Mboko and Siniakova.

The 32 seeded players all have first-round byes. Swiatek will start against either Yulia Putintseva or wild card Yuan Yue, while Gauff will face either Kamilla Rakhimova or Lucia Bronzetti.

Two former major champions are unseeded threats in the draw as they also make their way back from injury layoffs. Barbora Krejcikova takes on Anna Blinkova in her opener, with the winner to play Seoul finalist and No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova. Meanwhile, Bianca Andreescu returns to action for the first time since injuring her ankle in Montreal a month ago. The Canadian faces a qualifier or lucky loser, with No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova awaiting the winner.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys joined US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on the sidelines, withdrawing from the tournament on Monday due to injury.

Projected fourth-round matchups

[1] Iga Swiatek vs. [16] Emma Navarro[12] Naomi Osaka vs. [5] Jessica Pegula[4] Mirra Andreeva vs. [14] Daria Kasatkina[10] Clara Tauson vs. [7] Zheng Qinwen[6] Jasmine Paolini vs. [24] Veronika Kudermetova[13] Karolina Muchova vs. [3] Amanda Anisimova[8] Elena Rybakina vs. [9] Ekaterina Alexandrova[15] Belinda Bencic vs. [2] Coco Gauff

Here's how the draw breaks down by quarter:

First quarter

Swiatek is projected to face No. 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round, No. 16 seed Emma Navarro in the fourth round and No. 5 seed Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals. The Pole is one of three former champions in the draw, and is bidding to reclaim the title she previously won in 2023. The player she defeated in that year's final, No. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova, is another potential last-16 opponent.

Pegula's section is one of the most intriguing in the draw. She is projected to meet No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu, who will be making her tournament debut, in the third round; she currently owns a 2-1 head-to-head lead over the Briton, including 2-0 on hard courts. Whoever emerges from that tussle could face either 2019 champion Naomi Osaka, the No. 12 seed, or No. 23 seed Marta Kostyuk in the last 16. Osaka has been resurgent over the past two months, reaching the Montreal final and US Open semifinals to rocket back into the Top 20.

First-round matches to watch: Ann Li vs. Camila Osorio, Rebecca Sramkova vs. Elena-Gabriela Ruse, [Q] Aliaksandra Sasnovich vs. [Q] Janice Tjen, Magdalena Frech vs. [Q] Ella Seidel

Second quarter

After winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva solidified her Top 5 status by compiling a 31-8 record this year through Roland Garros. Since then, the 18-year-old's results have been quieter: she's 7-5 since Roland Garros, and just 2-2 since Wimbledon. The No. 4 seed in Beijing, where she was a quarterfinalist last year, Andreeva will open against either qualifier Moyuka Uchijima or wild card Zhu Lin. She'll have to navigate a section that includes big-hitting No. 29 seed Dayana Yastremska in a potential third round.

In the last 16, Andreeva could face either No. 14 seed Daria Kasatkina or her regular doubles partner, No. 17 seed Diana Shnaider -- two more players in need of a deep run at the close of the season, given their respective season records of 19-21 and 24-21. Shnaider could face a tricky opener against fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint, who made her first career WTA 500 semifinal last week in Seoul. The Australian teenager opens against qualifier Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva in a rematch from the US Open first round, which Joint won in two tight sets.

Zheng has a mixed record against the young talents in her section. She's 2-0 against Noskova, but has yet to defeat Tauson in two meetings -- once in juniors and once in pros. Meanwhile, Mboko joins Raducanu as a player who is making her debut in Beijing as a seed. This time last year, the 19-year-old Canadian was ranked No. 356; now, she's a WTA 1000 champion on the verge of the Top 20. Mboko will bid to notch her first win since lifting the Montreal trophy against either Siniakova or Anastasia Potapova.

First-round matches to watch: Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. Jaqueline Cristian, [Q] Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva vs. Maya Joint, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [WC] Wei Sijia, Katerina Siniakova vs. Anastasia Potapova, Suzan Lamens vs. [SR] Wang Yafan

Third quarter

Fresh off leading Italy to a successful defense of their Billie Jean King Cup title last week, No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini enters Beijing on a high. She could face a tricky opponent off the bat, though -- 2018 runner-up Anastasija Sevastova, whom she barely escaped in three sets at Wimbledon. Sevastova's ranking is still down at No. 221, but since returning from an ACL injury in April the Latvian has already scored wins over Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko. She'll need to defeat Kimberly Birrell in the first round to set up a rematch against Paolini.

Paolini's route doesn't get any easier after that. She's projected to face No. 27 seed Sofia Kenin -- against whom she has yet to win a set in three meetings -- in the third round. Kenin is searching for some form -- the 2020 Australian Open champion hasn't won back-to-back main-draw matches since Roland Garros -- but throughout her career has a track record of hitting her hot streaks with little warning.

In the last 16, Paolini could resume her rivalry with No. 11 Elina Svitolina -- a matchup that has provided some thrilling contests this year. Svitolina got the better of Paolini twice on the Grand Slam stage in three-setters at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, but Paolini managed to notch her first win in the series last week at the Billie Jean King Cup. To get there, Svitolina will have to navigate a section that contains Andreescu, Veronika Kudermetova and Tatjana Maria.

(Note: Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into her position as the No. 33 seed. No. 24 seed Kudermetova is now projected to meet Paolini in the fourth round.)

The third quarter is led by No. 3 seed Amanda Anisimova, competing for the first time since reaching her second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open. The American will play her first match as a Top 5 player against either Hailey Baptiste or Katie Boulter, and is projected to face home favorite and No. 31 seed Wang Xinyu in the third round.

A potential fourth-round meeting between Anisimova and No. 13 seed Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up, could make for a fascinating stylistic clash. The pair have only played once previously, with Anisimova advancing via retirement at Roland Garros 2022.

First-round matches to watch: [Q] Anna Bondar vs. Bianca Andreescu, Tatjana Maria vs. Marie Bouzkova, [Q] Anastasia Zakharova vs. [WC] Zhang Shuai, Katie Boulter vs. Hailey Baptiste

Fourth quarter

Gauff's up-and-down form in 2025 has seen the American at her gritty best during the clay swing, which culminated in her second major title at Roland Garros -- but also fail to reach a final on any other surface, with her service yips returning to afflict her during the North American hard court swing. She's projected to face No. 25 seed Leylah Fernandez, whom she has a 2-0 head-to-head lead over, in the third round. In the last 16, Gauff could then meet either No. 15 seed Belinda Bencic or No. 22 seed Jelena Ostapenko, both of whom have also struggled for form in recent months after standout results earlier in 2025. Since reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, Bencic's record is just 2-3, while Ostapenko has won just three out of nine matches since Roland Garros.

No. 8 seed Elena Rybakina has landed in a section full of dangerous opponents. The big-serving Kazakhstani will have to be prepared to take on a barrage of variety in her opener against either Wimbledon quarterfinalist Laura Siegemund or Caty McNally, two players with net-rushing instincts and every shot in the book. Rybakina is 6-1 overall against Siegemund, but was forced to retire in her only previous meeting with McNally.

In the third round, Rybakina is projected to face Iva Jovic, the 17-year-old who was ranked outside the Top 100 in June but who has surged into the No. 32 seed spot here after capturing her first WTA title in Guadalajara two weeks ago. Despite Jovic's inexperience -- Beijing will be just her 11th tour-level event -- this is already a familiar matchup for her; Rybakina defeated her in straight sets at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year.

Two-time major champion Krejcikova's return from a back injury this year has been riveting to watch -- not least due to the number of unlikely comebacks the Czech has pulled off. Since June, she's won from match points down on four separate occasions, the latest of those being an escape from 6-4, 5-2 down against Raducanu last week in Seoul. If Krejcikova's second-round clash against Alexandrova happens, it could be one to circle; with a 41-20 record so far, Alexandrova is quietly putting together a career-best season, and the 30-year-old could be eyeing a Top 10 debut in the closing two months. Alexandrova has a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Krejcikova, though they have not played since 2021.

Whoever emerges from that match could have to face either No. 20 seed Elise Mertens or McCartney Kessler -- both two-time titlists this year -- in order to reach a potential last-16 meeting with Rybakina.

First-round matches to watch: Laura Siegemund vs. Caty McNally, Barbora Krejcikova vs. Anna Blinkova, Ashlyn Krueger vs. Maria Sakkari

Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The Rolex Shanghai Masters announced Tuesday that four-time champion Novak Djokovic would make his 14th main-draw appearance at the Masters 1000 event.For Djokovic, Shanghai will mark the 24-time Grand Slam champion's first tournament since the 2025 US Open, where he lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz.Djokovic discussed the potential benefits of playing more Masters 1000 tournaments following his Flushing Meadows defeat to Alcaraz, having lost to both Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner in his last three Grand Slam outings.

“I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three, I guess, one-week tournaments or the Masters tournaments, where you have almost two weeks with quite a few days between matches,” the 38-year-old said earlier this month. “So, you know, that could serve me better in the matchups against them.”The remarks were quite the turnaround from statements made at the start of the tournament. Indeed, the former world No. 1 had begun the US Open by reaffirming his intent to mainly enter Grand Slam tournaments, saying, “To be quite frank with you, I don't enjoy the two-week Masters events anymore. It's just way too long for me” during his pre-tournament Media Day press conference.

Currently ranked third in the PIF ATP Race to Turin, Djokovic had not committed to playing any tournaments beyond an ATP 250 event in Athens, which had relocated from Belgrade, Serbia.Djokovic last competed in Shanghai in 2024, where he reached the final and finished runner-up to then-top-ranked Jannik Sinner.

Over the past few years Wilson has really stepped up its apparel game with pieces like the Winning Onesie. It takes the classic tennis dress and injects a little modern flair and a lot of performance. The compressive stretch fabric flatters while still having enough give for unrestricted movement. Perforations throughout—as well as cutouts in lower back and a half-zip front—promote breathability and helps the moisture-wicking material dry even faster. There's even a pocket on the built-in liner underneath the removable skirt for ball or valuables storage. Mboko is wearing Infrared, and it also comes in Black.Shoes: Wilson Intrigue Tour ($158)Designed with input from fellow Wilson endorser, Marta Kostyuk, the Intrigue Tour is the brand's first female-specific shoe. That means a last constructed to suit the higher arch, narrower heel and wider toes that are more common in a woman's foot.In addition, three primary innovations give the shoe its high-performance chops. To keep it fast and responsive, a single layer of UltraShield mesh is used in the upper to provide support and breathability without adding bulk. The SwiftStep sockliner offers extra cushioning, lateral stability and comfort. And the FootFrame in the midfoot uses an integrated lacing system and internal support cage to create an adaptive fit and maximum lockdown.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Valtteri Bottas was on standby for Mercedes at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix as George Russell battled through illness.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff has admitted that it was at one stage “touch and go” regarding George Russell's participation in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with the Briton feeling unwell as the event got under way.

Russell skipped Thursday's media duties at the Baku City Circuit after coming down with 'flu and was heard nursing a particularly hoarse voice over the radio during Friday's pair of practice sessions.

While he battled through to reach Q3 in Qualifying and then finish a fine second in the race, Mercedes reserve driver – and future Cadillac racer – Valtteri Bottas was on standby to replace Russell if needed.

Wolff, having joked that “'flu does good for you” in a congratulatory radio message to Russell, explained during his Sunday press briefing just how ill his driver was at the start of the weekend.

Reflecting on Russell's performance, Wolff said: “Very impressive, considering that on Friday morning it was touch and go whether Valtteri would be in the car.

“It was George himself that said, ‘I'm not sure I can do it'. Then he recovered a little bit in the morning and decided to be in the car, and then every day he went strong.

“Doing a one-and-a-half-hour race here in Baku, not putting a single foot wrong on both tyres, that was a super merited P2.”

Wolff was also encouraged by an improved display from rookie driver Kimi Antonelli, who pipped Russell to fourth in Qualifying and came home in that position on race day.

“It was a really good rebound after Monza,” said Wolff. “He had such a difficult spell with the European races and, coming in here with a solid P4, running in the front group, that's something to continue to build on and consolidate.”

Asked what he had discussed with Antonelli after calling the youngster's performance at the Italian Grand Prix “underwhelming”, Wolff added: “I think we always speak very openly with each other. There's no such thing as holding back.

“For himself, he was not meeting his own expectations with what happened in Monza, and the driving just wasn't how he had expected it to be, or how he wanted it to be.

“Here, maybe there was a bit missing in ultimate performance that maybe made the difference between a podium and not, but such a good consolidation in my opinion; it was important to score that result.”

Mercedes' haul from Azerbaijan puts them second in the Teams' Championship on 290 points – just ahead of Ferrari on 286 and Red Bull on 272.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar reflect on scoring points for Racing Bulls in Baku, a result that saw them rise up to sixth in the Teams' Standings.

Liam Lawson was left with mixed feelings in the wake of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after failing to convert a P3 grid slot into a maiden podium for Racing Bulls, despite still scoring his career best F1 result with an impressive fifth.

With team mate Isack Hadjar also finishing in the top 10, it proved to be a strong weekend for Racing Bulls who were able to jump above Aston Martin into P6 in the Teams' Championship.

However, for Lawson, fifth was realistically the best he could have hoped for despite securing a superb third-place start on the grid in Saturday's chaotic Qualifying session in Baku. Starting ahead of both Mercedes cars for the Sunday's race, with both proving to be very quick in the cooler conditions, Lawson was forced on the defence from word go, with Kimi Antonelli in DRS range of his car for the first stint.

When the teenager boxed, Lawson then had to contend with George Russell hunting him down behind.

Pitting to get rid of his mediums, Lawson came out just ahead of Antonelli – but he soon lost out to the Mercedes man, whose tyres were already up to temperature.

He was also jumped by Russell who ran a very long first stint to enact the overcut on his way to an eventual second place, but did well in the closing stages without DRS to keep a gaggle of cars including the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda behind.

“I think rewarding after the last 10 or 15 laps, it was pretty intense,” Lawson explained. “Obviously, it is a little bit disappointing from where we are starting and realistically we didn't have the speed to fight with the guys in front today.

“But you're always hopeful. And we tried everything today, but there just wasn't quite enough, but still to have a P5 is big for us, especially in the Championship right now. Yeah, massive thanks to the team, we have had a good car all weekend and happy to come home with some points.”

Lawson's drive was particularly impressive considering how much pressure he was under throughout the race, with Antonelli the only driver able to overtake him on the track. The Kiwi star does not have a confirmed seat on the grid for next year either – so bagging his best F1 finish was a timely result.

“Honestly I think it is the best we had today,” he concluded.

As for Hadjar, his race almost ground to a halt before it had even begun when a hydraulics issue was detected on his way to the grid. The team did a great job to fix the problem so he could start the race, but the rookie ran into problems at a very early stage.

“I had a really good start, went by Lando [Norris] into Turn 2, and I made a mistake on the Safety Car restart and lost two places,"" he said. ""And from there the momentum was just not very good, the pace on the medium was not great.

“But then moving onto the hard, the pace was amazing and we were catching the group ahead quite fast but not enough to go and have a go.”

Hadjar eventually wound up 10th behind Charles Leclerc, which was all the more impressive considering he had struggled compared to his team mate across every session in Baku.

“I had a really bad feeling this weekend with the car, I wasn't comfortable and still somehow, we went to Q3, double score finish,"" he continued. ""So yeah, gives me a lot of positives that when I'm going to feel good inside that car, we are going to deliver way better.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

McLaren boss Andrea Stella has given his take on what proved to be a tough weekend for both Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.

Andrea Stella is confident that Oscar Piastri will “come back stronger” following his Lap 1 crash out of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend in which the other McLaren car of Lando Norris was again hit by a pit stop issue en route to a final result of P7.

After a tough Qualifying for the papaya squad on Saturday – in which Piastri hit the wall in Q3 while Norris failed to reach higher than P7 on the grid – the team also faced a difficult day as soon as the lights went out in Baku on Sunday.

Piastri's troubles continued as the Australian made a jump start before his car went into anti-stall, dropping him to the back of the field as well as earning him a five-second time penalty. But the championship leader's race soon came to an end when he locked up into Turn 5 and hit the barriers, making him the only driver to retire from the Grand Prix.

Reflecting on the events of the weekend after the race, McLaren Team Principal Stella suggested that Piastri's record across past categories shows his ability to bounce back and learn quickly from his mistakes.

“These errors that we've seen on Oscar's side, they are definitely uncharacteristic,” Stella explained. “Oscar has been the most solid driver in the 2025 campaign so far, and from what I could see, even with multi champion drivers, sometimes you have a weekend in which it's all about learning.

“And I think Oscar concentrated some learning opportunities in this weekend, despite his will. The start, I think it's just for an excess of eagerness. I'm sure we have seen this now, and we won't see this anymore.

“And in terms of the lock-up, similar to yesterday, he just misjudged the level of grip available. Perhaps this was compounded with a slow start, with a false start. We don't know yet.

“But I think one of the strongest features of Oscar is how rapidly he learns, how rapidly he improves, and now he can come back stronger. That's why he's been so successful in every category, and I think that's exactly what will happen in his Formula 1 career, and we will see it in the remainder of the season.”

On the other side of the garage, Norris struggled to overtake the cars ahead from his P7 starting slot and also found himself in traffic after a slow pit stop – his second in as many races.

While this meant that the Briton was unable to capitalise as greatly on Piastri's retirement in terms of the championship – with the gap only slightly reduced to 25 points – he insisted that the race was “not a missed opportunity”. From Stella's side, the team boss felt that the MCL39 did not have enough pace for Norris to gain any further positions.

“I think on Lando's side, we were hoping to have a car that was in condition to overtake, in fairness, but the reality today is that the car wasn't fast enough to stay close to the car ahead out of last corner to then be able to overtake down the straight,” said Stella.

“This means that Lando spent the entire race in traffic, despite feeling that the car had more to offer. Overall I think I've said yesterday that these kind of circuits don't seem to suit our car very well in terms of its strengths, but at the same time, definitely there was more available in the car that yesterday in Qualifying and today in the race we did not exploit.”

Reflecting further on Norris' performance, Stella added: “I think Lando today had a strong race. He raced to the limit of the potential that was available in the car. I think no other driver in Lando's car could have scored more.

“If anything, the responsibility to try and extract more performance today or more points may lie more on the team's side, because with a fast, or the fastest, pit stop we could have given Lando the opportunity for us to attack Liam Lawson. But from a driving point of view, we are completely, completely happy that Lando has delivered to the limit of what was available today in the car.”

As such, Stella admits that pit stops will be one of the squad's areas for improvement going forward as the potential impact of mistakes heightens entering into the final seven Grands Prix of the campaign, with the team boss stating that Baku winner Max Verstappen is “in the contention for the Drivers' Championship”.

“We need to keep working, because there's some important performance that is available through pit stops, and we have seen that the racing, if anything, is getting tighter and tighter,” Stella conceded. “So what is the impact of a pit stop now? It gets more and more important.

“So definitely, for the remainder of the season, and also thinking about next year's car, there's work to do.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Max Verstappen has been reflecting on his championship prospects off the back of an upswing in competitiveness for Red Bull.

Max Verstappen has cautioned that “everything needs to go perfectly” for him if he hopes to close the gap in the championship and bid for the title, despite the Dutchman bolstering his points tally after scoring back-to-back wins in Italy and Azerbaijan.

While McLaren faced a challenging weekend in Baku – which saw championship leader Oscar Piastri crash out of the race on Lap 1, while Lando Norris had to settle for P7 – Verstappen enjoyed a dominant outing, converting pole position into a commanding victory.

During a chat with Sky Sports F1 after the Grand Prix, Verstappen was asked if the new floor recently introduced on Red Bull's car has had a particular impact on their performance level over these past weekends.

“I think it's just a combination of a lot of things that are going better in the last few weeks, so we understood a bit more about the car,” the reigning World Champion explained. “Of course it's two low-downforce tracks, so we have to wait and see how we are going to perform again on a high-downforce track.

“But for now we're just very happy with what we're doing, and then we'll just find out [at] the upcoming races how that will go on other kinds of layouts.”

With seven rounds remaining in the 2025 season, Verstappen's run of wins has seen him close the gap to Piastri down to 69 points, while he tails second-placed Norris by 44 points.

When quizzed on whether he still sees opportunities to make gains should McLaren have further difficult weekends, Verstappen responded: “It's seven races to go and it's still 69 points – it's a lot.

“Basically everything needs to go perfectly from my side, and then a bit of luck from their side I need as well, so it's still very tough.”

Speaking further on the topic in Sunday's post-race press conference, the 27-year-old reiterated that he is taking each event as it comes.

Asked if Red Bull's recent increase in competitiveness had given him hope that the title could still be within reach, Verstappen answered: “I mean, I don't rely on hope.

“I personally don't think about it. I just go race by race, what I have been doing basically the whole season – just trying to do the best we can, try to score the most points that we can. And then after Abu Dhabi, we'll know.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson found the perfect gap in the Qualifying chaos to earn a top three start.

Liam Lawson achieved the best Qualifying result of his Formula 1 career ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix as he capitalised on the chaos of the session to take third position.

The Racing Bulls driver will join Carlos Sainz in the top three on the grid tomorrow after clocking early fast laps in Q3, with Max Verstappen the only driver who could beat the midfield teams to pole position.

After four red flags across Q1 and Q2, Lawson was one of the first out on track in Q3 and managed to set a lap before Ferrari's Charles Leclerc slammed into the wall just a few minutes in.

While his car was recovered, light rain made the track surface more slippery, and everyone struggled to find grip once they returned to the circuit. This culminated in Oscar Piastri crashing into the barrier with 3m 41s remaining, leaving just one opportunity for the drivers to improve their times.

“Honestly I can't even remember what happened, it was so busy,” Lawson summarised. “I didn't expect it to be like that, honestly. The car has been good all weekend and when it needed to be in Quali, it was good so a massive thanks to the guys and girls. The team's been amazing this weekend so far, but obviously tomorrow is the important day.

“It's always sketchy because you see the rain coming on your visor and you can feel it, and you can kind of see the gloss on the track, but because the tyres are still warm you have grip. You're trying to fight your brain and not back off and keep pushing. It's definitely tricky.

“It's going to be a very hard race. We have a great starting position but obviously we're aware of who we're fighting around us, and that's what we're focused on.”

Verstappen was not the only driver to jump up the timesheets as both Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda, and Lando Norris cut down their times marginally, demoting Hadjar to eighth place by the end of the disrupted session.

Having made his mark as a rookie with consistently impressive Qualifying results, he was underwhelmed by his performance, especially with his team mate shining in the top three.

He said: “It was tricky. We handled it perfectly until the final corner of the final lap. That's it. The car is fast, but we are not supposed to be starting eighth.”

AB Inbev brands will serve as title sponsors on Netflix content around the world, with Netflix IP featured in activations and packaging.

Senior Editor


	In what the companies are calling a first-of-its-kind deal, Netflix and beverage giant AB InBev say they have inked a global marketing partnership: one that will make its beer brands title sponsors of Netflix programming and live events, while bringing Netflix IP to live activations and packaging around the world.


	The deal will see AB InBev brands, which include Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona, become title sponsors of Netflix shows in markets around the globe, and see them launch co-branded campaigns around Netflix live events like boxing matches, the NFL Christmas Day games and the upcoming Women's World Cup.

	But what makes the deal so unusual is the global nature of it: Netflix now has an ad tier in a dozen countries, including across North America, Europe and Asia. For a global beverage company like AB InBev, that means the companies can partner on a global scale, while also customizing their efforts by market.

	“AB InBev and Netflix are both unique in our scale — making the global reach of our partnership unprecedented,” says Marcel Marcondes, the global chief marketing officer for AB InBev. “We grow our brands with a focus on consumer-centricity, consistency and cultural relevance, so Netflix's service presents an opportunity for us to come together in an authentic way. Our partnership is multilayered and will come to life through co-promoted shows, live events, limited-edition packaging and more.”

	











	“Global reach wasn't just a priority — it was a non-negotiable. Our biggest hits don't recognize borders. Money Heist didn't stop in Spain. Lupin became a phenomenon from Paris to Portland. Senna traveled the world. And Squid Game? It resonated absolutely everywhere,” added Netflix's chief marketing officer, Marian Lee. “We needed a partner with the same scale and impact — one that operates globally but also understands the importance of showing up locally in meaningful ways. We have to know when Michelob Ultra is the perfect pairing for Full Swing and when Stella Artois can elevate a European drama like The Gentlemen.”


	To that end, the partnership will not just include title sponsorships of shows and ads during NFL games and live events, but also integrations into shows (when appropriate, of course), and custom packaging that turns a six-pack into a collector's item. Lee suggests that the companies could even create custom products in the future.


	“We know that there is a huge opportunity to build a culturally defining partnership together — one that takes shape in different markets, around different stories, and in ways we can co-create together. The ambition is exciting. The flexibility to shape it side-by-side is even better,” Lee says. “As Marcel describes their business, it's not just about brewing beers; it's about creating connections. For us, it's the exact same thing. It's not just about debuting titles; it's about creating culture-defining moments for our fans.”

	











	“Consumers helped bring us together. Consumer passion points — from sports to music, to comedy, and food — are areas where Netflix is delivering amazing original content and that also represent natural beer occasions, where our brands are already present, so it just makes sense that we make this partnership official and global in scale,” Marcondes adds. “Through this multiyear partnership with Netflix, we will continue to transform AB InBev from being an advertiser to an experience provider.”


	The deal comes as Netflix continues to seek scale in its ads business, which now reaches more than 94 million users some two years after launching. The company believes it will become a significant driver of its business, though it is still seen as somewhat nascent. Though as the new deal underscores, Netflix is able to strike creative deals that other companies can't quite match.

The preemption means that 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will remain unavailable for some of the U.S. despite its return after a nearly weeklong suspension.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Jimmy Kimmel may be returning to ABC Tuesday night, but his show will remain dark in a large swath of the U.S., with Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar saying that they will preempt the show.


	“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,” the company said in a statement Monday. “Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return.”




	“We made a decision last week to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse,” Nexstar added Tuesday morning. “We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve. In the meantime, we note that Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”

	The Walt Disney Co. said Monday that Kimmel would return to the air after his nearly weeklong suspension.


	“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” the Bob Iger-run company said Monday. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

	











	However, most ABC stations in the U.S. are owned by independent station groups, and Sinclair is the largest owner of ABC stations, with 38 across the country, including WJLA, the ABC affiliate that serves the Washington D.C. metro area. Nexstar operates 28 ABC affiliates.


	It was pushback from Sinclair and Nexstar that sparked Disney's decision to pull the show in the first place, with both station groups telling Disney that they would preempt the show in response to his comments last Monday night about Charlie Kirk's killer. Sources say that other ABC affiliates had also expressed concerns.


	Nexstar, it should be noted, has a $6 billion-plus deal pending before the FCC to acquire Tegna, an agreement that would make it by far the largest owner of local TV stations in the country. Sinclair has also expressed a desire to pursue M&A, which would also require FCC approval.

The TikTok sensation and musical artist — who fans suspect is actor KJ Apa's alter ego — is diving into his musical aspirations, new music and why James Franco is the only actor he looks up to.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


	Depending on which side of TikTok you're on, you may or may not know who Mr. Fantasy is. But once you come across his account, it's quite hard not to become instantly obsessed.


	While Mr. Fantasy is an aspiring musical artist with an eccentric personality and quirky style, there's something all too familiar about him. That's because fans suspect he's actually New Zealand-born actor KJ Apa (Riverdale, The Map That Leads to You) wearing a wig and fake teeth, with a British accent. (To back up their theories, fans also point out that Apa and Mr. Fantasy have the exact same tattoos.)

	When The Hollywood Reporter asked his manager, who only goes by the name John, if he could confirm it's Apa under that unforgettable black bob, he wouldn't spill. And John asked over email that the “silly actor boy TJ Apple” not be brought up during THR‘s interview with him.

	Either way, in a little over a month, as Mr. Fantasy posted his first TikTok video on Aug. 18, he's already captured the attention of thousands, garnering nearly 700,000 followers on the social media platform. He also dropped his self-titled debut single earlier this month, already reaching nearly a million monthly listeners on Spotify alone.


	While Mr. Fantasy is not ready to address his connection to Apa just yet, he was more than thrilled to talk over Zoom about his goals as an artist, upcoming music, why James Franco is his biggest inspiration, whether he's open to performing live for his fans and more.

	











How did your whole social media and musical journey begin? 


	Well, it started with a woman. And that woman is my nan, my grandmother. That's where the story begins because she is my reason, and she fostered this gift that I had been given by the gods to create music. As a small child, that's what I loved, and I grew up listening to amazing music. And she always told me to pursue that dream and she believed in me and I decided to come to Los Angeles and make it like so many people do, because America is this place, this magical place, where somehow, for some reason, you can be completely who you want to be. Any version of yourself seems to be accepted. … I mean, look at how many stars were made here. James Franco, for example, came to Los Angeles to pursue this dream, and I'm just another artist who's out here doing his thing. (Laughs.) 


What is it about James Franco that inspires you?


	What isn't it about him? (Laughs.) I mean, that's the question, isn't it? What is it not about him that makes me want to be him? Oh, I don't want to be him. I simply just am fascinated by him, straight from the horse's mouth, that horse being James Franco. And he does have a big old mouth. I think he's the Renaissance man of our time. He's an artist, he writes, he's an actor, he's a director. You can give him anything, and he just seems to be this creative soul that just will not stop. And I'd love to get the chance to work with him and in any capacity: whether he wants to be on one of my songs, whether I can be in one of his movies or just a friend. 

	











Have you ever met James?


	No, I've never met him, but I love him.


Why is it so important for you to be open with your fans on social media with your creation process?


	It's important for me to include them in everything I do, because if it weren't for them, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you. And that rhymed, and I tend to do that. I'm kind of a genius when it comes to stuff like that. (Laughs.) The fans are my everything, literally. I'm constantly online. I've had to buy another phone because my phone died because I'm on TikTok too much, apparently. (Laughs.) But I love talking to them in the comments. I'm very interested in what people are doing in their own lives. I'm fascinated by that. If I could talk to a dog or talk to a horse or talk to a rodent, any kind of animal, I would be talking to them all night. 

A post shared by MR. FANTASY (@therealmrfantasy)


After releasing your debut song, “Mr. Fantasy,” what are you hoping to convey with your music and your sound? 


	What am I hoping to convey? Love. That's really the main ingredient, and it's not a conscious thing that I'm trying to concoct. It just sort of seeps out of me, like some kind of strange liquid. But that's where the music comes from, it's very natural. It's in the same way that a bee produces honey. It's the same way that Mr. Fantasy produces sound waves into the ether. It's very much part of who I am, in the same way that James Franco has the world on all fours for his performances. 

	











Would you be open to any live performances in the future?


	Yes, of course! I mean that's why we love what we get to do in life is because hopefully whatever it is that we're doing, we get to share it with people in a live format, in reality. So the answer is yes, and I can't wait for that because I've got a few tricks up my sleeves, you know what I mean? 


In addition to music, do you have other creative aspirations, like acting?


	I mean, I think I am a good actor. If I was given the right opportunity, I would be quite good. I think I'm honest enough to be an actor. Often the best performers, like James Franco, they seem to have honesty. It exudes off of the screen, and so yeah, of course I'd be very interested, you know. I'd love to work with James Franco, if I haven't already mentioned that. If I was to do it, I don't think I'd do it without him. 


As you try to define yourself as an artist, what do you think when people compare you to a certain person in your comments?


	I'm not trying to define myself, do you know what I mean? I sort of just am me. That's how I'm trying to inspire people, by just being who they are, because that's the biggest gift that we have. I'm sorry to say it, but we were born all very different, and I think it's very important to inhabit this thing that you are, instead of trying to be someone else. It's very difficult now. We're in a time where we all want to be like the big star, Austin Butler, or these other amazing people like James Franco. I'm guilty of it, aren't I? Shoot me. (Laughs.) … But I'm not trying to actually define who I am to people, do you know what I mean? What you see is what you get. Me sitting right here with you drinking this Guinness, Carly, is in fact who I am. And it doesn't change when I go to sleep at night. I'm just me. And I love being me. The best part of my life is that I get to walk outside and I get to scream, “I am Mr. Fantasy!” 

	











Do those comparisons bother you?


	Not bothered by it, not bothered by it. Things bother me sometimes, but I keep my eyes upward, and I keep trudging the happy road of happy destiny. You know, things can be hurtful, sure, but I focus on the positive. I focus on the people whom I love and who love me and that have a positive influence on my life, like James Franco. 


Can fans expect more music in the future? And if so, can you tease anything?


	So I've been listening all day to my next single that is gonna be coming out in the coming weeks, I promise that. It's a very good song, is all I'm gonna say. It's the type of song that will have you begging for your life, quite literally. That's all I can say. It's very nostalgic. It means a lot to me because it relates to my fans, my fantasies. (Laughs.) And it's a song that that came very naturally to me. I'm very proud of it, and I can only hope that it can flap its wings after it's released into the world and when I'm done with it. … And I think it is going to do that because the frequency that I have, that flow, my brilliant producer has this sort of sexy frequency that he puts onto all my songs that happens to make people fall in love with me. (Laughs.) Because I mean if you look around, everyone's sort of listening to Mr. Fantasy. And it's just brilliant. 


What's your overall goal with music, and what do you hope to achieve as an artist?


	I tend to live life one day at a time. I haven't thought about that, honestly, Carly. If I'm being honest with myself, when I wake up every morning, I'm focused on what's gonna happen today and that keeps me sort of in the present moment. The trajectory of the careers and the trajectory of things like money and all of these material things is great, and it's good to plan ‘cause life is a very fragile thing that we have to be aware of at all times, but I'm not worried about that. Look, this could all crumble away in the morning, but at the end of the day, I still have John, who's my friend, and I still am Mr. Fantasy.

Francesco Costabile's dark melodrama premiered at the Venice Film Festival. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


Italy has picked Francesco Costabile's dark melodrama Familia as its Oscar contender for the 2026 Academy Awards in the best international feature film category. 


Familia is based on Luigi Celeste's biographical memoir about his youth as a far-right militant and about the legacy of his toxic, violent upbringing at the hands of his criminal father. The film premiered in the Horizons sidebar of the Venice Film Festival last year, winning the best actor prize for star Francesco Gheghi, who plays Luigi. 




	Barbara Ronchi and Francesco Di Leva co-star. Di Leva won Italy's David di Donatello award, the local version of the Oscar, for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Attilio de Razza and Nicola Picone produced Familia for Rome-based Tramp Limited, with coproducers Nicola Giuliano at Indigo Film and Pierpaolo Verga at O'Groove, and in association with Medusa Film. True Colours is handling international sales.

Familia was picked from among 24 shortlisted candidates as the Italian Oscar entry. Among its competitors were Gianfranco Rosi's documentary Below the Clouds, Pietro Marcello's period biopic Duse, and Leonardo Di Costanzo's crime drama Elisa.

Paolo Sorrentino's La Grazia, which opened the Venice Film Festival this year, did not qualify for the Oscar race as it won't release in Italy until early January. For Italy, only films released between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025 are considered eligible for submission for next year's Oscar race.

	











	Sorrentino is the last Italian director to win the best international feature Oscar, taking home the trophy in 2014 for The Great Beauty. Italy's last Oscar nomination was in 2024 for Matteo Garrone's refugee drama Io Capitano. Last year's submission, Maura Delpero's World War 2 drama Vermiglio, was shortlisted but not nominated. 


	The U.S. Academy will announce the first shortlist of 15 films in contention for the 2026 best international feature Oscar on Dec. 16. The final nominations will be announced on Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards Ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on March 15, 2026.

Man-child, why you always come a-running to her?


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Sabrina Carpenter may have made an album called Man's Best Friend, but that doesn't mean she has men all figured out.


	In a new Vogue Italia cover story published Tuesday (Sept. 23), the pop star opened up about her somewhat conflicting feelings toward the opposite sex. “I think they're a really fun species to watch,” Carpenter began. “In both a good and bad way.”


	The Grammy winner went on to differentiate between the positive and negative experiences she's had with men (some of whom she might classify as man-children). “I feel really adored, inspired and loved by some of them,” she told the publication of men. “And really confused, attacked and ridiculed by others.”

	











	“When one of my friends announces she's having a son, I rejoice for that child,” Carpenter added. “Because I know he'll be raised right.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	For more of the singer's thoughts on men, fans need only listen to Man's Best Friend, which dropped in August and debuted atop the Billboard 200. On Billboard Hot 100-topping lead single “Manchild,” she laments the incompetencies of the male partners she attracts, while on “Tears,” she caustically raves about how hot it is when a love interest does the bare minimum.


	Carpenter has also previously opened up about the heartbreak that inspired Man's Best Friend. “I think I came out of a sad situation a lot less bitter than I intended or expected to, with a little bit more of the, like, ‘You know what? There's two people involved, and this is part of growing up,'” she told Zane Lowe earlier in September. “I don't want to be enemies with people that I loved … I feel like it is one of those situations where, even the album starting with, ‘Oh, boy' was sort of an eye roll to yourself being like, ‘Here we go again.'”


	The conversation with Vogue Italia comes as Carpenter has a number of exciting ventures coming up, with the Girl Meets World alum recently announcing that she'll soon be making her Grand Ole Opry debut in addition to hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time. She will also headline Coachella in 2026.

	











	Elsewhere in the new interview, Carpenter spoke about how meaningful it's been to her to have her fans by her side for every step of the way on her rise to superstardom. “The most important thing in the last 10 years of my life has been the people who have brought me to where I am now, the fans who have stuck by me through every moment, the good ones and the bad ones, with the songs they loved and didn't love,” she reflected. “We're really growing together.”

Inside the quick rise and recent news surrounding the 20-year-old pop singer.


													By
												

	Mackenzie Cummings-Grady



	After breaking through as a Gen Z pop singer, D4vd has been making headlines in relation to a tragedy over the past few weeks. The artist, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, rose to fame as a genre-blending musician after pivoting away from YouTube content creation; up until last week, he was in the throes of a massive world tour. Now, those tour dates have been cancelled, following the early September discovery of a deceased teenage girl in a car registered to the singer.


	On Sept. 8, a decomposed body was found in the singer's impounded Tesla. Authorities identified the decomposed remains — which were discovered in the Tesla's trunk while the car was in a Los Angeles tow lot — using forensics, and determined that the body belonged to 15-year-old Celeste Rivas. According to NBC News, the teen had been reported as missing and was last seen in April 2024, and her death is being investigated as a homicide. Following the identification of the body, the Internet exploded with speculative detective work, drawing connections between Rivas and D4vd, and linking the singer to the case.


	The singer's rep previously said in a statement that D4vd is “fully cooperating with the authorities,” and no charges have been brought against the 20-year-old. He canceled the remaining dates of his world tour last week.


	As the heartbreaking story develops, here's everything you need to know about D4vd's career, and how the pop singer enjoyed a meteoric rise prior to the tragic events of recent weeks.


	D4vd got his start in the early 2020s while live streaming video games, and in interviews credited Fortnite with exposing him to The Neighbourhood, Arctic Monkeys and other alternative artists. Prior to that, D4vd said he strictly listening to gospel music growing up. After some time on Fortnite, he made his first songs under the D4vd moniker titled “Run Away” and “You and I.” He used the latter song for gameplay montage videos, and noticed that people started taking it and using it in their own montages.


	“…I was like, ‘Okay, this could be something,' so I kept making songs,” D4vd told VMAN in 2022.


	D4vd released two singles in 2022 to get fans ready for his debut EP, Petals to Thorns. The first single was “Romantic Homicide,” which dropped in July 2022 and went viral on TikTok, eventually peaking at No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single was “Here With Me,” which also went viral online and hit No. 60 on the chart.


	The song's success led to D4vd being contacted by Darkroom and Interscope Records, leading to him signing with the label in September 2022.


	D4vd then officially made his recording debut with the release of his EP Petals to Thorns in May 2023. The EP became D4vd's first entry on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 105. After the success of Petals to Thorns, D4vd closed out the year with The Lost Petals EP that September, adding to the buzz surrounding the young artist.


	D4vd was announced as one of the openers on SZA's blockbuster SOS tour, which kicked off in February 2023. D4vd was one of three openers, joining Omar Apollo and Raye.


	“I'm SZA's biggest fan. I'm super grateful to her,” D4vd told Rolling Stone at the time. “When I got the news I was locked in for the tour, I was in a recording session and I jumped up, threw my headphones and was just going crazy.”


	D4vd issued a variety of singles throughout 2024: he dropped “Leave Her” and “2016” in February, and “Feel It,” which appeared on the soundtrack for the Amazon Prime Video TV series Invincible, the following month. In July, D4vd returned again with “There Goes My Baby,” and in November he released “Remember Me,” which was featured on the Arcane soundtrack. Before the year was out, D4vd returned once more with the single, “Where'd It Go Wrong?”


	After dropping another smattering of singles in early 2025, D4vd officially released his debut album Withered in April. D4vd also went viral that month after attempting a backflip during his Coachella performance, and face-planting onstage. The singer laughed off the tumble, and then announced the Withered World Tour days later. The tour kicked off on Aug. 5 in Del Mar, California.


	On Sept. 8, Los Angeles police discovered a body inside an impounded Tesla in Hollywood. The vehicle was reportedly registered to D4vd. A spokesperson for the LAPD told Billboard that officers responded to a call of a “foul odor” coming from the car in a tow yard before finding the “possible human remains.” The case was described as “currently a death investigation.”


	Days later, the body found in the Tesla registered to D4vd was identified as a missing 15-year-old girl named Celeste Rivas Hernandez. She had been last seen in April 2024, and had been reported missing. Officials announced that her remains weren't intact and she had been dead for an “extended period of time.”


	The next day, a home in Los Angeles where D4vd had previously stayed was searched by police.


	On Sept. 20, D4vd canceled the last two dates on his U.S. tour and multiple dates on his European tour. Ticketmaster communicated to fans the dates had been canceled, but some tickets for dates in Sweden, France, Poland and Australia scheduled for the end of the year remained available for purchase as of Sept. 22.


	Celeste Rivas' Inland Empire community of Lake Elsinore, where she lived with her family, held a vigil on Sept. 21, 2025. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Rivas' community members paid their respects to the teen, and said, among other things, that “She deserves justice.”

Ahead of the farewell dates, Manilow has released a new single, a cover of the Peter Allen-Dean Pitchford ballad ""Once Before I Go.""


													By
												

	Paul Grein



Barry Manilow has announced U.S. tour dates for January 2026, which will mark his final concerts in nine markets, including Orlando and Tampa, Florida, and Columbus, Ohio (see full routing below). But fans who miss out on these dates shouldn't despair: Manilow's website has tickets available to shows at his residency at the International Theatre at Westgate Las Vegas through December 2026.

	











	Tickets for Manilow's new tour dates go on sale on Friday, Sept. 26 at 10 a.m. local time. VIP packages will be available for select shows starting Tuesday, Sept. 23 at 1 p.m. ET. For all dates, tickets, and VIP packages visit Manilow's website.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Manilow's long-running Las Vegas residency and his record-breaking appearances at Radio City Music Hall have contributed to his reputation as a legendary showman. He was a road warrior by the time of his second Billboard Hot 100 hit in 1975, “It's a Miracle,” which contained this memorable line: “From Boston to Denver/ And every town in between.”


	Ahead of the farewell tour dates, Manilow has released a new single, a cover of the Peter Allen-Dean Pitchford ballad “Once Before I Go.” Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds and Demonte Posey produced Manilow's recording of the song, which was first recorded by Allen in 1983 on his album Not the Boy Next Door. Other artists who have covered it include Patti LaBelle, Hugh Jackman (in the Broadway show The Boy From Oz) and Johnny Mathis (on his final non-holiday studio album, Johnny Mathis Sings the Great New American Songbook – which was also produced by Babyface).

	











	Manilow has had two No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, nearly 30 years apart – Barry Manilow Live! (1977) and The Greatest Songs of the Fifties (2006). He has had three No. 1 hits on the Hot 100 – “Mandy,” “I Write the Songs” and “Looks Like We Made It.” Manilow has won two Primetime Emmys, a Grammy and an honorary Tony. He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2002.


	Here are the newly announced Barry Manilow 2026 tour dates:


	Sunrise, FL @ Amerant Bank Arena, Jan. 6


	Orlando, FL @ Kia Center, Jan. 7


	Tampa, FL @ Benchmark International Arena, Jan. 8

The rapper explained that the art represents ""putting trust in the hands of yourself and others.""

	Hannah Dailey



	B—h, she said what she said. After unveiling a new cover for her upcoming album Vie, Doja Cat is standing by the artwork — despite receiving some “harsh criticism” about it. 


	The rapper first unveiled the new art on Instagram on Monday (Sept. 22), showing off a photo of herself in a tattered wedding dress, hanging from a yellow parachute caught in a tree. “Falling in love is putting trust in the hands of yourself and others,” she wrote of the portrait. “The yellow parachute represents curiosity, happiness and adventure.”

	











	“Flying you towards new experiences and scenes, taking a leap of faith, and holding no bounds,” she continued. “The tree represents life and wisdom. Giving you a sense of safety within its branches, but the pain from the fall teaches you that those scratches can be healed. You don't have to hit the ground. Love grows upward but more importantly down.”

	“It's the roots that keep you steady,” she added. “This is the cover of my album.”


	The new cover arrives about a month after Doja premiered what fans originally thought was the official Vie artwork: a close-up photo of the California native surrounded by red roses. Apparently, some listeners aren't too keen on the new artwork, as Doja took to X on Tuesday (Sept. 23) to defend her creative choices.

	











	“You can't make me feel bad for a cover that has visceral meaning,” she wrote. “The greatest armor is love and integrity. I forgive your harsh criticism but for me I won yet again for following my heart. If I was you I wouldn't.”


	Doja has never been shy about shutting down criticism, especially when it comes to her art. Just weeks ago, she asserted her dominance as one of the leading female rappers in the game, telling someone online who doubted her skills, “Please stop trying to downplay my ability.”


	That said, Doja has also been open about the fact that Vie is much more pop-focused, with similarities to her earlier hits such as “Say So.” “It's taken until the beginning of this next album, Vie, to appreciate my older stuff,” she told CBS Sunday Morning recently. “I think [this album] was a return to that.”

With sentencing set for next month, the music mogul's attorneys say prosecutors are seeking punishment ""wildly out of proportion"" with his actual convictions.

	Bill Donahue



Attorneys for Sean “Diddy” Combs are asking a federal judge to sentence him to just 14 months in prison on his prostitution convictions, saying “it is time for Mr. Combs to go home.”


	In court filings late Monday, Diddy's attorneys urged Judge Arun Subramanian to reject “draconian” requests from prosecutors and instead impose a “far lower sentence in this unique case,” where Combs was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking charges.

	The star is set for sentencing on October 3. Because of 13 months the star has already served in jail since he was arrested, a 14-month sentence would see him released almost immediately.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,” his attorneys write. “He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America — yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life.”


	Sentencing recommendations from prosecutors are not yet public, but Diddy's lawyers say they're seeking a sentence of more than 20 years in prison – a request that his attorneys say would be “a perversion of justice” and suggests the government has “lost all perspective.”


	“This is wildly out of proportion to the conduct at issue—threesomes where fully competent adult men and women voluntarily crossed state lines and had consensual sex with each other, and the defendant made no money from the conduct,” Combs' attorneys write. “This draconian approach makes Alice in Wonderland's Queen of Hearts seem benevolent.”


	Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating the freak-offs — elaborate events which he allegedly forced his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	Following a blockbuster trial this spring, jurors cleared Combs on the RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. But he was still convicted on two other counts for transporting Ventura and others across state lines for the purposes of prostitution.


	In Monday's sentencing submission, Diddy's lawyers say the judge must take into account that outcome – that he was cleared of the more serious charges he faced.


	“The government accused Sean Combs of heinous crimes. It branded him an evil trafficker and racketeer who coerced and defrauded his girlfriends into having sex against their will. But none of that was true,” his lawyers write. “Put simply, the jury has spoken.”

A lawsuit claimed Blige's decades-old song borrowed from a 1973 song with a rich hip-hop history. But a federal judge now says nobody can even hear it.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit claiming Mary J. Blige's enduring 1992 hit “Real Love” features a legendary 1973 funk sample without a license, ruling simply that “the songs do not sound the same.”


	The case, filed last year against Universal Music Group (UMG) by Tuff City Records, claimed Blige's track illegally borrowed from “Impeach the President” by the Honey Drippers — an iconic piece of hip-hop source material that's been sampled or interpolated by Run-DMC, Dr. Dre, Doja Cat and many others.


	During the litigation, UMG effectively conceded that Blige's song had copied material from “Impeach.” But in a ruling Tuesday (Sept. 23), Judge Dale Ho says that it doesn't matter — since the two final songs are so different that an ordinary listener would not even be able to recognize the sample.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“‘Impeach the President' is a protest song from the 1970s that fits squarely within the soul/funk genre,” the judge writes. “‘Real Love,' by contrast, is a hip-hop soul song about heartbreak, not politics.”


	The earlier song is “sung by a group of men performed in a call-and-response style, and prominently features horns and guitar,” Judge Ho writes, while “Real Love” is instead “sung by a woman, and is driven by piano and drums.”


	“The songs do not sound the same,” the judge wrote, before later adding that the songs also don't share any similarities in melodies or lyrics.


	Representatives for both UMG and Tuff City did not immediately return requests for comment on the ruling. The lawsuit did not name Blige herself as a defendant nor accuse her of any wrongdoing.


	The ruling highlights a crucial distinction in music law: While the direct sampling of a copyrighted sound recording requires a license, no matter how insignificant the use, the borrowing of elements from a copyrighted musical composition is not as clear-cut.


	That quirky legal rubric is why UMG's recorded music unit (UMG Recordings, Inc.) reached a separate settlement with Tuff City regarding the use of the “Impeach” sample on the “Real Love” sound recording before the current lawsuit was even filed, but seemingly balked at paying for the composition.


	In his ruling on Tuesday, Judge Ho ruled that under the legal framework for musical compositions, Blige's song was not similar enough to infringe the earlier track: “Overall the musical motifs are extremely dissimilar, and the overall musical impression of each song is also different,” the judge writes.


	“Real Love” spent 31 weeks on the Hot 100 in 1992 and reached a peak of No. 7 on the chart. It has remained one of Blige's most enduring hits, with more than 120 million spins on Spotify and a movie adaptation released by Lifetime in 2023.


	Tuff City sued UMG over the track in April 2024, claiming it had warned the company about the uncleared sample, but that the label had done nothing about it: “Defendant has repeatedly refused to engage plaintiff in substantive negotiations to rectify the foregoing, let alone agreed to compensate plaintiff for the past infringement or on an ongoing basis.”


	Tuff City, which owns a large catalog of old songs, is no stranger to copyright litigation — filing cases over tracks by Jay-Z, Beastie Boys, Christina Aguilera, Frank Ocean, with claims that they featured unlicensed samples or interpolations. The company had even already sued over “Impeach the President” before the current suit, claiming in a 1991 complaint that it had been illegally sampled on the LL Cool J tracks “Around the Way Girl” and “Six Minutes of Pleasure.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	The release of Apple TV+‘s The Savant has been put on hold. The decision comes three days before the thriller starring Jessica Chastain was slated to premiere on the streamer Sept. 26. No new date has been set.


	“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone The Savant,” an Apple TV+ spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline. “We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date.”


	The streamer would not elaborate on the reasons for the last-minute change but The Savant's subject matter is believed to be behind it, with the storyline about preventing extremist attacks and some of the imagery considered possibly triggering following the Sept. 10 assassination of right-wing political activist Charlie Kirk. The series includes a sniper in action and the bombing of a government building among other acts of violence.

	











	There has been more unrest lately, including the shooting into the offices of Sacramento ABC affiliate KXTV (ABC10) on Friday.




			Watch on Deadline		







	From writer/executive producer/showrunner Melissa James Gibson, Fifth Season and Anonymous Content, The Savant follows an undercover investigator known as “The Savant” (Chastain), who infiltrates online hate groups to stop domestic extremists before they act.


	“We're on the verge of serious violence,” Chastain's character says in the trailer, evoking a potential attack of the scope of 9/11. 


	The cast also includes Cole Doman, Jordana Spiro, Trinity Lee Shirley, Toussaint Francois Battiste, and guest star Pablo Schreiber. James Badge Dale appears in a major recurring role.


	Chastain and Kelly Carmichael executive produce through the former's Freckle Films banner alongside Alan Poul, Melissa James Gibson, and Matthew Heineman, who also directs. David Levine and Garrett Kemble serve as executive producers for Anonymous Content. Stanley serves as a consultant.


	Here is the trailer.

Oh cmon Apple, stop being so gutless. Do you think the MAGA crowd will boycott? The MAGA crowd isn't watching AppleTV+! They don't care about stuff like The Studio and Your Friends and Neighbors. They watch Hee Haw reruns and Tyler Sheridan oil industry propaganda.

Cowards… I was really looking forward to this one. Also, they're still sitting on Teheran S3.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: While production on Spider-Man: Brand New Day has been paused for a week, after star Tom Holland suffered a concussion on set, casting on the project continues, as Marvin Jones III has been tapped for the role of Tombstone, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Sony declined to comment, and reps for Marvel couldn't be reached. 


	Jones comes to the new live-action Spider-Man after being tapped to voice Tombstone in Sony's animated Oscar winner Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, as well as the threequel Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, which is forthcoming.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Also known as Lonnie Lincoln, Tombstone is one of New York's nastiest crime bosses — a Marvel villain who is a recurring foil to Spidey in the comics. Created by writer Gerry Conway and artist Alex Saviuk, the character is a hulking African-American albino with filed teeth and near-indestructible skin. He first appeared in Web of Spider-Man #36 in March 1988.

	











	Production on Brand New Day resumes September 29. The film is still on course to meet its theatrical release date of July 31, 2026. As previously announced, others making their introduction to the live-action MCU in this film will include Sadie Sink and Liza Colón-Zayas, whose roles haven't yet been disclosed. Alongside Zendaya, who reprises as MJ, Mark Ruffalo is expected to reprise his role as The Hulk.


Shang-Chi‘s Destin Daniel Cretton is directing, with Amy Pascal and Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige producing. Brand New Day will be the first live-action Spider-Man since Spider-Man: No Way Home, which went on to gross over $1.9 billion upon its release in December 2021. All past films in the Holland-led Spidey series have been major draws, with Spider-Man: Far from Home bringing in over a billion in 2019 and Spider-Man: Homecoming grossing over $880 million two years prior to that.


RELATED: ‘Avengers: Dommsday' Cast Photos


	Best known for his turn as supervillain Tobias Whale in The CW's Black Lightning, based on characters from DC Comics, Jones recently has been seen starring opposite Kerry Washington in Joe Carnahan's Lionsgate pic Shadow Force. Other credits include All American: Homecoming, The Equalizer and Season 2 of Paramount's Halo opposite Pablo Schreiber. Upcoming, he'll be seen starring opposite Emilia Clarke and Adria Arjona in Amazon's Criminal and in Jonás Cuarón's indie Gringo Champion.

	











	Jones is repped by Buchwald, Framework Entertainment and Goodman Genow Schenkman.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Artists for Artists, the production company of Kenan Thompson and Johnny Ryan Jr., is developing a feature biopic on iconic wrestler “Macho Man” Randy Savage, we can tell you first.


	Thompson and Ryan Jr. come to the project, titled Macho, as lifelong fans of Savage — Thompson, having worked with Savage on a Nickelodeon promo all the way back in 1999. The project stems from a completed script by Savage's brother Lanny Poffo — who died in February 2023 — and Eric Shapiro.


	Thompson and Ryan Jr. will produce alongside Paul Coy Allen of Midas Entertainment Group, with Jonathon Davino (Immaculate), Cory Litwin, Boris Shvarts, and Monica Weber exec producing. Range Select will handle sales on the project.

	











	Born Randy Mario Poffo, “Macho Man” Randy Savage was one of the most influential figures in professional wrestling, from the '70s through the early 2000s. The son of wrestler and wrestling promoter Angelo Poffo, he initially chased a baseball career, even spending time in the farm systems of the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds. But after a shoulder injury derailed those ambitions, he redirected his athletic drive toward wrestling, adopting the name “Macho Man” in the ring.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Starting in the mid-1970s, Savage carved a path through regional promotions, sharpening a larger-than-life persona with which he'd go on to captivate audiences worldwide. He signed with the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE) in the mid '80s and later brought his trademark intensity to World Championship Wrestling, being named World Heavyweight Champion six times over the course of his decades in both.


	Largely stepping back from wrestling in the early 2000s, Savage died of a sudden heart attack while driving in Florida, at just 58 years old, in May 2011. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015. While his life story has been documented in specials from the WWE, as well as in A+E's Biography: WWE Legends and miscellaneous other books and documentary projects, it's never been told in the form of a narrative feature, until now.

	











	In a statement to Deadline, AFA‘s Ryan Jr. said, “Macho man Randy Savage was the greatest showman of all time and the OG bad boy of entertainment. His outfits were as electric as his personality and he's so much more than an artist, he's an icon. Lanny and Eric did a great job capturing this story and the crazy 80s wrestling era that turnt wrestling figures into life long pop culture icons.”


	Ryan Jr.'s partner Thompson told us, “Beyond excited for this one!! Macho Man is hands down one of the greatest of all time and can't wait to bring his story to the screen!!!”


	Said Midas Entertainment Group's Allen, “Some stories come once in a lifetime, not just to be told, but to ignite. MACHO is one of those rare stories that electrifies across generations. We are honored to partner up with AFA and Range Media to share Randy's story with the world.”


	News of AFA's Macho Man movie follows word of their developing a remake of Sleepaway Camp, the cult classic '80s slasher from filmmaker Robert Hiltzik, who is back to direct from his own script. Emmy-nominated for Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson, the company has moved to aggressively expand its film and TV slate several years into its existence, as Thompson continues to juggle his commitment to Saturday Night Live with his other projects.


	AFA is repped by Range Media Partners.

I miss Curtis Hanson

Oh my gosh. Does THAT suck!

In the original, Annabella Sciorra looked SO different from DeMornay that it was easy to distinguish the two. Not sure why they styled these two to look identical.

Probably because it's a different project inspired by the original. If you want the same, watch the original.

I WILL, mister!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Chain Reactions arms film criticism with a chainsaw","https://www.avclub.com/chain-reactions-film-criticism-texas-chain-saw-massacre","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

Anyone who cares even a little bit about film criticism, meaning anyone who's reading this, an essay from the Film Editor of The A.V. Club, has a notion of its vulnerable current state. In my home of Chicago, newspaper subscribers are now without a full-time film critic after Richard Roeper took a buyout from the Sun-Times and Michael Phillips did the same at the Tribune. Across the country, across its most visible and respected publications, the people who get to invite their readers to think more deeply about one of our most popular forms of art are being unceremoniously fired. As many in my field have already written, it's not for the normal reasons people lose their jobs. Film reviews from people who know what they're doing haven't gotten worse, nor has the appetite for them among moviegoers declined. Rather, studios have figured out that they can simply pay influencers for signal boosts to drown out voices that aren't bought and paid for, while publications have determined that it's actually a lot easier to sell ads to media monopolies when you're not employing someone whose job often involves cutting through their bullshit.

This isn't only a crass capitulation to our increasingly evil corporate overlords, but a disservice to audiences that either yearn for depth or don't yet know that they do—people who might never discover their passion without a cinematic shepherd. And yet, the profession comes under increased fire at the same time a serendipitous release makes an undeniable case for its value: Chain Reactions, a feature-length piece of film criticism slicing into the meat of one of the most famous horror movies ever made, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

Five interlocking video essays from Alexandre O. Philippe (Lynch/Oz, 78/52) juxtapose the personal angles and insights of its interviewees—comedian Patton Oswalt, filmmakers Takashi Miike and Karyn Kusama, critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas, and author Stephen King—with harrowing images from Tobe Hooper's grisly, sunbaked, rural mania. Less stretched-thin than some of Philippe's other film examinations (like the Alien deep-dive Memory), Chain Reactions discards behind-the-scenes trivia or scenic breakdowns for the specific preoccupations of its subjects. It's this more humble and personal approach that gives the documentary an accessible, conversational atmosphere, like these five people were shooting the shit in the lobby of an indie theater after a rep screening of TCSM. Like the best film criticism, it uses a movie as an instrument to push your brain in a new direction, to invite you into their world, and to understand that we all see something different even when watching the same thing.

Maybe the best way to advocate for the value of this quintet sharing their experiences with Texas Chain Saw is to share my own. When I was an 11-year-old living just north of Dallas, making regular trips out into the scrap-metal-in-the-yard boonies to visit my more hickish relatives, I got invited to a sleepover. It was hosted by a girl whose parents offered to put a movie on the living room TV while our rowdy bunch of tweens waited for the pizza to arrive. I don't remember it turning on, I don't remember it starting up, I only remember the screaming. Those closest to the TV started it, and as the Red Sea of traumatized children parted away from the screen, I caught enough viscera—in a locale familiar enough that, at any second, it might reveal my Boomhauer-voiced uncle spitting into a can—that I had bolted to join the line forming in front of the telephone, now a hotline for moms and dads to come pick us up. I think my host's parents just decided they didn't actually want a bunch of kids in their house all night.

Looking back, there's no way that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre actually played long enough at that party to get to anything gruesome. I certainly didn't see any of its more disturbing moments until much, much later. But my fears filled in the blanks. I had nightmares for a few nights, built out of what I didn't see and what I'd already worried about on every Thanksgiving visit to the middle of nowhere. The suggestions offered by Hooper's grungy frames, the cruel sun beating on its characters, the realistic confusion of its insular setting—its power had affected me before I had even really watched it.

Some of Chain Reactions‘ participants have similarly intimate stories to share, like Stephen King, whose hospitalized viewing of Blair Witch gets a shout-out during his section. Others approach it with a gleeful professionalism, like Karyn Kusama, who continues to draw inspiration from its contaminated well. What's invigorating about the film and the criticism it houses, is how different everyone's approach to the same subject matter is. 

Prolific gorehound Miike—who explains that, for a time, the film made everyone in Japan think that Texas was this logicless, fucked-up nightmare place—briefly considers how the film changed the trajectory of his life. He had intended to go see a wholesome Charlie Chaplin movie on the day he caught TCSM. We wouldn't have the piano wire of Audition or the ultra-violence of Ichi The Killer without a serendipitous journey into Leatherface's world. 

Even though Chain Reactions keeps returning to key moments of footage and particularly essential aesthetic elements, the connections the interviewees draw to them are impressively diverse. Aussie Heller-Nicholas, the one film critic in the group, finds eloquent echoes of Outback cinema in the colors, textures, and masculinity of the American West. Miike finds an expression of pain. Patton sees embodied reactionary politics. King sees a blurring of the line between reality and fiction: “It looks fucking real!” Their film touchstones range from the emotionally crushing anime Grave Of The Fireflies (Miike) to the Ray Harryhausen sci-fi Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers (King) to the Soviet shocker Come And See (Kusama). Multiple people cite experimental master Stan Brakhage.

It's this wide-ranging, international taxonomy of influences, anecdotes, comparisons, and memories, all grown from the same cultural root, that makes criticism such a special pursuit. Always changing, always expanding to include the unique perspectives of the latest person to have logged a film on Letterboxd, the conversation around and about films is often just as exciting and meaningful as the films themselves. Sometimes, they're good enough, as in Chain Reactions, to make entire movies out of them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","MegaDoc is the Rosetta Stone for appreciating (if not understanding) Megalopolis","https://www.avclub.com/megadoc-rosetta-stone-making-of-doc-megalopolis-mike-figgis-francis-ford-coppola","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The question that everyone walked out of Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis with was simple: “What the fuck?” 

It wasn't a question of who put up the cash for the wild-eyed passion project of Roman politics, modern sins, and sci-fi ideals. Coppola famously financed the thing himself, liquidating his assets in other industries in order to make a final epic statement in the one he chose to devote his life to. It also wasn't a question of how the unwieldy behemoth was made in a practical sense—how exactly the famously long-gestating film, which had been rattling around Coppola's brain since 1983, finally got recorded, edited, drenched in inconsistent visual effects, and pushed into movie theaters. Those interested could find plenty of leering production coverage from trade outlets eager to luxuriate in what was seemingly predetermined to be Coppola's financial and critical failure. No, that shared takeaway question was really one of understanding—it was a truncated “What the fuck was that all about?” MegaDoc, Mike Figgis' on-set making-of documentary, doesn't provide an answer that leads to traditional understanding, but it is a Rosetta Stone for appreciating the crystallized zeal that is Megalopolis.

Late in MegaDoc, Figgis (whose features include the Oscar-winning Leaving Las Vegas) notes that, “All the really good documentaries about filmmaking have actually been films about disasters.” This at least applies to the one documentary closest in proximity to MegaDoc: Eleanor Coppola's Hearts Of Darkness, about her husband's Apocalypse Now. But MegaDoc is not a really good documentary. That's partially because Megalopolis is more than a disaster, and partially because MegaDoc stares with such a lovingly uncritical eye at the chaos around it, like a sober friend affectionately humoring a group of wavelength-aligned drug-trippers. 

Any supplemental material would cower in the shadow of Coppola's grand vision, so Figgis does the bare minimum. MegaDoc‘s simple titles and bad Seinfeld bass licks puncture the expensive, obtuse audacity in front of it with cheap, honest fascination. Shooting with a little Nikon Z8 rig and with no plan other than to see what happened as a living legend poured $120 million of his own money into a film, Figgis sits through oddball acting exercises, contentious filming, and the growing sense that everyone's imbibed at least some of Coppola's Kool-Aid. After being initially drawn in by Coppola's name, money, or enthusiasm—mostly the latter, it seems—cast and crew seem to accept their shared fate.

And every cast before seemed to do the same. Figgis juxtaposes his behind-the-scenes view of moments that made it into the finished movie with those same moments in table reads that took place years, even decades prior. Robert De Niro is there as a favor; Uma Thurman and Billy Crudup go through the motions; footage from 2003 observes Ryan Gosling smirk through a role taken over by Shia LaBeouf 20 years later. Giancarlo Esposito, who somehow stuck around since those initial table reads, is one of the infectious true believers ready to preach the gospel of Coppola. Actually seeing the time investment, that continuity of care by Coppola—well, even if it's in service of something completely ridiculous, the dedication is hard not to admire. It's one thing to simply read about something being stuck in production hell, but another to watch a piece of art claw its way out of the pit.

There are plenty of enjoyably loopy evangelists on set, but the people who most bring out Coppola's magnetism are those butting heads with him. Among these are assistant directors (who note that Coppola will yell and storm off, then apologize after), department heads (some of whom are admonished for being too slow during the massive production, then fired), and cinematographer Mihai Mălaimare Jr., who argues with the director about maintaining lighting continuity. “To me, your job is not to match all the light,” Coppola gripes. “Your job is to get beautiful images of the scenes that we have.” 

The main force opposed to Coppola is the opinionated and unrelenting LaBeouf, who antagonizes the octogenarian more than any of the other actors—ironic considering that, in LaBeouf's words, he has “the least job security” of the cast considering his history of legal issues. But their sparring, around topics both dully practical and bracingly ideological, settles in the same place as the interactions with his peers (like the constantly amused Aubrey Plaza) who thrive off the circus-like atmosphere: It might not be the way anyone else makes movies, but that's the point.

Common sense and industry standards be damned, Coppola knows what he wants, and he wants it now! He bought up an entire hotel for the shoot, knocked down the walls, and put in a full-sized screening room, turning it into his own mini-studio for just one film. That curmudgeonly confidence is winning, even if the craftspeople working for him scratch their heads at his disregard for best practices.

But, as Coppola reiterates, he isn't interested in best practices. He's got plenty of money, fame, Oscars, and love. He's old, he's rich—all he wants now is to have fun! “Toil gives you nothing,” he says. “Play gives you everything.” Fittingly, he's inspired by Jacques Tati, who went bankrupt making his masterpiece Playtime: “Who cares if you die broke if you made something that you think is beautiful?” That's all that matters to Coppola, and this charming ethos is as clear throughout the production as it is in the final product. It also seems like he's had it for his entire career. George Lucas, Coppola's longtime friend, sits down for an interview where he good-naturedly shakes his head at the antics of his fiscally irresponsible buddy. But he also acknowledges that none of this is a front, or hot air, or some play for the cameras. Coppola really is that earnestly interested in pushing the form forward while having a good time.

As I wrote a year ago when it was released, where many modern movies are imaginatively stingy, misers trying to capitalize on the lowest common denominators, Megalopolis is a gluttonous hedonist, aimed at pleasing exactly one person. Your retired parents might fill their closets with the ephemera from new hobbies, spending their time on puzzles or crochet or building elaborate obstacle courses for their cats. Francis Ford Coppola is doing that on a $120 million scale. Especially as seemingly every other rich person in the country spends their cash in the cruelest way possible, there's beauty in that.

It's a beauty that MegaDoc soaks up, the thin film seeming to have some self-awareness that it's a lark, a glorified DVD extra only given a shining solo theatrical release because it's reflecting some of the light still emanating from Megalopolis‘ imploding sun. But even though that apocalyptic fate comes through clear as day in every scene of the documentary, so too does the feeling that Coppola still got what he wanted out of the film. In archival footage sourced from the making of One From The Heart, the 1981 musical flop whose financial failure initially pushed a go-for-broke Coppola towards Megalopolis, the filmmaker says he intends to make movies that explore “what the nature of existence is, what the nature of being a human being is.” Near the end of Megalopolis‘ production, as Adam Driver finishes a climactic speech, MegaDoc catches the director on set coming full circle, 40 years later: “Yeah, the human being is that, goddamn it.”

Now that everyone has seen Weapons, everyone would like to know what the deal with Aunt Gladys is. Answers are the scariest part of any horror movie, but, heck, not even Gladys bothers justifying her behavior anymore. Since Weapons didn't offer much in the way of backstory the first time around, director Zach Cregger is rectifying that by giving the film's strangest element a prequel to explain herself. Speaking to Fangoria, Cregger said that he's talking to Warner Bros. about a prequel starring everyone's favorite aunt. “It is real and I've been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There's a story and I'm pretty excited about it. It's not bullshit.” Cregger said. “I was ready. I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out.”

Gladys, Cregger says, is based on his lifelong fear of Lil (Kimberly Ann Cole), the walking cipher from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me that Gordon Cole (David Lynch) introduces to Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanely (Kiefer Sutherland) as they investigate the Theresa Banks murder in Deer Meadow. “She's wearing this crazy, outlandish, brightly colored outfit,” Cregger said. “She's making this weird face and doing this weird peacock dance. It just scared the shit out of me as a kid. I knew one day I was going to explore something like that, and this was my chance.” With Weapons ruling the late-summer blockbuster, it sounds like he's going to get his chance again.

After playing nice with the administration on Thursday, Jon Stewart returned to The Daily Show to do what he does best: Make fun of Ted Cruz. But that wasn't all that was on his mind with tonight's main segment. It's been a long day. After Disney reinstated Jimmy Kimmel, Donald Trump held a press conference about the unproven dangers of curing headaches. For the most part, though, Stewart focused on how flagrant the president has become and how bad Ted Cruz's Princess Bride impressions are.



Stewart spent a lot of time tonight mocking Cruz, but the Texas senator was not the object of his ire. Stewart spent the opening 20 minutes showing Trump's brazenness and the shamelessness with which he treats his power. This isn't exactly news, but Trump 2.0 is a mask-off presidency—unless you're a federal agent looking to snatch people off the street, then it's mask on. Between his belief that “bad” stories about him should be “illegal” and his message to Pam Bondi on Truth Social ordering her to prosecute his political enemies, the pretense is gone. It's become so bad that even Cruz called FCC Chair Brendan Carr's now-infamous “we can do this easy way or we can do this hard way” comment “dangerous.” Not that anyone can count on a sitting member of Congress to do anything about it. Still, it's important to acknowledge where we're at.

“You don't have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump's authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law,” Stewart said. “He does not give a shit anymore. He's saying it straight up. Trump is saying, ‘The people like dictators.' Trump is saying, ‘I hate my opponents and I want them punished.' Trump is saying, ‘I'll use the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal.'”

That's where we're at. So, without further ado, here's that video of Ted Cruz's Simpsons impression from, Jesus, a decade ago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sinclair will continue preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live!","https://www.avclub.com/sinclair-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

Following Disney's decision to return Jimmy Kimmel Live! to the airwaves, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced today that it would continue to protect viewers from Kimmel's comedy by preempting the show. Sinclair shared a statement (per Deadline), stating that talks with Disney are still ongoing.

“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,” the statement reads.

Earlier today, after pushback from consumers, employees, artists, unions, and those concerned about the future of free speech in a country that censors its most mainstream comedians, Disney announced that it will “return the show on Tuesday.” Disney also said that its initial decision was “made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” After days of “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,” the company reversed course. Those comments were: “The MAGA Gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

Kimmel's comments set off a firestorm. Shortly after Kimmel's show last week, FCC chair Brendan Carr said on a podcast that affiliates could “do this the easy way or the hard way” regarding broadcast licenses for affiliates that air Kimmel. Carr has since walked back those comments, which many interpreted as a threat. Though he spent the evening sending celebratory GIFs to reporters, Carr denies that his words were meant as a threat. Threat or not, his words got results because Nexstar, which is awaiting FCC approval of a $6 billion purchase of its competition, and Sinclair sprang into action to pull the comedian.

The second-largest television operator in the country, Sinclair holds 39 ABC affiliates across the country, the largest number of ABC affiliates in America. Though Disney will continue airing the show on ABC, Sinclair's preemption means that the show won't actually broadcast in large swaths of the country.

Miley Cyrus started working on “Hannah Montana” when she was still young. Nowadays, she has a successful music career that has earned her multiple awards and countless fans. However, during a chat with fellow star Pamela Anderson for CR Fashion Book published on Monday, September 22, Cyrus revealed that she might want to walk away from her career at some point.

“I actually had this moment the other night where I was lying in bed thinking, ‘Wow, I really jumped on a train when I was 11 years old, and I've never gotten off,'” Cyrus told Anderson. “I made a decision at 11, and I've never stopped.”

She added, “I made this deep commitment, and I never questioned it or reexamined it.”

Cyrus may have spent the bulk of her career not questioning whether or not it was what she wanted at the time, however, that eventually changed.

“It wasn't until my late 20s and early 30s that I started reevaluating: ‘Is this still what I want?' So far, the answer has been yes, but I'm not afraid of the day it's no,” she said while talking to Anderson for CR Fashion Book. 

Granted, she admitted, “I don't know if that day will come — when this no longer has my heart the way it does now.”

However, she knows that she might not always feel the same way. “Like you said, there could be a season where all of this no longer interests me, and that's okay,” she added.

Anderson responded by telling Cyrus: “You'll always be creative — even if it's in a garden, you'll never get rid of that. It's just a matter of if you get off the crazy train.”

Cyrus may still be interested in making music and performing on stage, however, she longer wants to do one major part of her career: tour.

“I do have the physical ability,” she noted during an interview on Good Morning America that took place on July 15. “I have the opportunities to tour, I wish I had the desire, but I don't.”

“I also don't think that there's an infrastructure that supports artists,” she added. “It's really hard to maintain sobriety when you're on the road, which is kind of a pillar of stability in my life. It's really hard to keep mental wellness.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Keanu Reeves Sets the Record Straight on ‘Secret Marriage' Rumors","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/keanu-reeves-alexandra-grant-marriage-update/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:15:03 GMT","

Keanu Reeves and Alexandra Grant are still going strong, but they haven't said “I do.” The “Matrix” star addressed fresh marriage rumors this week, with his representative confirming that the couple has not tied the knot despite recent speculation. “It is not true,” Reeves' publicist told E! News on Sept. 22. “They are not married.”

Though wedding bells haven't rung, the couple's relationship is still going strong. Earlier this month, Grant celebrated Reeves' 61st birthday on Instagram with a heart-shaped cake and the caption: “To Keanu—who saw this post as a draft!—I am so grateful for your love and partnership.”

Reeves, 61, and Grant, 52, met at a dinner party in 2009 and subsequently collaborated on books, including “Ode to Happiness” (2011) and “Shadows” (2016). They co-founded the publishing house X Artists' Books in 2017 and appeared at art events together long before making headlines.

Their romance became public in 2019 when they were spotted walking hand in hand at the LACMA Art + Film Gala. Grant later admitted to Vogue that she was surprised by the media frenzy that followed, saying, “I think every single person I knew called me in the first week of November.”

The visual artist has often spoken about how their partnership has empowered her. “He's such an inspiration to me,” Grant told People in 2023. “He's so creative, he's so kind. He works so hard.”

She added that their later-in-life romance allowed her to step into the relationship with confidence. “The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun. I feel very confident in the relationship on the red carpet. I feel confident on it alone.”

Reeves has been candid in rare moments about their connection. In 2020, he told Parade, “It's been really wonderful to be with Alexandra. We enjoy each other's company, whatever that may be.”

He also revealed their last moment of bliss during a People interview: “A couple of days ago with my honey. We were in bed. We were connected. We were smiling and laughing and giggling. Feeling great. It was just really nice to be together.”

Most recently, the couple shared a kiss at the 2023 MOCA Gala in Los Angeles and appeared side-by-side at the screening of Reeves' film “Ballerina,” showing that even without marriage, their love remains strong.

The “America's Got Talent” season 20 finale airs this week on NBC. It's time for the Top 10 finalists to take the stage and perform for America's votes. By the end of this week, the winner of “AGT” 2025 will be crowned.

With the Finals of ‘America's Got Talent” 2025 upon us, it means we have some schedule changes for this week. Find out the “America's Got Talent” season 20 Finals schedule below.

A post shared by America's Got Talent – AGT (@agt)

“America's Got Talent” season 20 finale week kicks off on Tuesday, September 23, 2025. While the normal live shows have aired at 8/7c on NBC, there will be a time difference this week.

Because “The Voice” returns for season 28 this week, that means NBC will air an hour-long episode of blind auditions starting at 8/7c. The Final Performances on “AGT” 2025 will immediately follow, starting at 9/8c on NBC.

On Tuesday night, the Top 10 acts will perform one last time for America's votes. They will be fighting to win $1 million and be named the best act in America.

A post shared by America's Got Talent – AGT (@agt)

For Wednesday night, it's going to be all about the “AGT” Finale on NBC. Things will kick off at 8/7c with a look back at the Top 10 performances from the night before.

This is a chance for viewers to check out the performances, in case they missed it. However, voting will be closed when this episode airs. This episode will dive into the journey the final acts took to the finale, including behind-the-scenes footage.

From there, the Finale Results will air starting at 9/8c on NBC. This two-hour episode will feature a slew of guest performers, including Ciara.

In addition to the performances, we will asl have host Terry Crews delivering the results throughout the show. The “AGT” results are all about how America voted.

When 11:00 p.m. ET rolls around, Crews will reveal the results, and the winner of “America's Got Talent” season 20 will be crowned.

So, for this final week of “America's Got Talent” season 20, both nights of shows will start an hour later at 9/8c. These new episodes will air exclusively on NBC, and then be available for streaming the next day on Peacock.

If you are interested in auditioning for “AGT” season 21, you can check out AGT Auditions for the information you need. You may upload a video directly to the site, submit a YouTube link, or sign up for a virtual audition with a producer.

In the meantime, tune in this week to see who wins “America's Got Talent” season 20.

Many celebrities who have competed on “Dancing With the Stars” believe they went home too early. One of them is comedian and talk show host Sherri Shepherd. Now, she's opening up about her experience in a new interview.

Shepherd was on the September 22 episode of “Watch What Happens Live” and talked about why she wants back on the show after more than a decade for a second shot at the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy. 

While on the Bravo series, she confided in Andy Cohen about her elimination, saying, “I think I was unfairly eliminated. I got eliminated during the tango, and I love salsa, bachata, and tango.”

Shepherd continued, “I got to the fourth week, and I was eliminated.” 

But she would love to do “Dancing With the Stars” again, she said. “I really want them … if they have a fan favorite [season], I would love to go back to Dancing With the Stars. I loved it. It was the best experience of my life.

“I loved being on the show because it's such a family. I keep in touch with everybody,” she said. 

Shepherd competed on season 12 of “Dancing With the Stars” in 2011 with Val Chmerkovskiy as her partner.

Shepherd currently hosts the hit daytime talk show “Sherri.” According to PEOPLE, she opened up in a recent episode about being eliminated and revealed that she cried “profusely.” 

“People thought I was crying because I didn't execute my paso doble correctly,” she said. “But I literally was crying because I was calculating my bills.” 

She went on to say that she had plans to use the money to pay for her son's tuition as well as her mortgage. Shepherd then joked, “I've gotta take that car back because I thought I was gonna get the Mirrorball.”

She added, “I need money!” Shepherd explained that it's in the best interest of the stars to last longer on the show because it means they'll earn more money.

Despite not winning “Dancing With the Stars,” Shepherd's career has been on the upswing ever since. Her talk show began in syndication in 2022 following the end of the iconic “Wendy Williams Show.” Notably, her show is produced by the same company, Debmar Mercury. She even guest-hosted “The Wendy Williams Show” in Wendy's absence. 

Additionally, Shepherd appeared in Tyler Perry's recent Netflix movie, “Straw.”

You can't keep a strong woman down. As the hands-down stand-out queen of Zach Cregger's massive horror hit “Weapons,” star Amy Madigan has been the subject of some serious chatter in recent weeks. Not only does she deliver, ahem, eye-catching thrills and skin-crawling chills as the witchy villain in the genre smash, her performance has also inspired some early awards chatter.

And while film fans and cinephiles alike love to tout genre performances for Oscar love, it tends to be a tough row to hoe with the Academy folks. Still, Madigan is absolutely deserving of awards attention, but all that talk about just how damn (and damned, depending on how you feel about her deeds) good she is in the film might engender something else: a whole prequel, just for her.

While prequel talked kicked up within days of the film's theatrical release in August, with The Hollywood Reporter noting on August 12 that “Warner Bros. and New Line … are already talking with Cregger about making a prequel exploring the origin story of the strange aunt who suddenly arrives in town.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






That THR report also pointed to the film's “chapter structure centering on particular characters” and that “sources say that Cregger actually had a chapter focused on Gladys and some of her backstory. He ultimately pulled that section from the script for length purposes. Now with the movie's wild success, that lost chapter would be expanded into a full-length story.”

At the time, a source told IndieWire that any plans at the moment are merely speculation. But, speculation aside, Cregger himself has now confirmed in a new interview with Fangoria that he is working on an Aunt Gladys-centric prequel idea.

“It is real and I've been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There's a story and I'm pretty excited about it. It's not bullshit,” he told the outlet. He also added that the prequel idea was kicking around before the film opened to huge success. “I was ready,” he said. “I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out.” 

In August, as prequel chatter heated up, The New York Times asked Madigan about the rumors. “You know what? I think it's really nice to be in a conversation,” she told the outlet. “I'm definitely not poo-pooing it, but because I have been doing this for a long time, things aren't real till they're real. Listen, I love Gladys, I love being in Zach's imagination and being on Zach's page, but what are people going to talk about in a couple of weeks or in November? It's great and exciting when people talk about it, but I'm one of those people that kind of takes it with a grain of salt.”

 










Much will depend on Cregger's increasingly busy schedule. The filmmaker is currently in prep on his next feature, a new “Resident Evil” film based on the video game franchise for Sony. Like “Weapons,” Cregger's take on that IP was also the subject of an aggressive bidding war, one that Warner Bros. pursued before it landed at Sony. That film is set to open in theaters September 2026.

And while an Oscar nom for her work in the genre hit would (still, despite some recent recognitions) be a bit of an outlier in the whole awards world, it would not be new to Madigan: she was nominated in 1986 for Best Supporting Actress for her work in “Twice in a Lifetime” (she lost out to Anjelica Huston for “Prizzi's Honor”).

A Warner Bros. release, “Weapons” is currently available to stream on video-on-demand platforms, including Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Fandango at Home.

Jessie Buckley and Christian Bale make a “monstrous” couple in the first teaser for “The Bride!,” director Maggie Gyllenhaal‘s punk rock take on “Bride of Frankenstein.”

The stylish, colorful, and bonkers first look at “The Bride” shows Buckley being revived and brought back to life as Frankenstein's bride, with him at one point killing some men in her defense and saying “Till Death Do Us Part.” 

While we got a completely different look at the film at CinemaCon back in April, both that first impression and this new one underscore how bold and bizarre Gyllenhaal's take on the monster movie source material is. 

 










The official synopsis reads: “A lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travels to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (five-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman, and The Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!”

The film stars Buckley, Bale, Peter Sarsgaard, with Bening, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Penélope Cruz. For Maggie Gyllenhaal, this is just her second feature film after first directing the very different “The Lost Daughter,” and she's directing from her own screenplay as well.  

The film was produced by Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Talia Kleinhendler, and Osnat Handelsman Keren. The executive producers are Carla Raij, David Webb, and Courtney Kivowitz.

Here's hoping that “The Bride!” is the latest in Warner Bros.‘ current hot streak of ambitious bets on filmmakers, capped by a year that has included “Sinners,” “Weapons,” and “One Battle After Another.” “The Bride!” will be presented in IMAX and hits North American theaters March 6, 2026. 

Check out both a censored and an uncensored teaser, which, by our estimation, is just the subtitle “FUCKING” ahead of the word “BRIDE,” below.

Over the course of her career, Maika Monroe has emerged as one of our most reliable modern scream queens. Between “The Guest,” “It Follows,” “Watcher,” “Greta,” “Villains,” “Longlegs,” “Tau,” and many more, when you see her name in horror movie credits, you can usually bet that Monroe will be the blood-soaked final girl we're all cheering for to the bitter end.

So that makes it all the more interesting that, for her next horror feature, a remake of Curtis Hanson's 1992 horror hit “The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” (which starred Rebecca De Mornay and Annabella Sciorra), Monroe is this time playing the baddie. Per the film‘s official synopsis: “Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as Caitlin Morales, an upscale suburban mom who brings a new nanny, Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe), into her home, only to discover she is not the person she claims to be.”

If you've seen Hanson's film or are at all familiar with its concept, you know that the nanny isn't our sympathetic heroine here. She's the one doing the rocking (of all kinds! physically, mentally, and emotionally!) and upending the lives of a seemingly nice and normal suburban family. What a delicious twist for Monroe.

 










The remake, directed by “Huesera: The Bone Woman” filmmaker Michelle Garza Cervera will arrive on Hulu just in time for Halloween. It also stars Raúl Castillo, Martin Starr, Mileiah Vega, Riki Lindhome, and Shannon Cochran, and is written by Micah Bloomberg based on a screenplay by Amanda Silver. The producers are Michael Schaefer, Mike LaRocca, and Ted Field, and the executive producers are Michael Napoliello, Maria Frisk, and Seth William Meier.

“The Hand That Rocks the Cradle” will start streaming on Hulu on Wednesday, October 22. Check out the film's first trailer below.

One of the year's best documentaries is composed entirely from you-are-there, true found footage that tells of a devastating American story by way of police bodycam video. 

“The Perfect Neighbor,” directed by Geeta Gandbhir, centers on how in June 2023, in Marion County, Florida, a Black family was torn apart by their white neighbor, Susan Lorincz, when she killed her neighbor Ajike Owens, a mother of four. Lorincz had deployed stand-your-ground laws in Florida that enable civilians to use deadly force when they feel under threat of imminent harm.

 










Winner of the Directing Award for Documentary at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, “The Perfect Neighbor” has gone on to play festivals globally throughout the year — including finally this October at the New York Film Festival. Watch the trailer below ahead of the upcoming October release date. Expect “The Perfect Neighbor,” out from Netflix later in October, to land on the documentary Oscar shortlist.

More on the film from David Ehrlich's IndieWire review: “Shot almost entirely by police body cams and interrogation room CCTVs, Geeta Gandbhir's unforgettable documentary crystallizes the horrors of stand-your-ground laws by examining their effects through the lens of a single case — one that harrowingly illustrates the defects of castle doctrines (among other policy failures) by painting a microcosmic portrait of white America's inability to parse between fear and anger. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Stand-your-ground laws aren't even mentioned by name until ‘The Perfect Neighbor' is more than half over, as Gandbhir elects to work the issue from the inside out, with the you-are-there reality of the footage she uses bringing viewers right into the heart of what's ultimately a human matter. Indeed, a subjective camera has seldom been more damning than it is here — here, in an American horror story that doesn't hinge on whether or not white Florida woman Susan Lorincz was actually in danger when she fired on the unarmed neighbor knocking at her front door, but rather on whether or not Susan Lorincz believed she was in danger when the young Black mother from across the street, Ajike Owens, came to retrieve her son's confiscated tablet.”

“The Perfect Neighbor” opens in select theaters on Friday, October 10 before streaming on Netflix Friday, October 17.

UPDATED, September 23, 2025, 11:00AM ET: Nexstar Media, which operates 32 ABC-affiliated stations, has announced it will continue to preempt the show. In a statement provided to Variety, the TV station group owner shared, “We made a decision last week to preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve. In the meantime, we note that ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”
 








Related Stories ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to Return Tuesday Night as Suspension Ends 400 Hollywood Celebs Sign ACLU Letter Supporting Jimmy Kimmel — Without Suggesting Any Specific Action or Disney Boycott 

Our original story, first published on September 23, 2025 at 10:13AM ET, follows.


			Popular on IndieWire		






Jimmy Kimmel is back! (With an asterisk.) After yesterday's announcement that the late night host and his “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would return to the airwaves this evening after Kimmel's “indefinite” suspension in the wake of comments made about Charlie Kirk last week (all told: only three episodes were cancelled), we've got a caveat. 

 










While “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return Tuesday night, September 23, as The Walt Disney Company announced on Monday, NBC News reports that “Sinclair, a company that operates more than 35 ABC affiliates across the U.S., said that it would replace Kimmel with news programming.” 

“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,” Sinclair said in a statement.

Last week, local affiliate companies Nexstar and Sinclair kicked off a firestorm when they stated that they would no longer air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” As of the publication of this article, Nexstar has not announced its plans for this evening.

While Sinclair initially announced its affiliates would air a tribute show to Kirk in lieu of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” that did not happen. Sinclair affiliates instead aired episodes of “Celebrity Family Feud,” like most ABC affiliates, in the timeslot instead.

On Wednesday, September 17, ABC announced that they were suspending Kimmel's show “indefinitely” following a joke that Kimmel made on air that many felt was insensitive and inflammatory in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. 

 










On the Monday, September 14 episode of the show, Kimmel said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” Many felt that this remark implied that Kirk's alleged killer was MAGA, which evidence does not currently suggest is the case.

IndieWire noted in the aftermath that Disney harmed its own business interests by capitulating to Trump. Kimmel was a serious investment of years and tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars. 

The suspension prompted days of discussion about the status of free speech in America and with serious criticism lodged from even conservative Republican senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul against the Trump administration for its coercive tactics in pressuring Kimmel off the air. Kimmel's suspension resulted in protests by free speech advocates in front of his Hollywood studio and an ACLU letter decrying his removal signed by 400 celebrities.

Yaeji has enlisted the hyperpop artist Underscores and rapper Aliyah's Interlude for a new song. “Booboo2” is the sequel to—and reinvention of—Yaeji's 2024 single “Booboo,” and her first song since March's “Pondeggi.” (“A year ago today, I wrote a banger that goes like: ‘Booboo, don't touch me,'” the song begins.) Watch a lyric video, animated by Caroline Waxse, below, and scroll down to see the single artwork.

Yaeji has released a string of loosies and collaborations since With a Hammer, starting with “Easy Breezy” and including recent collaborations with Bambii and Girl Talk, as well as a Teddy Geiger collaboration, “Pink Ponies,” for the Red Hot compilation Transa. She also remixed the South Korean boy band Ateez's song “In Your Fantasy” in July.

Phoenix and Braxe + Falcon are UFOs. The new project from the French indie-rock band and house duo launches today with a nearly self-titled debut single, “UFO,” which you can check out below. Warren Fu directed the photo-montage video.

UFOs said in a press release, “I don't believe in Miracles but I do believe in UFO: Six friends, one song, infinite memories.” “UFO” is also out now as a 12"" vinyl, via Domino imprint Smugglers Way. No news yet on whether more music will follow.

Braxe + Falcon, already a supergroup of sorts, formally united in 2022 with the Step by Step EP. The following year, they remixed “Winter Solstice,” a Phoenix song from the band's latest album, 2022's Alpha Zulu.

The title character of Angela Carter's short story “The Loves of Lady Purple” is a ferocious, man-eating marionette, a mute doll who is more vivid and fearsome than her wires and wigs suggest. As she becomes increasingly more lifelike, the puppet not only upstages but usurps her master until, in a blaze of glory, she rips out her strings, burns down the theater, and sets off to pursue adventure in the wider world. Contemporary pop music is full of would-be Lady Purples: mascots for a creative industry wholly indifferent to their creativity, who (once set free) pursue their own artistry with something like a vengeance. By now the stories are all too familiar: Many of the top musicians working today have at some point found themselves gagged by NDAs, stonewalled by their labels, and saddled with the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel schlock that even AI bots know to turn down for their reputation's sake. If you can't be the perfect product, they reason, it's better to become the industry's worst nightmare.

On the face of things, that's exactly the path Jade Thirlwall took. The Little Mix member's debut single, “Angel of My Dreams” is a glittering rampage of a song, a miniature epic of pop disillusionment that assumes all the distorted roles thrust onto a singer with a perverse, desperate eagerness to please. Thirlwall wrenches herself off her girl-group pedestal by playing up the part of diva: strutting, preening, and wailing over the beat as it veers from overblown banger to overblown ballad and back again. But the song's real heart lies in the raggedness of the transitions, when her voice buckles as it's sped up, pitched down, and progressively bent out of shape. Rounding into the song's final, monumental bridge, her poise shatters as her voice soars. The dream lies in pieces all around her, but in weathering her music's extremes she's finally managed to sound like herself.

Even for those who hadn't kept tabs during her girl-group tenure, “Angel” immediately contextualized a past, present, and future for the singer's music. It was an unexpected and undeniable showcase for years of bottled frustration and originality, and a thrilling glimpse of her own vision as a pop auteur. The track is scattered with Easter eggs alluding to her feelings of powerlessness under major label management. (She developed her understanding of power the hard way: The singer told the New York Times that she was so exhausted in Little Mix that makeup artists would steal into her room and doll her up while she was unconscious.) With full creative control and a loyal fan base, JADE has spent the past year performing show-stopping turns at Glastonbury and the BRIT awards, unveiling fabulously bonkers collaborations, and speaking boldly and with conviction about industry politics and the genocide in Gaza. THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY! was billed as a victory lap even before its release, and the album mostly lives up to the hype. It is the singer's most definitive statement yet, and the most complete manifestation of the artist she's always wanted to become.

Despite its title, the record largely ditches the behind-the-scenes bummer of the entertainment business in favor of putting on a show. Even the most emotionally challenging songs on Showbiz feel lit up with the glee of self-invention, phrasing various flavors of heartbreak in the boldest, most colorful production possible. The brilliantly busy disco of “Unconditional”—which feels like the moody cousin of Annie's “Me Plus One”—was written after her mother was diagnosed with lupus and underlines its urgent plea for a loved one to take care of themself with sudden intrusion of thrashing guitars. Fan favorite “Before You Break My Heart” flips the Supremes' “Stop in the Name of Love” into an echoey, ecstatic banger that Justice would approve of. A rejoinder for a partner to take her feelings seriously, it's just as striking as a labor of love: The price of using such an expensive sample is that JADE's forsworn any royalties from the track. On “Headache,” Thirlwall's chaotic, self-assured teasing is upended in the third act by a chasm of distortion, as she's left gasping, “You still love me,” in a tone that's somewhere between shell-shocked panic and disbelieving joy.

Part of what made “Angel of My Dreams” feel like such a revelation was that Thirlwall tapped into a strain of flamboyance that hadn't already been exaggerated by hyperpop: the overblown melisma of girl-group singing. Thirlwall's pipes have always been an incredibly powerful instrument, but her pyrotechnic vocals on Little Mix songs were often deployed to such basic and self-consciously showy ends that they seemed far less remarkable than they actually were. Her most meaningful course correction on Showbiz is to honor her music's sense of occasion by inhabiting emotion with the full force of her voice—belting, crooning, and faux-rapping. The throbbing synth anthem “Plastic Box” would be a completely unremarkable Robyn rip in any other singer's hands, but Thirlwall colors in gradients of feeling with overdubbed aches, sighs, and roars that make you understand her possessiveness is rooted in deep pain. “Fantasy” strikes the right balance between winking camp and unabashed sexiness. Thirlwall commands the polymorphously perverse siren song with pillowy singing that veers from Donna Summer seduction to Kylie Minogue cheesecake without ever puncturing its rosy, disco-ball mood.

JADE is at her best when she's selling honest emotion in the most exaggerated way possible. Her capacity for slaying, however, is more unwieldy. Even though she never once lacks for commitment, her overblown stunting can trend perilously toward Drag Race spoof. The improbably capitalized “IT Girl” sells the same showbiz drama as “Angel of My Dreams” but with sneering, theatrical irony that doesn't earn a speck of the latter's conflicted, prismatic emotion. “Natural at Disaster” is a melodramatic break-up track addressed to a toxic friend. The song is steeped in the language of mental health, which makes her take-downs sound like they were run by her therapist first: “It's like I'm a moth to the toxicity/You reeled me in, I'm addicted to narcissistic qualities.” Part Coyote Ugly bar dance, part cunty Ratso Rizzo, on paper “Midnight Cowboy” should be a complete disaster, but it's somehow just the right amount of insane. Over a pounding, black-lit dance beat, JADE delivers some of the weirdest boasts in recent memory with an equally absurd degree of commitment. “I'm the ride of your life not a rental/I'm the editor, call me Mr. Enninful,” she vamps with convincing swag, if a questionable grasp of the sexiness inherent in running a magazine.

Even if she doesn't always sell the camp, JADE comes by the extremity of her style in her own singular way. THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY! is a romp of a record, even if it feels front-loaded with bangers—like Addison Rae earlier this year, the album is slightly overshadowed by its hot streak of singles. After years of playing nice, she's finally torn off her strings; but more than the unrestrained havoc, it's the finer touches that make JADE's debut so dazzlingly her own.

In Joanne Robertson's oil paintings, thick knots of red and brown often appear in the lower left-hand corner. They push back against the sloshes of pale color as a visual analogue for how her music works. Those reds and browns are like the rhythmic unrest at the heart of her serene songs, where melodies twist and buckle and collapse. And like her frequent collaborator Dean Blunt, Robertson's visual practice bleeds into her music, shaping its tension and motion. She wanders with supple precision across both canvas and song in an improvisatory state, but it's in music that she comes closest to the divine.

Blurrr, Robertson's sixth solo album and her undisputed masterpiece, is at points so beautiful—53 seconds into “Always Were,” to be exact, or four minutes, 31 seconds into “Peaceful”—that it feels difficult to breathe alongside it. Here, Robertson sounds as though she has reached a stratosphere where the soul can stretch its legs and roam more freely. It is scarcely conceivable that Robertson recorded the album within the confines of a room, constructed from earthly material, somewhere inside a city. For its nearly 45-minute duration, there is only this.

The sound of Blurrr might best be likened to the Cocteau Twins calling from inside the house: a lo-fi rendering of the band's beautiful slurry. Like Elizabeth Fraser, Robertson makes a voice feel much larger than the words it carries, though she isn't singing with an alien tongue so much as blurring words into tonal brushstrokes. If Fraser's gift was a kind of ecstatic, non-linguistic invention, Robertson's errs closer to meaning. Her lyrics hover just beyond grasp, vaguely intelligible but never fully yielded. Grouper is another obvious point of comparison: both artists summon an immense solitude, with melodies and lyrics that seem dredged from half-buried incidents and associations, as if carried across remote distances and centuries before reaching us. Robertson, though, gathers those fragments into her voice, which doesn't just bear them forward but distills them; purified in the very act of singing.

On tracks like “Gown,” where she fully opens her melodic range, her voice is all yearning and suffering. Even in moments when her phrasing feels more provisional and hesitant, as on “Ghost,” it sounds as if she is attempting to stake a claim on the infinite. Her voice and guitar zigzag around one another, rarely colliding into melodic symmetry. Her voice the blur, her guitar the furious red and brown tangles; never just a scaffold but a tactile object that thuds with wood and wire, each string caught mid-rattle, harmonics clanging.

Robertson's music is always in conversation with itself. She responds to her own sounds—and to the energies they draw out of her—in real time, lingering on particularly beautiful lines of open-tuned guitar for several beats beyond the measure, or indulging in vocal curlicues that seem as pleasurable to sing as they are to hear. She is, as her friend Derek Bailey once suggested of the ‘freest' improvisers, still in dialogue with some prior tradition. For Robertson, that tradition is free jazz, a practice that has inspired both her painting and music. Not its atonality, but its insistence on dialogue. Like Cecil Taylor's loose figurations, which cohered through rhythm and energy rather than fixed harmony, her songs are less compositions than nerve-first zones of encounter. They have always been journeys in that sense, but where her earliest recordings could sprawl into unwieldiness, Blurrr feels propelled, as if moving toward a destination that never quite arrives but always draws you forward.

Blurrr is, above all, a lonely record. Even more than on previous albums, Robertson sounds as though she has been left in a room long enough to forget anyone else's presence, her voice and guitar carrying that sense of solitude in every phrase. She captures the unfiltered hum of consciousness, as though she were setting the colors of a brain scan to melody. Across the album, solitude and disinhibition are the same gesture: the absence of an audience becomes the condition for the most audacious wandering.

On the back half of the album, cellist Oliver Coates follows Robertson down into her solitude and draws out the immensity that the earlier songs had only shyly hinted at. The retentive tones Coates and Robertson form together are, in the strictest sense, heaven. Coates gives Robertson's songs a larger wingspan, tracing fine lines around Robertson's watercolor suggestions and flying them to their full, magisterial potential. His lovely melodies seize and carry. It is a gift to hear Coates so sentimental, as though he truly understands the inner grandeur of Robertson's work. This requires no primness, no cool detachment, nothing remotely aslant; only a very direct channel of feeling.

By each track's end, we don't so much see Robertson any clearer than we do the latent ideas and feelings that animate her: tragedy, ecstasy, doom. “Mystery gone into-wait take it with you,” she sings on ‘Gown'. On the page, it barely registers; sung, it strikes hard. And then the silence that follows it feels far heavier than the one before. Blurrr is an epic drawn in miniature. You take it with you.

Elon Musk's estranged father, Errol Musk, is facing several allegations of child sex abuse involving five of his children and stepchildren, according to a new New York Times investigation.


	The allegations against Errol, 79, were detailed in police reports, court records, personal letters, and interviews with family members and social workers. The alleged incidents occurred in South Africa, where Errol lives, and California. 


	Errol — who has not been charged with, or convicted of, any crimes — denied the allegations against him. He told the Times that “the reports are false and nonsense to the extreme.” He suggested the family members were “putting the children up to say false things” to get money from Elon. 


	Several allegations in the story center around a former stepdaughter from Errol's marriage to Heidi-Mari Bezuidenhout, his third wife. The earliest alleged incident occurred in 1993 when the stepdaughter (from Bezuidenhout's first marriage) was four years old. Errol allegedly placed her on a row of trash cans at the family's home in Pretoria, South Africa, and touched her. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The stepdaughter told her aunt about the alleged incident, and the aunt and other relatives reported it to the authorities. An investigation was opened, but the charges were withdrawn as part of a divorce settlement with Errol. (Bezuidenhout and Errol would marry and divorce twice.) 


	Errol claimed that following this divorce, a judge granted him custody of his daughter with Bezuidenhout, and two judges rejected the stepdaughter's abuse allegations. But the Times could not find court records or judges capable of verifying Errol's claim. 

	











	Around 1999, Errol and Bezuidenhout remarried. In 2002, they traveled to California to visit Elon (Errol's oldest child from his first marriage, to Maye Haldeman), who bought them a $2 million house in Malibu. During their stay, according to family members and personal notes, the stepdaughter, by then 14, walked in on Errol in her room allegedly sniffing her dirty underwear.

	The police were called and a complaint was filed with child protective services in Los Angeles. (A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment to the Times, and the LAPD denied a records request.) A restraining order was issued against Erroll, according to three people.


	Errol denied the allegation, saying he had been cleaning up his stepdaughter's room after returning from a trip and finding the house “in a terrible state.” 


	Afterward, Elon reportedly moved his father from the Malibu house to a boat in Los Angeles, and then back to South Africa. But Errol claimed he left the United States on his own, though he was soon reliant on Elon and his brother, Kimbal, for financial support. 


	While Elon reportedly explored keeping Errol's children and stepchildren with Bezuidenhout in California, and even becoming their legal guardian, the family chose to return to South Africa in 2003. Bezuidenhout and Errol divorced again in 2005, though in 2009 they reconnected. Around that time, the stepdaughter, now 21, claimed that Errol kissed her and stuck his tongue into her mouth. 


	She detailed the incident in an application for an interim protection order in South Africa, in which she wrote of Errol, “I don't want him to be allowed to come close to me.” The application was granted.


	Errol denied the allegation and claimed that his stepdaughter “inappropriately kissed” him while he was sleeping.

	As an adult, the stepdaughter struggled with drug abuse and homelessness. She told the Times that she tied her drug use to the trauma she experienced growing up. While Elon provided some support to the stepdaughter from afar, when she was 29, the stepdaughter reached out to Errol for help as well. The two became intimate and had at least one child together. (The stepdaughter has said they had one child, while Errol has suggested in other interviews that they may have had more. He told the Times it was “none of your business” how many they'd had.) 


	In 2022, Errol allegedly groped their five-year-old son, according to family members. Bezuidenhout texted a relative the following year, “He said, ‘dad gropes his behind.' He screamed, ‘no dad.'” A police investigation was opened, but prosecutors ultimately dropped the case due to insufficient evidence.

	











	Errol said of the allegation, “There was no evidence because this is nonsense.” 


	The other allegations of abuse against Errol were mentioned in the application for the interim protection order filed by the stepdaughter. She claimed that Errol also abused one of his stepsons, who later died in a car accident, as well as his two daughters with Bezuidenhout.


	While the stepdaughter did not provide details, Bezuidenhout did reference abuse allegations from one of her two daughters with Errol in a letter she sent Elon around 2007. Another relative mentioned the same allegations contained in the protective order in a note sent to Elon in 2010. 


	Errol called the accusation that he abused his stepson “nonsense,” and the claims involving his daughters “absurd.” 


	Elon declined to comment for the Times story, and a representative did not immediately return additional requests for comment.

	Over the years, Elon has been frank — if not exactly full of details — when discussing his problems with his estranged father. In a 2017 Rolling Stone story, he called Errol “such a terrible human being,” but did not provide specifics. “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil,” he said. “He will plan evil … You have no idea about how bad. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.”


	In Walter Isaacson's 2023 authorized biography, Elon said his father had been “uncomfortably attentive” to his stepsister. He added that he was angry with Errol for his “inappropriate behavior.”

	Media group Nexstar has joined Sinclair in blocking Jimmy Kimmel Live! from returning to broadcast on its ABC-affiliate stations. In a press release, the company stated on Tuesday that it would “continue to preempt” the series and “monitor” the late-night host's return to television.


	Last week, Kimmel was “indefinitely” suspended by ABC after comments he made on Jimmy Kimmel Live! about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and following a threat from President Donald Trump's FCC chair. 


	“We made a decision last week to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse,” Nexstar said. “We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve.”


	The comment Kimmel made that was deemed “insensitive” enough to halt the long-running, late-night series, impacting not just the host but also the extensive crew that keeps the show running, was, “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” Kimmel then pointed out that on more than one occasion, Trump redirected questions about Kirk's death to the construction of a ballroom in the White House.

	











	Disney reached a formal decision to bring the series back following “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,” the Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. 

	











	On Monday, Sept. 22, the ACLU published an open letter signed by more than 400 figures across the entertainment industry that pushed back against “government threats to our freedom of speech.” The letter read, “In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.”

	Late-night hosts celebrated the comeback of Jimmy Kimmel after ABC temporarily suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live last week. 


	Speaking on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart recounted how ABC announced that Kimmel would return to TV on Tuesday night, noting that the audience response helped to convince Disney to do the right thing. 


	“That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building, that really worked, congratulations,” Stewart said. He added, “Wasn't it interesting, to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life? It's one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers? Nah. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can't watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football? Or listen to early Hilary Duff?”


	Stewart went on to discuss why Jimmy Kimmel Live was pulled, joking that it “had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The host added that Donald Trump may need to look inward rather than continue cancelling everyone who criticizes him after playing a clip of a Fox news correspondent saying, “If Donald Trump wanted to take everyone off the air who had criticisms for him, there would basically only be a handful of individuals left on television.”


	“That is funny, but it's also maybe a cause for self-reflection?” Stewart replied. “‘Hey, if everybody on TV is criticizing me, except for like four people, and one of them is my daughter-in-law, am I the drama?'”

	











	On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert explained that “our long late-night national nightmare is over.” “This is wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff,” Colbert told his audience to loud applause and cheers. “I'm so happy for them.” He added, picking up his new Emmy, “Plus, now that Jimmy's not being cancelled I get to enjoy this again. One more I am the only martyr in late night! Wait, unless CBS, you wanna announce anything?”

	He acknowledged that Disney folded because so many viewers cancelled their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions. “Which explains why the other trending search was ‘how to entertain feral child without Bluey?'” Colbert joked. He added, more seriously, “So Disney put Kimmel back on because you, the American people, were upset.” 


	On Late Night, Seth Meyers noted that there has been backlash from conservatives as well as liberals about how the Trump administration is censoring comedians, including from Ted Cruz. “I want to say I agree with Ted Cruz and I want to say it because I feel pretty sure there won't be another occasion to say it,” Meyers said. 


	Speaking specifically about Kimmel, Meyers also spoke about the “massive national backlash” to the FCC attempting to silence the host. “I haven't seen a poll yet, but I think if you asked Americans if the president should be dictating what TV hosts can and can't say, you'd get about 3 percent positive and…” Meyers said before cutting to a clip of Trump saying, “97 percent negative.”


	On Monday, Disney has reached a formal decision to bring Kimmel back to the ABC airwaves just one week after his indefinite suspension following statements he made on Jimmy Kimmel Live about Charlie Kirks' assassin and after a threat from President Trump's FCC chair.


	“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” the Walt Disney Company said in a statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

Kamala Harris praised Disney‘s decision to return Jimmy Kimmel to the air during an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC last night. 


	“Talk about the power being with the people and the people making that clear with their checkbooks as it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel,” Harris told Maddow. “We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes and it moved a decision in the right direction.”


	During the interview, Harris referred to Donald Trump as a “tyrant” and said he is “abusing the power the people vested him with.” She reflected on the president's efforts to control the actions of corporations like Disney, who caved to pressure from the FCC when they pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air last week. Harris noted that corporate leaders seem to want to “please” Trump. 


	“I always believed that is push came to shove, these titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions,” Harris said. “And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been — I use the word feckless. It's not like they're going to lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons.”

	











	She continued, “I am a lifelong public servant. I've worked closely with the private sector over many years. And I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions. And one by one by one, they have been silent. Perhaps it is because they want to please him and nominate him for a Nobel Prize. Perhaps it's because they want a merger approved, or they want to avoid an investigation, but at some point they've got to stand up for the sake of the people who rely on all of these institutions to have integrity, and to at some point be the guardrails against a tyrant who is using the federal government to execute his whim and fancy because of a fragile ego.”

	Harris explained the the issue is “bigger than Donald Trump.” “So when we talk about where the fight must go, there is the aspect of it that is about the immediate moment, such as the weight of the federal government being used to silence critics, citizens, and it must be about understanding that this did not just happen overnight, and we have to pay attention to an agenda that is not going to necessarily go away when this guy is finally turned out of office,” she said. 


	Elsewhere in the conversation, Maddow asked Harris about her relationship with Joe Biden. In her book, Harris wrote that Biden's decision to run for re-election was driven by “recklessness.” Harris told Maddow she takes responsibility for contributing to that. 


	“So when I write this, it's because I realize that I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on,” she said. “And so when I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.”


	Maddow asked Harris if she would consider running again in 2028. “That's not my focus right now,” Harris responded. “That's not my focus at all. It really isn't.”

	Forty years after her first memoir, Elvis and Me, revolutionized the modern-day lore surrounding the King of Rock & Roll and his young bride, Priscilla Presley has released a new book that picks up where her last one left off.                                                  


	In Softly, As I Leave You: Life After Elvis, the actress and author known mononymously as Priscilla delves into the life she forged for herself in the decades after she met Elvis at age 14, married him at age 21, and left the music legend in 1972. The new book, released Tuesday, is filled with heartache and loss. It follows the once deeply enigmatic first lady of Graceland from Memphis to Hollywood, through several subsequent relationships, and into the depths of her sorrow over the 2023 loss of her daughter, Lisa Marie, her only child with Elvis.

	











	While much of the book takes readers through the well-worn milestones of Priscilla's highly scrutinized life, several passages give intimate new details. Here's what we learned:




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	When Priscilla ended up getting pregnant on the couple's wedding night, she was “stunned,” she writes. “Neither Elvis nor I was ready for a child. He worried about what fatherhood would do to his career. His fans were still adjusting to him being a married man,” she says.

	











	Priscilla confesses she was concerned, too, worrying what parenthood would mean for her fledgling marriage. “There would be no traveling, no romantic interludes for us to focus on each other. For weeks, Elvis and I worried in silence about what was to come,” she writes. She even fantasized about how she'd feel if she miscarried. But, according to the book, “it was Elvis who finally brought things to a head.”

	“He looked at me one day and asked if I wanted to have an abortion,” she reveals. “He told me he'd support whatever I wanted. His words were a wake-up call. The enormity of it hit me head-on, and I began to cry. I told him, ‘No! We can't do that. This is our baby!'” After Lisa Marie was born, “we fell hopelessly in love with her. We could not imagine our lives without her,” she writes.


	Priscilla famously dated Robert Kardashian, father of reality star Kim Kardashian, in 1975, a few years after her divorce from Elvis. She writes that Elvis would have been jealous of the relationship, so she concealed the fact she was in bed with the telegenic lawyer when Elvis called one night at 2 a.m. to boast about a performance. She leaped out of the covers and tiptoed down the hall to take the call in private.


	“Despite our divorce, he still couldn't wrap his head around my being with someone else. He'd have gone ballistic, maybe literally, if he'd known Robert was in my bedroom,” she writes. “Elvis always carried a loaded gun, sometimes more than one. I put my hand over my mouth to stifle the sound of my yawn while Elvis continued to talk.”


	Priscilla says Kardashian wanted to tie the knot, but they weren't a good match. Twenty years later, when Kardashian defended O.J. Simpson in his murder case, Priscilla believed it was crushing for the famed attorney, who was incredibly loyal. “The realization that his friend had committed the murders nearly destroyed him,” she writes. (Simpson was acquitted at his criminal trial but later found liable for the deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, at a civil trial.)

	Priscilla claims that when Kardashian was in the hospital, dying from esophageal cancer in 2003, Kim Kardashian called to connect the two one last time. “Robert and I had one last conversation before he died. He was the kindest of men, and I remember him with great affection,” Priscilla writes.

	











	When Lisa Marie married Michael Jackson in a secret ceremony on May 26, 1994, Priscilla was “appalled,” she writes. She believed Jackson, who was 10 years older than Lisa Marie and a big fan of Elvis, was using her daughter for positive publicity as he battled allegations of child molestation.


	“I knew in my bones that Michael wasn't marrying Lisa Marie; he was marrying the Presley dynasty. The King of Pop was allying himself with the King of Rock & Roll. I didn't believe he loved her,” Priscilla writes. “Michael was a manipulative man, and I think he had his sights set on her long before she realized it.”


	During a walk on a beach in Hawaii, Lisa Marie allegedly turned to her mom and confided, “Michael wants us to have a child.” Priscilla immediately opposed the idea, recommending her daughter take things slow, she writes.


	“I didn't trust his motives. A child would be a proof of virility. And I couldn't help wondering if he wanted to have Elvis's grandchild,” she says, adding that Lisa Marie told her the newlyweds did indeed have a physical relationship, but that she “hardly” saw her new husband.


	“Michael says that if I don't want to have a baby, Debbie Rowe will have one with him,” Lisa Marie purportedly told her mom, according to the memoir. “Oh, boy. Big red flag. Thank God, Lisa agreed with me that it was better to wait,” Priscilla writes.


	Lisa Marie filed for divorce from Jackson on Jan. 18, 1996, less than two years after the marriage. “She had begun to feel like the marriage was a setup. He didn't want to be with her; he wanted to be with Elvis Presley's daughter. If he'd wanted to be with her, he wouldn't have been gone for most of their marriage.”


	Priscilla writes that the year she had legal guardianship of her twin granddaughters, Harper and Finley, was one of “the best and most difficult” of her life. She cherished the time with the eight-year-old girls, but it only hardened Lisa Marie's stance that she wanted sole custody of the twins amid a bitter divorce. In a “last-ditch” effort to fulfill her goal, Lisa Marie asked Priscilla to sign a deposition supporting her allegations that her estranged husband, Michael Lockwood, was unfit to be around them, Priscilla writes. (The memoir doesn't specifically list the allegations, but Lockwood reportedly was investigated and cleared of claims that he had inappropriate photos of minors on his computer.)

	











	According to Priscilla, her relationship with Lisa Marie suffered a devastating blow when she refused to sign the deposition. “I told her I couldn't sign it, for I had never seen Michael behave in the harmful ways she was alleging. Signing it would be perjury,” Priscilla says. “In Lisa's mind, I was the last hope to prove her charges. The court's investigations of Michael had failed to reveal any wrongdoing or neglect on his part, so she had exhausted her legal options. Now I was refusing to back her up in court. To her, it was a betrayal.”


	In recounting Lisa Marie's struggle with addiction, Priscilla says her daughter's drug use climbed as high as 80 pills a day during her breakup with Lockwood. Lisa Marie was in a downward spiral, and she desperately needed professional help after stepping away from the Church of Scientology, Priscilla writes.

	“Though she had left the church, she retained some of its beliefs, including a distrust of psychologists,” Priscilla says. “She was still opposed to therapy, which would have given her a potential outlet for her feelings.”


	Lisa Marie went into rehab in 2016. In a Today show interview in 2018, she recounted her struggles. “I was not happy,” she admitted in the interview. “I have a therapist, and she said, ‘You are a miracle, you really are.' She said, ‘I don't know how you're still alive.'”

							By 

	Tim Dickinson



	An Indiana educator — fired after being targeted by the right-wing X account Libs of TikTok and the attorney general of Indiana for making private remarks on Facebook about the killing of Charlie Kirk — is suing Ball State University for violating her right to free speech.Brought in conjunction with the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the lawsuit claims that the woman's social media post was “fully protected by the First Amendment” and that “her firing was unconstitutional.”


	Suzanne Swierc was the university's Director of Health Promotion and Advocacy — an administrative post, not a member of the faculty — and developed health and wellness programming for students. Ball State is a public institution based in Muncie, Indiana, about 50 miles from Indianapolis. 


	In the aftermath of Kirk's assassination, Swierc reacted with a post on her personal Facebook account, with the distribution limited to her “friends.” As hot takes go, the spice level of Swierc's post was more banana pepper than habanero. “Let me be clear: if you think Charlie Kirk was a wonderful person, we can't be friends,” she wrote. Swierc called the death “a tragedy,” expressed empathy for Kirk's wife and kids, and even insisted that she would “pray for his soul.” But Swierc opined that the shooting of Kirk also served as “a reflection of the violence, fear, and hatred he sowed” — clarifying that this “does not excuse his death.” After highlighting other high-profile killings — including the June assassination of Democratic state Rep. Melissa Hortman in Minnesota, and school children in Colorado who were killed the same day as Kirk's murder — Swierc did add a kicker: “Charlie Kirk excused the deaths of children in the name of the second amendment.” 


	This last line appeared to reflect her view of provocative remarks Kirk had made in 2023 insisting that “it's worth [it] to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”

	We live in an age of snitches. And someone with access to Swierc's private Facebook posts screenshotted the take, juxtaposed it with a screenshot of her online university profile, and posted that two-image mashup to right-wing channels where it went viral. It was soon posted by Libs of TikTok, an X account that makes sport of pillorying progressives whose appearance, views, or actions the account deems ideologically suspect. That X post, which snitchtagged Ball State, was later retweeted by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a former U.S. congressman, who wrote that Swierc's post was “vile” and “outrageous” and “should make people question someone's ability to be in a leadership position.”

	The image of Swierc and her post, replete with a Libs of TikTok watermark, was also uploaded to Rokita's state-run snitch site, Eyes on Education. As Rolling Stone has previously reported, this portal presents itself as apolitical but in fact serves to make life miserable for individual educators whom Rokita and right-wing citizens of the state believe are producing “woke” curricula, or “socialist indoctrination,” that is at odds with “normal society.” 


	After Kirk's murder, Rokita joined in a right-wing scalp hunt that sought to get Americans fired for speech critical of Kirk — at the same moment Kirk was being memorialized as a champion of free speech. The attorney general posted on X that Eyes on Education would now be soliciting “evidence” of educators who have sought to “celebrate or rationalize the assassination.” The elected official declared: “These individuals must be held accountable — they have no place teaching our students.”


	The state compilation of supposed anti-Kirk offenders includes, for many of the entries, how to best contact the presidents or superintendents overseeing the institutions where the educators work. In Swierc's case, Rokita's office listed the email and phone number for the president of Ball State University, as well as when the university holds its next board meeting.

	Amid this state-supported backlash against her writing, Swierc was fired by Ball State within the week. The university even made the decision public in an X post, writing that it had terminated Swierc due to the “significant disruption” her post caused the institution. The move was feted by Rokita: “BSU made the right decision in firing her. Hope her vile comments were worth it.” (Ball State has publicly posted it has nothing more to say about this “personnel matter.”)


	The ACLU of Indiana and Swierc sued the university's president Monday with the simplest of legal claims: “The termination of Ms. Swierc violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.” 

	











	It argues that Swierc's decision to make social media post was private, protected conduct because: Kirk's death was a matter of “public concern”; her post had “nothing to do” with Ball State or the university's leadership or policies; and neither her job duties nor the university's core functions were undermined by her expression. The lawsuit alleges the termination was made with “malicious and/or made with callous indifference to Ms. Swierc's rights.” (The lawsuit name-checks Rokita four times, but the state official is not a party to the suit.)  


	Stevie Pactor, a Senior Staff Attorney with ACLU of Indiana, explained the cause of action: “People do not forfeit their First Amendment rights when they are hired by government institutions,” she said, adding: “Public employees are free to speak on matters of public concern, so long as they are speaking as private citizens. Swierc's Facebook post clearly meets these criteria, and her termination was unconstitutional.”


	In a call Monday, Swierc told reporters: “I do not regret the post I made, and I would not take back what I said.” But she said that she felt “violated” by the betrayal of “someone on my Facebook friends list” who decided to screenshot the post and make it public. Occasionally sipping from a Stanley mug with a Ball State sticker on it, Swierc described the personal consequences of being brigaded by right wing-trolls — including those whipped up by Rokita, whose role in this controversy she told Rolling Stone is “not something I ever would have expected from any party.”


	Rokita's press office responded to a request for comment by forwarding a six-page letter from the attorney general to Indiana superintendents and public university administrators about free speech and teacher terminations. The letter mixes dense legal citations with broad proclamations about the state's supposed interest in policing educator expression. ”As a matter of morality,” Rokita writes, “this moment demands decisive action from public officials to address noxious speech from government employees that undermines public confidence in our schools and corrodes public discourse.”

	Speaking to reporters, Swierc recounted a flood of insulting calls, voicemails, and Facebook messages ranging from “vulgar” to “harassing” that went far beyond the content of her post and questioned her ability to “do my job because of my appearance.” She also described one “true threat of violence” that he said she reported to the police — a voicemail on her cell phone in which the caller detailed a bevy of identifying information about Swierc, and then suggested that “maybe I deserve what Charlie got.”


	Pactor, the ACLU attorney, claimed that Ball State had punished Swierc for routine, protected speech, owing to a controversy not of her client's making. She accused the university of bending to what is known in legal precedent as the “heckler's veto” — which seeks to shout down, and shut down, protected speech. In short, the university fired Swierc not for misconduct, the lawyer said, but because “they got negative feedback from other people. And that's just not an injury to them that the First Amendment tolerates.”

Album Of The Week



The 5 Best Songs Of The Week


French titans Phoenix have long been tight with the dance music world, and their new project depends on that connection. The band's most recent album was Alpha Zulu, which came out in 2022. Since then, they've collaborated with people like Beck, Pusha T, and Kavinsky, and they gave a triumphant performance at the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics. Now, Phoenix have joined forces with Alan Braxe and DJ Falcon, the veteran French dance producers known collectively as Braxe + Falcon, to launch a new project called UFOs. It has nothing to do with the '70s metal band UFO, but it does have something to do with actual unidentified flying objects.

Braxe + Falcon, two cousins who have deep roots in the world of French Touch dance music, officially joined forces to release the Step By Step EP in 2022. They also remixed Phoenix's Alpha Zulu single “Winter Solstice.” For all we know, UFOs might exist only to release one single: the new song “UFO,” which they describe as “six friends, one song, infinite memories.” If that is the case — if the group is fated to only release one song ever, like Stardust with “Music Sounds Better With You” — then they've made sure that one song is a good one.

On “UFO,” Thomas Mars sings about love and flying saucers — “I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in UFOs” — over a percolating haze of keyboards. It's lovely. Warren Fu directed the video, which adds alien spaceships to a bunch of comfy-looking vintage photos, including images of the six musicians involved. Check it out below.



“UFO” is out now on Domino/Smugglers Way, with a limited edition 12″ version only available at some independent record stores. Read our We've Got A File On You interview with Phoenix here.

If you believe certain, odder, corners of the Internet, scientists are either too arrogant to investigate the possibility of alien life visiting Earth, or actively involved in a cover-up. 

But what do scientists really think about UFOs, and aliens more generally? Are they interested in the phenomenon, and do they think it worthy of further investigation? And do they think alien life will exist at all? 

Fortunately, not only are scientists interested in studying the topic, they are even interested in studying whether they are interested in the topic. There are several surveys asking these kinds of questions, with some surprising answers, even if some of the results should be taken with a generous pinch of salt.

Let's start with the more general questions. In a study published in January 2025, researchers from Durham University surveyed 521 astrobiologists and 534 non-astrobiologist scientists on whether they believe life and intelligent life exists out there in the universe. 

""The results reveal that 86.6% of the surveyed astrobiologists responded either 'agree' or 'strongly agree' that it's likely that extraterrestrial life (of at least a basic kind) exists somewhere in the universe,"" Professor in Philosophy of Science, Peter Vickers, explained in a Durham University blog post. 

""Less than 2% disagreed, with 12% staying neutral. So, based on this, we might say that there's a solid consensus that extraterrestrial life, of some form, exists somewhere out there.""

The team found that scientists were optimistic about intelligent life too. 67.4 percent of astrobiologists and 58.2 percent of non-astrobiologists agreed that complex and intelligent life exists out there in the cosmos, though as Vickers points out, given the sheer number of stars out there you could call these numbers quite pessimistic indeed.

How about UFOs and UAPs? These topics have been a little more taboo in scientific circles over the last century. Though scientists are slowly taking it more seriously, with projects like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and its evil twin METI, for the large part scientists do not want to discuss the possibility that UFOs and UAPs could be alien visitors. Of course, this could largely be because there is little convincing evidence to suggest that they are, even if some video footage is intriguing and worthy of investigation.

But there have been anonymous surveys which have attempted to gauge scientists' beliefs on the topic. In 2023, a team from the University of Virginia did just this, asking scientists with tenure or on the tenure track at top research universities whether they or anyone close to them had witnessed ""anything of unknown origin to you that might fit the U.S. government's definition of a UAP"".

The survey found that 18.9 percent of respondents said that they had, while a further 8.7 percent responded ""maybe"". The survey did not ask for further details of these incidents, but asked if there was anything else they would like the researchers to know.

“My entire family and I witnessed a UFO around 1976. It was over our house in the rural northeast (state redacted). Two of my siblings saw it, while the rest of us in the house felt it shake and heard a loud noise. We were eating dinner and the shaking was so intense that we all ran outside,"" one anonymous academic responded.

“I saw an unidentified flying object as a child in (state redacted) (with my sibling) – which my parents didn't believe. The news reported that others saw it, too,"" another added, while a third said they had witnessed two UAPs.

“I used to tell people, but they thought I was crazy or lying – so now I'm silent,"" they added.

Though interesting that some academics do believe they have seen a UAP, it should be noted that the survey respondents were self-selecting and chose to fill in a survey about UFOs, and so perhaps are not reflective of the scientific community as a whole. In fact, the team reported that they received hostile responses to the survey email, with one even writing ""tenure might be tricky for you – good luck.”



Despite the stigma, studies into the topics of UAPs are slowly making their way into the mainstream, particularly with the recent US government hearings on it. NASA, too has released its own reports on UAPs. While they did not find any evidence that UAPs are of extraterrestrial origin, they cannot say for certain what each UAP is, but they will continue to investigate.

""The mission of NASA is to find out the unknown,"" former astronaut Bill Nelson said as the report was released. ""I've said several times in my comments today that we deal openly, and we will be transparent on this.""

In short, scientists are interested in the topic too, and want to investigate further, even if the answer doesn't turn out to be ""it's aliens"".

EERIE footage shows the moment a mysterious V-shaped UFO ""bigger than the stars"" hovered over a Los Angeles neighbourhood.

The clip shows an illuminated object lighting up the night sky as it flew over the city for 30 minutes before disappearing. 

Two residents spotted the UFO from their balcony and immediately pulled their phones out to film it. 

The V-shaped UFO appeared to be black, with extremely bright lights fitted along what appeared to be the hull. 

The footage was submitted to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), a volunteer-operated nonprofit group that's been collecting UFO reports since 1974.

One of the bewildered witnesses said the puzzling UFO appeared to linger in the air, only slightly moving before disappearing. 

They added: ""While sitting on my balcony, I saw a light in the sky bigger than stars usually appear.

""It moved around a little bit but didn't go too far. At the end, it just flew off in the south direction until I couldn't see it anymore."" 

While some conspiracy theorists believe it could be an alien craft, others say the object could have been a secret aircraft, a drone, or an ultralight plane.

The boomerang-shaped object also appeared to have a small body at its centre, making it look similar to an F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter. 

However, that plane, built by the US Air Force, is a stealth jet meant to be almost invisible to escape flight radars. 

There have been several reports this year which specifically mention seeing a V-shaped wedge or triangle with multiple lights along its surface flying over the US, according to NUFORC. 

It comes after the first-ever bombshell footage of the infamous ""Mosul orb"" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq was released.

The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul.

Interestingly, the four-second footage shows the UFO flying at a constant speed without dropping altitude.

The object appeared suddenly and moved erratically in and out of the camera's view.

The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell.

It comes two years after the first still image from the video was declassified by the Pentagon.

Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled.

The videos released in the declassified cases are said to have been observed by US military drones.

The footage showed a mystery ""metal orb"" as it hovered and flew across open airspace.

The incidents were believed to have been recorded in the Middle East and South Asia.

Americans are curious and fascinated about aliens more than ever.

US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard vowed to ""share the truth"" on UFOs after saying she believes in aliens and that extraterrestrials are real.

The Director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's administration hinted that she has a lot of classified information on aliens, but is forced to remain tight-lipped due to her job.

Speaking with Pod Force One podcast host Miranda Devine, Gabbard was asked if ""there could be aliens"".

The US intel chief replied: ""I have my own views and opinions. In this role, I have to be careful with what I share.""

Devine then asked Gabbard if she believes aliens and UFOs are real, to which she replied: ""Yes.""

She said that right now she has ""nothing to share with the public about aliens and UFOs today"".

But she vowed to reveal the truth when the time comes.

""We're continuing to look for the truth and share that truth with the American people,"" Gabbard told the New York Post podcast host.

Lancashire based tech business Universal Atmosphere Processing (UAP), which has developed a pioneering carbon reduction and gas recovery system, has closed a significant funding round.

As part of the raise — which involved institutional, public, and private investors — UAP utilised the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), a government-backed initiative offering tax relief to early-stage startup investors.

By leveraging SEIS, UAP successfully secured a six-figure sum in funding from angel syndicates, including Lancashire County Council's Fhunded Angels network.

With the new investment, UAP will accelerate production of its Mk1 Atmospheric Processor — a proprietary unit capable of capturing high-value noble gases and CO₂ directly from ambient air.

To oversee development of the Mk1 system, UAP has appointed Dr James Myers, former head of aerospace R&D at Victrex, as its new head of engineering.

Founded by Brendan Cornthwaite in 2022 and headquartered at LCC's Fraser House innovation hub, UAP has attracted attention from global scientific institutions.

Its patented technology recently secured a research grant through CERN's Venture Connect programme, supporting the co-development of sensor components which are integral to UAP's system.

In further recognition of its breakthrough technology, UAP was recently selected as one of the top 100 startups in the world by SLUSH, the prestigious global tech summit held annually in Helsinki.

The company will present at the event in November, joining an exclusive cohort of startups considered to have significant global impact potential.

Brendan is also a recipient of the UK Space Agency's Visionary Award, which led to UAP's inclusion in the UKSA's C-LEO programme.

Brendan Cornthwaite, UAP founder and chief executive said: “I'm incredibly grateful for the backing we've had — including the investment secured from the Fhunded Angels community — which will allow us to take this technology to the next stage.

“But for me, this round isn't about celebration. It's about execution. It's about finally building the hardware that's been in my head for over two years — and proving that atmospheric separation can be done differently.

 “Support from CERN, the recognition from SLUSH, and having colleagues like James joining the team gives me the confidence that we're on the right track. And I want to thank Fraser House for being the foundation — it's where UAP started, and where I found the belief to keep going.”

Rory Southworth, LCC's early-stage equity finance lead who manages the Fhunded Angel network, said: “Brendan has been fully engaged with the Fhunded programme since its inception, and we were confident from the outset that we could help him raise the investment needed to turn UAP's vision into reality.

 “It's a great story of local entrepreneurship gaining international traction — and being selected for SLUSH 100 this year underlines just how much global interest there is in what Brendan is building.”

Coun Brian Moore, cabinet member for economic development and growth at Lancashire County Council, said: “Brendan embodies everything that Fraser House and the Fhunded programme were set up to support - an ambitious, resilient entrepreneur building high-value technology with global relevance. He is a fantastic ambassador for Lancashire innovation.”

In addition to its funding success, UAP will join the UK government's upcoming trade mission to South Korea and Japan, followed by attendance at COP30 in Brazil.

Is life possible—or has it ever been possible—on other planets? The (Origin of) Life Marker Chip (LMCOOL) seeks the answer. This innovative chip is being developed by a Dutch consortium led by TU Delft. UT researcher Jurriaan Huskens and his team are going to make the optical sensor selective for the required biomarkers.

A Dutch-built instrument capable of detecting traces of life on Saturn's moon Enceladus—that is the ultimate dream of TU Delft researcher Niels Ligterink. Over the coming years, he will work with around thirty colleagues from various Dutch companies and knowledge institutes on the (Origin of) Life Marker Chip (LMCOOL).

The invention is best described as a tiny yet complete laboratory in the form of a computer chip. It is ""pre-programmed"" to identify specific molecules in liquids; molecules that could point to life, such as amino acids.

""You can best compare our chip to a keyhole, with the molecule we are searching for as the key,"" explains Ligterink, ""Because only one key fits in the keyhole, we can be almost 100% certain that we have captured the molecule we are looking for when we detect something with our chip. This makes our lab-on-a-chip revolutionary.""

UT researcher Huskens adds, ""An important step forward is that we are going to selectively recognize a mirror image of an amino acid. After all, living organisms make only one of the mirror images, and so this recognition is essential to determine whether the amino acid comes from a life process or not.""

The idea for the Life Marker Chip (LMC) was first proposed more than twenty years ago for ESA's ExoMars mission. Although ESA eventually selected other instruments for that mission, the consortium partners remained enthusiastic about the concept. With financial support from the NSO Instruments Program, the instrument is now being further developed so that it can be used on a range of future planetary missions.

One of the greatest advantages of the new LMCOOL is its compact size and low weight. Current life-detection instruments on Mars are the size of a microwave oven and weigh between ten and twenty kilos. By contrast, LMCOOL will be about the size of a soft drink can and weighs only 700 grams. In space exploration, where every kilogram of launch mass matters, the Dutch chip offers a lightweight yet high-performance alternative.

At the heart of LMCOOL lies integrated photonic chip technology. The Netherlands already has extensive experience with this technology in medical applications, but it has never before flown in space. A key challenge is to test and prepare the chip for use in the extreme conditions of space.

In Delft, researchers are investigating under what circumstances—such as extreme temperatures, radiation and vacuum—the chip can function reliably, and what measures are needed to keep the system operational during a mission to Enceladus. Here, the expertise of Space Systems Engineer Vidhya Pallichadath MSc, who has worked on several space missions, is of great value: ""Through prototyping, test campaigns and refining the design, we are increasing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the instrument."" At UT, the optical sensor is being made selective for the required biomarkers.

""This is where the support of the NSO is crucial for us,"" says Ligterink. ""Thanks to the Instruments Program, we can continue developing LMCOOL, enabling us to qualify as a supplier for both small and large European space missions, for example, a future mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus.""

Around thirty engineers and scientists from TU Delft, Lionix, TNO, and the universities of Twente, Utrecht, Cranfield (UK), Leicester (UK), Colorado Boulder (U.S.) and the Open University (UK) are contributing to LMCOOL over the coming years. They are turning promising ideas into concrete blueprints for building a fully functioning prototype. Meanwhile, the chip is being tested extensively to develop the most stable receptors (keyholes) and to validate them under a wide variety of extreme conditions.

The global search for extraterrestrial life continues to capture the imagination, Ligterink notes. In his view, the Netherlands must claim a prominent position in this field. Partly because of the country's strong expertise in planetary research and astrobiology, and partly because investing in technology drives innovation, start-ups and economic opportunities within and beyond the space sector.

""And of course, the biological and medical breakthroughs that may follow once extraterrestrial life has been discovered and can be studied further,"" Ligterink adds. If LMCOOL does make its way to Saturn, it will not be for at least another 25 years. Analyzing the scientific results will then take a further decade.

""By that time, my colleagues and I will be approaching retirement age,"" says Ligterink, ""But that does not stop us from devoting ourselves fully to this instrument. If you want to compete at the top level of planetary research, you have to be willing to invest for the long term.""

The LMCOOL is a compact, integrated photonic chip designed to detect specific biomarkers, such as amino acids, in extraterrestrial environments. Its selectivity for molecular mirror images enables discrimination between biological and non-biological origins. The chip's small size and low weight make it suitable for future planetary missions, including potential deployment on Saturn's moon Enceladus.

Mark Sheppard was the devious demon Crowley (who was born a Scottish lad named Fergus MacLeod) who eventually ascended to the crown of Hell, while sometime allying with Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). He recurred in Seasons 5 through 9 and had a main role in Seasons 10 through 12. Though the British actor left the show under less-than-happy circumstances, Crowley went out in the 12th season's finale with a final satisfying grand gesture: sacrificing himself to seal Lucifer in Hell. Many fans, as we were, were sorry to say goodbye to the wry demon.

Nevertheless, the veteran actor happily appears at numerous SPN conventions in the States and abroad with his longtime colleagues. TV Insider spent time with the generously talkative Sheppard at Creation Entertainment's New Jersey event in May.

Why did you get involved in the Supernatural convention world?

Mark Sheppard: What's fascinating is that sci-f and genre shows tend to get canceled or they atrophy on their own. What is interesting about Supernatural is it has grown bigger through what we lovingly call the Supernatural Family that shows up at conventions. I learned one year at San Diego Comic-Con that these fans raised $2.5 million dollars for a children's charity! What sets Supernatural apart is that the theme of the show is good versus evil, the idea that you do the right thing and the outcome, ultimately, may be difficult, dangerous, and deadly, but will still be something that is worthy of the endeavor. These themes in a time like this are rather special. I've been on shows that have a lot of meaning, like Battlestar Galactica and Firefly and Trek series, that had meaning. But Supernatural has this extra ingredient, the connection between the actors, the characters, and the audience.

For example?

I make fun of Misha [Collins] on a regular basis because it's easy to do. But the man builds hospitals and schools and rescues people from foreign countries. That side of him is unbelievably worthy. And the boys [Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki] have a lot of causes. So, we put forward those causes which we invest our time and our effort into, and the Supernatural Family makes it a million times bigger. My son is a type 1 diabetic, who went to Camp Conrad Chinnock that was for diabetic kids, and a person who used to come to Creation's Supernatural events had discretionary budget for charitable donations from a trust that she had. She literally bought the entire camp's wish list for the year my son attended, and not just bought it, but shipped it! So, all these actions that I've seen over the years are way, way bigger than a little show first on the WB and then The CW.

How did you first come to fan conventions?

 I showed up at a few conventions starting with The X Files‘s first season. I saw the power of how it brought people together. My dad [the late actor William Morgan Sheppard] was in several Star Treks and there was a massive amount of attention for those cons, so I saw the positivity there. I saw people that maybe didn't have a lot of friends or were a stranger in a new city or people with serious disabilities that precluded them from some social agenda. But then conventions became places where everyone was totally accepted.

Beyond conventions, the Supernatural set always had a reputation for kindness. I observed the warmth and fun myself when I visited the show in Vancouver several times. Did you feel that way?

I think what's really fascinating, not many people talk about this, is that Jensen and Jared made a decision very, very early on, when [the late] Kim Manners was running the show, what their behavior was going to be when they worked. They knew that this series was a phenomenon and could be something that had longevity and meant something. And they made a decision to behave. I mean, that's who they are, but they made a decision to outwardly behave in a manner that was so appealing for people to come and work. Actors were treated in a manner that was absolutely superb. That was the tone of the set. And that's why when I got married — I married “a fan” — 160 odd people from actors to electricians to painters to whatever came from Vancouver to my wedding in California on their off week in black tie to celebrate. We truly operated as a very large, wonderfully dysfunctional family. But that tone they created also affects the way we behave here. We take care of each other in order that we can take care of our audience. We try to give them best time we can.

For example?

We're always looking at ways that we can make the cons more fulfilling. We have the concert on Saturday night, which is something I thought was vital to do because we've got so many great musicians — not amateur musicians, professionals. It's always been a high spot in that way. Yes, this is commercial. There's money involved, and that's why we want to give them a wonderful experience. There's a statement we use if someone is new to the fan community: “You are going to make friends.” And they do, often traveling all over the world together to visit the cons. It's such an honor to be able to be present at these events. As a friend of mine said, “You've got such a tough job, then you go somewhere and 3000 people tell you they love you and explain to you why.” It's fantastic.

What's at the heart of this special status Supernatural has?

Supernatural never deviated from themes that tend to unite people in an altruistic form of life. It's not brain surgery, but it is good for the heart and good for the head. I've had people tell me, “The show saved my life.” My response? “No, you did that, but we were happy to help.” I can't go anywhere in the world without somebody going, “Crowley!” Even when I was entering the hospital [when he was suffering heart attacks]. The entire TSA is a demographic that seems to watch Supernatural. I'm going through international customs like the King of Hell.

Not bad considering you weren't one of the heroes of the show and….

I am one of the heroes. How dare you? He absolutely killed less people than the Winchesters!

[Laughs] I will have to check that.

You do. [Note: We may have seen Sam and Dean kill more, but Crowley was, after all, a murderous demon for 300 years.] Crowley ran Hell, and he hated it! All he wanted was to be buddies [with Sam and Dean] and have fun.

Well, considering his mother, the Scottish witch Rowena turned Queen of Hell (Ruth Connell), he didn't have much of a chance.

That's not Crowley's mother, it's Fergus's mother. Fergus MacLeod was a 4'6” Scottish crofter [who sold his soul] who had no bearing on this meat suit. Ruth, however, was fantastic in the role. It might have been even more fun had she been his ex-wife.

What has Supernatural done for you?

I'm so happy to be part of it; my life would not be the same without Supernatural. I refused to be a series regular for about four years. I was busy doing other wonderful things, and it would limit me to be in there. I was offered another series by then CW president Mark Pedowitz, and I went, “I don't think I'm done on Supernatural.” Which was a great choice. I went back for one episode and ended up staying there eight years. The writers didn't particularly write for me; I'm not in any of the flagship episodes. I'm not in “French Mistake,” I'm not in “Baby,” I'm not in “Scoobynatural.” There's no “Weekend at Crowley's.” So, my job was very interesting. There were about 20-30 writers who loved the character but basically would say, “Let's throw this to Mark” — like spaghetti against the wall — “and see what the hell he does with it.” So I'd be, “How do I get to navigate this?” It really was a fantastic endeavor for about six or seven of those eight years. And then, the end served a purpose, and it never really resonated for me.

Was there a favorite episode where everything worked?

We never had enough money or enough time, but we all wanted the show to be the best thing we could make. And we loved the excitement we felt when we knew something had worked. I'd say “Sacrifice,” the episode ending Season 8, is my favorite. It's when I was having the human blood injected into me and we were in a church. It's ridiculous how good it was. It started with [ancient demon] Abaddon [Alaina Huffman] and me tied to a chair, and it ends up with Sam injecting me with human blood. And then the angels start falling through the sky.

That was a great episode; so much happened, including to Crowley, then the King of Hell.

Yes. So through that process, we're outside in the worst weather possible to shoot the outside of a church where the crew nearly died. The winds were insane. I mean, it's as bad as BC [British Columbia] weather can possibly be. We then moved inside to the stage, and we shot all of that in sequence, which is quite rare to do. The working crew who were allowed to talk between set-ups didn't make a sound for two days. None of us made a sound, we were so into what we were doing. I sat chained to that chair for two days. I wouldn't even get up most of the time. Because it was right. Everybody had everybody's back. And Jared will say the same thing. We all put a lot of love into it.

And it seems into the entire show.

Yeah. I've been lucky to do some wonderful shows in my career, but somehow this sort of encompasses all the silliness, the sadness, the darkness, and the lightness of life. And that's what's most important to me.

ATHENS, Ohio (WOUB) – In this episode of Conversations from Studio B, WOUB's Emily Votaw talks with Cleveland-based author Neil Sater about his most recent novel, Atrocity: The Haunting of Moravian Village.

The book tells the story of Sean Davidson, a teenager whose life takes a sudden, nightmarish turn after a mysterious stranger emerges from the night and intrudes on a deliberately strange campfire gathering with his best friend.

The supernatural forces that terrorize Sean are fictional, but their roots lie in a very real historical tragedy: the Gnadenhutten Massacre, also known as the Moravian Massacre.

On March 8, 1782—towards the end of the American Revolutionary War—Pennsylvania militiamen led by David Williamson brutally killed 96 unarmed and pacifist Native Americans, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, at the Christian mission village of Gnadenhütten, near present-day New Philadelphia, Ohio.

In the interview, Sater discusses working closely with representatives of the Native American tribes connected to those who died in the massacre. He also discusses his efforts to raise awareness of this history and the inspiration he finds in rural Ohio—specifically, Tuscarawas, Coshocton, and Holmes Counties—which he fictionalizes as Homer County, the setting for Atrocity, as well as his two other horror novels: Phantom Realm: the Haunting of Misery Mansion (2023) and Mercy Killing: the Haunting of Ghoul House (2024).

Travis Smola   09.23.25


Cryptid animals ride that fine, blurred line between ancient myth and reality. Every corner of the globe has an alleged animal still unknown to modern science. This is not a new phenomenon. Stories about these creatures are hundreds or even thousands of years old. Native American legends have countless tales that stir the imagination, especially for those who frequently visit the outdoors. Correspondingly, many modern-day reports come from avid hunting, fishing, and camping enthusiasts who spend most of their time outside.

Science tends to be skeptical of these legends, but there is enough fact to keep things interesting. With thousands of eyewitness reports of mysterious beasts that fly, creep, and crawl, there must be something more to it. This is not an extensive look at all the evidence, but we will look broadly at the various categories of what defines a cryptid. We will also briefly examine the most interesting and famous ones said to inhabit the United States today.

In simplest terms, the Dictionary defines a cryptid as “a creature whose reported existence is unproven, such as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.” Unlike mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns, these animals often have at least some documented eyewitness reports associated with them. Scientific circles usually treat these reports skeptically, but the stories are intriguing, nonetheless.

Other known animals often lumped into the cryptid category include ones thought to be previously extinct. For instance, the Tasmanian Tiger, or Thylacine, is a real animal native to Australia and Tasmania that was declared extinct in 1982. However, unconfirmed reports show that the species might still be periodically roaming wild, remote areas. Cryptids also include unconfirmed reports of animals in places where they are not native. One typical example is reports of big cats like mountain lions and panthers outside their home range.

Subsequently, the term “cryptid” has become nebulous in nature. It is usually safe to use as a blanket term for any mysterious or unknown animal.

Persistent tales of cryptids have given rise to the field of cryptozoology, which studies hidden animals. Technically, most scientists still consider this field to be “pseudoscience.” However, a handful of professionals have studied cryptids for decades, despite the ridicule. A prime example is Jeffrey Meldrum, a professor of anthropology at Idaho State University. He has openly studied the possible existence of sasquatch for nearly 30 years.

Most skeptics are quick to dismiss claims of cryptid animals. It is hard to blame them when there is a lack of concrete evidence. However, there are notable exceptions. One prominent example is the giant squid. Once a thing of sailors' stories, it wasn't photographed in the wild until 2004. Dead ones had washed up on shore, but a confirmed sighting in the wild eluded science for years.

Another good example is the Okapi. The unusual, horned creature inhabits an isolated area of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists treated eyewitness reports with the usual skepticism for years. The striped ungulate is incredibly weird-looking, so we understand the skepticism. However, in 1901, a native tribe provided British explorer Harry Johnston with a skull and pieces of skin. Later, scientists confirmed the elusive Okapi was the only living relative of giraffes.

For years, the only known record of the coelacanth was fossils. This unusual fish has been around long enough to watch the dinosaurs come and go from this planet. Thus, the scientific community was shocked when a fishing trawler hauled in a live specimen off the coast of South Africa in 1938. It turns out they had been alive and well the whole time. Conversely, local anglers scratched their heads in bewilderment at the excitement of the discovery. They had known of the coelacanth's existence for generations.

Granted, none of these cryptid discoveries are as exciting as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. However, the Okapi and coelacanth prove it is possible for large, unknown animals to hide on our vast planet.

Legends of a tall, hairy, man-like creature are often the first thing most people think of after hearing the word cryptid. Every corner of the globe has some variation of this beast. Stories of Bigfoot date back centuries and are part of Native American lore in the United States. These creatures are six to eight feet tall and weigh over five hundred pounds. Their bodies are covered with black or brown hair. These creatures allegedly leave behind large, three- or five-toed footprints.

Bigfoot's most famous sighting was in 1967, when the Patterson-Gimlin film was captured in Northern California. Scientists and skeptics still debate the authenticity of this film.

The behavior of these creatures varies from report to report. Most describe a shy, elusive beast that tries to avoid human contact. However, a handful of reports describe an animal that is aggressive towards humans. For instance, in 1924, a Canadian man named Albert Ostman claimed a family of the creatures kidnapped him for six days. Another group of Sasquatches allegedly threw rocks at miners in a Washington cabin near Mount St. Helens the same year. Subsequently, the area of the attack became known as “Ape Canyon.” However, such tales are extremely rare. Most reports are fleeting sightings.

Most sightings originate in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. However, beasts with similar descriptions have earned various pet names across the U.S.

Bigfoot: The classic, tall, man-like beast with five toes that inhabits the Pacific Northwest. Standing six to eight feet tall, with long, dark hair. They are very vocal. Reports of behavior vary.

White Thang: Alabama's most famous cryptid has bright red eyes and hair that is as white as snow. Most reports come from sloughs in the northern part of the state.

Mogollon Monster: The nickname for Arizona's resident Bigfoot legend, most seen in the northern part of the state near the Mogollon Rim. Described as being seven feet tall, brown, or reddish-brown, and very smelly.

Fouke Monster: The red-eyed, three-toed monster seen for years in and around the tiny community of Fouke, Arkansas. Sightings reached their peak in the 1970s. Consequently, this legend gained worldwide fame after the release of the 1972 documentary “The Legend of Boggy Creek.”

Selbyville Swamp Monster: This hairy creature allegedly stalked the swamps of southern Delaware back in the early 1960s. Witnesses described dark hair and the beast's terrifying scream.

Skunk Ape: As the name implies, an incredibly smelly Sasquatch-like beast, most seen in the Florida Everglades. Usually described as brown or reddish-brown, they are around five to six feet tall. A handful of videos and photos that allegedly show the beast do exist.

Momo (Missouri Monster): The name given to the monster sighted during a terrifying 1972 Bigfoot encounter in eastern Missouri. This led to an influx of sightings of a dark-haired beast with large glowing eyes.

Taku-He: South Dakota Bigfoot with roots in Lakota Native American legend. This creature sometimes has supernatural qualities.

Tennessee Wildman: Another red-eye creature said to have a horrific scream. The Wildman has red or gray hair and stands around seven feet tall.

Unknown animals soaring through America's skies are a slightly rarer cryptid type. Most eyewitness reports describe creatures larger than a known bird. The reports of winged cryptids can be wild. For instance, the hooved Jersey Devil's demon-like appearance feels like something straight out of American folklore. Others, like the Thunderbird, are closer to a normal bird, only oversized.

Most of these stories are incredibly old. The Thunderbird legend has roots in traditional Native American tales. Reports of winged cryptids describe everything from oversized birds to alien-like creatures from another world. Some of these reports include sightings of UFOs and other strange phenomena in conjunction with the creature reports. America's more famous winged cryptids include the following:

Jersey Devil: An unusual, winged, and hooved cryptid, most famous in New Jersey. Thousands of reports have come from the state's Pine Barrens area over the last 250+ years.

Teratorns: Gigantic, prehistoric vultures that allegedly survived to modern times. New Mexico claims the most sightings of this lost bird.

Thunderbird: This gigantic bird is a Native American legend that sometimes controls the weather through the beating of its wings. Most often reported in North Dakota. One allegedly tried to carry away a 10-year-old boy during a famous 1977 incident in Illinois.

Mothman: Red, glowing eyes are a key feature of this bat-like creature. Point Pleasant, West Virginia, was the epicenter for sightings in the 1960s. Sightings before a famous bridge collapse in 1964 have led some to label Mothman as a harbinger of tragedy.

Van Meter Visitor: A pterosaur-like oddity sighted in Iowa in 1903. Old newspaper reports describe it as having an “unusual glowing horn.”

The Loch Ness Monster is the most famous water cryptid in the world, but it is far from the only one. Reports of water monsters span the globe. North America is no stranger to these tales. The common similarity in these reports is that the sightings take place either in or near water. Water cryptid tales seem localized in nature. Residents know the tales, but they usually fly under the radar of mass media.

The one exception in the United States seems to be Lake Champlain's plesiosaur-like “Champ.” Reports of that monster date back to the early 1800s. P.T. Barnum once put a bounty out for the live capture of the creature.

Sea serpents and plesiosaurs are the most common water cryptids. However, there are some real oddities here. For example, the otherwise unremarkable town of Churubusco, Indiana, is allegedly home to an oversized snapping turtle named Oscar. Loveland, Ohio, turned their unusual 1970s “Frogman” reports into a town mascot and source of tourism.

Unfortunately, none of the United States' water cryptids have come close to Nessie's fame, but they still make for fun legends. America's most famous water cryptids include:

Alkali Lake Monster: Nebraska legend about an alligator-like beast. Reports date back to the late 1930s.

Champ: The plesiosaur-type creature in New York and Vermont's Lake Champlain. Sightings of this creature date back hundreds of years. Analysis of a 1977 photo has been unable to prove or disprove its authenticity.

Tahoe Tessie: Lake Tahoe's resident sea serpent legend that allegedly lives in the deepest, darkest depths of the lake.

Altamaha-ha: This monster is a mix of Native American legend and early Georgia folklore. The creature is allegedly 10-30 feet long and has a head resembling that of a crocodile and a body resembling that of a sturgeon.

Sharlie: Reports of this sea serpent in Idaho's Payette Lake date back over one hundred years. Eyewitnesses claim this creature was 40 feet in length.

Beast of Busco: A dining room table-sized Indiana snapping turtle named “Oscar.” Locals tried using traps and even dynamite to capture it, without success. This legend has a local yearly festival named after it.

Sink Hole Sam: An unusual sea serpent legend for land-locked Kansas. Reports sometimes describe a giant eel or worm.

Pocomoonshine: An ancient Native American legend about a 30-foot sea serpent in Maine's Pocomoonshine Lake. Sightings of this creature date back to the late 1800s.

Loveland Frogman: Four-foot-high humanoid frogs were sighted in Loveland, Ohio, in 1972. This cryptid is now the official town mascot.

Oklahoma Octopus: An out-of-place giant octopus allegedly inhabiting the state's manmade reservoirs.

Colossal Claude: Oregon's Columbia River is allegedly home to this 40-foot-long sea serpent. The most notable sighting happened in 1937.

Block Ness Monster: Rhode Island's resident sea serpent legend. Beachgoers found a mysterious carcass in 1996. However, the body disappeared before scientists could study it.

Bear Lake Monster: Utah legend about a 50-foot creature inhabiting Bear Lake since the mid-1800s.

Other cryptids have descriptions that defy all classifications. These creatures couldn't fit into any other category. For instance, the Enfield Horror's three legs and red eyes do not match any known Earth animal. Other tales, such as the human hybrid Goatman, feel like straight-up science fiction. Consequently, some of these stories have become modern folklore. However, other cryptids still have origins in Native American legends and lore. Overall, these reports are straight-up weird.

The unusual descriptions of these creatures have led to speculation that they came from another world. Two prime examples are the hairless Dover Demon and the Hopkinsville Goblin incident in 1955. In the Hopkinsville incident, eyewitnesses reported a UFO in the sky before the creature's arrival.

Tornit: An Inuit legend about a tribe of wild men in Alaska. However, unlike other Native legends, the Tornit allegedly once lived peacefully alongside the Inuit. Often referenced in tandem with stories about Bigfoot.

Slide-Rock Bolter: Lumberjacks popularized tales of this fish or whale-like creature in the Colorado mountains.

Melon Heads: Small, humanoid creatures with large heads reported in several states. Connecticut's Fairfield County is a frequent area for sightings.

Menehune: Traditional Hawaiian folklore about a tribe of tiny people who live in the forest. Only children can see them.

Enfield Horror: A bizarre, three-legged jumping creature seen multiple times near Enfield, Illinois, in 1973.

Hopkinsville Goblins: Three-foot-high, gremlin-like creatures that attacked a Kentucky farmhouse in 1955. Eyewitnesses said the creatures were impervious to shotgun blasts.

Rougarou: A werewolf-like creature popularized in Louisiana's Cajun folklore.

Goatman: Maryland's strange half-man, half goat legend. Goatman became famous for attacking cars late at night.

Dover Demon: A four-foot-tall creature with a featureless face except for a pair of red eyes. The sightings happened near Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.

Michigan Dogman: Werewolf-like creatures seen throughout the state. Lumberjacks first reported sightings of Dogman in the 1890s. However, the legend did not enter pop culture until the release of a popular song in the 1980s.

Wendigo: A terrifying Native American legend about humans turning into cannibalistic monsters. Wendigo has at least two real-life murders involving cannibalism associated with it.

Pascagoula Aliens: Unusual humanoids with crab-claw hands that captured two anglers in 1973. The men claimed the creatures took them aboard a UFO.

Shunka Warakin: A cryptid hyena or werewolf-like canine hybrid spotted in Montana.

Woods Devils: The nickname given to New Hampshire's resident Bigfoot Lore. However, this one has a twist. The Woods Devil sometimes has tree-like features.

Beast of Bladenboro: An alleged big cat that terrorized Bladenboro, North Carolina, in 1954. This beast left behind dozens of dead dogs, chickens, and rabbits in its wake.

Squonk: A stout, ugly creature of Algonquin folklore said to inhabit the forests of Pennsylvania. Legend says that when captured, the Squonk dissolves into tears and vanishes.

Lizard Man of Scrape Ore Swamp: A gigantic, seven-foot lizard reported by South Carolina residents. It had a reputation for chasing and scratching cars.

Chupacabra: Spanish for “goatsucker.” This creature has two descriptions. Early reports were of a reptilian beast. More recent reports depict something closer to a feral dog with mange. Reports range across Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the southern United States.

Bunny Man: An urban legend of Maryland and Virginia of a man in a bunny costume. He allegedly smashed the windows of multiple cars with an axe.

Beast of Bray Road: Wisconsin's resident werewolf-like creature legend. Most sightings occurred in the 1990s, primarily in and around the town of Elkhorn.

Jackalope: Regular rabbits that have antlers. These unusual creatures have become a symbol of Americana and a fixture in tourist traps of the Western U.S.

The dark woods feed into our imagination, making it easy to imagine the wondrous and mysterious beasts that inhabit the shadowy areas. There have been times when I sat in a treestand in the pre-dawn hours, while knowing an animal was in front of me. However, due to the darkness, I couldn't properly identify whatever was snapping twigs and breaking brush. Plenty of outdoor enthusiasts have had similar experiences hunting, fishing, and camping.

Thus, it is little wonder that cryptid stories hold special significance in American pop culture. These stories tap into our natural curiosity about the unknown. Consequently, even the skeptics must admit that these tales make our lives more interesting. At the very least, it is fun to speculate about what else might be out there.

While we may be living in an information age, that doesn't mean the planet has spilled all its secrets. Scientists continue to find and classify hundreds of new species every year. Knowing that, we hold out hope that some of our favorite cryptids eventually make it onto the lists of known animals. Until that happens, we will continue to enjoy the mysteries for what they are.

They say people find psychics in times of crisis. During my most recent crisis, David The Medium found me. Or, more accurately, his publicist did.David had been a hot topic in the office when the email came in asking if I'd like a private reading with one of the most in-demand psychic mediums in the country, and the only one to hold public readings at the Sydney Opera House — twice.Our beauty director had seen him for a reading a few days earlier, and he had told her spooky, uncanny things that she was adamant no-one could have known: like a fleeting comment she'd made to her brother — and then forgotten about — two days prior; he'd correctly named people in her life on the first attempt; he told her she would receive signs from family members who'd passed away in the form of magpies, which then began appearing in the most unlikely of places and behaving really weirdly.

During these conversations, only one person (the magazine's fact-checker, go figure) attempted to poke holes in her reading. Some things, sure — we're admittedly in a sort-of-public-facing industry, so we're easy to find online. But unless David The Medium is to magpies what the Wicked Witch of the West is to flying monkeys, or he's in the habit of bugging people's friends and family members in the days leading up to their readings, it's all pretty astonishing. (Although, if he was able to identify, locate and mic-up close contacts while they remain none the wiser, would that be more impressive than communicating with the spirit realm?)

So when his publicist reached out to me offering that private reading, the idea had become irresistible. Plus, truth be told, I was in crisis (and, importantly, in denial about being in crisis)

Any other time, I probably would have passed on the invitation. I've never been one to feel curious about how my life is going to turn out, even though I have the kind of anxiety that suggests otherwise. And as a lapsed Catholic, I still have a hint of No, that's not right, someone grab the Holy Water when it comes to the idea of lingering spirits. I'm also scared of hearing something I can't unhear. And also, isn't talking to my deceased loved ones just going to be really, really sad? 

But in the three-month lead-up to that email, a lot had happened. My aunt died. I finished a huge, months-long project that had consumed me entirely. I'd been drinking too much wine and not enough water. I'd been staying up late and getting up early. I was not exercising at all, and then exercising too much. Then, my partner's father passed away, and the very next day, my sister gave birth to twins. 

I told people it was just emotional whiplash. My body had other ideas: days-long vertigo, weekly migraines, parainfluenza (a diagnosis I was frustrated with because it wasn't as dramatic as how I felt. Yes, I am a Leo, thanks for asking), and an eye twitch and a rash that, come to think of it, still haven't gone away. 

So, two funerals, another deadline. Another migraine. Baby cuddles (thank god for them). Fighting with the landlord, moving house (in the rain, because, of course). More baby cuddles. Another deadline. As someone who usually thrives on the chaos of having multiple stories on the go at once, it felt like my fingers were made of lead too heavy to type with.

And still — crisis, me? No way. The people around me are going through things so much harder: it wasn't my sister or my dad who passed away; they're not my newborn twins; I'm not the editor of the magazines that are going to print; we were only moving upstairs, not even to a different building. There's a genocide in Gaza and a war in Ukraine and there are people that are dying, Kim. Nothing was happening to me, just around me. How I was feeling was not a big deal, really. And yet. 

So, I said yes please and thank you to David The Medium's publicist. My reading was scheduled for three days before my birthday. The timing felt auspicious. 

I see now why millennials and gen Z are turning to psychics instead of therapists. My reading with David felt like the most enlightening therapy session of my life — most likely because I wasn't being called out for any of my bullshit and was neither encouraged to reflect on my actions nor take accountability for them.

Instead, it felt like everyone I've ever loved who has passed away was stopping by to simply say, “Hello, I love you, and I see you.” It wasn't sad, it was euphoric. I don't remember walking back to the office — I'm pretty sure I was floating.

The way David The Medium works is this: he has a bunch of the ‘claires': clairvoyance (psychic vision), clairgustance (taste), clairsalience (smell) and clairsentience (physical sensation). He essentially lends his body, mind, voice and senses to the spirits, and then communicates for them. That sounds nightmarish to me, but thankfully, he knows how to switch it off. The spirits can offer predictions for up to 12 months into the future, and can even comment on other people in your life who are still alive — like inter-realm gossip.

David wasn't always psychic. He was thriving in the corporate world when he went to see a medium with a friend, almost as a joke. She immediately spotted that he had the gift and sent him to a psychic mentoring program. At first, it was a party trick. Then, as word spread, so did his popularity. Now, the 38-year-old is in full-time contact with the other side.

During the reading, he rarely looks at me — except to laugh at a joke one of my family members makes, or ask for confirmation on a name he's guessed (spoiler: always correct) or for more context about a message that's coming through. Mostly, he has his eyes closed and is tapping the arm of his chair with his fingertips, like spiritual Morse code. 

As the first spirit enters the room, my scepticism immediately slips out the door behind it. It's my partner's dad. I'd been wondering if he'd show up: maybe it would be too soon; maybe his memory loss meant he didn't know me, so when the alarm sounded in the other realm that Alexandra English was waiting, he didn't know to come forward; maybe he retained his cynicism even on the other side; maybe none of this was real. 

“A man has followed you into the room,” David says. “He's not your dad, but he's someone's dad. Is there a [insert my partner's correct name here]?” I'm floored, but also trying to appear unflappable. I don't want to accidentally give anything away. I say yes, there's someone with that name in my life, but I don't mention that it's my partner. “[This spirit] knows you didn't think he'd come today,” David continues. “And he knows that you think he wouldn't know you, but he wants you to know that he does know you.” David goes on to correctly name my partner's father, and how he passed — and when. He even speaks with the right sense of humour. “He's mainly here to tell his son he loves him, and to test him because he knows he won't believe this.” David laughs at that.

David correctly names my immediate family members, who are all living. “Who's Daniel?” My brother. “Who's Elizabeth?” That's my sister's middle name. “Oh yes, Megan Elizabeth” Correct. “And who's Jac?” My other sister, Jacqueline. “What about Lee, Leo?” Leonie, my mum. He doesn't get “Geoff” for my dad — I think it was the G instead of a J that threw him off.

He talks about my sister's newborn twins: a boy and a girl. Our family jokes that my niece has been here before; she just has that vibe. “Your niece, she's been on earth before,” David says. “Oh?” I say. My resolve is crumbling. “Her last memories are of sitting around with her grandkids, and she closes her eyes and then she wakes up and she's a baby again and she thinks, ‘What the fuck is this?'” Now we're both laughing. That sounds right. 

David goes into great detail about my other sister's work drama, explaining that she needs a new job and suggests a different industry that, to me, doesn't sound like a natural fit. When I speak to her that afternoon, it turns out she's applied for a job in the exact industry he mentioned. A week later, she gets the job. 

He asks me if I've moved or am moving (at this point, we were in one apartment while waiting for cleaners to come to the other) and warns that the bathroom fan doesn't work. That's weirdly specific and accurate. When I tell the electrician that I called him because a psychic told me to, he doesn't really react. Maybe he's heard this before. Maybe he wants to get away from me.

Some parts of my reading are less shocking: David says I'm iron-deficient and that I want to go to Europe next year (I am exactly like the other girls). He says I should watch out for potholes; that there are changes coming at work. There are some parts of my reading that a sceptic could “A ha!” at: I've posted all my siblings on my Instagram at some point, so even though their profiles are private, you can see their names; he knows where I work; he could have checked obituaries for mine and my partner's surnames. But the manpower behind that level of in-depth research for multiple readings a day, and then the sheer ability to remember it all — I'm not convincingly unconvinced. I do think this is real. There was too much that was unknowable. 

As the reading is wrapping up, David asks, “Why is everyone up here singing ‘Happy Birthday'?” That's when I finally burst into tears. I'm misty-eyed writing this even now, imagining grandparents, my partner's dad, my aunt, long-lost friends all huddling together for a chorus of “Happy Birthday”.

A funny thing happened when I went to see my therapist next. I noticed that I was not giving her any information — I was waiting for her to guess; to contact the spirit realm and tell me what was going on with me. She was asking questions, and I was resisting answering them for fear of giving anything away, of falling for a “trick”. For the first half of our session, I gained absolutely nothing because I was not a willing participant until I snapped out of it.

And so I don't think we should be replacing our therapists with psychics. We need to vocalise what's going on in our lives and minds and take active steps to try to better our lives, with the help of a curious and knowledgeable professional. Occasional encouragement from family members in the other realm who can see that we're on the right track and want to tell us they love us is just the cherry on top. If you believe in that kind of thing.

David The Medium will be at the Sydney Opera House on October 18. He will continue his tour across Australia and New Zealand. For tickets and more information, see here.

A Utah musician accused by a Michigan State University professor of being an insider in the QAnon conspiracy theory and political movement has sued the professor and other MSU faculty and officials, alleging the professor has continually defamed him with her allegations.

Thomas Schoenberger also claims he received death threats and online harassment after MSU Communicative Sciencesprofessor Laura Dilley made comments on social media suggesting he may be to blame for the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University.

Schoenberger's lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court, filed Aug. 7, alleges Dilley has been harassing him on social media, repeatedly defaming him online and in research papers, saying he is behind QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory that originated in 2017. Its adherents allege Satan-worshipping pedophiles control the Democratic party, the media and Hollywood, and that President Donald Trump is leading the fight against them.

Schoenberger does not ask for any particular damages in the lawsuit. A status conference is scheduled for Nov. 6.

This lawsuit stems from a paper Dilley wrote titled “QAnon Propaganda on Twitter as Information Warfare: Influencers, Networks and Narratives."" Schoenberger's lawsuit alleges Dilley's paper contained “false and outlandish allegations of and concerning Thomas Schoenberger, such as that he was the mastermind behind QAnon, that the Cicada 3301 alternate reality game (puzzle) is a direct link with QAnon, and that Thomas belongs to the IAM Cult.”

The theory that Schoenberger is involved with QAnon stems from his organization, Cicada 3301, and the complicated puzzles it has published, according to Barry Powers, Schoenberger's attorney. People began theorizing that it was a way to identify and recruit highly intelligent people into the CIA, Powers said.

A 2014 Washington Post story called the Cicada 3301 puzzles one of the Internet's ""eeriest, unsolved mysteries.""

Schoenberger created the Cicada 3301 puzzles, but denies any link to QAnon, Powers said. Powers called Dilley's paper ""yellow journalism"" and ""sensationalism.""

""If you boil down 100 pages into two words, it's 'yellow journalism.' It's ideology masquerading as scholarship,"" Powers said. ""On a basic level, my client is being attacked to this very day by officers and professors at the university, and that's not tolerable.""

MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the pending litigation. Dilley called Schoenberger's lawsuit ""very weak"" and said her defense is strong.

""The purpose of the paper was to give an entry point to further study on networks that might be involved in spreading QAnon, and Thomas Schoenberger's account was selected as one to query for further study,"" Dilley said. ""My opinion is the lawsuit is frivolous, that it is vexatious litigation, that it should not have been brought in the first place.""

Schoenberger, of Utah, is a 64-year-old composer and musician. He created Cicada 3301 to bring together creative individuals and inspire people interested in history, music and culture, according to the lawsuit. It is not a political group, the suit says.

Both Dilley and Schoenberger have accused the other of harassing them, but only Schoenberger has taken legal action on it.

Dilley's paper, published in 2021, described what she called evidence of large-scale coordination among accounts promoting ""QAnon propaganda,"" which may have led to Russia and corporate entities' use of social media to undermine the U.S.'s democratic process. Her paper looks at five studies of QAnon's spread through social media.

In her paper, she sampled thousands of accounts on Twitter for data — including Schoenberger's, she said.

The first mention of Schoenberger in the paper is in a paragraph about connections between QAnon and ""so-called 'alternative reality games'"" and live action role play. She said people who promoted Cicada 3301 were involved in the early promotion of QAnon narratives. According to the paper, Schoenberger and an associate ""promoted the puzzle, organized groups of puzzle solvers and content creators, and groomed and enlisted some participants to post as Q.""

Dilley wrote that Schoenberger was a person ""identified to be central to the history of QAnon"" and that he is a ""QAnon insider.""

""Given Schoenberger's prominence in putative recruitment of 'trolls' for, or through, the Cicada 3301 puzzle, further connections with QAnon were indicated, among other things, by the fact that QAnon influencer and recruiter @MrDeeds1111—one of the most influential Twitter accounts in our sample in Study 1—bore the Cicada 3301 puzzle insignia in its profile,"" Dilley wrote in the study.

Dilley said she chose the topic because she wanted to do something within her skill set that was relevant to what was going on in the world in 2020. She was paying a lot of attention to social media at the time and was drawn to the question of why there was so much propaganda.

She came across Schoenberger's name from several YouTubers and media reports that mentioned him in connection to QAnon, alleging he was involved in spreading the conspiracy theories, she said.

""I think this case is significant for academic freedom, and I hope that not just my university but others will renew their commitment to standing up for faculty's freedom of speech,"" Dilley said.

Powers said the biggest impact on Schoenberger has come from Dilley's tweets the night of the mass shooting at MSU alleging Schoenberger may have had something to do with the attack. Three students — Arielle Anderson, Alexandria Verner and Brian Fraser — were killed and five others were injured in the Feb. 13, 2023, shooting.

Schoenberger, in his lawsuit, said Dilley posted on X ""asserting that he was the force behind the shooter"" and that the ""gunman was acting under the control of Thomas.""

Dilley denied making that post, and it does not currently appear on her X feed.

As the shooting was going on, Dilley posted: ""I was targeted through stochastic terrorism tactics for my research on QAnon disinformation on Twitter. Police report was filed. Remains to be seen."" This post quoted an earlier post she made in November 2022 about Schoenberger harassing her.

In later replies to her initial post, she said if there is any connection between her research and the shooting, it should be investigated.

""I literally had folks from across the country and around the world contact me to ask if these things were connected,"" she wrote on X. ""It's not for me to decide or dismiss, it's for law enforcement. There is ample evidence that goes well beyond me. That is all.""

From Feb. 13, 2023, to Feb. 15, 2023, Dilley mentioned Schoenberger once, according to a News review of her posts. In that instance, she was responding to a post that is not visible to the public, saying the Cicada 3301 puzzle was ""weaponized to incentivize people to stalk & harass me. This was initiated by and/or with Thomas Schoenberger, who is the Dilleys_Willy account. I went to the police/FBI. This is only one of many stalking incidents by this group on me & others. So.""

She tweeted about Cicada 3301 and QAnon about half a dozen times in that time period, according to a News review.

Dilley said Schoenberger misrepresented her tweet, and like many other areas of the lawsuit, it is misinformation.

Police said 43-year-old Anthony McRae was the shooter. McRae opened fire at three locations at the university, killing three and wounding five others, before taking his own life when he was confronted by police.

Michigan State University Police said in April 2023 they found ""no conclusive motive"" for McRae's actions.

Common knowledge is necessary for coordination, for making arbitrary but complementary choices like driving on the right, using paper currency, and coalescing behind a political leader or movement. It's also necessary for social coordination. Humans have a sixth sense for common knowledge, and we create it with signals like laughter, tears, blushing, eye contact, and blunt speech.

But people also go to great lengths to avoid common knowledge—to ensure that even if everyone knows something, they can't know that everyone else knows they know it. And so we get rituals like benign hypocrisy, veiled bribes and threats, sexual innuendo, and pretending not to see the elephant in the room.

In this episode, Steven Pinker shows how the hidden logic of common knowledge can make sense of many of life's enigmas: financial bubbles and crashes, revolutions that come out of nowhere, the posturing and pretense of diplomacy, the eruption of social media shaming mobs and academic cancel culture, the awkwardness of a first date.

Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, a two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, and one of Time's “100 Most Influential People in the World Today.” He has won many prizes for his teaching, his research on language, cognition, and social relations, and his twelve books.

US President Donald Trump has claimed that Ukraine can still prevail in the conflict with Russia three years into the fighting, even as Kiev's forces have been steadily losing ground in recent months. The statement marks a stark shift in rhetoric from the US leader.

Since taking office, Trump has made repeated attempts to mediate the Ukraine conflict, initiating numerous rounds of talks with Russian officials, which culminated in a summit with Putin in Alaska in mid-August. The US president has recently expressed frustration over the lack of progress in settling the conflict but still referred to Russia as a powerful nation while arguing that Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky had no “cards.”

However, in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, following a meeting with Zelensky, Trump claimed that he believes Kiev is “in a position to fight and win all of Ukraine back,” if the EU and NATO continue to support it. He also referred to Russia as a “paper tiger,” arguing that it had failed to defeat Kiev's forces in three and a half years.  

The US president also claimed that Russia is “in [a] big economic trouble” over the conflict and it was “time for Ukraine to act.” He did not announce any new financial or military aid packages for Kiev, though, stating instead that the US would continue to “supply weapons to NATO” for the bloc to use them as it sees fit.

The Russian economy has recently showed signs of slowing down compared to the growth of 4.1% in 2023 and 4.3% in 2024. It is still expected to grow 2.5% this year, despite sweeping Western sanctions.

President Vladimir Putin said last week that the country “is still far from a recession,” citing the “historically low unemployment rates.”  

The governor of Russia's central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, also recently dismissed the rumors about recession. “The economy is slowing, but there is no recession,” she said at the Moscow Financial Forum last week. 

The nation's military have also been steadily advancing on the front lines for months. Moscow's forces had taken control of 3,500 square kilometers and 149 settlements since March, Chief of the General Staff General Valery Gerasimov reported in late August.

UNITED NATIONS, September 23. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump's speech at the General Debate of the UN General Assembly's 80th session lasted nearly an hour, exceeding the recommended speaking time by almost fourfold. Although each delegation is strongly advised to limit their remarks to 15 minutes due to the large number of speakers - 193 in total - Trump's address stretched to about 57 minutes. The limit is not mandatory but helps ensure that all voices are heard during the six days of debate.

In his remarks, Trump declared that the world has entered ""one of the greatest crises in its history"" and placed blame on the United Nations for failing to resolve international challenges. He also emphasized his role in addressing the conflict in Ukraine. Below are the key points from his speech, compiled by TASS.

Six years ago, the world was thriving, but now it has entered one of the greatest crises: ""Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents, an era of calm and stability gave way to one of the great crises of our time.""

He identified nuclear weapons as the most severe danger: ""There is no more serious danger to our planet today than the most powerful and destructive weapons ever devised by man, of which the United States, as you know, has many.""

The US, he said, intends to take the lead in strengthening compliance with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC): ""Hopefully, the UN can play a constructive role.""

Trump criticized the UN for its ineffectiveness in resolving global conflicts, including Ukraine: ""Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help. In any of them - I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal. All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle.""

He also condemned what he described as wasteful spending in the UN: ""They had massive cost overruns and spent between $2 and 4 billion on the building. <...> Unfortunately, many things in the United Nations are happening just like that, but on an even much bigger scale.""

Trump acknowledged US efforts in the Ukrainian conflict but admitted the process has been harder than anticipated: ""I thought that would be the easiest [conflict to settle] because of my relationship with President Putin, which had always been a good one. I thought that was going to be the easiest one. But you know, in war, you never know what's going to happen. There are always lots of surprises, both good and bad.""

He accused several nations of indirectly fueling the conflict: ""China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil, but inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products.""

Trump warned that the US is ready to impose tariffs if Russia does not agree to a settlement: ""In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly. But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations <...> would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.""

He added that he would be raising the matter with European officials: ""They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia. Otherwise, we're all wasting a lot of time. So I'm ready to discuss this. We're going to discuss it today with the European nations all gathered here."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Photos of an alleged Russian operation entering Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine (R) through pipes in a photo posted on Jan. 24, 2024. (Telegram)

A recent Russian assault in the embattled city of Kupiansk has once again thrust an uncommon, but often highly-effective tactic into the spotlight — using underground pipes to penetrate Ukrainian defensive lines.

Russian units attempting to move across the Oskil River used a gas pipeline, monitoring group DeepState reported on Sept. 12, with soldiers using specially designed wheeled benches and electric scooters to maneuver.

They reportedly reached the nearby village of Radkivka ""without serious losses"" before moving to a forest and dispersing into Kupiansk.

But the tactic also has a huge cost for Moscow's forces — Russian independent media outlet Astra in July published a video of a soldier describing the chaos inside a pipe in Russia's Kursk Oblast where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion in 2024.

The man, later identified as Igor Garus from St. Petersburg, claimed that ""dozens of soldiers suffocated, committed suicide, or died in panic and delirium.""

""People were going crazy there. One shot himself. One… pointed a machine gun at himself. The second one smashed his head in,"" Garus says in the video.

""The Russians themselves call these tactical, pipe-based actions 'deadly attacks,' but they still accept the cost,"" Serhii Bratchuk, spokesperson for the Ukrainian Defense Army's Southern Division, told the Kyiv Independent. 

""This is now an accepted tactic for Russia, and they use it.""

Ukraine's General Staff confirmed on Sept. 13 that Russian forces had used a pipe to enter Kupiansk, but played down the success of the operation.

""The exit from the pipeline… is under the control of Ukrainian defenders,"" the military said. ""The pipeline does not lead directly to the city.""

Ukrainian Army Commander Yuriy Fedorenko told Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty that Kyiv's forces flooded the pipeline to block the maneuver. ""As a result, the pipe is now blocked,"" he said on Sept 17. 

Ukrainian units were also clearing saboteurs who entered the city, while maintaining control of its center, he added.

The use of underground passages in warfare is centuries old. Armies have long relied on tunnels to bypass defenses or move undetected.

During World War I, militaries dug networks beneath enemy trenches to plant explosives, while in the Vietnam War, U.S. forces faced the vast Cu Chi tunnel system used by the Viet Cong.

Russia has adopted the method, using decommissioned gas pipelines to bypass Ukrainian defenses and the threats posed by modern warfare.

The aim is to avoid detection by drones, artillery, and other strike systems, according to retired Ukrainian officer and defense expert Viktor Kevliuk.

""That is not some special tactic — it's just a way to get to the needed location safely,"" Kevliuk told the Kyiv Independent. ""If there were a subway there, the enemy would move through that.""

""If someone can move the required resources from point A to point B, then any method that achieves that should be considered effective.""

The first notable case was in January 2024, during the battles for Avdiivka, Donetsk Oblast. Russian troops discovered a long section of an abandoned underground pipeline and used it to infiltrate a fortified Ukrainian position.

Russian lawmaker Eduard Sharafiyev, who fought in Ukraine, told Russian media in 2024 that the pipe had been identified as early as February 2023.

During preparations for the assault, Ukrainian forces discovered Russian troops gathering at an entry point and struck them with artillery, he said.

After weeks of preparation, Russian troops tried again. This time, they traveled more than two kilometers underground, emerging behind Ukraine's lines, and managing to capture part of the fortified area.

""This tactic, unfortunately, proved its worth during the battles around Avdiivka,"" Bratchuk said.

Russia revived the tactic in 2025 during its counteroffensive in Kursk Oblast.

Ukrainian forces had launched a cross-border incursion in August 2024, seizing around 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) of territory. 

By spring 2025, Russian troops began pushing back.


""Senior Russian officers have never valued a soldier's life highly.""
    

In Sudzha, located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Ukraine's border, Russian soldiers moved through a decommissioned gas pipeline for 12–15 kilometers (7–9 miles), emerging behind Ukrainian lines.

According to Russia's Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, over 600 soldiers took part in the operation. 

Russian troops spent four days inside the pipe before launching an assault that Moscow claimed secured several villages. 

""Regarding Sudzha or Avdiivka, it should be understood that it's impossible to move a large number of troops through a pipe,"" Kevliuk said.

""The main factor for the enemy's success is surprise — acting unexpectedly in the rear of our forces.""

Ukraine's General Staff confirmed that Russia tried to use the pipeline but claimed its forces identified the groups and inflicted heavy losses with drones and artillery.

Russian troops have not only suffered casualties in battle but also inside the pipelines themselves.

""Everyone who was in the tunnel (to reach Sudzha) suffered lung damage,"" Russian propagandist and war blogger Anastasia Kashevarova said in June.

""The fighters were suffocating. Some had already died.""

Bratchuk emphasized the dangers posed by even decommissioned pipelines, pointing out the serious health risks for any Russian soldier sent inside.

""Many develop chronic illnesses that are untreatable; a lot become disabled or die,"" he said.

""Senior Russian officers have never valued a soldier's life highly — sending hundreds of fighters into such conditions is not difficult for them.""

Experts say Ukraine must develop systematic defenses against such tactics used by Moscow.

""It's obvious these methods can be used in other locations,"" Bratchuk said. ""Therefore, the response must be official and systematic.""

""The quickest responses are to blow up pipes or flood them. What would be more effective is coordinated work with local authorities and specialists who understand the pipes, sewage, and gas systems.""

Bratchuk also highlighted the difficulty of tracking the underground pipeline network on Ukrainian territory, saying that many of the original plans remain in Russia.

""We have problems mapping this network… The system was designed and built in the Soviet era, and we lack a lot of that information,"" he said.

🇷🇺🇺🇦 Ukranian forces placed razor wire inside a pipeline to try and stop Russian forces from using it. pic.twitter.com/E6gggQIpdN

One of the other measures Ukrainian forces use to counter the pipeline tactic is filling the tunnels with barbed wire, Ivan Stupak, a government adviser who used to serve with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), said.

""There are photos online of Russians trying to crawl into these pipes. Ukrainians packed them with a lot of barbed wire,"" he told Radio NV.

""And not like that used in World War I, but really sharp wire. If you get tangled in it, it's almost impossible to get out on your own.""

Kevliuk said the simplest response is to keep pipeline exits under fire control, while a more complex approach is to demolish a section near the entrance.

""Overall conclusion — if you're organizing the defense, study the terrain and the engineering networks thoroughly in your area of responsibility,"" he said.

 But Symbolic Statehood Is No Panacea for the Palestinians

 Shira Efron

On September 21 and 22, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and six other countries recognized a Palestinian state. Israel has responded defiantly. Following Sunday's recognitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a Hebrew-language video statement: “It will not happen. A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan.” Although Netanyahu will only make a final decision on Israel's full response when he returns to the region after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, his coalition has repeatedly threatened to annex West Bank territory and collapse the Palestinian Authority entirely.

This tit-for-tat serves nobody's interests. Israelis will lose as the momentum around recognition and their government's aggressive response accelerate their country's diplomatic, economic, and cultural isolation. Palestinians will lose, too. On their own, the recognitions fail to afford real, tangible benefits to the Palestinian people or to help the struggling PA escape crisis. Instead, they give hard-line elements of the Israeli government more pretext to try to suppress Palestinian self-determination and further weaken the PA. Even before the recognitions were formally announced, the Israeli government had begun to cite them in fresh steps to expand settlements in the West Bank. On August 20, Israel approved the construction of the controversial E1 settlement that effectively bisects the West Bank; Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich explicitly framed the move as a response to calls for Palestinian statehood. “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state,” he said, “because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.”

But something good could still come out of the momentum toward recognition if both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership look beyond the symbolism—and if international actors work to market recognition not as a unilateral action but as a small part of an arduous multilateral push for mutual recognition by Israel and Palestine, the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and its neighbors, and greater regional integration. The recognizing governments need to more clearly situate their decision within the so-called New York Declaration (endorsed overwhelmingly on September 12 by the UN General Assembly) and the July UN conference on a two-state solution co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. Both propose more practical ways forward—and Israel should take the opportunity that these initiatives offer. The New York Declaration outlines a comprehensive framework for ending Israel's military operations in Gaza, returning the remaining hostages, dismantling Hamas, and rebuilding the strip and backs these steps with security guarantees and initiatives to boost regional integration.

All these measures are consistent with Israel's military and political objectives. Israeli leaders must look past the ideological rigidity that drives them to oppose any notion of Palestinian self-determination. They need to use this moment to engage with France and Saudi Arabia on how to implement the New York Declaration, to ask the Palestinians and other regional actors to recognize Israel as the Jewish people's homeland (as the 2020 Abraham Accords did), and to demand that Palestinian leaders be held accountable to their obligation under international law to prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel. If they do so, they may well find that the momentum toward recognition has advantages for Israel. The recognizing states will have to step up, too, by making their security guarantees concrete and by helping shape a Palestinian state that does not threaten its neighbors and dignifies its people by providing functioning institutions and proper services.

The state of Israel was established by a UN General Assembly resolution, which theoretically means that Israel cannot selectively accept the legitimacy that created it while rejecting a Palestinian state formed under the same framework. But Israeli opposition to a Palestinian state has only hardened since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack. A June 2025 Pew survey found that only 21 percent of Israelis agreed that “peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state is possible,” the lowest proportion since the polling organization first asked the question, in 2013. A September 2024 joint poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) and Tel Aviv University's International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation found that most Israelis believed that if a Palestinian state were established, terrorist attacks on Israel would persist or increase.

After October 7, Israelis have become extremely risk-averse and reluctant to make territorial concessions, especially given the ongoing terrorism threat from the Palestinian territories and the PA's dysfunction. Even centrist leaders who persistently oppose Netanyahu have come out strongly against recognition. Benny Gantz, a centrist retired army general who served in Netanyahu's war cabinet, lamented that recognition now “ultimately only emboldens Hamas, extends the war, distances the prospects of a hostage deal, and sends a clear message of support to Iran and its proxies.” On September 21, Yair Lapid, Israel's opposition leader, said that “the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, Australia, and Canada is a diplomatic disaster, a harmful step, and a reward for terror.”

Many Israelis, with some justification, share the sentiment that the timing of the recent recognitions rewards Hamas—a view that Hamas officials have encouraged. On August 2, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera that “the initiative by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state is one of the fruits of October 7. We proved that victory over Israel is not impossible, and our weapons are a symbol of Palestinian dignity.”

Beyond the trouble with this narrative, Israelis have other valid concerns. Recognition will fundamentally alter the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under international law, committing recognizing states to review their agreements with Israel to ensure that they do not violate their obligations to the state of Palestine. A wide range of Israeli military operations, including its thousands of annual raids to arrest terrorists or destroy weapons in Palestinian territory, could be recast from counterterrorism to violations of the sovereignty of a UN member. Before September, nearly 150 UN member countries already recognized a Palestinian state. But adding France and the United Kingdom to that list—two permanent Security Council members—as well as G-7 countries such as Australia and Canada may well subject Israel to much more scrutiny and pressure by lawmakers and civil society groups, including substantial legal challenges at international courts. Germany, Italy, and even the United States may eventually feel that they have no choice but to follow their Security Council peers' lead. It will also strengthen Palestinians' standing in international forums and pave the way for Palestine's transition from a permanent observer at the UN to a full member—which would make its status as a state unquestionable despite Israel's objections.

In the near term, recognition is likely to hurt Palestinians the most. By the standard definition of a state, Palestine clearly does not fully qualify at present: although it has partially functioning institutions, it has no defined territory it truly controls, no monopoly on the use of force, no independent economy, and no coherent governance. Whatever nominal Palestinian state exists on paper thanks to the recognition announcements will have no real viability—and recognition's aftermath may well further undermine the PA's ability to govern even in the limited territory it supposedly controls.

The PA is teetering on the brink of insolvency. Public schools in the West Bank have postponed the start of the school year and are now only open three days a week, affecting more than 600,000 children. The PA has been forced to slash the salaries of its public servants by as much as 50 percent and to delay payments to private-sector contractors. Government departments such as the Ministry of Health provide only partial services. The West Bank's economy has shrunk to less than a sixth of its 2022 size, and unemployment stands at over 30 percent. The PA enjoys little popularity among its people: a May PCPSR poll found that 81 percent of Palestinians want President Mahmoud Abbas to resign and that 69 percent believe that the PA will not succeed in accomplishing the reforms necessary to govern.

This week's recognitions do nothing, in practice, to give the PA more capacity or shore it up against Israeli aggression. Instead, they put Palestinians even more squarely in the crosshairs of Israeli officials seeking to render Palestinian statehood impossible. On September 18, Smotrich threatened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if the Israeli government does not annex the West Bank in response to the recognitions, he will use his authority as finance minister to fully collapse the PA. Speaking at a September 20 event at Maale Adumim, a large settlement near Jerusalem, Netanyahu declared, “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.”

The consequences for Israel, however, go well beyond the symbolic and cannot easily be neutralized with annexations. This wave of recognitions will likely increase anti-Israel sentiment globally, accelerating divestments and boycotts. And the very governments that sought to address domestic opposition to Israeli policy by announcing recognitions will come under more pressure to impose formal sanctions. The European Union is Israel's largest investor, contributing nearly twice as much annually to the Israeli economy as the United States does; the main destination for Israeli investments; and Israel's largest trading partner.

Some European institutions have already divested from Israeli enterprises: in August, for instance, Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing an “unacceptable risk” that its investments were contributing to human rights violations. Countries with more investments in Israel, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, could follow suit. Many economic ties between EU member states and Israel are governed by the 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which can be canceled only by unanimous consensus, an unlikely outcome given Hungary's continued support for Israel. A European Commission proposal in mid-September to partially suspend the agreement—which required only the backing of a majority of member states—was vetoed by Germany and Italy.

Yet the trajectory of European opinion that the recognition wave represents could push Germany and Italy to lift their veto. In such a scenario, Israel could lose its free trade agreement with the EU as well as its access to the $100 billion Horizon Europe research program, the EU's flagship fund for research and innovation. Israel is a major beneficiary of the program, but this year to date, its approval rates for projects with Israeli collaborators has already dropped by 68.5 percent. In May, David Harel, the president of Israel's Academy of Sciences and Humanities, said that if Israel were excluded entirely it would be a “death sentence for Israeli science.”



The alienation of Israeli academics represents a broader trend. The country's athletes are less and less able to compete with their peers abroad. The executive committee of the Union of European Football Associations is expected to vote soon on suspending Israel's national team and all of its clubs from its competitions, which would exclude Israelis from a leading venue for its favorite sport. Cultural institutions face equally severe pressure—pressure that will only increase after this week's recognitions. In early September, the Flanders Festival Ghent, in Belgium, canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic solely because its conductor, Lahav Shani—who has called for peace in Gaza—also directs the Israel Philharmonic; over 4,000 actors and filmmakers have pledged not to cooperate with Israeli institutions.

It may seem trivial to outsiders, but the growing possibility that Israel could be ejected from the Eurovision Song Contest hits Israelis especially hard. The competition is one of Israel's most cherished events of the year, and Israelis take pride in their exceptional record: Israel has won four times, and the fact that an Israeli contestant reached the 2025 final felt enormously comforting to Israelis, reassuring them that their artists could still be loved in countries where protests against their government are common. But Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain have all threatened to boycott Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. The recent recognitions and Israel's aggressive counterreaction may well push more countries to issue similar threats.

At a Finance Ministry conference last week, Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel is entering “a kind of isolation.” But he has sought to claim that the country could manage this isolation, suggesting that Israel can adopt an economy with “autarkic features” and become a “super-Sparta.” Netanyahu appears to have forgotten that Israel's economic success owes much to Oslo's peace dividend and that Israel has become an export-driven economy that relies on the tech sector and a highly educated, globally connected workforce. Its continued success depends on thriving relationships with the rest of the world. This is why Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, famously said in 1955 that “Israel is not destined to become a new Sparta.” Regardless of Israel's military engagements, he continued, “we must not be distracted” from the fact that “our ultimate goal in our relations with our neighbors is peace and coexistence.”

After the diplomatic circus at the UN subsides, there will still be an opportunity to make lemonade from lemons—if Israel and other countries turn their attention back to the New York Declaration. That declaration's objective was to avoid the pitfalls of previous unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives by proposing time-bound, tangible steps toward a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within a regional framework that shuns Hamas and incentivizes Arab states to play major roles. Unfortunately, the escalatory rhetoric and mutual threats surrounding recognition took attention off these measures. But they could provide the Israeli government with an off-ramp to end its war in Gaza, which is unpopular among Israelis.

The Israeli government has long insisted that five conditions must be met before its military operations can halt: Hamas must be disarmed, all living and deceased hostages must be returned, Gaza must be demilitarized, Israel must retain security control over the Gaza Strip, and an alternative civilian administration run by neither Hamas nor the PA should be established. The New York Declaration is perfectly aligned with Israel's first three goals, and it implicitly accepts that in the near term, Israel will maintain peripheral security control over Gaza and that Hamas will not return to power. Its vision for PA authority over Gaza is conditioned on reforms that would make the PA a more trusted neighbor than it is today.

In reality, the gap between what Israel wants and what international actors hope for can be bridged. France, Saudi Arabia, and the governments that endorsed the New York Declaration should immediately start taking practical steps to operationalize its proposed measures, such as by designing a mechanism to disarm Hamas, training a multinational security force that could properly monitor and enforce a cease-fire, acquiring real commitments from international players to stabilize and reconstruct Gaza, and developing a concrete plan to deradicalize Palestinian armed-resistance movements. In addition, the governments that signed the New York Declaration should invest in more effective marketing to the Israeli public. They need to demonstrate why their proposal offers a viable alternative to the Israeli government's current zero-sum approach to the Palestinians. They also should seek to bring the United States on board in their September 23 meeting with Trump, which is expected to cover a post-war vision for Gaza.

Israel, for its part, has shown that it can be pragmatic when it needs to be. For instance, during the six-week cease-fire in January 2025, it allowed PA security forces carrying the Palestinian flag to patrol the Rafah border. Now is the time to be even more pragmatic. This week's recognitions are a fait accompli. Whether even more powerful states will recognize Palestine is a question of when, not if. And Israel will face an isolation that its people cannot survive in the long term unless it accepts that the PA will have to play some role in ending the war in Gaza.

In fact, recognition could have advantages for Israel. If the international community begins to treat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a dispute between legally equal entities rather than between an occupier and an occupied people, that could force the UN and other international forums (including international courts), as well as the Palestinian leadership, to recognize that Israel does face a security threat from the Palestinian territories. It will also clarify the obligations that Palestinian leaders have to abide by international law, prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel, and stop Hamas's terrorist activities.

In the Middle East, if you do not take a seat at the table you will likely end up on the menu. Instead of flat-out rejecting the rest of the world's attempts to intervene, Israel should make it clear that it accepts key components of the New York Declaration, join discussions on how to implement them, seek conversations on elements of concern, and ask for critical additional measures such as a recognition of Jews' right to self-determination within Israel. Only then can the course of events in the Middle East change from unilateral recognition, regional fragmentation, and international isolation for Israel to regional integration and enhanced security for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","There is no safe amount of alcohol when it comes to dementia, study finds","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/health/alcohol-dementia-risk-study-wellness","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 22:30:05 GMT","


            Drinking any amount of alcohol increases your risk of dementia later in life, according to a new study that challenges prior research findings.
    


            Some research has suggested light drinking — such as fewer than seven drinks a week — may be more neuroprotective than no alcohol at all. Those studies, however, focused on older people and didn't differentiate between former drinkers and lifelong nondrinkers, thus potentially skewing the results, study authors said.
    


            In the new study, published Tuesday in the journal BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, researchers analyzed how certain genes linked to alcohol might impact how liquor consumption affects the brain.

            “The genetic analyses results (showed) that even small amounts of alcohol could increase dementia risk,” said lead study author Anya Topiwala, a senior clinical researcher in the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.
    


            “This is the largest study on the topic, and the combination of observational and genetic analyses was key,” Topiwala said via email.
    


            The genetic analysis, called Mendelian randomization, has less risk of introducing a confounding or “spurious” variable to explain the alcohol-dementia relationship, Topiwala said.
    


            Mendelian randomization also reduces the chance of reverse causation, such as dementia processes influencing drinking rather than the reverse, and it can also estimate the cumulative impact of alcohol consumption over a person's entire life, Topiwala said. Observational studies, however, tend to capture a snapshot of mid- to late-life drinking habits, and depend on subject recall, which may not be accurate.
    


            “This is a fairly complicated study that provides some, but not definitive evidence, that alcohol can harm the brain regardless of how much is consumed,” said neurologist Dr. Richard Isaacson, director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson, who conducts studies on cognitive improvement in people who are genetically at risk for Alzheimer's disease, was not involved in the new study.
    


            “In my clinic, we tell people with the APOE4 genetic variant, which is the most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's, that drinking zero alcohol is best based on the available evidence,” he said in an email.
    


            However, for people with less genetic risk for Alzheimer's it often depends on “when” and “how” people drink, Isaacson added. For example, he said, two drinks before bed on an empty stomach several nights will have a more harmful effect on brain health compared with one drink a few times a week with an early dinner.
    


            The new study looked at data from nearly 560,000 people who participated in the UK Biobank, a longitudinal study that included participants from England, Scotland and Wales, and the US Million Veteran Program, or MVP, which includes people of European, African and Latin American ancestry.
    


            In that observational part of the study, people provided self-reports of how much they drank, and researchers compared alcohol consumption with their risk of developing dementia over time.
    


            “In the self-reporting study, people who reported consuming small amounts of alcohol (less than 7 drinks per week) had lower risk than heavy drinkers (more than 40 drinks per week),” said Tara Spires-Jones, professor of neurodegeneration and director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, in a statement.
    


            “Interestingly, in this part of the study, non-drinkers and people who reported never drinking actually had similar risk of dementia to people who drank heavily,” said Spires-Jones, who is also a group leader in the UK Dementia Research Institute in London. She was not involved in the study.
    


            The study then examined genetics from 45 studies of dementia in 2.4 million people and compared genetic markers associated with alcohol use over a lifetime.
    


            Higher genetic risk was associated with an increased risk of dementia, with a linear increase in dementia risk the higher the alcohol consumption, according to the study.

            “There is a 15% higher dementia risk for 3 drinks per week compared to 1 drink per week across life,” Topiwala said.
    


            In addition, a doubling in the genetic risk of alcohol dependency was associated with a 16% increase in dementia risk, according to the study.
    


            “Neither part of the study can conclusively prove that alcohol use directly causes dementia,” Spires-Jones said. “But this adds to a large amount of similar data showing associations between alcohol intake and increased dementia risk, and fundamental neuroscience work has shown that alcohol is directly toxic to neurons in the brain.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Fact check: Trump litters UN speech with false claims about climate, inflation, immigration and world peace","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/politics/fact-check-un-speech-claims-trump","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:55:01 GMT","


            President Donald Trump's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday was littered with numerous false claims, many of which have been debunked before.
    


            Trump was inaccurate about a wide variety of subjects. They included inflation in the US, climate policies both in the US and abroad, immigration, his role in settling international conflicts, and his standing in opinion polls. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks.
    


Trump and wars: The president claimed, “I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda — a vicious, violent war that was — Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.”
    


            But Egypt and Ethiopia were not actually at war during Trump's time in the White House. They have a long-running and unresolved dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but this is not a war, so Trump couldn't have ended one there. Similarly, while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren't in an actual war either during Trump's current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump's administration in 2020.
    


            In addition, Trump hasn't actually ended the conflict involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration and signed by the DRC and Rwanda in June did not involve the rebel coalition, allegedly backed by Rwanda, that has seized territory in the eastern DRC, and CNN reported from the ground this week: “The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump's claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.”
    


            Trump's importance and success in addressing the other four conflicts he mentioned can be debated. Notably, while Pakistan has heaped praise upon Trump for playing a critical role in brokering its May ceasefire with India, India has rejected the claim that he did so and said it resolved the conflict directly with Pakistan.
    


Trump's poll numbers: The president claimed, “I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I've ever had. Part of it is because of what we've done on the border. I guess the other part is what we've done on the economy.” It's theoretically possible Trump saw some private polling that gave him dramatically better numbers than public polling has produced, but his standing in public polling is nowhere near his highest ever — in fact, it's down substantially from the beginning of this year.
    


A New York Times polling average put Trump's approval rating at about 43% as of Tuesday (with 54% disapproval), down from 52% approval in the first week of his second term in January (with 43% disapproval).
    


            Similarly, a polling average produced by data journalist G. Elliott Morris put Trump's approval rating at about 42% as of Tuesday (with about 54% disapproval), down from about 51% approval in the first days of his second term (with about 39% disapproval). And a polling average produced by data journalist Nate Silver put Trump's approval rating at about 44% as of Tuesday (with about 53% disapproval), down from about 52% approval in the first days of the term (with about 40% disapproval).
    


CNN's Poll of Polls average had Trump at 41% approval as of Tuesday (with 57% disapproval), down from 48% approval in our first average of this term in early February (with 49% disapproval). And Trump's average ratings for his handling of immigration and the economy have both fallen from positive territory to negative territory since the beginning of the term, the averages from Morris and Silver show.
    


Trump's ‘your countries are going to hell' speech, annotated



Inflation: Trump baselessly claimed that “inflation has been defeated” under his leadership. This is vaguer than his frequent false claim that there is now “no inflation,” but there's no basis even for the vaguer version. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April. It was about 2.9% in August, up from about 2.7% in July; the August figure was nearly identical to the 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration Trump said left him an “economic calamity.”
    


Grocery prices: Trump also claimed that under his leadership, “grocery prices are down.” False. Average grocery prices have increased during Trump's presidency, though the prices of some individual items have fallen; Consumer Price Index figures show that average grocery prices were about 1% higher in August than they were in January, when Trump returned to the White House. And while we should be careful not to read too much into any single month of data, the increase in grocery prices from July to August was about 0.6%, which was the highest month-to-month jump since late 2022.
    


Electricity bills: Trump said electricity in Europe is much more expensive than in China or the US, which is generally correct. But then he added, “And our bills are coming way down.” In fact, US electricity prices are spiking, rising more than twice as fast as overall prices; Consumer Price Index figures show they were about 6.2% higher in August than they were a year prior and about 4.9% higher in August than they were in January.
    


Foreign investment: Trump, talking about “new investment into the United States,” claimed, “In just eight months since I took office, we have secured commitments and money already paid for $17 trillion.” This figure is unproved at best. Just a day ago, Trump's own White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, used a much lower figure, saying Trump “has secured nearly $9 trillion in US investment.” She did say “we expect that number to be upwards of $15 trillion very soon,” but Trump didn't explain how an additional $8 trillion supposedly materialized in a day — and even Leavitt's $9 trillion figure should be treated with skepticism, since it is heavily based on vague semi-commitments from foreign countries that may never materialize.
    


Global warming and climate change: Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and he also referred to “the global warming hoax.” He didn't precisely explain what he was calling the con job or hoax, but global warming is a demonstrated fact. Trump also baselessly suggested that scientists now use the phrase “climate change” instead of “global warming” so that they can't be accused of getting things wrong if the world ends up cooling; in reality, climate scientists use both phrases, often saying “global warming” when referring to the long-term trend of increasing global temperature and “climate change” when referring to the numerous effects the world is experiencing because of that trend.
    


            NASA says on its website: “‘Climate change' encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.”
    


            For example, a 2023 report from the UN's climate change panel, titled “Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report,” said this: “Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020.” In a section titled “Future Climate Change,” the report also said this: “Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence).”
    


China and wind power: Trump repeated his false claim that although China is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, “they have very few wind farms” themselves. He added, “So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know, they use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don't like wind. But they sure as hell like selling the windmills.” In reality, China is the world leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore; it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US.
    


Coal and renewables: Trump referred to coal as “clean, beautiful coal,” as he usually does, but coal is just not clean; its use as a power source creates polluting emissions that harm humans and the environment, even with technological improvements that can reduce the emissions levels. Trump also wrongly said renewable energy sources “don't work,” saying that “they're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great” and that “the wind doesn't blow.” But energy generated by wind is still a useful power source when the wind isn't blowing, just as solar energy is still a useful power source when the sun isn't shining — since the energy can be stored in industrial batteries or using other methods, allowing it to be deployed as part of a power mix along with energy from traditional fossil fuels.
    


The Paris climate accord: Trump repeated some false claims about the Paris climate accord from which he has withdrawn the US during each of his presidencies.
    


            At one point, he wrongly said the US was “supposed to pay like $1 trillion” under the accord. It wasn't. The US has never spent or committed anywhere close to $1 trillion in connection to the accord; Biden pledged upon taking office to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing, but Congress appropriated less than even that.
    


            Trump also said, “China didn't have to pay until 2030.” This was confusing, but it appeared to be a reference to his previous false claim that the accord gave China more time than the US to hit its targets for reducing carbon emissions. In reality, the accord came into effect for all participating countries at the same time, November 2016, but allowed each country to set its own voluntary targets for reducing carbon emissions.

Five takeaways from Trump's UN speech



Biden and migrants: Touting his efforts to secure the southern border, Trump said, “Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million all together over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration.” The “25 million” figure is fictional; even Trump's previous “21 million” figure was a wild exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there's no way the total was even close to what Trump has said.
    


Biden and migrant children: Trump repeated his misleading claim that “the previous administration also lost nearly 300,000 children,” then quickly said it was “more than 300,000 children.” He continued to say that many of these children “have been raped, exploited and abused and sold,” while others are dead.
    


            He appeared to be referring to a 2024 report from the Homeland Security Department's Office of Inspector General, which said Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.
    


            There are two key things to note here. First, the period covered by the report includes two years and four months under the first Trump administration. Second, while the report said immigration authorities have “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor,” it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited or had been killed.
    


            Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN last summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn't mean they're missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn't bring them or they are teenagers who didn't want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn't filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”

US President Donald Trump has replied affirmatively when asked if NATO states should shoot down Russian aircraft that breach their airspace.

The US president was asked the question at a joint press conference alongside Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky on Tuesday.

“Yes, I do,” Trump replied.

Estonia, a Baltic member of the US-led military bloc, last week claimed that three Russian MIG-31 jets breached its airspace. Moscow has denied the claims, saying that the planes did not deviate from their routine flight path, and arguing that NATO lacked evidence.

Tallinn called for urgent consultations with bloc members under NATO Article 4, which allows members to seek talks if they believe their security or territorial integrity is threatened. Bloc members convened in Brussels on Tuesday.

According to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, the US-led military bloc decides whether to shoot down planes that violate the bloc's airspace on a real-time case-by-case basis depending on the threat level.

In the alleged Estonian incident, “NATO forces promptly intercepted and escorted the aircraft without escalation as no immediate threat was assessed,” he claimed during a press conference following the meeting.

Earlier this month, another NATO member, Poland, accused Russia of sending at least 19 drones into its airspace – a claim Moscow has dismissed as baseless. The only damage from the incident was allegedly caused by a missile fired by a Polish F-16, which struck a residential building, the news outlet Rzeczpospolita reported last week.

The incident in Poland was a fabricated provocation meant to “undermine a political settlement of the Ukraine conflict,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said last week.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the accusations were levied without a shred of evidence. The claims “have never been supported by any reliable data or convincing arguments,” he told journalists on Tuesday.

Beijing is conducting a sophisticated campaign to demoralize Taiwanese by exploiting their economic anxieties and fear of war, a report released yesterday by a civil research organization showed.

China has been engaged in a systematic campaign to construct a narrative of “Taiwan defeatism” to encourage Taiwanese acquiescence, Information Operations Research Group codirector Yu Chih-hao (游知澔) told a news conference in Taipei.

The defeatist narrative is formed by framing news about Taiwan's foreign affairs, national defense, economic issues and democracy with messaging that depicts the nation as weak and dependent on foreign powers, Yu said.

People who identify as both Taiwanese and Chinese have positive views of China's economy and negative views of the Democratic Progressive Party government, and are more likely to accept defeatism, he said.

The types of issues Beijing seeks to leverage to spread defeatism reflect Taiwanese fears of being abandoned by allies, conflicted national identity and lack of education in national security matters, he said.

The defeatist worldview, built to dovetail with other Chinese information campaigns, creates a sense of crisis and then presents acquiescence to China as its solution, he said.

The promotion of defeatist messages is being timed to put a negative spin on specific events as they happen in real time, such as Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercises, he said.

The vectors for Chinese propaganda include Taiwanese politicians and political pundits, social media accounts under the management of unknown organizations or individuals, Beijing's leadership and state-run media, he said.

Chinese propaganda routinely quotes Taiwanese opposition figures, and makes use of idioms and phrases typically used in China to homogenize Taiwanese culture, language and public discourse, Yu said.

Citing a poll the center conducted last year, Yu said that 46 percent of Taiwanese are pessimistic about the nation's economy and national security, suggesting a high level of potential susceptibility to Beijing's propaganda.

TikTok users are more likely to approve of China and express pessimism about the economy, he said.

Chinese propaganda preys on anxiety and a sense of helplessness, especially in disinformation campaigns aimed at sowing division in Taiwan, he said.

The executive branch should enhance information governance, regulate the quality of open source media and emphasize critical reading skills in education, Yu said.

Academics should deepen interdisciplinary study of the information environment in Taiwan and promote public educational efforts, while Taiwanese should be more critical of the information they encounter online and base their discussion about public affairs on verifiable facts, he said.

The Information Operations Research Group seeks to spread public awareness about information manipulation.

Tropical Depression No. 21 formed at 8am about 1,850km off the southeast coast, CWA forecaster Lee Meng-hsuan (李孟軒) said.
The weather system is expected to move northwest as it builds momentum, possibly intensifying this weekend into a typhoon, which would be called Mitag, Lee said.
The radius of the storm is expected to reach almost 200km, she said.
It is forecast to approach the southeast of Taiwan on Monday next week and pass through the Bashi Channel                                    


WARNING:
                                        People in coastal areas need to beware of heavy swells and strong winds, and those in mountainous areas should brace for heavy rain, the CWA said                                        The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday issued sea and land warnings for Typhoon Ragasa, forecasting that it would continue to intensify and affect the nation the most today and tomorrow. 
People in Hualien and Taitung counties, and mountainous areas in Yilan and Pingtung counties, should brace for damage caused by extremely heavy rain brought by the typhoon's outer rim, as it was upgraded to a super typhoon yesterday morning, the CWA said. 
As of 5:30pm yesterday, the storm's center was about 630km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip, moving northwest at 21kph, and its maximum wind speed had reached

Ragasa intensified from a tropical storm into a typhoon at 8am yesterday, the CWA said, adding that at 2pm, it was about 1,110km east-southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost tip.
The typhoon was moving northwest at 13kph, with sustained winds of up to 119kph and gusts reaching 155kph, the CWA Web site showed.
Forecaster Liu Pei-teng (劉沛滕) said that Ragasa was projected to strengthen as it neared the Bashi Channel, with its 200km

Taiwan proper could be out of the typhoon's radius by midday and the sea warning might be lifted tonight, it added.
CWA senior weather specialist Wu Wan-hua (伍婉華) said that Ragasa's radius had reached the Hengchun Peninsula by 11am yesterday and was expected to hit Taitung County and Kaohsiung by yesterday evening.
Ragasa was forecast to move to Taiwan's southern offshore areas last night and to its southwestern offshore areas early today, she added.

The US, Japan and South Korea on Monday emphasized the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and voiced concern over “increasingly frequent destabilizing actions” around Taiwan, a joint statement issued by the US Department of State said.

The three governments encouraged the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues and opposed “any attempts to unilaterally change the status quo,” the statement said, alluding to Beijing's threat of annexing Taiwan by force, but without naming China.

They also said they support Taiwan's meaningful participation in appropriate international organizations, the statement said.

The joint statement came after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Takeshi Iwaya and South Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Hyun met in New York during the UN General Assembly to discuss security and economic issues in the Indo-Pacific region.

The US reaffirmed in the statement what it called its “ironclad commitments to the defense of Japan” and South Korea, pledging extended deterrence supported by “America's unmatched military strength, including its nuclear capabilities.”

In remarks implicitly aimed at China, they also rejected “unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, as well as attempts to enforce such claims,” and opposed “any attempts to change the status quo including dangerous and destabilizing actions in the waters of the Indo-Pacific, including the South China Sea.”

They underscored their commitment to a “free and open Indo-Pacific” and to international law as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, including “freedoms of navigation and overflight and other lawful uses of the sea.”

The statement also addressed cooperation in other areas, including potential trilateral coast guard exchanges, strengthened coordination on arctic issues, and encouraging Russia and Ukraine toward “a durable negotiated settlement.”

It reaffirmed the governments' commitment to North Korea's complete denuclearization under UN Security Council resolutions and urged an immediate end to Pyongyang's “increasing military cooperation with Russia.”

The statement further highlighted efforts to bolster energy security — citing US liquefied natural gas and other resources — while pledging to diversify critical supply chains and to accelerate joint development of advanced civil nuclear reactors.

In Taipei, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Hsiao Kuangwei (蕭光偉) yesterday said that the meeting was the third time this year the US, Japan and South Korea had “reaffirmed their support for maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”

Hsiao said the ministry welcomed the international community's “continued attention” to cross-strait issues.

“Taiwan would continue to enhance its national defense capabilities, strengthen its economic resilience, and work with like-minded partners such as the United States, Japan and South Korea to ensure peace, stability and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region,” he said.

In an online interview titled “The Coming US-China Clash Over Taiwan” posted on YouTube, US economist Jeffrey Sachs called for peace.

“We need above all peace and prudence here, because if it were not for the US meddling, I'm quite sure that across the [Taiwan] Strait there would be a solution to these issues that is peaceful, sensible and especially pragmatic, and if ... politicians in the US are pragmatic and prudent, that peace will prevail,” Sachs said.

His summary of the historical situation between Taiwan and China, and the US' involvement, was largely accurate, and he was certainly less overtly proximate to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) version of events than he has been before.

However, he did repeat the CCP's mischaracterization of World War II-era agreements as “proving” that Taiwan was ceded to China.

Sach's preoccupation has long been with what he considers the folly and arrogance of US foreign policy, and with China. There is no reason to doubt his commitment to peace, but there was something he left out in his summary: recognition of the agency of Taiwanese to decide their own future.

It is one thing to not want Taiwan to be a pawn in US-China regional hegemonic politics, but the problem is his tacit agreement to allow Taiwan's future to be decided by one great power while the other stays on the sidelines. Where is the self-determination for Taiwanese?

Sachs does not want war. Contrary to his suspicions about the prudence of US officials, Washington does not want war, either. Taiwanese certainly do not want war, with the majority in favor of the cross-strait “status quo.”

Moreover, despite saber-rattling by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the Taiwan Strait, neither Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) nor the CCP want war. Initiation of a conflict that would be difficult to contain would be far from prudent. The PLA will continue its pressure to prevent erosion of the CPP's advantages, but resolution according to international law is Beijing's most pragmatic option.

Former minister of culture Lung Ying-tai (龍應台) in an article in the Taipei Times (“Why talk about peace now?” Sept. 18, page 8) urged Taiwan to leverage its agency to push more firmly for peace.

John Cheng, a retired Hong Kong businessman who lives in Taiwan, wrote that there were limits to Lung's argument (“Let's talk about peace plainly,” Sept. 19, page 8). In Hong Kong, Cheng saw first-hand the “peaceful, sensible and especially pragmatic” solutions that the CCP might offer Taiwan.

Monique Chu (朱明琴), a lecturer at the University of Southampton, wrote in an online article published on Thursday last week titled “The Use of Force Against Taiwan as a Contested State: An Analysis of Legality and Great-Power Politics,” that Taiwan's status as a “contested state” could affect the legality of use of force by the CCP to annex it.

Chu detailed the distinction between de jure recognition of Taiwan as a sovereign nation — which Taiwan has been unsuccessful with — and de facto recognition through unofficial channels.

However, while the CCP would frame an invasion as a “domestic action” beyond the scope of Article 2(4) of the UN Charter — which prohibits member states from using force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state — Chu argues that an alternative reading of international law regards “contested” de facto states like Taiwan as also being protected entities, with use of force contravening its rights and security.

If the CCP were to take the prudent, sensible and pragmatic approach that Sachs hopes for, it would offer a real chance of meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's elected government.

The surgeon was arrested for suspected medical malpractice, again bringing to the surface shortcomings in the regulation of cosmetic medicine. Media reports said the clinic owner and surgeon, surnamed Ting (丁), was previously convicted of negligent homicide for a postsurgical death and had been charged with coercion and aggravated assault after allegedly stopping a patient from calling for an ambulance. He had also been fined for failing inspections and had allegedly permitted people without medical licenses to assist

Comrade Xi's soaring rhetoric was stuffed with “martyrs, sacrifice, solemnity and unwavering resolve” in praise of the “Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.” His aspirations overflowed with “world peace” and love of the United Nations, of which China is a founding member.
The Liberation Army Daily said that every word from General Secretary Xi Jinping “resounded in his powerful voice, illuminating the

The US Department of State later affirmed that the AIT remarks reflect Washington's long-standing position: Taiwan's political status remains undetermined and should only be resolved peacefully.

Jimmy Kimmel has not commented publicly about his suspension since his show was pulled off the airwaves.CHRIS DELMAS/AFP/Getty Images

Jimmy Kimmel was due to return to ABC's late-night television lineup on Tuesday after a nearly week-long suspension over his on-air remarks about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's accused assassin that drew the ire of the Trump administration.

On his first night back, the comedian was expected to address his comments from last week that rankled some viewers, prompted threats of federal regulatory action and led to a boycott of the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show by two major television station groups.

While ABC parent Walt Disney announced on Monday that it was ready to restore Kimmel to the airwaves, station owners Nexstar Media and Sinclair have said they will continue to preempt Kimmel's time slot with other programming on their network affiliate stations, which reach about 23 per cent of U.S. households.

Still, Disney's decision to cut short Kimmel's exile from late-night television marked a high-profile act of corporate defiance in the face of an escalating crackdown by U.S. President Donald Trump on his perceived media critics through litigation and regulatory threats.

Kimmel, whose show has frequently lampooned Trump, sparked outrage from conservatives for saying that the president's supporters were desperate to characterize Kirk's accused assassin “as anything other than one of them” and for trying to “score political points” from his murder.

The comments came in the opening monologue of Kimmel's broadcast on September 15, five days after Kirk, an influential Trump ally, author and radio-podcast host, was shot dead while speaking on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem.

Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates broadcasters, said on a podcast hosted by conservative commentator Benny Johnson on September 17 that Kimmel's remarks were part of an effort to lie to the American public about the politics of the man accused of killing Kirk, and that he was looking at “remedies.”

He urged local broadcasters in ABC's network to quit airing Kimmel and warned stations that they otherwise could face fines or the loss of licenses.

“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said then.

A short time after Carr's remarks, Disney announced an immediate, indefinite halt to production of the Kimmel show, as Nexstar announced it would not carry the late-night program. Sinclair followed suit later that same day.

Trump, who has repeatedly pressured broadcasters and other media to squelch content that he has found objectionable, cheered the news of Kimmel's suspension after it was announced and referred to it erroneously as an outright cancellation of the show.

In comments to reporters last week aboard Air Force One, the president raised the prospect of revoking FCC licenses as punishment for what he regarded as unfair treatment of him by broadcasters, saying, “It will be up to Brendan Carr.”

Carr's attack on Kimmel marked his latest effort to rein in media companies for perceived bias against the Trump administration and Republicans, stoking fears among free-speech advocates who saw the FCC chairman as wielding the agency's regulatory authority as a cudgel and drawing criticism from many Democrats and some Republicans.

Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon touched on the suspension of 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' in the Thursday night episodes of their own late-night shows, while protesters took to the streets in front of ABC.

The Associated Press

Influential podcaster Joe Rogan, who endorsed Trump for the presidency, weighed into the debate Tuesday, taking issue with the government attempting to curb speech.

“I definitely don't think that the government should be involved ever in dictating what a comedian can or cannot say in a monologue,” said Rogan, in a podcast released Tuesday.

Kimmel had planned to address the widening controversy on his show last Wednesday, but Disney executives feared the monologue would have further inflamed the situation - and suspended the show.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Kimmel had not commented publicly about his suspension. In announcing the show's return, Disney said it found Kimmel's comments about Kirk the week before “were ill-timed and thus insensitive,” but the entertainment giant stopped short of an outright apology.

They once laughed at Donald Trump for boasting about his domestic achievements.

On Tuesday, delegates in the United Nations chamber sat in stunned silence as Mr Trump berated them for leading their countries to disaster, ridiculed his hosts for a broken escalator and teleprompter, and poured scorn on the rules-based international order by ignoring the 15-minute limit on speeches.

“I feel very happy to be up here with you, nevertheless,” the US president said in his opening remarks as he explained why he would have to read his speech from paper. “And that way you speak more from the heart.

“I can only say that whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.”

His audience laughed with him.

The moment was very different to 2018, when his boasts about how his administration had accomplished “more than almost any administration in the history” of the US triggered mocking laughter in the hall.

That humiliation helped drive Mr Trump to turn his back on the UN and develop his America First movement.

But the US president and the world have both changed in the past seven years.

Mr Trump has lost an election, survived an assassination attempt, and returned to power with a dedicated team of loyalists intent on taking a hammer to US institutions and the global order.

In front of him were delegates who now know that the Trump of 2018 is no longer just a brief aberration. They come from governments drawn from a new international populist movement or whose leaders know that working with Mr Trump is more fruitful than opposing him.

The result was that he was able to rail against enemies and talk up his successes without a hint of mockery from his audience.

“Today, just eight months into my administration, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close,” he said.

This was carnival barker Trump.

While his speechwriters struck a perfect, respectful tone for his address during his second state visit to the UK, praising the King and Britain in equal measure, Tuesday's speech was more like a raucous rally address to the red-hatted faithful.

“Zero f---s given,” was how one former adviser put it in a text message.

Mr Trump delighted in ribbing the UN for the state of its building, describing how an escalator had broken down as he and the first lady made their way to the hall and using it as a metaphor for the institution's failures in helping him end conflicts around the world.

“These are the two things I got from the United Nations, a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,” he said.

What would you expect, he added, from an organisation that was not coming close to living up to its potential? “At least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter.”

As ever with Mr Trump, his worldview is linked to the personal and to his experience as a real estate developer.

In the early 2000s, his bid to renovate the UN headquarters in Manhattan, with much of the cost coming out of his own pocket, was rejected, meaning his grand plan for marble floors never came to fruition.

“You walk on terrazzo,” he told his audience of international diplomats. “Do you notice that?”

Fifteen minutes into the speech, he was talking about launching strikes on Iran. “We have the greatest weapons on Earth,” he said.

A red light flicked into life on his lectern, a warning that he had overshot his time limit.

It made no difference.

Just as organisers of this year's Nato summit cut their meetings short to appease the president, so too UN officials may well have decided that it was better to allow Mr Trump to do his thing and worry about it later.

The result was a 57-minute speech that included attacks on “Sleepy Joe” Biden, the “green energy scam”, claims that Christianity is “the most persecuted religion on the planet”, and warnings of the death of Western Europe.

“No more cows,” he said at one point as he mocked environmentalists' worries about carbon emissions. “We don't want cows anymore. I guess they want to kill all the cows.”

The thread that linked it together was how the modern world order in general – and the UN in particular – was mishandling the big issues of the day, and how the Trump approach is better.

Whether it is questions about Iran, Gaza, green energy, freedom of speech, or immigration, for the US president, it all comes down to the same issue as the spurned UN renovation.

“And I realised that they did not know what they were doing when it came to construction... the product that they were proposing to build was so bad and so costly...”

Mr Trump recalled. “And I said, wait till you see the overruns.

“Well, I turned out to be right.”

It was striking even by the standards of an unpredictable US president known for surprising allies and enemies alike.

After months of telling Ukraine that its land in the east was lost to Russia and that it was time to settle for peace, Donald Trump offered a striking new position during a day of speeches and meetings at the United Nations in New York.

“I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.

“With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, Nato, the original borders from where this war started, is very much an option.”

Mr Trump delivered his message after a meeting with Volodomyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.

It followed two days of soft diplomacy during his state visit to Britain on Sept 17, when the King gently reminded Mr Trump at the Windsor Castle banquet that “tyranny once again threatens Europe.”

On Tuesday, headlines came thick and fast after Mr Trump's post was published.

Social media commentators concluded that the president had pulled off a stunning U-turn, throwing his weight behind a Ukrainian victory and the restoration of its borders.

But has the US president really tired of Vladimir Putin? He is, after all, a leader who has repeatedly delivered warm words to Mr Trump while at the same as time delivering missiles and drones to Ukraine (as Melania Trump has pointed out to her husband in the past).

Was he really now throwing his weight behind Ukraine and a leader he once humiliated in the Oval Office? Up to a point.

This is a president impressed by strength and in thrall to winners.

Mr Trump's General Assembly speech and his subsequent post made clear that the facts on the ground had left him unimpressed with Russia's inability to defeat a smaller opponent.

He called Russia a “paper tiger” in comments later in the day.

“In any event, I wish both countries well,” he continued. “We will continue to supply weapons to Nato for Nato to do what they want with them. Good luck to all!”

Recommended

Look beyond the headlines, and the statement is a lesson in messaging.

Rather than pledging fresh support to Ukraine or loading up action on Russia, Mr Trump appears to be handing things over to Europe and Nato.

There is no suggestion of extra support for Ukraine, or that he will punish Moscow further. His only commitment is to keep selling weapons to allies. Hardly a game changer.

After staking so much of his own reputation to bring Putin to Alaska for talks and putting himself at the heart of negotiations, Mr Trump has learned a difficult lesson: ending a war is hard.

It sounds as if he may have had enough.

Anti-vaxxers are copying a core anti-abortion strategy: if you can't make it illegal, make it inaccessible instead.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

For the first time since COVID vaccines were made widely available in 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has severely restricted who can access them. After years of allowing everyone to access this life-saving vaccine, the FDA has said that it is limiting COVID vaccines to people who are 65 years or older and at high risk. Some states, including Illinois and Colorado, have chosen to ignore this guidance, because it isn't based on science, and it isn't about protecting anyone's health — it's about cowering to fanatics while maintaining the veneer of decorum.

It's a tactic vaccine deniers learned from another radical, anti-science faction — abortion opponents. For the decade leading up to the Dobbs decision that finally overturned Roe v. Wade, abortion opponents grew ever more creative in their attempts to undermine access to abortion without outright banning it.

TRAP laws, short for Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers, became all the anti-abortion rage in the 2010s because they allowed hostile legislators to force abortion clinics to close without directly banning abortion. These laws required abortion clinics to meet onerous and medically unnecessary requirements — requiring that abortion clinics meet the facility standards for ambulatory surgical centers, for example. Abortion is an outpatient procedure that is 14 times safer than childbirth, according to one study, and has a lower complication rate than knee surgery. There is absolutely no need for an abortion clinic to meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center, and it is extremely costly to do so. That was the entire point. While abortion opponents branded TRAP laws as “protecting women's safety,” in reality, they were designed to force abortion clinics to close. And they were extremely successful at it — between 2018 and 2023, 139 abortion clinics were forced to close their doors, according to the Abortion Care Network.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Limiting COVID vaccines arbitrarily, without any scientific basis and after years of unfettered access, is straight out of the TRAP law playbook. It undercuts access without banning vaccines. Who counts as “high risk” and who doesn't? Even if you are over 65 years of age, access to the COVID vaccine isn't guaranteed. In Florida, folks over 65 have reported that they've been told they require a prescription in order to get the vaccine. That isn't specific in the new FDA guidance, either. So, who can get a vaccine, where can they get it, and how? There is no definitive answer.

That confusion is a critical part of the ban without a ban. If you make health care inaccessible, it doesn't matter whether it's technically legal or not.

That confusion is a critical part of the ban without a ban. If you make health care inaccessible, it doesn't matter whether it's technically legal or not. And if you have competing messages and requirements, all the better — not only do vaccine seekers not know the requirements, but the pharmacists dispensing the vaccines may not be clear, either.

We've seen the same thing when it comes to attempts to restrict and ban access to mifepristone and misoprostol, the two drugs commonly used in medication abortion. Even in states where abortion is legally protected, some companies have refused to fulfill prescriptions for the medications. Costco has refused to provide mifepristone in its pharmacies, including in some states with abortion protections. Other pharmacies, like Walgreens and CVS, have said that they will provide the medication. The patchwork of legality and access regarding abortion care has made it difficult for the average abortion seeker to understand what the law is, where they can get one, and if they could face criminalization.

This kind of rampant confusion and chaos created a chilling effect among abortion seekers, and it is now being used in service of vaccine deniers.

In my home state of Colorado, Gov. Jared Polis (D) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment issued a public health order ensuring access to the COVID vaccine for anyone who wants one. My husband and I were both able to get our COVID vaccines without any issue. But even with that order in place, some Coloradans have reported being denied access to the COVID vaccine because they don't meet the FDA's preconditions, even though the state's public health order guarantees them the ability to have one. Even in a “protected” state, folks still aren't able to easily access the vaccine; and when they tell their friends and family, that confusion grows and spreads. It becomes all but impossible to put the proverbial genie back in the bottle to make clear who can get a vaccine — which, of course, is the point.

But even if you can get a COVID vaccine, vaccine deniers are still working to stigmatize this kind of basic care that enjoys broad American support, just as abortion opponents did.

Taking a page directly out of the anti-abortion playbook, the Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo equated vaccine mandates with “slavery.” Ousted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Dr. Susan Monarez testified before Congress that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told her that the “CDC told hospitals to turn away sick Covid patients until they had blue lips before allowing them to get treatment,” an absurd lie.

What RFK Jr. and Ladapo are doing is reframing vaccines — a traditionally nonpartisan, broadly supported, basic health care service — as threatening and destructive. Vaccines are very safe. Ladapo even acknowledged that he didn't review the evidence when rescinding the state's vaccine mandate.

Vaccines save lives. Abortion care saves lives. Both are safe, effective, and essential to your fundamental right to bodily autonomy.

That's because attacks on vaccines, like attacks on abortion, don't just defy evidence — they are anti-evidence. Like so much of the Republican Party's positioning today, these attacks rely on drumming up fear and distrust of the scientific advancements that have provided stability and safety for millions of Americans. When fanatics can erode our public confidence in basic health care that has been proven to save lives, they can easily consolidate control in even broader, more insidious ways. Stigmatizing vaccines is a means of making us disbelieve what we see with our own eyes.

Supporters of science and common sense shouldn't back down in the face of vaccine deniers. Do not allow fanatics and bad actors to brand basic health care as somehow deviant and wrong, to convince you that they alone have the answers, to wipe out decades of research about vaccines' safety, from right under your noses. Vaccines save lives. Abortion care saves lives. Both are safe, effective, and essential to your fundamental right to bodily autonomy.

Take it from those of us who have been fighting for abortion rights — once that right is gone, it's hard to get back.

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            In a just-about hourlong address to the UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump insulted the organization repeatedly.
    


            He mocked the UN headquarters building, questioned the entire purpose of the organization, bragged about his own accomplishments and called the concept of climate change a “con job.”
    


            Here are some of the more colorful moments, along with some context.
    


TRUMP: I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working. I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless, and that way, you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.
    


The teleprompter would ultimately be fixed. Trump truly did not seem to mind speaking without it.



TRUMP: Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term. Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents. An era of calm and stability gave way to one of the great crises of our time, and here in the United States, four years of weakness, lawlessness and radicalism under the last administration delivered our nation into a repeated set of disasters.
    


This is a theme of all Trump speeches. It's a golden age when he's in power and chaos when he isn't. Real life is obviously more complicated.



TRUMP: Just eight months into my administration, we're the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close.
    


This is Trump's new favorite line. The US is HOT.



TRUMP: In my first term, I built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We had the best economy ever, history of the world. And I'm doing the same thing again, but this time it's actually much bigger and even better. The numbers far surpass my record-setting first term.
    


People of good will can debate these boasts.



TRUMP: I want to thank the country of El Salvador for the successful and professional job they've done in receiving and jailing so many criminals that entered our country.
    


The US has deported people to El Salvador who are not from El Salvador, and it has also deported people who do not appear to be criminals. They are often held in a controversial prison with appalling living conditions.



TRUMP: On the world stage, America is respected again like it has never been respected before. You think about two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, or one year ago, we were a laughingstock all over the world.
    


People may not be laughing at the US, in part because Trump has used tariffs as a weapon against much of the world. He has, however, failed to bring peace in Ukraine or in the Middle East, as he promised. Read a fact check from CNN's Daniel Dale.



TRUMP: In a period of just seven months, I have ended seven unendable wars… It's too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them, and sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them. I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal.
    


Ending wars deserves credit. But there are some asterisks. Trump gets clear credit for hosting peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan after nearly four decades of war. The conflict in Congo and Rwanda continues, however, despite Trump's peace effort, according to CNN's latest report. India has rejected the idea that Trump ended its short-lived conflict with Pakistan. The ceasefire between Iran and Israel was also negotiated by Qatar and came only after Israel violated Trump's previous ceasefire announcement. Neither Kosovo and Serbia nor Ethiopia and Egypt were technically at war during Trump's term. Dale goes much more in-depth.



TRUMP: All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up, stopped right in the middle. If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen, but she's in great shape. We're both in good shape. We both stood… These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.
    


We will soon learn what's behind Trump's dislike of the UN headquarters building.



TRUMP: What is the purpose of the United Nations? The UN has such tremendous potential. I've always said it. It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential, for the most part. At least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. It's empty words, and empty words don't solve war. The only thing that solves war and wars is action.
    


Again, Trump gets some credit for peace efforts, but he has failed to stop the two wars he promised to end as a candidate. But it's also not controversial to say the UN has not lived up to its potential.



TRUMP: Everyone says that I should get the Nobel Peace Prize for each one of these achievements. But for me, the real prize will be the sons and daughters who live to grow up with their mothers and fathers because millions of people are no longer being killed in endless and unglorious wars. What I care about is not winning prizes; it's saving lives. We save millions and millions of lives with the seven wars. And we have others that we're working on. And you know that.
    


            Trump very much wants to win the Nobel Peace Prize. He would be the fifth US president to do so, joining Woodrow Wilson, Teddy Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
    


TRUMP: Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J. Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex….
    


            But they decided to go in another direction, which was much more expensive at the time and which actually produced a far inferior product…. It was going to cost them a fortune. And I said, and wait till you see the overruns. Well, I turned out to be right…. They had massive cost overruns and spent between 2 and 4 billion dollars on the building and did not even get the marble floors that I promised them. You walk on terrazzo. Do you notice that?
    


            As far as I'm concerned, frankly, looking at the building and getting stuck on the escalator, they still haven't finished the job…. The project was so corrupt that Congress actually asked me to testify before them on the tremendous waste of money…. Unfortunately, many things in the United Nations are happening just like that, but on an even much bigger scale. Much, much bigger. Very sad to see.
    


It's true. Trump did testify before Congress about the UN headquarters building in 2005.



TRUMP: As if to encourage continued conflict, some of this body is seeking to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The rewards would be too great for Hamas' terrorists for their atrocities… but instead of giving in to Hamas' ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: Release the hostages now. Just release the hostages now.
    


The UN recognizes 193 countries and most, more than 150, now recognize Palestine as a state. The countries that joined the list this week include France, Belgium, Monaco, Luxembourg, Malta, Britain, Canada, Australia and Portugal.



TRUMP: Even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago and I wasn't happy. Think of it — they're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?
    


Europe does indeed continue to import oil from Russia  but far less than before the war, when Russia was Europe's largest oil importer. The US continues to import things like fertilizer from Russia, according to a CNN report.



TRUMP: Just a few years ago, reckless experiments overseas gave us a devastating global pandemic, yet despite that worldwide catastrophe, many countries are continuing the extremely risky research into bio-weapons and manmade pathogens. This is unbelievably dangerous.
    


The origins of Covid-19 are, to say the least, still hotly debated. Intelligence agencies that previously declined to say the virus came from a Chinese lab leak have changed their tune in Trump's second term, although the CIA makes the claim with “low confidence.”



TRUMP: To prevent potential disasters, I'm announcing today that my administration will lead an international effort to enforce biological weapons convention, which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust.
    


            Hopefully, the UN can play a constructive role, and it will also go — be one of the early projects under AI. Let's see how good it is, ‘cause a lot of people are saying it could be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good. And this would be an example of that.
    


This is an objectively interesting idea.



TRUMP: We have reasserted that America belongs to the American people, and I encourage all countries to take their own stand in defense of their citizens as well. You have to do that because I see it. I'm not mentioning names. I see it, and I can call every single one of them out. You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed.
    


            Europe is in serious trouble. They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe. Nobody has ever — and nobody's doing anything to change it, to get them out. It's not sustainable. And because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it.
    


The issue of immigration is roiling politics in Europe, too. Trump wants to help fuel a surge to the political right. Trump also made a wild accusation about London's mayor and made a specious claim about the rise of sharia law in London. Local officials were appalled.



Separately, Trump expresses a lot of concern for Europe and none for the global South.



TRUMP: It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. It's — I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.
    


TRUMP: By them not coming, we're saving tremendous numbers of lives. My people have done a fantastic job in doing what they did, and the — the American public agrees with it. I mean, I was very proud to see this morning, I have the highest poll numbers I've ever had.
    


Trump here recasts his immigration crackdown and deportation effort as a humanitarian effort. His approval rating, according to Gallup, is at 40%, which is up from July's 37%, but still very much underwater.



TRUMP: We've recently begun using the supreme power of the United States military to destroy Venezuelan terrorists and trafficking networks led by Nicolás Maduro. To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence. That's what we're doing. We have no choice.
    


There's a very real question about whether Trump should be asking Congress for authority to make these strikes and whether they violate international law.



TRUMP: We're getting rid of the falsely named renewables. By the way, they're a joke. They don't work. They're too expensive; they're not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great. The wind doesn't blow. Those big windmills are so pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate, and they have to be rebuilt all of the time and they start to rust and rot.
    


Trump is actively working to smother the offshore wind energy industry, including by citing national security to stop at least one nearly completed project.



TRUMP: All green is all bankrupt. That's what it represents. And it's not politically correct, I'll be very badly criticized for saying it, but I'm here to tell the truth. I don't care, it doesn't matter to me. I'm in New York City. I'm feeling a lot safer…. It's the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you're involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling.
    


Trump blames the UN specifically for raising the alarm about climate change. The organization plays a key role in documenting the effects of climate change and pushing for international agreements to address it.



TRUMP: All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don't get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.
    


Climate change is occurring and the world is already seeing the consequences.



TRUMP: And I'm really good at predicting things, you know?… I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything. And I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail. And if you don't stop people that you've never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. I'm the president of the United States but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration.
    


He does not appear to worry about Asia, Africa or South America. But he is very confident in his opinions.



TRUMP: You want to be nice, you want to be politically correct, and you're destroying your heritage. They must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late. The carbon footprint is a hoax made up by people with evil intentions, and they're heading down a path of total destruction.
    


Trump seems to think there is a cabal of climate scientists in league with the cabal of people who support open borders.



TRUMP: So all of these countries are working so hard on the carbon footprint, which is nonsense, by the way. It's nonsense.
    


He's arguing that because China is emitting more carbon, every other country shouldn't bother.



TRUMP: In the United States we have, still, radicalized environmentalists, and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. “We don't want cows anymore.” I guess they want to kill all the cows.
    


Cow farts produce methane and it's a major climate change issue. But there is no serious talk about killing all the cows.



TRUMP: In Asia, they dump much of their garbage right into the ocean, and over about a one-week and two-week journey, it flows right past Los Angeles — you've seen it — massive amounts of garbage, almost too much to do anything about flowing past Los Angeles, past San Francisco, and then somebody will get in trouble because he dropped a cigarette on the beach. The whole thing is crazy.
    


This line of thinking would lead to a lot of cigarette butts on beaches.



TRUMP: European electricity bills are now four to five times more expensive than those in China, and two to three times higher than the United States. And our bills are coming way down.
    


Electricity prices are on the rise in the US, in part due to the needs of AI.



TRUMP: So while the US has approximately 1,300 heat-related deaths annually — that's a lot — Europe loses more than 175,000 people to heat deaths each year cause the costs are so expensive, you can't turn on an air conditioner. What is that all about? That's not Europe, that's not the Europe that I love and know — all in the name of pretending to stop the global warming hoax.
    


Clearly Europe needs more air conditioning as a result of climate change. But it also seems likely that the rise in heat related deaths there has something to do with climate change.



TRUMP: The entire globalist concept of asking successful industrialized nations to inflict pain on themselves and radically disrupt their entire societies must be rejected completely and totally, and it must be immediate.
    


TRUMP: I have a little standing order in the White House — never use the word “coal,” only use the words, “clean, beautiful coal.” It sounds much better, doesn't it?
    


Not to those concerned about the climate crisis. How about an all-of-the-above strategy that recognizes climate change?



TRUMP: In closing, I just want to repeat that immigration and the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world, and a large part of our planet. Countries that cherish freedom are fading fast because of their policies on these two subjects. You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.
    


In short, Trump says to the rest of the world, you're all doing it wrong.

CHICAGO (AP) — Police body camera footage released Tuesday shows a federal immigration agent who fatally shot a Mexican immigrant describing his own injuries during a vehicle pursuit as “nothing major,” a contrast from the Trump administration's characterization of events in suburban Chicago earlier this month. 

The Department of Homeland Security has said the officer was “seriously injured” by Silverio Villegas González, who allegedly tried to evade arrest after agents pulled over his car in Franklin Park. Nearly three hours of video and audio clips obtained by The Associated Press through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on the shooting that has escalated tensions amid a federal immigration crackdown in the country's third-largest city.

DHS said Villegas González drove his car at officers, dragging one of them “a significant distance,” leaving the officer to “fear for his life.” The officer then opened fire. Federal officials have said their officers weren't wearing body cameras at the time.

Franklin Park police footage shows local officers arriving at the roadside where a car had crashed into a cargo truck in Franklin Park, about 18 miles (29 kilometers) west of Chicago. 

Two ICE agents attempt to explain to the police officer what had happened moments after an agent shot and killed Villegas González,

“He tried to run us over,” an ICE agent says. 




“I got dragged a little bit,” said the injured agent, who can be seen walking and talking while wearing ripped jeans with blood on them.

The videos show the first agent saying his partner had suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands” while speaking over a radio.

“Nothing major,” the injured officer says while putting his arms up to shrug off concerns. 

Immigrant rights advocates, Illinois' top elected officials and Mexico's president have called for a thorough investigation and more transparency after the shooting that put area schools on lockdown and prompted protests.

“We want answers to questions that we have raised,” U.S. Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia, a Chicago Democrat, said Tuesday. “The family is entitled to it. The community wants to know what is going on, and the public deserves answers as well.”

Federal officials had previously said the agent suffered “multiple” and “serious injuries.” DHS, which has not identified either agent, said the injured officer who fired his weapon has been a member of ICE since 2021 and served in the military. DHS said it was the officer's first time firing his weapon in a “use of force incident.”

“His life was put at risk and he sustained serious injuries,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who visited Chicago for an immigration operation last week, posted on X last week. Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, told the AP on Friday that he had met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate. He declined further comment, saying there is an open investigation. 

DHS officials did not return messages Tuesday. 

The videos, from the perspective of multiple officers arriving on the scene, also show the two ICE agents performing chest compressions on an unresponsive man lying on the ground before other emergency personnel take over. Blood can be seen on the pavement.

ICE operations in Chicago, where federal officials have arrested more than 550 people, have drawn comparisons to the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Los Angeles earlier this summer. In Los Angeles, at least two people died while attempting to evade ICE — a farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a raid and a man struck by an SUV while running from agents outside a Home Depot store.

Villegas González, who worked as a cook, had just dropped off one of his children at day care the morning of the shooting in the close-knit and largely Hispanic suburb of roughly 18,000 people. DHS said he had a history of reckless driving and did not have legal permission to live in the U.S. 

The day care's director described him as a good father while many Franklin Park residents came to vigils and remembered him as a kind family man.

The 38-year-old was from the state of Michoacan in western Mexico, according to the Consulate General of Mexico in Chicago, which said it would “closely monitor” the investigation.

President Donald Trump on Monday used the platform of the presidency to promote unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism as his administration announced a wide-ranging effort to study the causes of the complex brain disorder.

From the pulpit of the presidency, Donald Trump offered some advice to pregnant women: “Tough it out” before taking Tylenol.

Nine times in all, Trump said expectant mothers should suffer through their discomfort instead of reaching for acetaminophen — or paracetamol in countries outside the U.S. — to cure their fevers or headaches, despite the drug being one of the few painkillers that pregnant women are allowed to take.

“Fight like hell not to take it,” Trump instructed at a Monday news conference meant to address autism. He added that if pregnant women absolutely have to take Tylenol, that'll be something that they “work out with themselves.”

What many women and experts heard was the latest example of a man telling women how much physical pain they should endure — and an age-old effort to blame mothers for their babies' autism.

“His use of ‘tough it out' really was infuriating because it dismissed women's pain and the real danger that exists with fever and miscarriage during pregnancy,” said women's rights advocate and social media influencer Amanda Tietz, a 46-year-old mom of three in Wisconsin, in an email. “Not to mention the pain we can experience in pregnancy that can be debilitating.”

Others saw a man opining — again, without evidence that maternal use of Tylenol causes autism or ADHD in children — on mothers, children with disabilities and their health at a time when studies show pain suffered by women is frequently dismissed. Women's health and their autonomy are especially fraught issues in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in 2022 to strip away constitutional protections for abortion, a deeply personal change for Americans nearly a half century after Roe v. Wade. The debate now roils state legislatures nationwide.

“Yesterday 5 powerful men stood together in the WH and shamed: Pregnant women, told to ‘tough it out' through pain; Moms of autistic kids, blamed for their child's condition; Autistic people, called broken & in need of fixing,” Trump's former surgeon general, Jerome Adams, posted on social media. “Can we all be kinder and less stigmatizing?” 




Three women also spoke at Monday's press conference and thanked Trump: Dorothy Fink, the acting assistant secretary at HHS; and Jackie O'Brien and Amanda Rumer, two mothers who said they have autistic children.

Dr. Nicole B. Saphier of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center said pregnant women generally are advised to take acetaminophen only under medical supervision, when necessary and at the lowest effective dose. But equally important — and missing from Trump's message — was that untreated fever or severe pain can also pose serious risks to mothers and babies, she said.

“For decades, women have endured a paternalistic tone in medicine. We've moved past dismissing symptoms as ‘hysteria,'” Saphier, who also is a Fox News medical contributor, wrote in an email. “The President's recent comments on Tylenol in pregnancy are a prime example. Advising moderation was sound; delivering it in a patronizing, simplistic way was not.”

Trump is not known for a delicate touch around policy where women are concerned. Ahead of the 2016 election, he erupted over tough questioning by Fox News' Megyn Kelly, later telling CNN: “You can see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.” He's got a special playbook for female opponents that includes put-downs about their appearance, their emotional stability and their intelligence. 

There's a long history of men holding forth, sometimes incorrectly, about women's reproductive health. Former Missouri Republican Rep. Todd Akin sank his 2012 U.S. Senate campaign with remarks about what constituted “legitimate rape.” Others have erred by suggesting publicly and falsely that rape victims can't get pregnant. 

History offers a long list of men making medical policy for women based on the beliefs of their time — and, some say, suspicion about the power of women to create and shape their unborn babies. A nearly half-century-old theory, long discredited, held that “refrigerator mothers” — cold or distant figures — were responsible for their children's autism. 

Trump's advice “took me straight back to when moms were blamed for autism,” said Alison Singer, founder of the Autism Science Foundation. “He basically said, if you can't take the pain, if you can't deal with the fever, then it's your fault.”

Trump's “tough it out” advice is familiar to Mary E. Fissell, a professor of medical history with Johns Hopkins University. “It's the classic blame-the-mother ...over and over again,” she said. The “maternal imagination,” for example, was a principle once thought to influence the way a baby forms. 

“It's the idea that what a pregnant woman desires or feels or imagines will shape the form of her unborn child,” said Fissell, who focuses on 17th- and 18th-century medical history. 

Trump offered at least one moment of introspection during his news conference, acknowledging the awkward nature of his directive.

“You know, it's easy for me to say tough it out,” the president allowed. “But sometimes in life or a lot of other things, you have to tough it out also.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.

The new find was possibly 23 feet (7 meters) long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.

Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and “huge and very powerful claws,” said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.

But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline — mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the discovery of a new dinosaur from Argentina that may have used its long arms and claws to capture prey.

In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhué Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.

This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali “fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,” Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.

The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago — close to the time dinosaurs went extinct — and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.




The front leg bone pressed against its jaws — belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles — could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.

Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one. 

“All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,” he said.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons discusses efforts to stop illegal immigration on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is targeting an illegal alien who is charged with strangling his infant sister with a power cord, leaving the baby in critical condition.

In a statement Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had lodged a detainer against Alvaro Mejia-Ayala, a 21-year-old Salvadoran national, after he was arrested for strangulation of an infant by police in Leesburg, Virginia.

According to the Leesburg Police Department, police responded to a report of an infant not breathing on the morning of Sept. 17. The department said it discovered the baby had been the victim of an assault and that Mejia-Ayala had fled on foot.

Local Fox affiliate Fox 5 reported that the infant was found unresponsive with a white charging cable around her neck.

With the assistance of the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, the department tracked down Mejia-Ayala. He is now in custody and is being charged with strangulation.

According to DHS, the baby is in critical condition.

A spokesperson for the agency told Fox News Digital that Mejia-Ayala entered the U.S. as part of a family unit from El Salvador during the Obama administration in 2016. The spokesperson said that on Oct. 17, 2024, the Biden administration dismissed Mejia-Ayala's immigration case, allowing him to illegally remain in the U.S. indefinitely.

DHS also said that Mejia-Ayala was previously arrested by police for reckless driving in 2024, but he was released ""before ICE could even lodge a detainer.""

The Virginia General District Court online database says that Mejia-Ayala pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of reckless driving in February 2024. The database also lists several other charges against Mejia-Ayala, including driving without a license in 2023 and failure to display license plates in 2024 and 2025.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin commented on the case, saying that ""ICE lodged an immigration detainer to ensure this heinous criminal is not released on U.S. streets.""

""What kind of sick monster strangles a defenseless, innocent baby girl with a charging cord? This barbarism has no place in the U.S.,"" said McLaughlin. ""President Trump and Secretary Noem have been clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.""

In a separate message posted to X, McLaughlin wrote, ""Pray for this precious baby girl. May God cover her and protect her.""

In another X post, Homeland Security called Mejia-Ayala a ""monster"" and the case an example of ""PURE EVIL.""

""This criminal illegal alien STRANGLED AN INFANT with a charging cable,"" DHS wrote, adding, ""President Trump and @Sec_Noem will not allow this barbarism in America.""

A spokesperson for Biden declined to comment. Fox News Digital also reached out to Obama spokespeople but did not receive a response by the time of publication.

Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, unpacks efforts to limit judges from making decisions for the whole country on 'Hannity.'

FIRST ON FOX: A conservative climate policy group is urging House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, to subpoena records from the Environmental Law Institute's Climate Judiciary Project as part of an ongoing probe into the influence of climate advocacy groups in climate policy litigation. 

Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, a conservative pro-U.S. energy production policy group, wrote a letter to Jordan last week pointing to evidence from a Sept. 12 Multnomah County v. ExxonMobil et al. court filing that he says suggests ""covert coordination and judicial manipulation.""

""This new evidence raises serious red flags about the credibility of both the so-called science being used in climate lawsuits and the judicial training programs behind the bench,"" Isaac told Fox News Digital. 

According to Isaac's letter to Jordan, the court filing submitted by Chevron Corporation earlier this month reveals that ""one of the plaintiffs' lead attorneys, Roger Worthington, had undisclosed involvement in at least two so-called scientific studies that the county is presenting as independent, peer-reviewed evidence.""

One of those studies ""acknowledged funding from the Climate Judiciary Project in a draft version, but that disclosure was inexplicably removed from the final publication,"" Isaac said in the letter. 

Earlier drafts of the study, labeled ""DO NOT DISTRIBUTE,"" were found on Worthington's law firm website, the letter revealed. 

TOP ENERGY GROUP CALLS FOR PROBE INTO SECRETIVE 'NATIONAL LAWFARE CAMPAIGN' TO INFLUENCE JUDGES ON CLIMATE

According to the American Energy Institute, the study seeks to ""attribute global economic losses from climate change to specific oil companies."" The website also included a ""pre-publication draft of a CJP judicial training module"" with internal editorial comments, according to the letter. 

Isaac told Jordan this mark-up raises ""serious questions about how and why a plaintiffs' attorney had early access to, and possibly editorial influence over, materials being presented to state and federal judges as ‘neutral' science.""

Another module was designed to ""educate"" participant judges on how to apply ""attribution science"" in the courtroom, according to Isaac. 

Attribution science seeks to measure how much human-caused climate change is responsible for certain extreme weather events, per Science News Explores' definition. 

""The Environmental Law Institute has claimed neutrality, yet documents suggest coordination with plaintiffs' counsel who stand to profit from the outcomes,"" Isaac told Fox News Digital. ""If the same lawyers suing energy companies are shaping the studies and educating the judges, that is not justice; it is manipulation. Congress is right to dig deeper, and the American Energy Institute is proud to support that effort."" 

Isaac is requesting that Jordan formally request ""communications, draft documents, funding agreements, and internal editorial notes related to the scientific studies and CJP curriculum.""

While commending Jordan's leadership, Isaac said, ""Judges and the public deserve to know whether the courtroom is being quietly shaped by coordinated climate advocacy posing as neutral expertise.""

Isaac said the Environmental Law Institute and Worthington should answer several questions about their involvement in the studies, including the ""judicial education module on attribution science.""

""Does ELI regularly seek input from plaintiffs' attorneys on its judicial education modules?"" Isaac questioned. 

""ELI did not fund the Nature study, and the Climate Judiciary Project has not coordinated with Mr. Worthington,"" Environmental Law Institute spokesman Nick Collins told Fox News Digital in a statement. 

""CJP does not participate in or provide support for litigation,"" Collins added. ""Rather, CJP provides evidence-based continuing education to judges about climate science and how it arises in the law. Our curriculum is fact-based and science-first, grounded in consensus reports and developed with a robust peer review process that meets the highest scholarly standards.""

When 23 Republican state attorneys general sent a letter last month to Environmental Protection Agency chief Lee Zeldin calling on him to cancel funding to the Environmental Law Institute, Collins told Fox News Digital that the Climate Judiciary Project's projects are far from ""radical.""

""The programs in which the Climate Judiciary Project (CJP) participates are no different than other judicial education programs, providing evidence-based training on legal and scientific topics that judges voluntarily choose to attend,"" Collins said.

President Donald Trump criticized European allies in an address before the United Nations, warning them that mass migration will lead to their destruction.

In a winding speech that targeted Europe, past administrations, and even the United Nations, Trump dwelt extensively on the idea that unmitigated immigration is “destroying a large part of the free world.”

“The U.N. is supposed to stop invasions — not create them, and not finance them,” Trump said. “In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime, and deplete our social safety net.”

He contrasted his administration's sharp course correction to the continued mass migration in Western Europe, saying the continent is in “serious trouble.”

“[Europe has] been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe and nobody's doing anything to change it, to get them out,” Trump told the gathering of diplomats. “It's not sustainable, and because they choose to be politically correct, they're doing just absolutely nothing about it.”

TRUMP GOES SCORCHED EARTH ON UN AND ACCUSES IT OF NOT BEING FIT FOR PURPOSE

Trump drew particular attention to London, where he just had a state visit with King Charles III. He said the city has “so changed” that arriving Muslim immigrants are seeking to “go to Sharia law.”

Trump went on to cite 2024 statistics from the Council of Europe that found that the majority of inmates in Germany, Austria, Greece, and Switzerland were from foreign countries. He said the trends of mass immigration will contribute to the “death of Western Europe if something is not done immediately.”

“I'm the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe,” Trump said, ultimately warning, “It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now […] I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff — your countries are going to hell.”

Despite his repeated affirmations of love and affection, Trump did not withhold harsh condemnations of Europe's energy policy.

Turning his attention to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump expressed discontent with Russian President Vladimir Putin's continued refusal to participate in meaningful ceasefire negotiations.

He pointed a finger at China and India as the “primary funders of the ongoing war” for their uninterrupted purchase of Russian oil.

“But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products,” Trump said. “Which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago — and I wasn't happy.”

“Think of it,” he continued. “They're funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?”

Trump promised to bring Putin to the negotiating table and “stop the bloodshed” by deploying “a very strong round of powerful tariffs.”

“But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures,” he warned.

The European Union has implemented several rounds of sanctions on Russian energy and imports since the invasion began three years ago. This has resulted in a 89% drop in imports from the Eastern European nation.

However, the EU has continued to purchase key resources from Russia, including oil, natural gas, steel, and fertilizer, due to insufficient supply trains from alternative sources.

During his speech, Trump announced that he would meet with European leaders on the sidelines of the conference to discuss minimizing this reliance and applying further pressure on Moscow.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democrats are digging in against a short-term funding measure from Republicans and betting that the party in control of Washington will bear the brunt of the blame for a possible government shutdown.

But it's a risky calculation, given Senate Democrats are using filibuster leverage to block a largely “clean” stopgap spending measure unless enhanced Obamacare subsidies set to expire are extended. It's an annual scenario where one party invokes leverage over must-pass legislation, but only this time, the usual party roles are reversed.

Democrats are betting that Americans will blame President Donald Trump and Republicans. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they still require bipartisanship to overcome the 60-vote Senate threshold to pass a short-term funding bill. Unless more funding is approved, the federal government will shut down on Oct. 1.

“They who run the Legislative Branch usually get blamed in the eyes of voters when something goes awry or there's a shutdown of any kind,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), who now chairs Senate Democrats' campaign arm.

“What matters is if there is a shutdown and all of a sudden your benefit checks stop coming,” Reinish added.

But there's also a recent precedent suggesting that the party that supports extraneous policy riders is typically seen as responsible for shutdowns and emerges on the losing political end without significant wins. Republicans were bruised from the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which occurred in Trump's first term and lasted 35 days, after the president failed to get any additional money to construct more of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in 2018 when Republicans controlled Congress.

The Republican plan was passed by the House last week but failed to clear a 60-vote filibuster in the Senate. It includes largely extending current funding levels through Nov. 21 to allow appropriators more time to finish a bipartisan annual budget. A Democratic counterproposal would provide funding through October and extend the Obamacare insurance credits, along with a Democratic wish list of other policies that are non-starters for the GOP.

“This is the same budget that the Democrats approved six months ago, just adjusted for inflation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. “And unfortunately, all of a sudden, now they want to shut down the government.”

Leavitt told reporters that discussions are “ongoing” with both Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) were originally scheduled to meet with Trump later this week, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to the Washington Examiner. 

But less than 24 hours later, Trump canceled the meeting. He said in a Truth Social post that, after reviewing the “unserious and ridiculous” demands from the Democratic leaders, he determined no meeting could “possibly be productive.” He said he would meet with Jeffries and Schumer “when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for.”

During an earlier funding showdown in March, Democrats blinked. Schumer and nine other Senate Democrats sided with Republicans to prevent a shutdown. This go-around, Democrats appear more defiant and unified as they vow to resist Republicans.

“The American people are on our side,” Schumer said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. “They believe, if there's a shutdown, it's going to be caused by Trump, because they know how much they want relief in the healthcare issue, and they know he's not negotiating.”

Pressed repeatedly, Schumer ultimately declined to confirm that he and other Democrats would vote against funding the government unless there were negotiations. He stated the party is “firm” on the “need to get something done to relieve the distress the American people are in.”

“The bottom line is,” Schumer added, “we must get a better bill than what they have, plain and simple.”

However, at least one of Schumer's members strongly disagrees. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a centrist, has criticized his party for flirting with the notion of a shutdown and vowed to support Republicans' stopgap funding bill. With opposition from Fetterman and Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a fiscal hawk who typically opposes such short-term spending bills, Republicans are likely to still require support from at least seven Democrats to get anything passed the Senate.

“For me, as a Democrat, if you are concerned by a lot of these changes that have occurred during the Trump presidency, why would you turn over a shuttered government over to [White House budget office director Russell Vought] to effectively remake the government in all kinds of ways?” Fetterman said in a later interview on CNN's State of the Union. “That would allow them to redefine exactly what's essential and what is not. And, for me, I'm not sure we have the appropriate kinds of leverage.”

SENATE DEMOCRATS TRY TO REBRAND ‘CLEAN' FUNDING BILL IN ESCALATING SHUTDOWN BRAWL

Both sides say this time involves different political calculations than the dozens of other government funding showdowns in past years. Democrats see an electorate, particularly their base, craving greater resistance to Trump. The GOP sees a president carrying out a mandate to tackle government bloat and bureaucracy.

“While they may fight our spending reductions and other Trump reforms, they don't get to hold the government hostage to force their agenda,” Rep. Eric Burlison (R-MO) told the Washington Examiner. “It only shows that he is going to throw a tantrum and shut down the country until he and the Democrats get the radical left spending increases and policy changes that they want.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

More than half of the nation's liberal voters and 40% of Democrats believe that the assassination of Charlie Kirk was “understandable,” the latest evidence that the killing has revealed a massive partisan divide in America.

In the latest Rasmussen Reports survey shared with Washington Secrets on Tuesday, 54% of liberal voters believe that Kirk, the cofounder of youth voting mobilizer Turning Point USA, spouted hate, so his killing was not surprising.

“Charlie Kirk was speaking hateful words and his murder was tragic but understandable,” said 54% of liberals and nearly half of Democrats, a group Rasmussen pollster Mark Mitchell described as voters for losing 2024 presidential candidate Kamala Harris.

Overall, most voters said that they believe Kirk was more of a uniter and agreed with the opposite view. Rasmussen said that 62% agreed with this characterization of Kirk: “Charlie Kirk was peacefully and respectfully debating people and it is a tragedy that he was murdered.”

Coming tomorrow…Almost half of Kamala voters say Charlie Kirk was speaking hateful words and his murder was tragic but UNDERSTANDABLE.

The survey is one of the first to test the nation's view of Kirk since his slaying on Sept. 10 at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. It was conducted in the days leading up to Sunday's memorial at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, attended by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, friends of Kirk.

While the general results were not unusual, the partisan divisions in the results showed how America is split on Kirk, political violence, and the effect of liberal media that has spent a year spinning that violence as Make America Great Again-inspired.

For example, despite Trump being the target of two assassins last year and Kirk's murder, more voters said that they are concerned about “extreme right-wing terrorism”  than left-wing terrorism, by a margin of 43% to 39%.

On that question, liberals helped push the numbers again, with 79% citing “extreme right-wing terrorism.”

Only 10% of Democrats are aware that Charlie Kirk's killer was Left Wing.This represents a complete failure of Legacy Media to honestly inform its viewers. pic.twitter.com/BTgIAb6Ka7

Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Gray, detailing emails alleged shooter Tyler Robinson had with his transgender partner and roommate, quoted Robinson admitting that he shot Kirk  because he had “had enough of his hatred.”

Some in the media have, however, played up reports that his family was pro-MAGA. ABC temporarily suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel for saying Robinson was “anything other than one of them.”

The president made clear that he's done “standing up for the world.”

The world laughed at Donald Trump.

Seven years ago, Trump was just a few sentences into his annual United Nations General Assembly address when most of the gathered leaders of the 193 countries represented began to chuckle—and then outright guffaw. A visibly startled Trump had been boasting about his administration's successes; he had long claimed that other nations mocked his presidential predecessors, and now it was happening to him. Trump later publicly downplayed the moment. But aides at the time told us he was seething.

No one is taking him lightly now.

Trump returned to the United Nations rostrum today for the first time since he reclaimed the White House. The moment underscored how dramatically his relationship with the world has changed. Trump has led a campaign to upend the global order that the United States built following World War II. He has bent foreign leaders to his will while antagonizing allies by musing about a return to an age of American imperialism, when the U.S. could simply seize the territory it wanted. He and his advisers have launched trade wars and aligned themselves with movements that have eroded democracies and supported rising authoritarians.

In his meandering, grievance-filled speech today, Trump belittled the threat of climate change, warned about excessive immigration, and touted his role as global peacemaker even though the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have escalated in recent months. He mocked alliances and the United Nations itself, outlining something of a Trump Doctrine that prioritizes individual nations' sovereignty and a transactional approach that rewards only those nations that can do something for the United States—or him personally.

“During the campaign, they had a hat, the best-selling hat: ‘Trump was right about everything.' And I don't say that in a braggadocios way, but it's true,” he said. “I've been right about everything.”

Trump: ‘I run the country and the world'

Trump, in some ways, has withdrawn the United States from the world. He has weakened ties with traditionally close allies, derided globalism and curtailed U.S. soft power by slashing everything from foreign aid to overseas government-funded media. Since returning to office, Trump has heralded America's exit from the UN's global health agency, its human-rights council, and its cultural organization. He has also cut funding for a wide array of UN activities, including food assistance and aid to refugees and children. As a result of this major reduction from its biggest funder, the UN has secured funding for only a fifth of this year's required budget for humanitarian activities, a top UN official said this month.

Matthew Kroenig, vice president of the Atlantic Council, told us that Trump's approach reflected a Republican Party consensus that global institutions like the UN have long been broken, allowing Russia the power to thwart Security Council measures on Ukraine or enabling decades of General Assembly resolutions critical of the U.S. ally Israel.

Although Trump has always been suspicious of the United Nations and other organizations of “global governance,” his approach was tempered during his first term by a staff who hoped to exercise American leadership in a more traditional way. In his 2018 address, Trump emphasized his commitment to not just championing American interests but also “standing up for the world.” In his second term, Trump is unapologetically America first, leaving allies scrambling to reorient their global blueprints as he hews to more of a lone-dog approach. Not only is the United States no longer the world's sole superpower; it is less interested in bringing the world along in pursuit of its priorities.

That is visible in the decision by Canada, France, Britain, and other close allies to move forward with recognizing a Palestinian state, leaving America and Israel ever more isolated. Trump warned against recognition again today, suggesting that it rewards Hamas for its October 7, 2023, terror attack. But he has also privately fumed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to expand the war.

European nations, meanwhile, are attempting to provide security aid and guarantees to Ukraine to compensate for the unpredictability of future American support. And other reordering is under way as well. Richard Gowan, an expert on the UN at the International Crisis Group, told us that other nations are moving ahead without Washington on issues including the environment and pandemic preparedness. (That strategy won't work on matters of security, where Washington remains the sine qua non.)

“There was an assumption that Trump was an aberration and that the next president would come back and reset the clock,” Gowan said. “That's no longer the case. So people are taking it much more seriously this time around.”

Rather than a forum for international cooperation, the United Nations has turned into another arena for global competition. “The purpose is to muscularly advocate the American view and push back against the bad guys,” Kroenig told us of Trump's approach. (Although Trump in a post-speech meeting with UN Secretary-General António Guterres said he was behind the organization “100 percent,” aides have told us he believes that the organization is feckless and easily ignored.)

George Packer: The Trump world order

Trump's shifting strategy for the Ukraine conflict took another turn today when, following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, he posted on social media his belief that Kyiv could eventually recapture much of its territory from Russia, given Moscow's economic woes. This was perhaps Trump's most pro-Ukraine statement yet—he previously largely deferred to Russia in the conflict—and it comes just weeks after he insisted that Kyiv would have to give up territory. But Trump still emphasized that the primary support would need to come from the European Union and NATO: Although the U.S. would continue to sell weapons to NATO, it would not increase its aid to Ukraine, and he made no mention of further cease-fire talks.

As Trump spoke, he kept mentioning “peace.” Driven by his desire to win a Nobel Peace Prize, the president has invested heavily this year in brokering peace deals. He repeated his claim today about having ended seven wars, though some of the affected countries dispute his involvement. He also warned European allies that they must stop buying Russian energy before he makes good on his promise to sanction Moscow over its Ukraine invasion. Many in Europe see that challenge as a nonstarter; Russia-friendly EU countries such as Hungary and Slovakia have refused to stop doing business with Moscow, as has Turkey, a key NATO member. Some diplomats feel like Trump knows it will go nowhere but will still use their noncompliance as an excuse to, once more, back down against Vladimir Putin.

Trump's new tack also means that stalwart U.S. allies are rethinking their economic and security reliance on the United States and finding new partners on climate change and other priorities. Trump today declared that the concept of a “carbon footprint” is a “hoax,” and that climate change is the “greatest con job that's ever happened to the world.” (China may eventually fill the vacuum on the issue, including in renewable-energy development.) Although no nation can afford to walk away from America's political and economic might—meaning foreign leaders must woo Trump to get the best possible deal on tariffs—the president's threats to violate allies' sovereignty represent a before-and-after moment for countries such as Canada, Denmark, and Panama. Trump also boasted about his recent military strikes against boats that he has claimed were being steered by Venezuelan drug dealers, saying, “There aren't too many boats that are traveling on the seas by Venezuela.”

The rapid global reordering has left allies unsettled. “This is not a transition,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said at a Council on Foreign Relations event yesterday. “This is a rupture.”

As Trump was introduced in the famed Turtle Bay assembly hall today, his fellow world leaders applauded. They then took his insults, sitting stone-faced when Trump declared not just his greatness but that their “countries are going to hell.” And only when Trump teased them about a busted teleprompter and broken escalator did they chuckle. They laughed with Trump, not at him.

The president abruptly turned on Putin, but the epiphany may not last.

Today, President Donald Trump threw one of the most important tenets of his own foreign policy into a 180-degree turn, reversing course without even slowing down. Trump has always been overly deferential to Vladimir Putin, including enabling the Russian president's war in Ukraine. Now Trump appears to be signaling that he's fed up with the Kremlin. But is he?

Trump's latest policy reversal came after he spoke to the United Nations General Assembly for nearly an hour today. His speech was classic Trump: full of grievance, inappropriate references to American political feuds, embarrassing moments of self-promotion, detours into odd tangents, and claims that everyone in the world but him is stupid. Trump seemed irritated with everyone, including Putin, for depriving him of the Nobel Peace Prize he thinks he deserves—an oversight he whined about to the UN audience. The diplomats in attendance could be forgiven if they didn't take any of it seriously.

After his address, however, Trump met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and France's President Emmanuel Macron. And then he said something genuinely startling. Should NATO shoot down Russian aircraft if they cross the alliance's borders? Yes, he said, sounding like a born-again Cold Warrior. Russia, Trump later explained on his social-media site, Truth Social, is just a “paper tiger,” a feckless nation that “has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win.”

Ukraine, Trump now says, can win the war. “With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option.” I assumed he meant the 2022 starting position of the Russian invasion, not the 2014 borders that Russia violated when it seized Crimea, but maybe not: With Western help, Trump wrote, “Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that!”

The president has come a long way since he berated Zelensky in the White House last winter. Back then, Trump wanted Ukraine to fold because it doesn't “have the cards.” And after the disastrous Anchorage summit, last month, Trump was still telling Ukraine it was going to have to accept some territorial exchanges. (Translation: Russia would get to keep some of the land it stole.) Now Trump seems to be saying that Ukraine could win back all of its conquered territory and then some.

One explanation is that Trump just doesn't like being humiliated. Trump made it clear at the UN today that he thought his relationship with the Russian president would make Ukraine the easiest of the world's many conflicts he intended to solve. But Putin has merely taken advantage of Trump to continue his war effort and has signaled no willingness to make concessions in the name of peace. Perhaps Trump is sending a message—finally—that there are limits to the amount of abuse and embarrassment the president of the United States is willing to take from the Kremlin.

Possible, but unlikely. Trump has always had a high endurance for Putin's abuse. Besides, this isn't the first time he's lashed out at Moscow. Unless Zelensky and Macron told Trump of some amazing plan to win the war, the president has no reason to have changed his mind about Ukraine's ability to win. Note, too, that Trump's messages include no action items to beef up the Ukrainian war effort: no weapons, no money, no increased U.S. intelligence or technological support. Even Trump's call for sanctions on Russia is an empty threat, because it relies on conditions—such as a requirement that NATO nations impose massive tariffs on China, rather than on Russia—that other countries are unlikely to fulfill.

Instead, Trump seems to be going through one of his tantrums where he threatens just to walk away from the conflict. In the past, that presented more of a danger to Ukraine than to Russia: Trump always implied that without a peace deal, he'd cut Kyiv loose and let Putin do whatever the hell he wants. Now the president seems to be implying that he'll walk away and let Europe do whatever the hell it wants, including send more weapons to Ukraine and shoot down Russian military aircraft (and the pilots in them) instead of merely shoo them away from NATO airspace.

Indeed, Trump even added an implied threat to engage in some kind of propaganda or information operations against Russia. His Truth Social post mentioned how Ukraine could make a decisive move when “the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it's almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy.”

The Russians already know this, but if Trump is going to order U.S. intelligence agencies to drive that message home, such a move would be a welcome change for Ukraine and the rest of the free world. At the least, it would signal the beginning of the end of Trump's policy of appeasing the Kremlin.

Unfortunately, David Sanger of The New York Times is probably correct in his evaluation that Trump, rather than increasing pressure on Russia, is “washing his hands of the conflict.” Putin, who, like other world leaders, shows little inclination to take Trump seriously, has no intention of stopping his daily murder of innocent Ukrainians, and so Trump cannot gain any public credit from trying to broker a peace. As Sanger noted, the tell is that Trump ended his message by saying: “I wish both countries well.” That's Trump-speak for being bored with and exhausted by two nations that seem to have other priorities in the world besides getting a Nobel Prize for President Donald J. Trump.

Worse, Trump's carping about Russia today could be a way for Trump to head down the road of normalizing relations with Russia—removing tariffs, encouraging trade, and ending Russia's isolation. By showing just how deeply disappointed he is in Russia, he shows America and the Russia hawks in his own party that he's really talked tough to Putin while simultaneously ditching the Ukraine war as an intractable and endless problem that is no longer worth his attention. Life goes on: The Europeans buy American weapons, the Russians continue to bomb Ukraine, and the Ukrainians continue to bleed and die.

I hope I'm wrong. But Trump has a well-known tendency to agree with whomever he spoke with last, and his comments today may only reflect the immediacy of his meetings with Zelensky and Macron. The only way the world can know if the president meant what he said today is if he comes back to Washington and puts America firmly back on the side of NATO and Ukraine with money and materiel. Until then, it's just talk.

Trump had a lot to say at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.

This story appeared in The Logoff, a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here.

Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump took a chaotic, and at times, incoherent turn through the 80th meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, upending US policy on the Russia-Ukraine war in the process.

What just happened? Trump started his day with a bizarre speech to the assembled world leaders, at points attacking other countries, efforts to address climate change, and the United Nations itself. The address was noticeably light on policy and heavy on false claims.

Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, Trump made at least two potentially significant pronouncements: NATO countries should shoot down Russian jets that violate their airspace, and Ukraine should push to reclaim all of its original territory from Russia.

What's the context? Trump has been inconsistent about US policy on the war. Last month, he hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin for a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, that was widely perceived as a win for the Russian president; today's statement marks an about-face on Trump's stated vision for an end to the war.

Why does this matter? Trump has intermittently appeared disillusioned about his relationship with Putin, including in remarks today with French President Emmanuel Macron. Coupled with his answer on how NATO countries should respond to airspace violations and his new position on the war, this would be the most aggressive stance of his presidency toward Russia — if he sticks with it.

The email you need to stay informed about Trump — without letting the news take over your life.

What's the big picture? Trump changes his mind on even the biggest policy questions, and he's often subject to the opinions of the people he last spoke with (in this case, Zelenskyy and European leaders supporting him, like Macron). That makes covering what he says in major moments like these difficult, but his pronouncements can have serious real-world implications. Whether they constitute a meaningful policy shift remains to be seen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","YouTube says it'll bring back creators banned for violating its COVID-19 and election content policies","https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-reinstate-channels-banned-over-covid-content-policies-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:33:00 GMT","

A roster of high-profile conservative voices could soon return to YouTube.

YouTube's parent company, Alphabet, said in a letter published Tuesday that it intends to ""provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform"" whose accounts had been terminated over repeated violations of its COVID-19 and election integrity policies.

The letter, written by Alphabet lawyer Daniel Donovan to Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said that YouTube ""values conservative voices on its platform"" and recognized their reach and role in civic discourse. (Read the letter in full below.)

The House Judiciary Committee published the letter on its website on Tuesday following its monthslong investigation into whether Biden White House officials pressured Big Tech platforms into censoring content. A Google spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the letter.

YouTube's about-face on previously banned accounts marks the latest shift in Big Tech content moderation. Companies from Meta to X have overhauled their content policies and switched away from using third-party fact-checkers.

Prominent YouTube channels from conservative creators — including Dan Bongino, Steve Bannon, and Children's Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nonprofit activist group, as well as those from lesser-known creators — had been banned from YouTube for flouting its COVID-19 misinformation and election-related policies. Bongino has since become the deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, while Kennedy leads the Department of Health and Human Services.

Google's lawyer said in the letter published Tuesday that YouTube had ended all of its stand-alone, COVID-19-related policies by December 2024 and retired a separate policy regarding election integrity in 2023 to ""allow for discussion of possible widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurring in the 2020 and other past U.S. Presidential elections.""

The letter didn't go into detail about how previously banned creators could resume their terminated channels or whether their content would be monetized and therefore eligible to get a cut of ad revenue.

Google, via its @UpdatesFromYT X account, later clarified that it is planning a pilot program that would be available to a ""subset of creators"" who have been suspended from YouTube — in addition to accounts that were kicked off for violating COVID-19 or election-misinformation policies that have since been deprecated.

The Google spokesperson had no further comment but added the company would have more to say in the coming weeks.

""This is another victory in the fight against censorship,"" Jordan wrote in a post on X.

Google's move to reinstate previously banned channels comes just over a year after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said — also in a letter to Jordan — that the Biden administration had repeatedly pressured Meta in 2021 to remove content related to COVID-19.

""I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it,"" Zuckerberg wrote in the August 2024 letter.

Google, too, said senior Biden administration officials, including White House officials, had pressed the company to remove content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that didn't violate YouTube's policies.

""It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how"" a company moderates content, Google wrote in the letter published Tuesday.

Google said it has been testing a feature similar to X's Community Notes to allow people to provide relevant context about its videos, but it ""has not and will not empower fact-checkers to take action on or label content"" on the platform.

Here's the letter from Google counsel to the House Judiciary Committee:

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Tether, the issuer of the largest stablecoin, is planning to raise as much as $20 billion in a deal that could put the crypto company's value on par with OpenAI, according to a report from Bloomberg News.

The crypto company is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion in exchange for a roughly 3% stake through a private placement, the report said, citing two individuals familiar with the matter. The transaction would involve new equity rather than existing investors selling their stakes, the people told the news service.

The report said that one person close to the matter warned that the talks are in an early stage, which means that the eventual details, including the size of the offering, could change.  

However, the deal could ultimately value Tether at around $500 billion, according to the report. That would mean the crypto giant's valuation would rival some of the world's biggest private companies, including SpaceX and OpenAI. OpenAI's fundraising round earlier this year valued the tech company at $300 billion.

Tether, which was once accused of being a criminal's ""go-to cryptocurrency,"" has been furthering its plans to return to the U.S. in recent months, given President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance. The company earlier this month named a CEO for its U.S. business and launched a new token for businesses and institutions in the U.S. called USAT, which will be regulated in the U.S. under the GENIUS Act.

Stablecoin USD Tether (USDT) is pegged to the U.S. dollar with a market cap that recently surpassed $172 billion. In second place is Tether rival Circle's USDC stablecoin, which is worth about $74 billion.

ABILENE, Texas — OpenAI and Oracle are betting big on America's AI future, bringing online the flagship site of the $500 billion Stargate program, a sweeping infrastructure push to secure the compute needed to power the future of artificial intelligence.

The debut site in Abilene, Texas, about 180 miles west of Dallas, is up and running, filled with Oracle Cloud infrastructure and racks of Nvidia chips.

The data center, which is being leased by Oracle, is one of the most notable physical landmarks to emerge from an unprecedented boom in demand for infrastructure to power AI. Over $2 trillion in AI infrastructure has been planned around the world, according to an HSBC estimate this week.

OpenAI is leading the way.

In addition to the $500 billion Stargate project, the startup on Monday announced an equity investment deal with Nvidia that will add an estimated $500 billion worth of data centers in the coming years. Since 2019, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, providing loads of access to Azure credits. Additionally, OpenAI contracts with smaller cloud companies for additional compute capacity and help operating its infrastructure.

One building on the Abilene site is operational while another is nearly complete. The campus has the potential to ultimately scale past a gigawatt of capacity, OpenAI finance chief Sarah Friar told CNBC. That would be enough electricity to power about 750,000 U.S. homes.

The data center construction plans are important enough that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang personally engaged in last-minute negotiations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman over the weekend to get in on the action, CNBC reported earlier on Tuesday.

""People are starting to recognize just the sheer scale that will be required,"" Friar said. ""We're just getting going here in Abilene, Texas, but you'll see this all around the United States and beyond.""

The scale of the project's construction was necessary to supply the amount of compute required to operate OpenAI's models, Friar said.

""What we see today is a massive compute crunch,"" she said. ""There's not enough compute to do all the things that AI can do.""

OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, which is helping fund the project, announced on Tuesday five additional Stargate sites across Texas, New Mexico, Ohio and an additional unnamed site in the Midwest. That brings the size of the initiative to nearly 7 gigawatts and more than $400 billion of investment over the next three years, which includes an existing $300 billion agreement between OpenAI and Oracle.

While companies like Oracle are helping fund the data center construction, OpenAI will ultimately be the one to pay for the computing capacity as an operating expense, Friar said. Although Nvidia is putting in equity to jumpstart the project, Friar said the chipmaker will get paid for all graphics processing units (GPUs) that it provides as those chips get deployed.

Friar said OpenAI will generate $13 billion in revenue this year, and that the company plans to help pay for the construction using its own cash flow and debt financing.

The Stargate name will refer to all OpenAI infrastructure projects going forward, CNBC reported this week. Together with CoreWeave and other partners, the companies say they are ahead of schedule to meet their full 10-gigawatt commitment by the end of 2025.

Friar told CNBC the shovels going into the ground today are laying foundations for compute that won't come online until 2026, starting with Nvidia next-generation Vera Rubin chips.

""No one in the history of man built data centers this fast,"" Friar said, adding that the entire ecosystem has to work together to meet demand.

Critics have questioned the circular funding behind Stargate -- OpenAI committing hundreds of billions of dollars to projects while suppliers like Nvidia are also investing directly into those same buildouts.

Friar said history shows that technology booms require bold infrastructure bets.

""When the internet was getting started, people kept feeling like, 'Oh, we're over-building, there's too much,'"" Friar said. ""Look where we are today, right?""

The project also carries political weight. OpenAI and Oracle first unveiled Stargate alongside President Donald Trump at the White House in January. Friar called Trump ""the president of this AI era,"" pointing to Washington's role in framing the technology as both an economic engine and a national security priority. Trump was briefed on the Nvidia investment into OpenAI during a state visit to the U.K. earlier this month.

Oracle says the project will employ more than 6,000 construction workers daily and deliver nearly 1,700 long-term jobs.

In a paper published Tuesday about OpenAI's infrastructure plans, the company wrote that its data center buildout could help reshape the American power grid with new technologies and help the U.S. exert global influence.

Stock futures were little changed Tuesday night after the S&P 500 pulled back from record levels, snapping a three-day winning streak.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 18 points, or 0.04%. S&P futures were 0.06% higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.09%.

In after-hours trading, shares of Micron Technology gained more than 2% on the back of better-than-expected earnings and a strong forecast. The artificial intelligence boom fueled a 46% increase in Micron revenue.

The leading memory chipmaker's results follow a trading session that was dominated by heightened fears about the circular nature of the AI industry, sparked by a Nvidia-OpenAI partnership. Shares of leading AI players Nvidia and Oracle tumbled on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 closed in the red on Tuesday, down 0.6%, after it had reached a new all-time intraday high earlier in the session and posted a record close the previous day. The Nasdaq Composite fell nearly 1%, pulled down by a 2.8% loss in Nvidia shares just one day after the chipmaker announced a massive investment in OpenAI, which prompted questions about whether there is enough energy to power planned data centers and if Nvidia's partnerships are akin to the risky practice of vendor financing.

Traders could also be profit-taking amid elevated market valuations, which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell called out at a Tuesday press conference.

Wells Fargo chief equity strategist Ohsung Kwon remains bullish on the AI trade, anticipating that spending will continue to be robust. ""I think this is a AI-led bull market, and I think this is likely to continue,"" he said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""

""First of all, it's not a bubble,"" Kwon continued. ""The entire outperformance of the Nasdaq since the end of tech bubble has been driven by better fundamentals in the Nasdaq versus the S&P 500, and I think that's likely to continue. Second, we still think we are in the early innings of the AI investment cycle. ... I think the way this plays out is, as long as the equity market continues to reward companies' capex outlook and the growth outlook, this is likely to continue.""

The Trump administration is looking to get an equity stake amounting to as much as 10% in Lithium Americas as it renegotiates terms of the company's Energy Department loan for its Thacker Pass project, according to a Reuters report that cited two people familiar with the matter.

Shares of the Canada-based lithium company popped roughly 75% on the back of the news. Albemarle jumped nearly 6% in sympathy.

Thacker Pass is a proposed large lithium mine in Nevada that has been under construction for almost one year. General Motors has a 38% stake in the project, which would be the Western Hemisphere's largest source of lithium when it opens in 2028, the report said. It underscores President Donald Trump's efforts to boost U.S. production of lithium, which is used to make batteries for electric vehicles, grid storage and batteries.

Trump's interest in Lithium Americas comes after the administration took a 10% stake in beaten-down chipmaker Intel.

Shares of Micron Technology rose about 2.8% after Tuesday's close on the back of the chip manufacturer's strong quarterly results. 

Micron, one of the world's leading suppliers of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips, exceeded estimates on top and bottom lines and gave a strong forecast for the current quarterly period. The company's overall revenue jumped 46% on a year-over-year basis during the quarter.

Micron reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.03 on revenue of $11.32 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG expected earnings of $2.86 per share on $11.22 billion in revenue. The company said that its revenue in its fiscal first quarter will be about $12.5 billion, higher than the $11.94 billion consensus analyst estimate per LSEG.

Shares of Micron have skyrocketed 97.7% this year amid ongoing demand for Micron's high-tech memory and storage technology, which powers AI workloads.

Shortly after 6 p.m. ET on Tuesday, futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures each gained 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 33 points, or less than 0.1%.

In this article

""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" returns to air Tuesday night, roughly one week after the late night show was suspended by Disney's ABC broadcast network.

The program was initially pulled ""indefinitely"" following comments by host Kimmel during a show monologue that criticized President Donald Trump's MAGA movement for their reaction to conservative activist Charlie Kirk's killing.

The media industry, fans and critics are eagerly awaiting the comedian's pre-taped monologue as it will be the first time he had publicly addressed the matter.

Earlier Tuesday, Kimmel's show posted a photo to Instagram with the caption, ""We are back full of love."" Kimmel's personal account posted a photo of the host with the late screenwriter Norman Lear, who in 1981 founded People For The American Way, an organization dedicated to First Amendment rights.

Ahead of the show's taping, protesters and supporters appeared outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood.

""He should be off the air for another full week if not a full month to think about what he said,"" Perry Caravello, a YouTuber who was protesting Kimmel's return to air, told CNBC outside the studio Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Gregg Donovan, who donned a black top hat and red blazer, carried a laminated sign welcoming Kimmel back.

""This is America,"" he said. ""I don't think free speech will ever really be threatened."" 

Live audience members were ushered inside quickly. Doors to the theater were expected to close at 4:30 p.m. PT with taping scheduled to begin at 4:45 p.m. PT. However, NBC News reported Kimmel didn't take the stage until closer to 6 p.m. PT. The taping typically takes 90 minutes.

Kimmel's show is filmed at the El Capitan Entertainment Centre on Hollywood Boulevard, across from the iconic TCL Chinese Theater. The Hollywood Walk of Fame takes up the sidewalk outside Kimmel's venue, with names as diverse as Roy Disney, Eva Longoria, Kelly Ripa, Paul Rudd and Chris Pratt decorating the pavement.

Kimmel's suspension came amid statements from Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr that suggested ABC and its affiliate stations could be at risk of losing broadcast licenses over the comments.

Local station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair both planned to preempt the show's return on Tuesday. Together, they own roughly 70 ABC affiliate stations.

Kimmel, ABC and Disney are the latest targets of Trump's scrutiny of media companies, which has intensified during his second term marked by high-profile defamation lawsuits, the defunding of public broadcasters and regulatory interference from the FCC.

In this article

Disney on Tuesday unveiled price increases for its streaming subscription packages beginning Oct. 21.

The stand-alone Disney+ ad-supported plan will see a $2 increase to $11.99 per month, while the premium no-ads plan will jump $3 to $18.99 per month or get a $30 annual hike to $189.99 per year.

The Disney+ and Hulu ad-supported package will increase by $2 per month, and both of the bundles with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN will see a $3 monthly increase. The packages with Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max will also both increase by $3 per month.

The NFL+ plans will remain at the same pricing.

The company previously alluded to the price increases on its third-quarter earnings call, adding that it expects a modest increase in Disney+ subscribers in its fourth fiscal quarter. Disney last raised prices for its packages in October 2024, with most plans increasing by $1 to $2.

The price hikes come as the entertainment company has faced intense scrutiny for its handling of ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" after Disney subsidiary ABC pulled the show off air last week over the host's controversial comments about the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

The company announced nearly a week later that the show would return to air on Tuesday, after viewers and late-show hosts criticized Disney for its actions.

In the interim, some fans took to social media to announce they were canceling their Disney+ subscriptions in solidarity with Kimmel.

Disney did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the price changes.

Something strange was happening at Jeff Hancock's work.

It was 2022, just after OpenAI's release of ChatGPT to the masses, and the Stanford professor noticed something was off in the research assignments he was grading. ""They looked pretty good, but not quite right,"" Hancock tells CNBC Make It. ""And then because I had 100 students, I could see that 10 other assignments looked exactly the same with the same sort of not-quite-rightness.""

The papers in question seemed to have a lot of text without saying anything substantive to ""advance the work,"" and they all did so in the same overly wordy style.

Kate Niederhoffer felt the same sinking feeling of suspicion when she was once asked to speak about her research, but the request summarized her studies in a way that revealed they didn't actually know her work.

Reading messages that missed the mark ""felt like deep effort,"" Niederhoffer says. ""I'm a quick reader, normally, so I [thought] 'Why is this feeling so effortful? Also this is so confusing?'""

Niederhoffer and Hancock now have a name for this phenomenon, the feeling you get when you're reading a message or document that's so convoluted or incomplete in thought that you start to wonder, ""Wait, did a human even write this, or is this AI?""

It's called workslop, and it's killing teams and productivity across all kinds of businesses, they say.

Workslop refers to ""AI-generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.""

That's according to new research from BetterUp, where Niederhoffer is vice president of their research labs, and Stanford Social Media Lab, where Hancock is the founding director.

Like AI art or features of the so-called slop life that came before it, workslop looks familiar in an off-kilter, uncanny way but at its core is devoid of meaning. Think: long, fancy-sounding, copy-pasted language that doesn't say anything.

Some 40% of people say they've received workslop in the last month, according to a recent BetterUp and Stanford survey of 1,150 full-time U.S. workers. These staffers estimate an average of 15% of the content they receive qualifies as low-effort, unhelpful, AI-generated work; it's happening across industries but is especially prominent in professional services and technology.

One survey respondent, a finance worker, recalled how receiving AI-generated work from a colleague led to more work for them: ""It created a situation where I had to decide whether I would rewrite it myself, make him rewrite it, or just call it good enough.""

Another respondent, a director in retail, said they wasted time following up on information they were sent and doing their own research. ""I then had to waste even more time setting up meetings with other supervisors to address the issue. Then I continued to waste my own time having to redo the work myself.""

There are tell-tale signs of workslop, Hancock says, including ""purple prose,"" like using three paragraphs of text when one bullet point would suffice.

It may appear in different forms, from bad code to decks with incomplete information or just strangely worded emails, but it all has the same effect of adding work onto the recipient to make sense of it all. Ultimately, it can erode trust and productivity.

Niederhoffer has herself judged the people who send her workslop. ""Why did they do this?"" she'd wonder. ""Can they not complete the job themselves? I don't trust them. I don't want to work with them again.""

The end result is ""confusion, annoyance, wasted effort and then some serious layers of judgment,"" she says.

AI use has doubled at work since 2023 from 21% to 40%, per Gallup, yet 95% of organizations don't see a measurable return on their investment in the tech, according to a recent MIT Media Lab report. Workslop could be a big reason why, BetterUp and Stanford researchers say.

People who've encountered it say they spend an average of one hour and 56 minutes dealing with the aftermath of it; that adds up to a roughly $186 invisible tax per month, based on their self-reported salaries.

For an organization of 10,000 workers, that's a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, researchers say.

(Worth noting, this doesn't account for any productivity gains reported by companies or employees.)

Beyond the financial cost, there's an emotional one. Recipients of workslop say it takes time and mental energy to figure out how to diplomatically address the subpar work with their colleagues; 53% report being annoyed, 38% confused and 22% offended.

Receiving it makes people rethink their colleagues' abilities: Roughly half of workers say they consider their co-workers less creative, capable and reliable after receiving workslop from them. About 1 in 3 say they notify their teammates or bosses after receiving confusing AI-generated work, and a similar share are less likely to want to work with the other person afterward.

And though sloppy work has been around forever, AI takes it to another level.

""For me to produce sloppy work, I still have to put in a fair bit of effort. I have to write it. It can be thoughtless, but it still requires effort,"" Hancock says. ""Now that [the effort] piece is gone, I can generate a lot of useless or unproductive content very easily.""

The phenomenon's human cost is driven by ""shifting the burden onto the other person without recognizing that impact implicitly,"" Niederhoffer says. ""People forget that because we're thinking of [AI] as a tool with which we alone work, but it's actually mediating human-to-human work.""

Minimizing low-quality AI-generated work, and all the consequences that come with it, is up to organizations that bring AI into the fold, researchers say.

Businesses should focus on an organized approach to adopting and promoting AI at work, Hancock says. Without guidance and leadership, he says, workers may act out of fear that if they don't use AI they'll be replaced, but if they do, they'll be judged for it.

What reduces workslop is ""a team's commitment to task quality,"" Hancock says. Teams should spend time talking to one another about how they use AI and critiquing the best applications for their needs.

That also requires being forthcoming about when and where you're using AI. Say you were pressed for time and used a generative AI chatbot to complete a presentation deck, for example. If you tell your colleague that the work you're sending is AI-generated, they can have a better sense of what prompts you were working with and what your goal was and fill in any missing gaps, Hancock says.

Leaders should focus on human agency and encourage a ""pilot mindset"" to see how tools can give them more control in their workplace, Niederhoffer says. Managers should be able to provide specific reasons why they want to use certain AI tools for certain projects, and have clear messages on the guidelines, policies and training that will accompany usage, she says.

Having high agency over AI ""can be incredible,"" Niederhoffer says, ""but it's in stark contrast to this really copy-and-paste mode, where you just let the tool do all the work for you, and you forget to let it augment your human competencies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Trump UN escalator snafu: White House wants investigation of sudden stop","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/trump-un-ga-speech.html","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:58:59 GMT","



White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt fumed Tuesday that if anyone at the United Nations ""intentionally"" stopped an escalator right before President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump stepped onto it, ""they need to be fired and investigated immediately.""

Leavitt's demand on X came hours after an escalator at the UN abruptly halted just as the Trumps got on it shortly before he delivered a speech to the General Assembly in New York.

Leavitt's tweet referenced a report in a British newspaper, The Times.

The paper on Sunday said that UN staff members, to mark Trump's arrival, ""have joked that they may turn off the escalators and elevators and simply tell him they ran out of money, so he has to walk up the stairs.""

The press secretary wrote, ""If someone at the UN intentionally stopped the escalator as the President and First Lady were stepping on, they need to be fired and investigated immediately.""

But a UN official earlier Tuesday said that a person traveling with Trump inadvertently hit the stop lever on the escalator, causing its sudden halt, the Associated Press reported.

Trump mentioned the mishap and a faulty teleprompter to mock the quality of the UN headquarters as he complained that his prior effort to win a contract to renovate the buildings there had been rejected.

Trump began his speech reading from paper because the teleprompter was not working.

""Many years ago, a very successful real estate developer in New York, known as Donald J. Trump, I bid on the renovation and rebuilding of this very United Nations complex,"" Trump told the GA in his speech.

""I said at the time that I would do it for $500 million, rebuilding and everything, it would be beautiful,"" Trump said.

""I used to talk about, 'I'm going to give you marble floors, they're going to give you terrazzo,'"" he recalled. ""'I'm going to give you the best of everything, you're going to have mahogany walls. They're going to give you plastic.'""

""I realized that they did not know what they were doing when it came to construction,"" Trump said.

He said that the UN ultimately decided to go in ""another direction,"" which was ""much more expensive at the time"" and ""produced a far inferior product.

""These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,"" Trump cracked.

The UN official who spoke to the AP noted that the president's team was responsible for operating the teleprompte

In 2005, Trump asked a U.S. Senate committee to allow him to manage renovations of the UN, a request that was ultimately denied.

In his speech to world leaders on Tuesday, Trump criticized their global organization, accusing the UN of operating with ""empty words, and empty words don't solve wars.""

""The UN has such tremendous potential, I've always said it,"" Trump said.

""It has such tremendous, tremendous potential, but it's not even coming close to living up to that potential,"" he said in his address, which lasted nearly an hour.

""All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter, and then never follow that letter up; it's empty words,"" he continued.

Trump's speech came as he has withdrawn the United States from a number of different UN bodies and slashed funding for the organization.

Trump, who has long been critical of the UN, said its member countries ""are being ruined"" by immigration.

He also called climate change ""a con job.""

Trump urged the UN to trust his vision for policy, saying that he's ""really good at predicting things.""

""During the campaign, they had a hat. The best-selling hat, 'Trump Was Right About Everything,'"" he recalled.

""And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true,"" Trump said.

When Jacob Kaplan thinks about his path to financial security, he sees a need to take big risks.

For years, Kaplan has been betting on major sporting events through online platforms, often dedicating 30 hours a week to the hobby. The 25-year-old regularly trades tips with fellow enthusiasts through Discord and bought a membership to sports data platform Bookie Beats to help level up his bets.

""There's the risk that goes into each individual bet that you take,"" Kaplan told CNBC. ""But if you surround yourself with the right people and you know what you're doing, then it kind of answers that problem that my generation is looking to solve of finding some financial security.""

Kaplan is part of a cohort of young people pushing typical investing strategies to the side for higher-risk alternatives. They're looking for a stroke of luck amid broad feelings of direness about the economy as home prices skyrocket, loan debt grows and the job market tightens.

This phenomenon has been dubbed ""financial nihilism."" It can help explain the rise of speculative investments like meme stocks, leveraged exchange-traded funds and crypto, as well as booming interest in forums like sports betting platforms and prediction markets.

""I view this as more of a rational response on the part of the young investors who would like to achieve certain goals using their investments,"" said Simon Oh, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School.

""Relatively to the past, it's become much more difficult to do that using traditional means of wealth accumulation,"" Oh said. ""As a result, sort of the rational thing to do is to swing for the fences.""

A crop of risk-on trades have gained followings since the pandemic took hold of society just over five years ago.

Outside traditional markets, sports betting platforms and prediction markets allow people to gamble on outcomes of everything from the latest NFL game to whether singer Justin Bieber will announce a tour this year.

Digital currency trading has also earned relevance, an umbrella that includes everything from bitcoin to ""meme"" coins. Gen Z was the most likely of any generation to say they were either curious about or planning to invest in cryptocurrencies over the next five years, according to a U.S. Bank survey released this week. 

Within the stock market, there's the short-squeeze stock craze that began with GameStop and AMC during the pandemic. This year, a new class of so-called meme stocks such as OpenDoor and Kohl's have burst onto the scene. OpenDoor shares are up nearly three-fold this year. Kohl's stock has doubled in the last three months.

Fund creators have aimed to ride the risk wave with leveraged ETFs, which amplify investments to provide larger returns or losses. Leveraged ETF launches in 2024 hit a record going back more than 15 years, according to data from VettaFi and Bloomberg.

Options trading allows investors to bet on whether they think a security will go up or down. The Options Clearing Corporation said total contract volume topped 1.2 billion in August alone, a jump of 18% from the same month a year prior.

Marketing consultant Marcellous Donyae turned to options trading about five years ago as he was looking for ways to make money while attending school. He was hoping to avoid the fate of counterparts across the country grappling with student loan debt.

""I've always wanted to have a source of income that kind of gave me a sense of financial freedom and control over my life,"" said Donyae, 22. ""Options was just the one thing that I felt like gave me that.""

While there's an evolving slate of risk-on investments, Columbia's Oh said the demand for this type of bet hasn't changed. Looking historically, he said commodities were once considered a similar way to make high-risk wagers.

Still, Donyae's desire for a financial security blanket underscores the anxiety felt by this generation of investors as traditional economic goals now feel more like distant dreams.

Rising housing prices and high interest rates have made the dream of home ownership — long considered a core tenant of financial success — appear increasingly unattainable. Three out of every 10 members of Gen Z have given up on buying a home altogether due to cost, according to U.S. Bank's survey.

These investors experienced young adulthood during the inflation spike that accompanied the pandemic and now face a white-collar job market slowdown. Even if they can get a job, fears of a Social Security cliff leaves them feeling longer-term uncertainty. Rising credit card debt levels and the continued overhang of student loans (with loan suspensions ending under the Trump Administration) can also throw cold water on their outlooks.

""Anything that you would think about on the traditional economic ladder is increasingly out of reach,"" said Kyla Scanlon, an economic commentator and author of ""In This Economy?"" Young people are ""feeling left out of the market and feeling like there's no future, so you might as well just gamble it away.""

Scanlon said social feelings of rejection tied to dating apps and college acceptance can amplify the insecurity that young people are already experiencing financially.

Accordingly, data tracked by the University of Michigan shows 18-to-34-year-olds have had the worst consumer sentiment readings for much of this year out of any age group. That marks a reversal from previous trends.

Young adults in this boat acknowledge that this flavor of high-risk investing doesn't necessarily equate to a life-long market strategy.

Kaplan, the sports bettor, said he earmarks much of his earnings for index funds or savings accounts. The Maryland resident knows one day that he'll have to give up such a time-consuming practice — but he hopes to raked in enough profit by then to be set up for success.

""I don't see this as a sustainable, long-term form of income,"" Kaplan said. ""It's been beneficial financially for now, and at some point I'll put it away and take my money and run.""

The U.S. Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point rate cut sparked a brief bitcoin price rally to $118,000, but a bearish doji candle signals a potential reversal. Support at $111,300, with a deeper slide possible. 

Bitcoin price closed last week at $115,333, rejecting the $118,000 resistance level. After three straight weeks of gains, Bitcoin bulls finally lost steam — and the Fed's rate cut wasn't enough to break $118,000. 

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut the key interest rate by 25 basis points as anticipated, which provided a boost for markets to close out the week, but it wasn't enough. Bitcoin price made a move to $118,000 on Thursday after the Fed's announcement, but was pushed back just shy of this critical resistance level. Sunday's close gave us a shooting star doji candle for the week, signaling a likely reversal in price action heading into this week. The bears have finally stepped in to limit bitcoin's gains after a 3-week rally by the bulls. We may see some renewed strength by the bears this week as they attempt to push the price down to test the recent support levels.

Looking downward, we are eyeing the $111,300 level as a potential support level. Bitcoin nearly hit that support level already after the big sell-off Sunday night. Below a bitcoin price of $111,300, we will once again look to the 21 EMA, which is currently at $109,500, entering this week. If the price closes below the 21 EMA, it is unlikely the $107,000 low will hold, and we should look to the $105,000 level to act as support.

Price crashed straight through the $113,800 support level on Sunday night, but we will look for bitcoin to close above this level to give some renewed strength to the bulls this week. The next resistance level above here is $115,500. If we can manage to establish these levels as support, we will look to make another attempt at the critical $118,000 resistance level.



Bitcoin saw a massive sell-off just after the weekly close on Sunday night, which brought the bitcoin price all the way down to $111,800. 

There are two ways to view this action. Rapid price corrections like this often occur in bullish environments, so it is possible the low this week is already in, and we could expect to see more bullish price action through the remainder of this week. The other possibility is that this is just the beginning of a renewed downtrend, in which case we would anticipate a slight bounce from the lows over the next day or so, followed by continued bearish price action to close out the week. So, to maintain bullish bias this week, we want to see price regain the $113,800 level, while the bears will attempt to push price down past the $111,300 support level to maintain bearish bias.

Market mood: Bearish — after rejecting $118,000 with a shooting-star doji candle, the bears are back in control for the time being.

Expanding our view on bitcoin price action into the next few weeks, we will look to establish a higher low on the weekly chart. If we can get any type of reversal before the price gets down to the $107,000 low, the bulls will get this higher low and will look to take over once again from the bears.

The MACD oscillator is still in a slightly bearish position after crossing bearish at the end of August. This should assist the bears in keeping the price subdued while it is in place. Bulls will be looking for the MACD to cross back bullish in the coming weeks to give them a bit more strength and help to overcome the $118,000 resistance level.

Bulls/Bullish: Buyers or investors expecting the price to go higher.

Bears/Bearish: Sellers or investors expecting the price to go lower.

Support or support level: A level at which the price should hold for the asset, at least initially. The more touches on support, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold the price.

Resistance or resistance level: Opposite of support. The level that is likely to reject the price, at least initially. The more touches at resistance, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold back the price.

EMA: Exponential Moving Average. A moving average that applies more weight to recent prices than earlier prices, reducing the lag of the moving average.

Oscillators: Technical indicators that vary over time, but typically remain within a band between set levels. Thus, they oscillate between a low level (typically representing oversold conditions) and a high level (typically representing overbought conditions). E.G., Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD).

MACD Oscillator: Moving Average Convergence-Divergence is a momentum oscillator that subtracts the difference between two moving averages to indicate trend as well as momentum.

For a long time, the US stock market would pay $2 for $1 worth of crypto. If you had a stash of, say, $500 million worth of Bitcoin, you could plop it into a random public company and the market would value the company at $1 billion. Then you could raise more money in at-the-market stock offerings, and use the money to buy more Bitcoin. Each $1 that you spent on Bitcoin would increase your market capitalization by $2, allowing you to raise more money to buy more Bitcoin, etc., in a virtuous cycle that, come on, just had to end badly. If nothing else, this strategy was extremely visible and extremely easy to copy, so everyone did it, driving the premium down.

But, for a while, good trade. One oddity of the trade was that, if you did have $500 million worth of Bitcoin, and someone came to you and said “I'll give you $500 million for your $500 million worth of Bitcoin,” you'd be kind of an idiot to sell. Those Bitcoins were going for $1 billion on the stock market! If you had a big stash of Bitcoin, the proper trade was to start a Bitcoin treasury company, not sell the Bitcoins to someone else who already had a Bitcoin treasury company.

 Neal Stephenson's Lamina1 teamed up with Consensys' Linea to launch Spaces, a platform for creator-owned IP and interactive storytelling on Ethereum. 

Lamina1, the blockchain content platform co-founded by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson and tech and creative leader Rebecca Barkin, has partnered with Consensys' layer-2 network Linea to bring creator-owned media to Ethereum.

The collaboration aims to change digital storytelling by giving creators control over their intellectual property and a direct channel to their communities, according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph. 

The partnership includes investments from Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, as well as Systemic Ventures. “Neal Stephenson is one of the leading figures in cyberpunk,” Lubin said. “Lamina1 is now perfectly positioned to be at the forefront of the onchain revolution in content creation,” he added. 

Launched in 2022, Lamina1 aims to enable artists, writers and developers to maintain control of their intellectual property while involving fans in the creative process. The platform has seen over 150,000 active addresses since its launch.

The debut product on Linea is called Spaces, which will serve as a home for interactive story-driven worlds and creator-controlled IP. 

The first project within Spaces is Artefact, developed by Stephenson, Weta Workshop and the Lamina1 team. Described as a role-playing experience in a post-AI world, Artefact will allow players to join competing factions, collect data fragments and shape the unfolding narrative.

“Linea's zkEVM offers an ideal environment for creator-driven platforms like Lamina1's Spaces due to fast, inexpensive, and secure blockspace that leverages Ethereum's decentralization, with fully EVM-compatible development, ZK-proofs for fast finality between Ethereum and Linea, and a flourishing onchain economy as the largest ZK-rollup,” said Declan Fox, vice president and head of Linea. 

Fox added that user data, digital assets and creative IP on Linea are protected by Verax, an attestation platform that allows creators to attach verifiable credentials to their works. “This robust infrastructure has already supported millions of attestations for use cases like Proof of Humanity,” he added. 

Linea's zkEVM technology is designed to handle scalable Ethereum applications with low fees and fast performance. The expansion follows Linea's recent Token Generation Event and signals growing momentum for creative applications in the Ethereum layer-2 space.

Earlier this month, Lubin hinted that long-term holders of the new LINEA token may receive future rewards. In a post on X, he suggested that holding tokens over time could qualify users for airdrops from Consensys or other projects in the ecosystem. 

The remarks came after community concerns about the utility of the LINEA token following its token generation event. One user called on the team to enable staking or lending to give the token real use, while others criticized the project, calling LINEA a “memecoin” with no clear value beyond speculation.

Key Points

It's helpful to stay abreast of how this asset tends to perform during the tail end of the year.

When enough investors see the same price action at the same time of year, their habits can echo through prices. Ethereum (ETH 0.35%) happens to have one of those habitual echoes late in the calendar year.

Let's take a look at what investors should be expecting from this coin in the fourth quarter.

Image source: Getty Images.

Traditionally, Q4 is the best-performing quarter for Ethereum, with the median return being around 22% and the average near 24%.

That tells us two things. First, late-year momentum has often been kind to holders, and second, the dispersion of results is wide enough that the median trails the average, which implies some very big upside outliers.

With that being said, it's important to be precise about what this means. Seasonality is a tendency shown by an asset's past performance, and it's just one factor among many others affecting prices. There have been Q4 drawdowns, including a couple of extremely sharp ones in the ballpark of 40% in both 2016 and 2018, and there will be more eventually.

Ethereum is also a very different asset in 2025 than in prior years, and thus it is to be expected that it'll perform somewhat differently with regard to its seasonality.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications in May 2024 to list spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening the door for mainstream brokerage accounts to allocate without learning new plumbing. Those same ETFs also heralded an increasing degree of the coin's integration with the traditional financial system as asset managers began to accumulate it. Now, with crypto treasury companies being formed with the sole intent of buying and holding Ethereum, there's a new crop of investors affecting the coin's float as well.

Therefore, the investors whose actions were responsible for creating the historical price behaviors in the fourth quarter may not be as relevant this time around. The new players on the scene, primarily asset managers and treasurers, have a lot more capital to throw around, and much longer investing horizons than the average buyer of the era before they arrived.

There are other trends indicating that Q4 is likely to be a good one for Ethereum, in keeping with its historical performance during the period.

The biggest structural driver of demand for the coin in the near term, and thus higher prices, is asset tokenization. You can think of tokenization as the process of recording the ownership of real-world assets -- like U.S. Treasuries, vehicles, commodities, or stock shares -- on a blockchain as tokens, so that the underlying assets can settle faster, move 24/7, and be used more flexibly as collateral for other purposes.

Many of the largest tokenized asset programs are already running on Ethereum. That's why it has more than $8.3 billion in tokenized asset value parked on its chain. This is up by an impressive 7.5% over the last 30-day period ending on Sept. 18 alone, and constituting a share of 31% of the total value of tokenized assets which currently exists. With more high-grade assets living on its chain, the case for Ethereum's role in institutional finance strengthens. That can support more demand for the asset over multi-year horizons, as well as right now.

But what should an investor do with that information? Don't try to time the market, for one. Remember, seasonality isn't something to hang your portfolio's value on.

If you wait for a perfect bargain, you may end up watching from the sidelines while history plays out. There may well be a dip to buy this coin sometime in the next four months, but don't count on it. There aren't any major competitive threats to it that will be relevant to the price in that timeframe, and the possibility of macroeconomic weakness causing a sell-off, while real, is not probable enough to bet on right now.

A more practical path is to start buying Ethereum deliberately, ideally via a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) plan, and holding it for years rather than months. If Q4 performs like its median, you will be glad you owned it. If it doesn't, the long-term tokenization story is still very much intact, and you'll just need to wait a bit longer for it to pay off.

Oops, something went wrong

A swarm of autonomous robots could offer a new way to bring trustworthy real-world data onto blockchains—without relying on centralized sources.

The idea, detailed in a new preprint study titled Swarm Oracle: Trustless Blockchain Agreements through Robot Swarms, builds on earlier peer-reviewed research where researchers demonstrated that mobile robots could reach reliable consensus, even in times of disruption, cyberattack, or in hostile environments. The new study applies that approach to a persistent problem in blockchain design: how to get verified real-world data into smart contracts without introducing new points of trust.

A blockchain oracle is a service that securely supplies external, real-world data to blockchain smart contracts, enabling those contracts to execute based on information that exists outside the blockchain network.

The “oracle problem” refers to the challenge of feeding off-chain data into decentralized systems. Blockchains like Ethereum are built to be trustless—each node independently verifies transactions. But that same design prevents smart contracts from accessing external information, such as weather reports, price feeds, or sensor readings, without third-party input.

 Today's blockchain oracles, like Chainlink, aggregate data from multiple sources to reduce reliance on any one feed. But they can still reintroduce centralized risks, either through opaque aggregation methods or single points of failure.

Swarm Oracle proposes a different model: robot swarms. The system uses a collective of simple, low-cost mobile robots—each equipped with basic sensors and communication hardware—to gather environmental data and reach consensus through a Byzantine fault-tolerant protocol. Once a consensus is reached, the swarm can publish its findings to a blockchain, where the data becomes available to smart contracts.

The concept expands on earlier work by integrating blockchain publishing into the robot swarm's decision-making process. In a 2023 Nature study, researchers showed how swarms could maintain consensus accuracy even when up to one-third of robots were compromised, misreporting data, abstaining from voting, or physically interfering with other robots.

In the new system, the robots host a permissioned blockchain locally, allowing them to store and verify data without needing continuous internet access. When appropriate, they can upload finalized agreements to public blockchains like Ethereum. The local chain reduces communication overhead while enabling transparency.

The swarm includes a built-in reputation system. Robots that attempt to manipulate the system gradually lose the ability to participate. This provides a mechanism for “self-healing,” with faulty or malicious robots excluded from future consensus rounds.

The researchers tested the Swarm Oracle protocol in simulations and with physical robots called Pi-Pucks—ground-based devices powered by Raspberry Pi boards. While the experiments used identical robots from a single lab, the system is designed to support diverse swarms types.

Use cases for Swarm Oracle include verifying disaster damage for insurance claims, monitoring air or water quality, or supporting decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs). By operating independently and across varied terrain, the robots can reach areas that are inaccessible or too costly to monitor.

Stablecoin Titan Tether Seeks $500 Billion Valuation on $20 Billion Raise: Report

However, the researchers acknowledge that challenges remain. Malicious agents could attempt to mimic honest robots. While robots can recover from temporary disconnections, long distances may strain communication.

The idea of robots as blockchain participants isn't new—projects like Helium have explored decentralized hardware oracles for specific tasks such as network connectivity.

The concept is a part of a growing interest in using autonomous agents to make economic decisions, such as routing deliveries or managing grid loads. Robotics developers are also embedding cryptocurrency wallets into autonomous systems to carry out transactions for their users.

Whether Swarm Oracle can move from simulation to real-world deployment remains to be seen, with cost, availability of the robots, and a general mistrust of AI slowing adoption.

Stablecoin giant Tether is looking to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion for about a 3% stake in the company through a private placement, Bloomberg reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.

The massive raise would bring its valuation to around $500 billion, putting it in the same league as OpenAI and SpaceX, Bloomberg reported. Tether would be issuing new equity, and Cantor Fitzgerald is acting as lead adviser. 

Tether's USDT has market cap of around $172.8 billion, making it the largest among stablecoins. Circle, which recently went public in the U.S., is the issuer of USDC, which has the second-largest market cap of $74 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. 

The report of the raise comes as Tether recently reported $4.9 billion in net profit in the second quarter and held over $162.5 billion in reserves against $157.1 billion in liabilities. It also holds about $8.9 billion in bitcoin in its reserves.

Bloomberg said that the talks of the deals are in early stages, and the final numbers of the raise could be significantly lower. According to the report, prospective investors have been given access to a data room over the past few weeks to facilitate the deal. 

CoinDesk has requested Tether for comments.

Bitcoin-focused Latin American company OranjeBTC is set to go public on Brazil's B3 exchange in early October with more than $400 million in BTC reserves, making it Brazil's largest publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firm.

The move, confirmed by local news outlet Brazil Journal and at Mercado Bitcoin's DAC 2025 conference, will see it go public via a reverse merger with Intergraus, a prep-course provider already listed on the exchange. Once the transaction closes, Oranje will assume Intergraus' public listing with a roughly 85% free float.

Oranje holds 3,650 bitcoin, roughly six times more than Brazilian fintech Méliuz, the only other major publicly-traded bitcoin treasury firm in the country. The sum would rank Oranje among the top 25 corporate bitcoin holders globally, and the company aims to expand that reserve aggressively, according to local media.

Backing the venture are high-profile crypto investors including Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, trading platform FalconX, and Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. Institutional players like Off the Chain Capital and ParaFi Capital also participated in the initial round, the report added.

Alongside its treasury play, Oranje plans to launch a financial education platform focused on bitcoin and crypto, using Intergraus' existing infrastructure.

As bitcoin's [BTC] recent sell-off accelerates, analysts are focusing on three critical price support levels that could shape the cryptocurrency's near-term trajectory.

The first key level is $112,000, identified by Swissblock Technologies. “As long as $112,000 holds and the Risk stays stable, BTC can rebuild strength,” Swissblock noted on X.

The firm's proprietary Bitcoin Risk Index aggregates on-chain valuation and cost-basis data to gauge market volatility—rising readings indicate risk aversion and potential price swings, while low or stable levels suggest bullish sentiment.

On Monday, the risk index hovered near zero, signaling optimism despite BTC's 1.7% drop to $112,600 in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly dipping as low as $111,717, according to CoinDesk data.

Swissblock also highlighted $110,000 as a “lifeline support.” Historical charts reveal that in the December-January period, buyers struggled to hold BTC above this level, marking it as a significant zone to monitor.

The third crucial support is the on-chain metric known as the “short-term holder cost basis,” currently at $111,400.

Analytics firm Glassnode defines this as the average purchase price for wallets that have acquired bitcoin within the last 155 days. This indicator is widely regarded as a battleground between bulls and bears—prices above it generally reflect bullish conviction. In contrast, sustained trading below it could signal increased risk of sell-offs or a shift toward a bearish market structure.

“Sustained trading below this level could signal a shift toward a mid- to long-term bearish market structure,” Glassnode explained on X.

Together, these three levels – $110,000, $111,400, and $112,000 – form a delicate support zone that traders are closely watching as bitcoin navigates this volatile phase.

Geneva, Switzerland – September 23, 2025 – TRON DAO, the community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet through blockchain technology and decentralized applications (dApps), unveiled a strategic brand evolution commemorating its eighth anniversary. Alongside the logo upgrade, TRON founder Justin Sun shared his letter to the community, reflecting on the network's milestones and evolution over the past eight years. In his letter, he expressed gratitude for the community's continued support and reaffirmed TRON's long-term commitment to responsible innovation, resilience, and advancing financial inclusion on a global scale. The elevated logo, redesigned with golden ratio principles and rotated eight degrees to mark TRON's eighth year, represents the first major brand upgrade since its founding in 2017.

TRON has evolved into a core component of the global digital financial infrastructure dedicated to expanding access and inclusion. TRON currently hosts over 330 million user accounts on the blockchain, with a total value of $28 billion locked across the ecosystem. On average, the TRON network processes around 9 million transactions daily with over 2.83 million daily active accounts. Driven by real-world activity across the network, TRON generated nearly $1 billion in protocol revenue in each of the first two quarters of 2025, establishing a new all-time high. Furthermore, TRON is the #1 network among all blockchain networks for USDT total transaction volume and daily active users.

TRON continues to reinforce its position as a global settlement layer for stablecoin transactions and everyday purchases with proven success.

With the continued global adoption of stablecoins on TRON, ensuring security and trust has become more important than ever. T3 FCU is a first-of-its-kind public-private initiative launched by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs in September 2024 to combat illicit activities on the blockchain. Since its inception, T3 FCU has frozen over $250 million in criminal assets across five continents, established rapid response capabilities to address threats, and demonstrated how industry collaboration can effectively combat financial crime while supporting blockchain innovation. As an expanded effort, T3 FCU recently announced the “T3+”, a global collaborator program with Binance joining as the program's first official member.

TRON's mainstream adoption continues to accelerate. The Nasdaq-listed company TRON Inc., formerly known as SRM Entertainment, recently launched a TRON treasury strategy, generating $1.8 billion in trading volume on its first day, signaling growing interest from U.S. institutions. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Commerce has selected the TRON blockchain as one of the primary networks for posting official economic data, beginning with the second-quarter GDP release.

TRON's mission is to become the global port for Finance—where money becomes borderless, opportunity becomes universal, and access to the digital economy is open to all. The elevated logo reflects eight years of strength, resilience, and progress, while signaling a future defined by collaboration and sustainable growth. TRON will continue to enhance its infrastructure and expand its global ecosystem, supporting the development of a digital financial landscape that is secure, transparent, and inclusive.

TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.

Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON blockchain has experienced significant growth since its MainNet launch in May 2018.

Is it truly “lights out” when we die?

In October 2021, 36-year-old Anthony “TJ” Hoover II was rushed to Baptist Health Richmond in Kentucky after a drug overdose. He went into cardiac arrest, and doctors found no reflexes or brain activity. They declared him brain dead.

Doctors followed the standard steps after a patient's death: they notified Hoover's family and prepared him—an organ donor—for a procedure to harvest his organs for a transplant. But about an hour into the procedure, surgeons came to a screeching halt.

That's because Hoover wasn't dead.



According to a whistleblower letter received by Congress, Hoover started to “thrash” on the operating table multiple times. In an interview with NPR in 2024, an organ preservationist present in the operating room said Hoover seemed alive to her, and two doctors refused to go forward with the procedure. She even said Hoover appeared to have tears in his eyes.

Hoover suffered severe, long-term complications to his memory, mobility, and speech as a result of the drug overdose, but ultimately lived. He was later released into the care of his sister after the cancellation of the organ extraction, but to this day, how Hoover went from dead to alive remains a mystery.

Hoover's shocking story isn't the only case of an individual seemingly “waking up” from death–and challenging what we know about the final moments of our consciousness. Some people have woken up in morgues and coffins, while others have described seeing bright lights or hearing voices of deceased relatives while dying. It's a chilling phenomenon that questions whether death happens as immediately as once thought.

And new studies challenge the idea that death is as quick as switching off a light. Researchers have recorded sudden bursts of gamma-waves, or surges of high-frequency brain activity associated with memory, in patients even after they died. These near-death experiences (NDEs) could serve as the brain's last-ditch attempts to stay alive–and change what we know about the function of consciousness once we die.

But many questions still remain unanswered about death and consciousness. Were people who experienced NDEs truly dead to begin with? Why would the brain launch a surge of activity as it dies? How should NDEs impact protocols for practices like organ donation? Read all about the research investigating NDEs in Pop Mech's full feature on twilight consciousness.

Scientists are astonished at what's forming below the sea's surface, but they now have the opportunity to study how the massive salt deposits form.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

A “salt giant” might sound like a creation straight from the mind of J.R.R. Tolkien, but in geology, they are very real, large-scale salt deposits within the Earth. For years, these deposits have been an area of focus for University of California (UC) Santa Barbara professor Eckart Meiburg, who has studied the fluid dynamics of the Dead Sea—a hypersaline terminal lake that just so happens to be the saltiest body of water on Earth. 

In 2019, Meiberg and his team discovered the mechanism driving the underwater phenomenon known as “salt snow,” which slowly funnels salt down to the lakebed. Six years later, Meiberg and co-author Nadav G. Lensky (from the Geological Survey of Israel) detail the process of salt giants forming below the Dead Sea, and argue that this body of water may be the only place to study the formation of these particular geological structures. The the study containing these claims was published in the journal Annual Review of Fluid Dynamics. 

“These large deposits in the Earth's crust can be many, many kilometers horizontally, and they can be more than a kilometer thick in the vertical direction,” Meiburg said in a press statement. “How were they generated? The Dead Sea is really the only place in the world where we can study the mechanism of these things today.”

Being a terminal lake means that water only has one way of escaping the Dead Sea—evaporation, which tends to leave behind lots of salt in the process. The damming of the Jordan river has also both sped up the water level decline in the lake and completely mixed up its chemistry. As the authors note, in the 1980s, the Dead Sea was considered “meromictic.” This means that the lake was stably stratified, with less dense and warmer water at the top and cooler, more saline water at the bottom. But the diversion of the Jordan threw off the balance of evaporation versus freshwater inflow, causing surface salinity to rise. Now, the Dead Sea is considered “holomictic,” meaning that the lake experiences annual overturns among layers, primarily in the winter months. 

This backdrop—in addition to other behaviors, such as internal currents and surface waves—is slowly forming salt giants, strangely mimicking the geologic past of a nearby aquatic neighbor. 

“There was always some inflow from the North Atlantic into the Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar,” Meiburg said in a press statement. “But when tectonic motion closed off the Strait of Gibraltar, there couldn't be any water inflow from the North Atlantic.”

This is known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis, which occurred around 5.96 to 5.33 million years ago. During the time, similar to today's Dead Sea, the Mediterranean was cut off from water inflow from the North Atlantic and eventually dried up. However, the Strait of Gibraltar eventually reopened during the Zanclean flood. 

Studying these salt giants won't just provide a glimpse into the Mediterranean's past—it will help scientists better understand the erosion of arid coastlines as sea levels continue to rise due to climate change. 

Don't let its name fool you. The Dead Sea is alive and well when it comes to scientific exploration.

A self-learning memristor is our closest step yet to recreating synapses in the human brain.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 1971, American electrical engineer and computer scientist Leon Chua reasoned that there must exist a fourth fundamental element of computing. There's the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, but Chua believed there also existed a “memristor”— a portmanteau of “memory” and “resistor” that described a simple, non-volatile memory component that could store information even when turned off.

This sounds like a simple function, but it provides the technological foundation of neuromorphic (a.k.a. brain-like) computing—an effective memristor would essentially act as an artificial synapse in an AI neural net, as it can achieve both data storage and computation at the same time (which is something our brain does). Since researchers “discovered” memristors back in 2008, scientists and engineers around the world have been slowly improving their capabilities in the hopes of bringing about computers that are as efficient and powerful as human brains. 

At the forefront of this research is the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, or KAIST. In January of this year, KAIST president Kwang Hyung Lee announced that his institute had successfully developed a memristor that can correct errors and learn from mistakes, meaning it could solve problems that were previously difficult for neuromorphic systems. The researchers say, for example, that this chip could separate a moving image from a background during video processing, and actually improve its ability to do this task over time. The results were published in the journal Nature Electronics.

This breakthrough means that AI tasks could be performed locally (instead of relying on cloud-computing servers) while also improving privacy and energy efficiency. 

“This system is like a smart workspace where everything is within arm's reach instead of having to go back and forth between desks and file cabinets,” Hakcheon Jeong and Seungjae Han, both researchers from KAIST, said in a press statement. “This is similar to the way our brain processes information, where everything is processed efficiently at once at one spot.”

In the same vein, KAIST also developed the first AI superconductor chip that runs at ultra-high speeds with minimal power consumption—just like the brain. In terms of computing, the human brain can perform a billion-billion mathematical operations per second with just 20 watts of power. If you want to make an AI neuromorphic brain, then you also need it to make it hyper-efficient. 

Developing better and better memristors brings us incremental steps closer to creating a true brain-on-a-chip, essentially supercharging AI and (possibly) pushing us ever closer toward the singularity—the moment when AI surpasses human intelligence. However, “intelligence” is a notoriously complicated subject, and just because an AI can perform certain calculations like the human brain, that doesn't mean it is capable of all of the brain's functions. 

Of course, some scientists argue that such a capability means these machines could simply be “alien minds”—neural constructions unlike our own but undeniably intelligent in their own unique way. But for now, the human brain remains king in terms of hyper-efficient computing. With the help of improved memristors, however, AI could one day claim that neural crown for its own.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This surprising building material is strong, cheap, and sustainable","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922074949.htm","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 02:14:23 GMT","

Engineers in Australia have developed a new building material with about one quarter of concrete's carbon footprint, while reducing waste going to landfill.

This innovative material, called cardboard-confined rammed earth, is composed entirely of cardboard, water and soil - making it reusable and recyclable.

In Australia alone, more than 2.2 million tons of cardboard and paper are sent to landfill each year. Meanwhile, cement and concrete production account for about 8% of annual global emissions.

Cardboard has previously been used in temporary structures and disaster shelters, such as Shigeru Ban's iconic Cardboard Cathedral in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Inspired by such designs, the RMIT University team has, for the first time, combined the durability of rammed earth with the versatility of cardboard.

Why it matters

Lead author Dr Jiaming Ma from RMIT said the development of cardboard-confined rammed earth marked a significant advancement toward a more sustainable construction industry.

""Modern rammed earth construction compacts soil with added cement for strength. Cement use is excessive given the natural thickness of rammed earth walls,"" he said.

But cardboard-confined rammed earth, developed at RMIT University, eliminates the need for cement and boasts one quarter of the carbon footprint at under one third of the cost, compared to concrete.

""By simply using cardboard, soil and water, we can make walls robust enough to support low-rise buildings,"" Ma said.

""This innovation could revolutionize building design and construction, using locally sourced materials that are easier to recycle.

""It also reflects the global revival of earth-based construction fueled by net zero goals and interest in local sustainable materials.""

Practical benefits

The cardboard-confined rammed earth can be made on the construction site by compacting the soil and water mixture inside the cardboard formwork, either manually or with machines.

Study corresponding author and leading expert in the field of structural optimization, Emeritus Professor Yi Min 'Mike' Xie, said this advancement can spearhead a leaner, greener approach to construction.

""Instead of hauling in tonnes of bricks, steel and concrete, builders would only need to bring lightweight cardboard, as nearly all material can be obtained on site,"" Xie said.

""This would significantly cut transport costs, simplify logistics and reduce upfront material demands.""

Ma said cardboard-confined rammed earth could be an effective solution for construction in remote areas, such as regional Australia, where red soils - ideal for rammed earth construction - are plentiful.

""Rammed earth buildings are ideal in hot climates because their high thermal mass naturally regulates indoor temperatures and humidity, reducing the need for mechanical cooling and cutting carbon emissions,"" he said.

The mechanical strength of the novel material varies based on the thickness of the cardboard tubes.

Ma said the team has developed the formula for this strength design.

""We've created a way to figure out how the thickness of the cardboard affects the strength of the rammed earth, allowing us to measure strength based on cardboard thickness,"" Ma said.

In a separate study lead by Ma, carbon fiber was combined with rammed earth, proving it had a comparable strength to high-performance concrete.

Ma and the team are ready to partner with various industries to further develop this new material so it can be used widely.

Open data sets and AI tools can be used to mass-produce low-quality, redundant papers.Credit: Tutatama/Alamy

An analysis of a literature database finds that text-generating artificial intelligence (AI) tools — including ChatGPT and Gemini — can be used to rewrite scientific papers and produce ‘copycat' versions that are then passed off as new research.

In a preprint posted on medRxiv on 12 September1, researchers identified more than 400 such papers published in 112 journals over the past 4.5 years, and demonstrated that AI-generated biomedicine studies could evade publishers' anti-plagiarism checks.

Low-quality papers based on public health data are flooding the scientific literature

Low-quality papers based on public health data are flooding the scientific literature

The study's authors warn that individuals and paper mills — companies that produce fake papers to order and sell authorships — might be exploiting publicly available health data sets and using large language models (LLMs) to mass-produce low-quality papers that lack scientific value.

“If left unaddressed, this AI-based approach can be applied to all sorts of open-access databases, generating far more papers than anyone can imagine,” says Csaba Szabó, a pharmacologist at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, who was not involved in the work. “This could open up Pandora's box [and] the literature may be flooded with synthetic papers.”

To investigate, researchers screened association studies — those that statistically link a variable to a health outcome — that were based on data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a huge open repository of data on the health, diet and lifestyles of thousands of people.

They focused their search on studies they defined as ‘redundant', meaning that the work tested the association between the same variable and health outcome as other research did, but analysed a subtly different subset of the actual data — including results from different survey years, for example, or participants of a different age or sex.

AI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers

AI linked to explosion of low-quality biomedical research papers

Their search of the PubMed index of biomedical literature revealed 411 redundant studies published between January 2021 and July 2025. Most were simple ‘repeat' cases, involving two publications that were almost identical. But three associations had a particularly high number of duplicate studies — six papers apiece — some of which were published in the same year.

This “shouldn't be happening, and it doesn't help the health of the scientific literature”, says co-author Matt Spick, a biomedical scientist at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.

Most publishers have checks in place to prevent researchers submitting the same research to multiple journals, but Spick and his colleagues suspect that AI tools are being used to evade these.

To test whether AI can help to produce multiple papers from the same data set, the researchers used OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to rewrite three of the most heavily redundant articles identified by their analysis (each reported a particular association that had already been published five or six times). The researchers prompted the LLMs to use the information in each paper, and NHANES data, to produce a new manuscript that could avoid plagiarism detectors.

“We were shocked that it worked straight away,” says Spick. “They weren't perfect, and the LLMs did create some errors. It took two hours of cleaning-up work for each manuscript.”

Rise of ChatGPT and other tools raises major questions for research

When analysed with a plagiarism-detection tool used by many publishers, the AI-generated manuscripts did not score at a level that would be considered problematic by editors. This shows that LLMs “can produce something that is derivative of everything that's gone before and doesn't include anything new. But it'll still pass plagiarism checks”, says Spick. This, in turn, makes it more difficult to distinguish between researchers who are producing genuine research using public-health data sets such as NHANES, and others who are deliberately creating redundant papers using LLMs, the authors note.

Solid-state batteries


Nature Energy

                         (2025)Cite this article


All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) promise both higher energy density and greater safety than today's commercial lithium-ion batteries, but turning this promise into practice requires cathodes with very high mass loading. Thick electrodes, however, face sluggish ion transport and severe rate limitations that reduce their practical capacity. Now, Hongli Zhu and colleagues in the USA apply operando neutron imaging to directly visualize the root cause of this limitation.

Unlike conventional X-ray techniques, neutron imaging offers high sensitivity to lithium and allows visualization of electrochemical reactions across an entire electrode. Using this technique, the researchers observe that in a thick LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode (with a loading of 33 mg cm−2) lithiation occurs more strongly near the interface with the solid electrolyte and more weakly toward the current collector side. This reveals that the key limitation to ion transfer in the cathode stems from a mismatch between the non-uniform lithium-ion (Li+) flux and the homogeneous distribution of solid electrolyte, which ultimately leads to poor electrochemical performance. Building on this insight, the team design a three-layer composite cathode with a gradient in catholyte content, tailored to match the non-uniform Li+ flux across the electrode. This architecture matches ionic pathways to the spatial demand for Li+ transport, dramatically improving rate performance. Impressively, this strategy also scales to a very high-loading (100 mg cm⁻²) LiCoO2 cathode.

	A chance interbreeding in the Andes millions of years ago led to today's tasty spud

Today's versatile potato has an ancient origin story, researchers say. A wild tomato interbred with a potato-like plant in South America some 9 million years ago.

Today's potatoes arose out of an unlikely mashup — with a tomato.

Until now, the potato's origin and evolution had long been a scientific mystery. It now appears that the starchy spud emerged 9 million years ago as the Andes Mountains were forming. It came about from natural breeding events between an early tomato plant and a potato-like species.

This ancient cross gave rise to the plant's swollen stem parts, known as tubers. Tubers eventually spread through some 180 wild species of potatoes and thousands of cultivated varieties. Scientists from around the world shared the new findings in the September 18 issue of Cell.

The cultivated potato — Solanum tuberosum — is one of the world's most important staple foods. Scientists knew it was related to Solanum etuberosum, a South American plant. That species looks a lot like our potato plant. It just can't form tubers, those parts that we turn into fries, baked potatoes and chips.

Genetics had shown that potatoes are related to tomatoes. But scientists thought the two plants were like distant cousins. Instead, research now shows, species from these two lines interbred.

The team peeled back the potato's origin by analyzing dozens of wild and cultivated varieties of potato. About half of the genes in every potato species traced to the tomato, the rest to S. etuberosum.

This suggests potatoes came from a single hybrid cross of these two groups, says Sandra Knapp. She's a botanist at the Natural History Museum in London, England.

“In creating that hybrid offspring, various gene families came together and interacted to enable the creation of tubers,” she says.

One gene — SP6A — came from the tomato side. Previous studies had shown it works as a master switch for tuber initiation. Another gene — IT1 — is key to the growth of underground stems that form tubers. It came from S. etuberosum.

Experiments in potato plants now confirmed that without the IT1 gene, tubers are tiny. Without SP6A, tubers don't even form.

How combining these genes in one plant “led to potatoes making potatoes isn't fully explained in this paper,” says Salomé Prat. She's a plant biologist who did not take part in the new study. She works at the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics. That's in Barcelona, Spain. Showing that these genes came together from a natural cross does not mean tubers formed right away, she adds. “The story is much more complicated.”

How interbreeding led to tubers shows that hybrid crosses can be a powerful driver of evolution. Some new hybrids can be sterile (unable to reproduce). But tubers store water and nutrients. And if left buried, they can sprout new plants. No pollination or seeds are needed.

This likely gave the new potato lines time to regain an ability to reproduce sexually. And the new tuber structures may have given early potato plants an edge as the Andes began to form millions of years ago.

Tomatoes prefer dry, warm conditions. S. etuberosum thrives in cold, wet places. Potatoes inherited a mix of traits that allowed them to flourish even in cold, dry sites. They got “the best of both worlds,” Knapp says. And changing habitats in the Andes might have given these new species opportunities to thrive.

Most of today's 180 wild potato species are bitter or toxic. But many thousands of years ago, Indigenous people in the Andes found a tasty wild potato. Over time, they developed many varieties from it. Spanish explorers later brought several of them to Europe. This led to the potato's global spread as a food staple.

More recently, scientists and farmers have crossed potato species to get traits such as high yield or pathogen resistance. Many of these lost some of the potato's initial genetic variability. That makes today's potatoes less adaptable — and more vulnerable — to extreme heat, flooding and other features of our changing climate.

Identifying the genes inherited from the early tomato and S. etuberosum might lead to a more resilient potato. Lost traits might be restored through traditional breeding or genetic engineering. And that, Knapp says, might lead to more adaptable varieties.

ancestor: A predecessor. It could be a family forebear, such as a parent, grandparent or great-great-great grandparent. Or it could be a species, genus, family or other order of organisms from which some later one evolved. For instance, ancient dinosaurs are the ancestors of today's birds. (antonym: descendant)

biologist: A scientist involved in the study of living things.

cell: (in biology) The smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Typically too small to see with the unaided eye, it consists of a watery fluid surrounded by a membrane or wall.

engineering: The field of research that uses math and science to solve practical problems. Someone who works in this field is known as an engineer.

environment: The sum of all of the things that exist around some organism or the process and the condition those things create. Environment may refer to the weather and ecosystem in which some animal lives, or, perhaps, the temperature and humidity (or even the placement of things in the vicinity of an item of interest).

evolution: (v. to evolve) A process by which species undergo changes over time, usually through genetic variation and natural selection. These changes usually result in a new type of organism better suited for its environment than the earlier type. The newer type is not necessarily more “advanced,” just better adapted to the particular conditions in which it developed. 

gene: (adj. genetic) A segment of DNA that codes, or holds instructions, for a cell's production of a protein. Offspring inherit genes from their parents. Genes influence how an organism looks and behaves.

genetic: Having to do with chromosomes, DNA and the genes contained within DNA. The field of science dealing with these biological instructions is known as genetics. People who work in this field are geneticists.

genetic engineering: The direct manipulation of an organism's genome. In this process, genes can be removed, disabled so that they no longer function, or added after being taken from other organisms. Genetic engineering can be used to create organisms that produce medicines, or crops that grow better under challenging conditions such as dry weather, hot temperatures or salty soils.

habitat: The area or natural environment in which an animal or plant normally lives, such as a desert, coral reef or freshwater lake. A habitat can be home to thousands of different species.

hybrid: An organism produced by interbreeding of two animals or plants of different species or of genetically distinct populations within a species. Such offspring often possess genes passed on by each parent, yielding a combination of traits not known in previous generations. The term is also used in reference to any object, process or idea that is a mix of two or more things.

indigenous: Native to some region. (in anthropology) An adjective (and capitalized) for people that have lived for eons in some region, developing a culture that reflects the resources, climate and ecosystems of that place.

pathogen: Short for harmful microorganisms, living things too small to see with the unaided eye, including bacteria, some fungi and many other organisms such as amoebas. Most consist of a single cell.

resilient: (n. resilience) To be able to recover fairly quickly from obstacles or difficult conditions.

resistance: (as in disease resistance) The ability of an organism to fight off disease.

selection: In biology, a process in which environmental or genetic influences determine.

species: A group of similar organisms capable of producing offspring that can survive and reproduce.

spud: A nickname for a potato.

sterile: (in biology) An organism that is physically unable to reproduce.

toxic: Poisonous or able to harm or kill cells, tissues or whole organisms. The measure of risk posed by such a poison is its toxicity.

trait: (in genetics) A quality or characteristic that can be inherited.

OpenAI is planning to build five new data centers in the United States as part of the Stargate initiative, the company announced on Tuesday. The sites, which are being developed in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank, bring Stargate's current planned capacity to nearly 7 gigawatts—roughly the same amount of power as seven large-scale nuclear reactors.

“AI is different from the internet in a lot of ways, but one of them is just how much infrastructure it takes,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a press briefing in Abilene, Texas, on Tuesday. He argued that the US “cannot fall behind on this” and the “innovative spirit” of Texas provides a model for how to scale “bigger, faster, cheaper, better.”

Three of the new sites, in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and a yet-to-be-disclosed location in the Midwest, are being developed in partnership with Oracle. The move follows an agreement Oracle and OpenAI announced in July to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts of US data center capacity on top of what the two companies are already building at the first Stargate facility in Abilene.

OpenAI claims the new data centers, along with a planned 600 megawatt expansion of the Abilene site, will create more than 25,000 onsite jobs, though the number of workers required to build data centers typically dwarfs the amount needed to maintain them afterwards.

The two remaining sites are being helmed by OpenAI and SB Energy, a SoftBank subsidiary that develops solar and battery projects. These are located in Lordstown, Ohio, and Milam County, Texas.

Stargate is one of several major US technology infrastructure projects that have been announced since President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year. OpenAI said in January that the $500 billion, 10 gigawatt commitment between the ChatGPT maker, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX would “secure American leadership in AI” and “create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.”

Trump touted the mammoth initiative just two days after he returned to the White House, promising that it would accelerate American progress in artificial intelligence and help the US compete against China and other nations. In July, Trump announced an AI action plan that called for speedy infrastructure development and limited red tape as the US tries to beat other countries in the quest for advanced AI. “We believe we're in an AI race,” White House AI czar David Sacks said at the time. “We want the United States to win that race.”

OpenAI initially framed Stargate as a “new company” that would be chaired by Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. Now, however, executives close to the project say it's an umbrella brand name used to refer to all of OpenAI's data center projects—except those developed in partnership with Microsoft.

The flagship site in Abilene is primarily owned and operated by Oracle, with OpenAI acting as the primary tenant, according to executives close to the project. The buildout, which is being managed by the data center startup Crusoe, is on track to be completed by mid-2026, sources close to the project say. It is already running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and supporting OpenAI training and inference workloads, those sources add.

Oracle is in the process of standing up eight data center halls in Abilene, which will each support roughly 100 megawatts of power. One of those buildings is currently complete, and another one is close to being finalized. When it is done, the facility will house more than 400,000 GPUs and support more than 1.4 gigawatts of power, sources close to the project say.

The initial Stargate announcement called for companies with land, equipment, and other relevant resources to get involved. After it was published, OpenAI executives say they were inundated with messages from firms that wanted to participate.

One executive estimates that OpenAI has surveyed around 700 sites in the US where data centers could potentially be built. For the five projects announced Tuesday, OpenAI claims it reviewed more than 300 proposals together with its partners from roughly 30 states.

In a policy white paper released Tuesday, OpenAI framed AI infrastructure as a crucial tool the United States will need to beat China and become a manufacturing powerhouse. “Today, Communist Party–led China is developing electricity resources at unmatched velocity while the US falls behind,” the document argues. “China's immense electricity consumption underscores not only its industrial dominance but its ability to rapidly deploy AI infrastructure including new data centers, semiconductor fabs, and manufacturing hubs.”

Earlier this week, OpenAI also announced a new strategic partnership with Nvidia to deploy 10 gigawatts of data center capacity—dwarfing even the size of OpenAI's deal with Oracle. As part of the arrangement, Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI, though neither company shared specifics about the exact structure of the funding. The initial build-out will include 4 to 5 million GPUs, Nvidia said, and the chipmaker will make investments “progressively” as each gigawatt is deployed.

OpenAI's first Nvidia-powered system, which will be built with the hardware maker's Vera Rubin GPUs, will be operational in the second half of 2026, the two companies said. In an interview with CNBC, Altman said that the undertaking would “expand on the Stargate ambitions.”

Jonathan Koomey, a visiting professor at UC Berkeley who has studied computing and data center efficiency for decades, says the enormous size of OpenAI's data center investments may not be enough to guarantee the company's success. Earlier this year, the Chinese startup DeepSeek debuted an impressive AI model built using relatively little computing power, a feat that suggested OpenAI could still be beat out by lesser-resourced competitors.

“OpenAI are making a bet that scale will continue to be the best way to get performance from large learning models, and if that's true—and if they're able to find applications that people really want and are willing to pay for—then it will all work out fine,” Koomey says. But that thesis has still yet to be proven, he adds.

Koomey is also concerned that the tech industry may be abandoning its environmental commitments in pursuit of new data center capacity, and he questions whether such sacrifices are really warranted. “I would question the sense of urgency,” he says.

While some data center projects, like a massive complex being developed by Meta in Louisiana, have received pushback from the local community, the site in Abilene appears to have strong support from local politicians. Mayor Weldon Hurt attended the press briefing alongside Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday to champion the initiative.

“In my view, we should have a very light-touch regulatory approach because we are in a race with China,” Cruz told a group of reporters. He said that if “we want freedom and free speech and free enterprise and individual liberty to dictate AI” the United States needs to “win the race for AI. That's happening right now. And that's why Stargate is so important.”

Since May, OpenAI has also announced Stargate UK and Stargate UAE, which aim to build out large-scale data center projects abroad. Trump administration officials have helped arrange some of the infrastructure deals with allied nations, betting the deals would help American companies capture market share globally.

But questions have swirled around Stargate ever since its inception. Last month, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal both reported that progress had been delayed by trade uncertainty and soaring hardware costs.

Koomey says the convoluted nature of some of the Stargate deals could prove to be another issue. “From an accounting perspective it's very complicated and it has the potential to be a problem if things go south,” he says.

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

Amazon introduced a Nova Act extension to build and test AI agents directly inside integrated development environments including Visual Studio Code, Amazon's Kiro, and Cursor.

The company says the new extension, unveiled Tuesday, addresses a common frustration for developers: the constant back-and-forth between an IDE and a browser when testing agents.

It follows the March launch of Nova Act, Amazon's AI model and toolkit for creating autonomous agents in web browsers. Nova Act was the first release from Amazon's AGI Lab in San Francisco.

Amazon says features of the new extension include natural-language script generation, a notebook-style builder for cell-by-cell execution, live debugging with a unified view of code and browser actions, and an ‘Action Viewer' to compare workflow versions side-by-side.

Nova Act is part of a broader effort by Amazon to compete with rivals including OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google in offering agentic AI tools to developers and businesses, attempting to expand beyond generative AI tools that require active user involvement.

Visual Studio Code dominates the market for code editors, with a large ecosystem of extensions and cross-platform support. Cursor is a popular AI-powered fork of VS Code with natural-language coding and smart search. Amazon's Kiro is an AI coding tool that uses agents to automatically create and update project plans and technical blueprints.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek

MediaTek's chips power over 2 billion devices a year. From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever. As AI moves from the edge to the cloud, MediaTek's high-end chips make intelligent devices even smarter.

OpenAI announced on Tuesday that it plans to build five new AI data centers across the United States with partners Oracle and SoftBank through its Stargate project. The new data centers will bring Stargate's planned capacity to seven gigawatts — enough energy to power more than five million homes.

Three of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. They're located in Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an undisclosed location in the Midwest. The other two sites are being developed with SoftBank, with one in Lordstown, Ohio and the other in Milam County, Texas.

The new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI's massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a $100 billion investment from Nvidia to buy the chipmaker's AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.

This is not California state senator Scott Wiener's first attempt at addressing the dangers of AI.

In 2024, Silicon Valley mounted a fierce campaign against his controversial AI safety bill, SB 1047, which would have made tech companies liable for the potential harms of their AI systems. Tech leaders warned that it would stifle America's AI boom. Governor Gavin Newsom ultimately vetoed the bill, echoing similar concerns, and a popular AI hacker house promptly threw an “SB 1047 Veto Party.” One attendee told me, “Thank god, AI is still legal.”

Now Wiener has returned with a new AI safety bill, SB 53, which sits on Governor Newsom's desk awaiting his signature or veto sometime in the next few weeks. This time around, the bill is much more popular or at least, Silicon Valley doesn't seem to be at war with it.

Anthropic outright endorsed SB 53 earlier this month. Meta spokesperson Jim Cullinan tells TechCrunch that the company supports AI regulation that balances guardrails with innovation and says, “SB 53 is a step in that direction,” though there are areas for improvement.

Former White House AI policy adviser Dean Ball tells TechCrunch that SB 53 is a “victory for reasonable voices,” and thinks there's a strong chance Governor Newsom signs it.

If signed, SB 53 would impose some of the nation's first safety reporting requirements on AI giants like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google — companies that today face no obligation to reveal how they test their AI systems. Many AI labs voluntarily publish safety reports explaining how their AI models could be used to create bioweapons and other dangers, but they do this at will and they're not always consistent.

The bill requires leading AI labs — specifically those making more than $500 million in revenue — to publish safety reports for their most capable AI models. Much like SB 1047, the bill specifically focuses on the worst kinds of AI risks: their ability to contribute to human deaths, cyberattacks, and chemical weapons. Governor Newsom is considering several other bills that address other types of AI risks, such as engagement-optimization techniques in AI companions.

SB 53 also creates protected channels for employees working at AI labs to report safety concerns to government officials, and establishes a state-operated cloud computing cluster, CalCompute, to provide AI research resources beyond the Big Tech companies.

One reason SB 53 may be more popular than SB 1047 is that it's less severe. SB 1047 also would have made AI companies liable for any harms caused by their AI models, whereas SB 53 focuses more on requiring self-reporting and transparency. SB 53 also narrowly applies to the world's largest tech companies, rather than startups.

But many in the tech industry still believe states should leave AI regulation up to the federal government. In a recent letter to Governor Newsom, OpenAI argued that AI labs should only have to comply with federal standards — which is a funny thing to say to a state governor. Venture firm Andreessen Horowitz wrote a recent blog post vaguely suggesting that some bills in California could violate the Constitution's dormant Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from unfairly limiting interstate commerce.

Senator Wiener addresses these concerns: He lacks faith in the federal government to pass meaningful AI safety regulation, so states need to step up. In fact, Wiener thinks the Trump administration has been captured by the tech industry and that recent federal efforts to block all state AI laws are a form of Trump “rewarding his funders.”

The Trump administration has made a notable shift away from the Biden administration's focus on AI safety, replacing it with an emphasis on growth. Shortly after taking office, Vice President J.D. Vance appeared at an AI conference in Paris and said: “I'm not here this morning to talk about AI safety, which was the title of the conference a couple of years ago. I'm here to talk about AI opportunity.”

Silicon Valley has applauded this shift, exemplified by Trump's AI Action Plan, which removed barriers to building out the infrastructure needed to train and serve AI models. Today, Big Tech CEOs are regularly seen dining at the White House or announcing hundred-billion-dollar data centers alongside President Trump.

Senator Wiener thinks it's critical for California to lead the nation on AI safety, but without choking off innovation.

I recently interviewed Senator Wiener to discuss his years at the negotiating table with Silicon Valley and why he's so focused on AI safety bills. Our conversation has been edited lightly for clarity and brevity. 

Senator Wiener, I interviewed you when SB 1047 was sitting on Governor Newsom's desk. Talk to me about the journey you've been on to regulate AI safety in the last few years.

It's been a roller coaster, an incredible learning experience, and just really rewarding. We've been able to help elevate this issue [of AI safety], not just in California, but in the national and international discourse.

We have this incredibly powerful new technology that is changing the world. How do we make sure it benefits humanity in a way where we reduce the risk? How do we promote innovation, while also being very mindful of public health and public safety. It's an important — and in some ways, existential — conversation about the future. SB 1047, and now SB 53, have helped to foster that conversation about safe innovation.

In the last 20 years of technology, what have you learned about the importance of laws that can hold Silicon Valley to account?

I'm the guy who represents San Francisco, the beating heart of AI innovation. I'm immediately north of Silicon Valley itself, so we're right here in the middle of it all. But we've also seen how the large tech companies — some of the wealthiest companies in world history — have been able to stop federal regulation.

Every time I see tech CEOs having dinner at the White House with the aspiring fascist dictator, I have to take a deep breath. These are all really brilliant people who have generated enormous wealth. A lot of folks I represent work for them. It really pains me when I see the deals that are being struck with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and how that money gets funneled into Trump's meme coin. It causes me deep concern.

I'm not someone who's anti-tech. I want tech innovation to happen. It's incredibly important. But this is an industry that we should not trust to regulate itself or make voluntary commitments. And that's not casting aspersions on anyone. This is capitalism, and it can create enormous prosperity but also cause harm if there are not sensible regulations to protect the public interest. When it comes to AI safety, we're trying to thread that needle.

SB 53 is focused on the worst harms that AI could imaginably cause — death, massive cyberattacks, and the creation of bioweapons. Why focus there?

The risks of AI are varied. There is algorithmic discrimination, job loss, deep fakes, and scams. There have been various bills in California and elsewhere to address those risks. SB 53 was never intended to cover the field and address every risk created by AI. We're focused on one specific category of risk, in terms of catastrophic risk.

That issue came to me organically from folks in the AI space in San Francisco — startup founders, frontline AI technologists, and people who are building these models. They came to me and said, “This is an issue that needs to be addressed in a thoughtful way.”

Do you feel that AI systems are inherently unsafe, or have the potential to cause death and massive cyberattacks?

I don't think they're inherently safe. I know there are a lot of people working in these labs who care very deeply about trying to mitigate risk. And again, it's not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk, unless you're going to live in your basement and never leave, you're going to have risk in your life. Even in your basement, the ceiling might fall down.

Is there a risk that some AI models could be used to do significant harm to society? Yes, and we know there are people who would love to do that. We should try to make it harder for bad actors to cause these severe harms, and so should the people developing these models.

Anthropic issued its support for SB 53. What are your conversations like with other industry players?

We've talked to everyone: large companies, small startups, investors, and academics. Anthropic has been really constructive. Last year, they never formally supported [SB 1047] but they had positive things to say about aspects of the bill. I don't think [Anthropic] loves every aspect of SB 53, but I think they concluded that on balance the bill was worth supporting.

I've had conversations with large AI labs who are not supporting the bill, but are not at war with it in the way they were with SB 1047. It's not surprising. SB 1047 was more of a liability bill, SB 53 is more of a transparency bill. Startups have been less engaged this year because the bill really focuses on the largest companies.

Do you feel pressure from the large AI PACs that have formed in recent months?

This is another symptom of Citizens United. The wealthiest companies in the world can just pour endless resources into these PACs to try to intimidate elected officials. Under the rules we have, they have every right to do that. It's never really impacted how I approach policy. There have been groups trying to destroy me for as long as I've been in elected office. Various groups have spent millions trying to blow me up, and here I am. I'm in this to do right by my constituents and try to make my community, San Francisco, and the world a better place. 

What's your message to Governor Newsom as he's debating whether to sign or veto this bill?

My message is that we heard you. You vetoed SB 1047 and provided a very comprehensive and thoughtful veto message. You wisely convened a working group that produced a very strong report, and we really looked to that report in crafting this bill. The governor laid out a path, and we followed that path in order to come to an agreement, and I hope we got there.

Google Search is bringing its AI Mode feature — its AI-powered search experience — to Spanish-speaking users, the company announced on Tuesday. This expansion will introduce Google's conversational search interface to a broader market, allowing users to ask questions using natural language queries, engage in back-and-forth conversations, upload images, dig deeper on complex topics, and more.

The Spanish-language rollout comes on the heels of Google's major AI Mode expansion in August, when the company released the feature to 180 more countries worldwide. Previously, it had only been available in the U.S., U.K., and India. During that August rollout, Google also introduced advanced AI capabilities to its Google AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to request restaurant reservations in AI Mode. The company plans to introduce support for other types of appointments and event ticket purchases in the future.

Google has been rapidly rolling out AI across its products and services, often with multiple product announcements occurring simultaneously. For instance, the company announced Tuesday that it was bringing conversational photo editing to all Android users in the U.S. It also announced the same day that its more affordable Google AI Plus subscription plan, first introduced in Indonesia, is now arriving in 40 more countries. This expansion follows OpenAI's recent launch of its ChatGPT's Go plan, which launched in India in August and in Indonesia on Tuesday. 

The ChatGPT Go plan is a mid-tier subscription option that sits between OpenAI's free version and its premium $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus plan. Users get 10 times higher usage limits than the free plan for sending questions or prompts, generating images, and uploading files. According to OpenAI, the plan also allows ChatGPT to remember previous conversations better, enabling more personalized responses over time.

Google announced earlier this month that AI Mode also now supports Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Brazilian Portuguese.

With so many products, users may find it hard to distinguish between different features and functionality, like the difference between Google's AI Mode and its AI Overviews. The former is a separate, immersive, and conversational experience where users chat directly with Gemini AI. Meanwhile, AI Overviews simply offer a quick, AI-generated summary of information about your search query at the top of Google's Search results.

Ruby central was short for cash, Shopify used that to pressure them into a takeover of several core community repos like bundler so that Shopify can control those indirectly? Is that it?

reply

reply

I'm assuming there's a ton of reputational risk in this move, and my understanding as an outsider is that Shopify already has a ton of weight in the Ruby ecosystem - they seem to be the one case quoted by everyone as the “proof that Ruby scales”.

reply

Shopify is a multi-billion dollar company that has processed over a trillion dollars. They are a high value target for sophisticated attackers. It's entirely possible they are trying to accomplish some security and supply chain goals to protect their Ruby pipeline, but completely messed up the execution and did not predict the community interpretation and backlash.

I doubt there will ever be a run-time dependency of rubygems with Shopify. I would be more alarmed if, say, Microsoft GitHub™, Google, Cloudflare would ""step up to safe the project"".

As an aside, I imagine the discussion of this will be end up being... difficult, because people are tending not react to these sorts of things well.

Oh, so this is just dhh doing a hostile takeover of core ruby infrastructure where previously he had to try to work with people, now he can just tell people what he wants to be done, because they work for him.

I remember Ruby Central denied they ever tried to deplatform DHH. But now when they are platforming DHH Sidekiq wants out.I honestly think it is may be way simpler. Shopify is willing to sponsor and put money into it but they also want it done ASAP, preferably now. They give a deadline and Ruby Central didn't think, plan or act until too late.And the moment it was badly done, politics creeps in.

Let's be paranoid for a moment. What if there's a supply side attack on a gem used by Homebrew. That's basically installed on every dev machine, auto-updates automatically/silently, could have sudo, that no one would care or even know how to point at a private gem repository.

Are there any reliable decentralized package distribution systems operating at within 2 orders of magnitude of that scale?

I got off the Ruby and Rails trains ages ago (around the time that Rails changed the package management solution it used; that convinced me the whole project was not in its ""adults in the room"" phase yet and I couldn't be bothered to keep up with a project that would require me to pay attention to it every quarter instead of putting a project down for a year and having it mostly work when I picked it up again). Sad to say this kerfluffle hasn't exactly shifted my opinion of the ecosystem.

Open source is about licensing and not about governance. There are plenty of open source projects where the owner is a dictator. In this case the owner of the github organization has control over who is a part of it and who has permissions within it.

When someone says “open source,” that's often shorthand for the broader definition.

As expected, President Donald Trump and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the podium Monday afternoon to blame acetaminophen (known by the brand name Tylenol) for causing autism—an assertion that many experts reject. But both men also took some time to point the finger at one of their favorite scapegoats: vaccines.

Throughout yesterday's news conference announcing the HHS' apparent findings on autism, ostensibly focused on acetaminophen and folate deficiency, Trump and Kennedy repeatedly circled back to the topic of vaccination. The two tossed out familiar and regularly debunked talking points from the antivaccination movement, such as the supposed dangers of taking too many vaccines at once. These moments, off-script as they may have been, are a strong signal that RFK Jr. and his allies are still planning to officially blame vaccines for causing autism.

The HHS announcement on autism released yesterday, not so much a report as it is a purported fact sheet, mostly concerned the drugs acetaminophen and leucovorin, the latter being a medication used to treat certain kinds of folate deficiency. Outside scientists have already torn apart the findings, arguing they're based, at best, on weak and mixed evidence. But that didn't stop Trump and RFK Jr. from loudly proclaiming during the conference that they've come closer than anyone yet to finding the true answer to rising reported autism rates. Actual experts say most of the rise is simply due to better screening and expanded criteria for what qualifies as autism.

Trump and RFK Jr. Blame Tylenol For Autism in New Report, but Experts Push Back

Trump certainly emphasized the primary findings, more than once yelling at pregnant women to not take Tylenol and to instead tough out their episodes of pain and fever since it apparently comes with no drawbacks. Leaving aside the misery of having to bear these symptoms without medication, fever during pregnancy may be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental conditions like autism. He also wrongly stated that Cuba has no autism, presumably because the country has reduced access to acetaminophen.

All that said, it didn't take too long for Trump to start ranting about vaccines.

In probably the most memeable moment, Trump called for the childhood vaccine schedule to be broken up and further spaced apart, arguing it's dangerous for babies to be exposed to too many vaccine ingredients at once—including, it seems, the water used to contain vaccine shots.

“Break it up, because it's too much liquid, too many different things are going into that baby at too big a number, the size of this thing, when you look at it, it's like 80 different vaccines,” Trump said.

The “too much liquid” part seems to be a unique Trumpism, but it's certainly true that many antivaxxers fearmonger about the number of vaccines children are mandated to receive, often by highly exaggerating the figure as Trump did. Nowhere in the world is a child mandated to take 80 different vaccines, or up to 92, as RFK Jr. has previously claimed.

The tally can differ depending on the state's policy, but kids are typically encouraged to receive around 15 different vaccines before adulthood. Many vaccines require boosters, so antivaxxers will try to fudge the math by counting every single dose as a separate vaccine. But if you even do that for all the non-annual vaccines, you still get roughly 30 doses. People, kids and adults alike, are also generally recommended to get a seasonal flu shot (and until recently, a regular covid-19 booster), but even if you included both yearly flu and covid shots until age 18, you still wouldn't get to 80. This fuzzy math is pointless anyhow, since only some childhood vaccines are actually mandated by states for children to enter and stay in public school. New York, for instance, requires children to take ten vaccines throughout their school years.

Trump offered other nonsensical canards about vaccination. He claimed that Amish communities, some of which are skeptical about vaccines, do not experience autism—a complete falsehood. He claimed the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine was dangerous—an unfounded assertion—and said the shots should be given separately. That's a longtime goal of the antivaccination movement, but it would actually put children at risk, since fewer families have the time or resources to get all three vaccines individually. (It would also require more doses in total, which seems to fly in the face of Trump's liquid concerns!)

Though RFK Jr. had less speaking time during the announcement, he too made it a point to bring up the debunked link between vaccines and autism. During one particularly astonishing moment, he tried to frame people's opposition to the antivaccination movement as the “gaslighting” of mothers who believe their children's autism was caused by vaccines, even arguing that it went against the common refrain of “believing all women”—a sentiment wholeheartedly endorsed by the White House, which highlighted it on its social media accounts.

""Some 40-70% of mothers who have children with autism believe that their child was injured by a vaccine. President Trump believes that we should be listening to these mothers instead of gaslighting and marginalizing them like prior administrations."" – @SecKennedy pic.twitter.com/491tqIpgKy

— The White House (@WhiteHouse) September 23, 2025



The HHS autism announcement released yesterday only contains a brief, but important, reference to vaccines. It noted that the National Institutes of Health has recently launched the Autism Data Science Initiative, which is intended to fund research that will further investigate the drivers of autism, among other things. The HHS announcement mentions that vaccinations will be one of the “medical and perinatal influences” that the initiative will look into, which RFK Jr. confirmed as well. HHS has also reportedly hired well-known antivaxxer David Geier to conduct a new study reexamining the link between vaccines and autism.

Some members of the antivaccination movement expressed dismay that the much-touted HHS report mostly focused on acetaminophen, fearing that RFK Jr. and Trump would let vaccines off the hook. But given their comments yesterday, it seems like they're raring to keep undermining vaccination too. The state of the country's public health is bad now, but it could certainly get even worse from here on out.

While Innosilicon Technology's products may not be prominently featured on the list of the best graphics cards, the company has been hard at work developing its Fenghua (translated as Fantasy) series of graphics cards. As ITHome reported, Innosilicon recently unveiled the Fenghua No. 3, the company's latest flagship GPU. The company promises that its third GPU iteration is a significant advancement over its predecessors.

While previous Fenghua No.1 and Fenghua No.2 graphics cards were based on Imagination Technologies' PowerVR IP, the new Fenghua No.3 leverages the open-source RISC-V architecture instead. The graphics card reportedly borrows a page from OpenCore Institute's Nanhu V3 project.

The company representative didn't provide any more details on the Fenghua No.3 during the launch event, only that it features a home-grown design from the ground up. The Fenghua No.3 is also purportedly compatible with Nvidia's proprietary CUDA platform, which could open many doors for the graphics card if it holds true.

The Fenghua No.3 is designed for a bunch of different workloads, as Innosilicon describes it as an ""all-function GPU"" (translation). The company plans to deploy the graphics card in different sectors, including AI, scientific computing, CAD work, medical imaging, and gaming. Therefore, it's safe to assume there will be other variants of the Fenghua No.3.

From a gaming perspective, the Fenghua No.3 claims support for the latest APIs, including DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.2, and OpenGL 4.6. The graphics card is also reportedly equipped to support ray tracing. The team demonstrated the Fenghua No.3 in titles such as Tomb Raider, Delta Force, and Valorant at the press conference, and reports claim that the gameplay was smooth. However, there was no available information on game settings, resolution, and actual frame rates, so take these claims with a grain of salt.

The Fenghua No.3 reportedly comes equipped with 112GB+ of HBM memory, making it an ideal product for AI. A single Fenghua No. 3 can handle 32B and 72B LLM models, while eight of them in unison work with 671B and 685B parameter models. Innosilicon claims unconditional support for the DeepSeek V3, R1, and V3.1 models, as well as the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families.

Innosilicon also boasted that the Fenghua No.3 is China's first graphics card to support the YUV444 format, which offers the best color detail and fidelity—a feature particularly beneficial for users who perform extensive CAD industrial work or video editing. The manufacturer also highlighted the Fenghua No.3's support for 8K (7680 x 4320) displays. The graphics card can drive up to six 8K monitors at 30 Hz.

The Fenghua No.3 is the world's first graphics card to offer native support for DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine). It enables the precise visualization of X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds on standard monitors, eliminating the need for costly, specialized grayscale medical displays.

China's semiconductor industry is gradually improving. Although it is unlikely to rival that of the United States in the near future, it may not necessarily need to do so. China's primary goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in key areas. Announcements such as the Fenghua No.3 may seem insignificant individually. Collectively, they might amass into substantial progress, akin to accumulating grains of sand that eventually form a small beach.

As we age, we experience a number of changes in our bodies and how they operate, including the brain. It's not uncommon for people to have problems remembering names or having a slower time making decisions as we get older, normally referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, it is not common for these types of cognitive issues to have a negative impact on a person's overall daily life. 

If a person's thinking and memory issues start to impact their daily life, this can be signs of moderate to severe cognitive decline, or dementia. 

While not all cases of MCI lead to Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia, past studies show that between 10-20% of people with MCI go on to develop dementia over a one-year timeframe.

For this reason, clinicians emphasize the importance of following a healthy lifestyle to help keep their brain healthy as we age. Past studies show that certain unhealthy lifestyle factors, such as obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, medical conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, and depression, as well as social isolation and intellectual inactivity, may increase a person's risk for cognitive decline. 

Now, a new commentary study recently published in The American Journal of Medicine provides further evidence of how certain lifestyle factors may impact a person's risk for cognitive decline.

The study also urges the medical community and policymakers to take action to support lifestyle-based interventions to help prevent cognitive decline around the world. 

In the commentary, researchers spotlight the findings of two large published studies that examined how lifestyle changes affect cognitive outcomes in older adults — the Protect Brain Health Through Lifestyle Interventions to Reduce Risk (POINTER) with results published in July 2025, and the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) trial with results published in June 2015, to support their beliefs that lifestyle interventions can help clinicians reduce cognitive decline in older adults. 

In the POINTER study, researchers recruited 2,111 older adults, with an average age of 68, at risk for cognitive decline and dementia. Participants followed either structured or self-guided lifestyle interventions, which included the MIND diet, a moderate to high-intensity exercise program, social engagement, and heart health monitoring. 

At the study's conclusion, researchers found while both styles of lifestyle interventions were beneficial in helping to lower cognitive decline risk, those in the structured program had greater improvement in their global cognition compared to the self-guided group. 

The findings of the POINTER trial, researchers comment in their commentary, are consistent with the findings of the FINGER trial in 2015, where a “multi-domain intervention” strategy including diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring, offered greater improvements in their cognition than the group who was just given general health advice. 

“POINTER and FINGER are the first large-scale randomized trials to test multi-domain lifestyle interventions — like exercise, diet, cognitive training, and social engagement,” Charles H. Hennekens, MD, FACPM, FACC, the First Sir Richard Doll Professor of Medicine and Preventive Medicine in the Departments of Medicine and Populations Health, interim chair of Population Health, and senior academic advisor for the Schmidt College of Medicine at Florida Atlantic University, and senior author of this study, told Medical News Today. 

“Each provides reliable evidence of benefit. These trials illustrate that targeting several modifiable risk factors simultaneously can produce measurable improvements in cognitive outcomes. The fact that these large-scale, randomized results were consistent in two different populations strengthens the belief that lifestyle modifications are causal in reducing cognitive decline.”— Charles H. Hennekens, MD, FACPM, FACC

MNT spoke with Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD, director of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center and co-director of the Center for Memory Loss and Brain Health at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, for her thoughts on this commentary. 

“The summary suggests this is a logical extension of existing knowledge. The text explicitly states that lifestyle factors have long been ‘postulated' to influence cognitive decline. More importantly, it points out that the very same ‘therapeutic lifestyle changes' discussed — such as improved diet, physical activity, and smoking cessation — already have ‘proven benefit' in preventing and managing other major chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease and colorectal cancer.”— Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

“Given the known biological mechanisms, such as how physical activity improves brain perfusion and how certain diets reduce oxidative stress, it is a well-supported hypothesis that these interventions would also benefit brain health,” she added. 

MNT also asked Raphael Wald, PsyD, a neuropsychologist with Marcus Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, for his reaction to this recently published commentary. 

“This study highlights the importance of healthy choices in reducing the risk of cognitive decline,” Wald commented. “This is something that has long been understood, though this study helps underline the magnitude of the effect of diet and exercise on brain health as we age.”

Based on the evidence presented in their commentary, the researchers ask clinicians, public health professionals, and policymakers to implement coordinated efforts and support interventions for known lifestyle-based risk factors for cognitive decline. 

“Changing individual behavior is difficult, especially when people face structural barriers such as limited access to nutritious food, safe exercise environments, or affordable health care,” Hennekens said. “That's why a siloed approach — where clinicians give advice, but communities lack resources to act on it — is suboptimal.”

“We're calling for a coordinated response that brings together clinical practice, public health initiatives, and policymaking to create a supportive ecosystem,” he continued. “This includes things like city planning that promotes walkability, insurance incentives for preventive care, and public education campaigns that normalize healthy aging. Only through such coordinated efforts can we create lasting change and reduce disparities in who benefits from these lifestyle-based interventions.”

Parulekar told MNT that this study highlights the burden of social determinants of health on the cognitive health of our population.

“Because the risk factors are embedded in daily life — diet, activity, social connection — a multi-level approach is essential. If clinicians are able to counsel individual patients and provide referral to community-wide education and support programs launched by the public health professionals, policymakers can create environments that make healthy choices easier.” — Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

“Just counseling and education will not be effective if there is limited access to healthy interventions,” Parulekar added. “Coordinated efforts are needed to translate research findings into ‘major clinical and public health implications' that can meaningfully reduce the burden of this disease.”

Moving forward from this commentary, Wald said the hope is that this research motivates people to take care of their overall vascular health. 

“A good next step would be to evaluate how to implement these lifestyle changes on a larger scale so that the public as a whole can benefit,” he continued. “This would likely help reduce the burden of dementia in society.” 

Hennekens said that to truly understand how lifestyle interventions protect the brain, we need more mechanistic studies that bridge the gap between behavioral outcomes and biological changes. 

“This means, for example, investing in research that integrates longitudinal lifestyle data with biomarkers such as inflammatory cytokines, markers of vascular health, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and others that may influence brain resilience,” he detailed. “Advanced neuroimaging and genetic profiling should also be part of future studies to detect changes at the cellular and systems level. Ideally, we need multidisciplinary collaborations that bring together neuroscientists, epidemiologists, and clinicians to design studies that can track these changes over time and across populations.”

And Parulekar commented that the clear next step for this research is to move from postulation to definitive proof. 

“The commentary hopes to achieve this by laying out the strong scientific rationale to encourage and justify future studies. Specifically, the next steps should include conducting rigorous trials and research that explores whether combining multiple interventions — such as diet, exercise, and smoking cessation simultaneously — produces a greater, synergistic benefit than any single intervention alone.”— Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD

“This commentary aims to serve as a call to action, providing the foundational evidence for the need for coordinated efforts to support lifestyle interventions as a powerful tool against cognitive decline,” Parulekar added.

Reducing injection burden has long been a priority in diabetes care. Now, a weekly, fixed-dose combination of basal insulin and a GLP-1 receptor agonist is one step closer to approval in Europe.

Kyinsu (insulin icodec with semaglutide; Novo Nordisk) received a positive recommendation from the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in September. The therapy is intended for adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus whose glycemic control remains inadequate despite treatment with either basal insulin or a GLP-1 receptor agonist and is to be used alongside diet, physical activity, and oral antidiabetic drugs. 

T2D is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive beta-cell dysfunction, resulting in hyperglycemia and subsequent multiorgan complications. Effective T2D management often requires therapies that target multiple glycemic pathways. 

Kyinsu combines two active agents with complementary mechanisms to enhance glycemic control. Insulin icodec, a basal insulin analogue, regulates glucose metabolism via insulin receptor activation, while semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, modulates insulin and glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. 

Insulin icodec features three amino acid substitutions and a C20 eicosane fatty diacid chain enabling reversible albumin binding, which prolongs its half-life to approximately 196 hours, achieving steady state after 3-4 weekly doses. Each unit of icodec delivers the same glucose-lowering effect as one unit of standard daily basal insulins, with a once-weekly dose being seven times that of a daily basal insulin.

Evidence from the COMBINE-1, COMBINE-2, and COMBINE-3 trials has demonstrated that once-weekly Kyinsu significantly improved glycemic control in adults with T2D across various treatment backgrounds. 

In COMBINE-1, IcoSema (another name used in clinical trials for the combo) showed superior A1c reduction (-1.55%) compared with insulin icodec alone (-0.89%) and resulted in meaningful weight loss and lower hypoglycemia rates. COMBINE-2 demonstrated that IcoSema was also superior to semaglutide in reducing A1c (-1.35% vs -0.90%), though weight loss was greater with semaglutide alone. COMBINE-3 confirmed that IcoSema was noninferior to full basal-bolus insulin therapy for A1c reduction, while offering the additional benefits of significant weight loss and markedly lower rates of hypoglycemia. 

The most frequent adverse effects with Kyinsu include hypoglycemia, nausea, and diarrhea. 

If next approved by the European Commission, Kyinsu will be offered as a prefilled pen containing a fixed-dose combination of insulin icodec (700 U/mL) and semaglutide (2 mg/mL) for subcutaneous injection. Designed as a once-weekly therapy, it aims to simplify treatment and reduce the challenges of daily basal insulin, particularly injection burden and poor adherence.

Detailed recommendations for Kyinsu use will be described in the summary of product characteristics, which will be published on the EMA website once the European Commission grants marketing authorization.

More than 1500 persons in Norway have had a liver transplantation. But how can doctors know which patients need extra follow-up or additional treatment so that as many as possible can live a long life afterwards?

In some people, liver failure is caused by cancer, in others it is due to diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissue, while others have a liver seriously damaged by alcohol consumption.

Amongst those who have a liver transplantation, around 95 per cent are still alive one year later. After five years, 85 per cent are still alive. How can doctors receive signals at an early stage indicating which patients may need more treatment or following up more closely?

Researchers at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the University of Oslo have looked at a large number of previously completed studies to find out how so-called biomarkers can help to foresee survival rates and complications.

Biomarkers are substances, molecules or even images that can be measured or detected in a body or cell and that can reveal information about an underlying condition. Typically, doctors can find these biomarkers in blood tests, urine samples or by using ultrasound.

In the article published in the scientific journal Liver Transplantation, the researchers analyzed studies covering many different biomarkers and combinations of these.

We investigated whether these gave signs as to how the patient would fare, both shortly after the operation and later on. The biomarkers were evaluated both in terms of whether they gave good explanations about the patient's health and as regards how the transplanted organ was functioning. Our findings can help doctors make treatments more effective in the future and to know which patients will need closer follow-up.""

Andrea Camera, Section of Physiology, University of Oslo



Examples of biomarkers which can reveal something about patient survival after transplantation are the coagulation factors V and ALAT. But perhaps more importantly, the study compiled new combinations of biomarkers that have not previously been tested, explain the researchers.

In the various studies the researchers looked at, different methods and medical scoring systems were used to measure how well the biomarkers worked. It was therefore not always easy for the researchers to compare the results.

""For this reason, we have drawn up recommendations as to how future studies could standardize this so that everyone uses the same scoring system. It is important to achieve a wide overview of which biomarkers function best in order to be able to foresee possible complications and get a picture of how the patient will fare"", says Gustavo Jose Justo da Silva, postdoctoral fellow and one of the leaders of the study.

The researchers are now also checking the biomarkers against other conditions, such as heart diseases, diabetes and heart transplantations. The project leader for the studies is professor Kåre-Olav Stensløkken at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences. The aim of the research is to increase the accessibility and function of donor organs for transplantation.

In beating the No. 8 ranked Penn State Nittany Lions 2-1 Sunday, the Wisconsin women's soccer team scored a major victory for the program on the road. 

It was also head coach Paula Wilkins' homecoming to Penn State, a place where she worked for over 10 years.

Erin Connolly netted two goals and Ella Ottey provided 2 assists to help the Badgers complete a comeback. On the defensive side, Hailey Baumann looked like the stalwart  she is, coming up with several clutch plays as centerback. Goalie Drew Stover also played a brilliant game where she only allowed one goal and had six saves, including one penalty shot. 

In winning, Wilkins achieved some bragging rights over a school, and coach, she is  familiar with. Wilkins was hired to the Nittany Lion's women's soccer staff in 1994 and then became the head coach from 2001-2006, leaving in 2007 to take the helm at Wisconsin. 

The Penn State women's soccer program has found great success under head coach Erica Dambach, reaching the NCAA tournament 18 consecutive times and winning the national championship in 2015. She has also had success against Wisconsin during her tenure, going 11-6-1 since 2007. 

Wilkins and Dambach go further back in their history, as they recall playing club soccer against each other in the Pennsylvania area in their early teenage years. 

With accolade lists including multiple Big Ten titles, Coach of the Year honors and players who went on to the U.S. Women's National Team, the two coaches feature plenty of accomplishments. But on Sunday, Wilkins got the better of Dambach.

Penn State got off to a quick start which was capitalized by a Kaitlyn MacBean goal, her fourth in her last three Big Ten matches and fifth of the season, around seven minutes in on a cross from Julia Raich. The Nittany Lions got several shots on goal in the first 20 minutes of the first half, but the Badgers came back with a vengeance. 

Delaney Cox, who had a great game coming off the bench, played a great ball into an open Erin Connolly to tie the game for Wisconsin. The Badgers controlled possession for the rest of the half through a relentless press and great defense in the midfield. Penn State struggled to play through their midfielders, and when they took their top forwards Aubrey Culpa and Amelia White out, they could not connect on any balls over the top of the defense.

“We started thinking we're better than we are, and started playing like individuals,” Dambach said about their collapse. “You're not good enough in this league to play as a bunch of individuals.” 

The Badgers struck with the go-ahead goal five minutes into the half, when Connolly scored on a beautiful through ball by Ella Ottey, making the score 2-1 in favor of Wisconsin. 

The biggest opportunity in the first 22 minutes of the second half for Penn State occurred when  Raich got tripped up by Wisconsin's Madison Ishaug just inside the 18-yard box, warranting a penalty. Raich took the penalty and shot it middle-left with some pace, but Stover got to it and forced the shot wide. Penn State only got one more shot on goal the rest of the game, showing the resilience of this Badger team.

“We've been down before this season and we watch our film and our body language. We talked about how we never want to be the team that looks like we're down.” Connolly said after the game. “‘There's nothing left to lose,' that's kind of what we said and we went out there, and killed it the rest of the game.”

The Badgers showed a winning formula today that proves they can hold strong against anyone as they enter the meat of their season. This was their third conference game of the year, improving their record to 1-1-1. Wisconsin has eight more conference games to try and capitalize on this major victory against a tough opponent. 

The Badgers have another tough test on Sep. 25 at 7 p.m. against the No. 12 Iowa Hawkeyes at home.","{'href': 'https://www.dailycardinal.com', 'title': 'The Daily Cardinal'}","soccer"

Izzy Engle netted a hat trick in her second collegiate game. She scored two more times in her third. The next four games all featured at least one goal or assist too.

By the time Notre Dame's 2024 regular season ended, Engle had produced 15 goals. She then scored in four consecutive postseason games — one in the ACC Tournament and three in the NCAA Tournament — as Notre Dame knocked off No. 1-seed Mississippi State and reached the Elite Eight. The awards and honors came pouring in: ACC Freshman of the Year. All-ACC first team. Top Drawer Soccer Freshman of the Year. United Soccer Coaches second-team All-American.

She has picked up in 2025 right where she left off.

Engle's eight goals in eight games this season are tied for the most in the ACC and tied for the sixth-most in the country through Sunday's games. She opened the scoring last week against No. 3 Duke, leading the Fighting Irish (7-0-1) to a 3-2 win, which pushed Notre Dame to No. 1 in the nation for Top Drawer Soccer and No. 2 in the most recent United Soccer Coaches poll.

Engle is living a dream. Her parents, aunt and uncle all went to Notre Dame, so she grew up attending Fighting Irish football games. Playing soccer for the school was always the goal, but she was determined to keep an open mind during her college recruiting process. Coaches knew Notre Dame was her dream school and would ask her if they even had a chance. She would tell them “yes.” And she meant it.

She liked the schools she visited. But in the end, they just weren't Notre Dame.

The Edina, Minnesota, native arrived in South Bend in the summer of 2024 ready to embrace the challenge ahead of her. She knew she would encounter adversity, so she braced herself for it as best she could, trying not to take anything for granted.

“My high school and club experience coming into Notre Dame for sure prepared me very well,” she said in a recent appearance on Sports Spectrum's “What's Up” podcast. “I was used to adversity. I had some injuries that you had to battle though. Having those experiences, I knew the season was not going to be easy and nothing's going to be given.”



Her freshman year was a season of incredible highs, as well as some difficult moments. Engle's strong faith in God helped her avoid getting caught up in the hype and push through the struggles.

“When things were going well, I knew who to give glory to,” she said on the podcast. “I knew it was not on my own. When things didn't go well … I knew that those valleys, they're temporary. I've got God and I've got my teammates to get me through it.”

Growing up in a Christian family, Engle is grateful for what she described as a “boring” testimony. Jesus has always been part of her life, and she specifically prayed that she would find ways to grow in her faith at Notre Dame. That prayer has been answered in ways that even she didn't expect.

“Having that foundation and knowing that no matter what I go through, no matter if I feel alone, I'm never alone and God is always with me. When you're going into something so new and so unfamiliar, knowing that everything else might be changing but He is unchanging, that was for sure something that I leaned on,” she said.

Engle was immediately invited to church by teammates and is part of a team Bible study. She is also part of an organization called Notre Dame Christian Athletes and is taking on more of a leadership role now as a sophomore.

This summer, Engle — who also has Brazilian citizenship through her mother — helped the U.S. women's U-20 national team qualify for the 2026 World Cup and served as captain in the semifinals of the Concacaf Women's U-20 Championship against Canada. The U-20 World Cup will take place in Poland next September.

As hectic as her life is, Engle still manages to find little moments to reflect and think about how grateful she is to be playing the sport she loves at her dream school in an environment that helps her grow closer to the Lord.

“It's been really special to see what God's been doing in this place, working in my team, working in me, and working in some of the other girls,” she said on the podcast. “It's also cool to be becoming more of a leader in my faith and having the courage to step out and allow myself to grow and see who God created me to be.”

Notre Dame hosts No. 11 North Carolina (7-3) in its next game Wednesday. Kickoff is at 6 p.m. ET.

The Orlando Pride averaged 1.12 points per game in their first seven seasons as a National Women's Soccer League franchise (2016-2022). They made the playoffs once and never won a postseason game. In January 2023, they selected center back Emily Sams (née Madril) with the third overall pick in the NWSL Draft.

Since Sams arrived, they are averaging a league-high 1.93 points per game. While correlation doesn't equal causation, there is no question that Sams has been a central figure in one of the most remarkable turnarounds in recent memory in any major sports league.

>> Subscribe to Sports Spectrum Magazine for more stories where sports and faith connect <<

Sams was well aware of Orlando's history as she went through the draft process, and wanted to be picked by a team that had a better track record of success.

“I was trying to talk to my agents and see if there was something we could do, but Orlando said, ‘No, we're drafting you and you are coming here,'” she said in a recent interview for the Summer 2025 edition of Sports Spectrum Magazine. “So at first I thought, ‘All right, just gotta make the best of it.' But now I'm so thankful. I feel I have also been placed here for a reason, so it's just been incredible.”

Her impact was immediate. Sams started every regular-season game as a rookie and led the Pride in minutes played. Orlando narrowly missed out on the playoffs, but it was clear the team was headed in a positive direction under head coach Seb Hines, who was hired in November 2022.

Yet no one could have predicted what was coming next. The Pride opened the 2024 season with a 23-game unbeaten run, resulting in a 60-point campaign that included 18 wins — all NWSL records. They also collected the first two trophies in franchise history: the NWSL Shield as the team with the best regular-season record, and the NWSL Championship.

Sams won NWSL Defender of the Year and was an alternate on the U.S. team that won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. She officially made her U.S. women's national team debut on Oct. 27, 2024, in a friendly against Iceland, and has earned three more caps since.

— National Women's Soccer League (@NWSL) November 21, 2024



Orlando is off to another strong start this year, sitting in second place as the season approaches its halfway point. The strong bond between players has played an important role in the team's success, and an active Bible study has helped build a strong foundation of faith in the locker room.

Sams is a regular participant in the Bible study, and teammates who have played for other teams have emphasized to her how special the present culture of faith in Orlando is.

“Everyone who has had previous experience [in the NWSL] is saying, ‘This is incredible. This is not very common. This is a sacred time and a sacred place,'” Sams said in the magazine feature. “So I definitely feel very blessed to be a part of this group. I would just say we're all very committed to meeting.”

Sams grew up going to church and was involved in Bible studies while in college at Florida State, but does not feel like she truly took ownership of her faith until last year. The defining moment came during a team Bible study when they were reading an introduction to a book that discussed spiritual warfare.

“It talked about how our souls our being fought for,” Sams said. “I can't remember the specific moment, but we were reading that, and for whatever reason it just clicked in my head, and I would say that is the moment I got saved. God just revealed Himself to me in a way that I had never experienced before.”

On New Year's Eve, Sams reflected on her incredible year in an Instagram post. Her caption was the only way she could explain everything that happened: “Only by the grace of God.”

Orlando (8-3-1) is back in action against Racing Louisville (5-5-2) at 8 p.m. ET on Friday. Sams was also included on the U.S. women's national team roster for its upcoming games against Ireland (June 26 and 29) and Canada (July 2).

By Daniel Villar Pardo

Following Gianni Infantino‘s tenure as FIFA president, soccer has seen transformative changes worldwide, particularly with the integration of technology. This era has ushered in a revamped FIFA Club World Cup and introduced a series of updates for the 2026 World Cup. As we look ahead, CONMEBOL is reportedly advocating for further modifications to enhance the prestigious tournament by the 2030 edition.

According to Diario Ole, CONMEBOL is pushing for a major shift in the 2030 FIFA World Cup by proposing an expansion from 48 to 64 teams. While this might seem excessive, it is not unprecedented; the tournament expanded from 24 to 32 teams in 1998, paving the way to the recent expansion to 48 national teams in 2026. Now, the potential expansion is now being studied towards the 2030 edition.

After the latest FIFA Council meeting, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez made a statement that could hint at a possible agreement for a major change in the World Cup format. “We came here to work and had an extremely important meeting. Stay tuned because we will soon be announcing news that will impact the world,” he said, as reported by Diario Ole.

Though FIFA has not officially announced it, sources like Diario Ole report that President Gianni Infantino is lobbying for support across various regions ahead of a Council meeting next week. The meeting is expected to unveil plans to expand the tournament to 64 teams. However, this change would only take effect starting with the 2030 edition, establishing a new precedent for future World Cups, while the 2026 event remains unaffected.

A detailed view of the FIFA World Cup Trophy.

If FIFA approves and announces expanding to 64 national teams, the traditional World Cup format will change significantly. The tournament will feature 16 groups instead of the usual 12, with the top two teams from each group moving on. Consequently, 32 teams will progress to the second round, matching the number that qualified for the tournament's first round in the 2022 edition.

This change presents a golden opportunity for national teams like Venezuela, which have yet to experience a World Cup. However, it also challenges future tournaments, as a single nation might struggle to accommodate the increased number of matches in a compressed timeframe. Consequently, this shift encourages more collaborative bids for hosting rights, shaping the tournament's future landscape.

We're less than nine months away from the start of the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will see AT&T Stadium (which will temporarily be renamed Dallas Stadium) host nine games across 31 days, beginning with a group stage match on June 14, and concluding with a semifinal match on July 14.

And while Dallas has taken center stage in the official FIFA branding, Fort Worth agencies are positioning the city to be a major player in the world's biggest sporting event, with plans underway to attract and accommodate fans from across the globe.

Anette Landeros, the chief strategy officer for Trinity Metro, which manages Fort Worth's public transportation, said FIFA officials expect 100,000 visitors across Dallas-Fort Worth each day.

Not all of them, of course, will stay in Fort Worth, but enough will that Landeros and her team are preparing for a significant uptick in train and bus ridership next summer. As for what the exact number will be, Landeros said, it largely depends on which countries' teams play in Arlington. That won't be decided until Dec. 5 when FIFA holds its final draw, where the 48 nations competing in the World Cup are placed into groups and venues are assigned.

For its part, Visit Fort Worth, the city's visitors bureau, is marketing Fort Worth as the place to experience the World Cup Texas style, an idea illustrated by Fort Worth artist Matt Cliff, who designed the official poster for our region. One of the first steps was establishing a dedicated website, fortworth.com/soccer2026, to welcome and educate soccer fans.

Mitch Whitten, Visit Fort Worth's chief operating officer, told the Fort Worth City Council on Tuesday the World Cup will have an estimated $1.5 billion impact on the region's economy. To carve out a sizable portion of that, Visit Fort Worth is teaming with business partners from the Stockyards, the Near Southside, Sundance Square, TCU and Downtown Fort Worth, Inc., to give fans that quintessentially Texas experience.

Additionally, with more than 4,000 media members expected at the International Broadcast Center in Dallas during the tournament, Whitten said his team is developing a strategy to attract coverage of Fort Worth, ostensibly introducing Cowtown to a worldwide audience that may be unfamiliar.

The first big kickoff event of World Cup season will be at 11 a.m. on Dec. 5, when Billy Bob's will host a FIFA draw watch party. Three months later, in March, teams will announce the locations of their base camps, and it's expected that TCU will host one of the national teams playing in Arlington.

“Next summer, the world is coming to North Texas, and we are excited to be able to showcase areas and cities around the region that make Dallas-Fort Worth the incredible destination it is,” said Noelle Leveaux, chief marketing officer for the North Texas Organizing Committee for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. “It's also an opportunity for our residents, business owners and community partners to take advantage of this once-in-a-generation event. As we deliberately look to include the region as a whole in our planning and preparation, having the Official Draw Party in Fort Worth was a perfect fit.”

Getting fans to come to Fort Worth is one thing. Getting them from point A to point B as quickly and efficiently as possible is a whole other challenge in itself.

“Right now, we're planning for, at the very least, being able to move 5,800 people via the TRE (Trinity Railway Express) on game days,” Landeros said. “The hope is that the TRE will be the primary focus of getting folks toward Arlington.”

To handle the increased ridership, Trinity Metro has acquired additional passenger cars and locomotives. Still, it likely won't be enough. To accommodate the overflow, Landeros said there will be supplemental buses from Fort Worth Central Station in downtown to Arlington. Landeros estimates the buses will be able to carry 2,000 to 4,000 passengers on game days.

Finding enough seats for riders was one hurdle, Landeros said. Another was the fact that there's no train station in Arlington. The closest one is the CentrePort/DFW Airport Station near Trinity Boulevard and Texas 360, but that lies about eight miles north of AT&T Stadium, meaning more buses will be needed to transport people from the station to the venue.

To create enough capacity to do all that, Landeros said Trinity Metro is looking at bringing in charter buses. But it has certainly posed a challenge, she said, figuring out how to establish routes in areas not traditionally served by public transportation.

When asked if this could be the catalyst for a permanent transportation link between downtown Fort Worth and Arlington's entertainment district, Landeros said she's always open to having those discussions.

“In terms of desire, I can confidently state that Trinity Metro would love to service Arlington,” she said. “Of course, that's a decision that's really in Arlington's court. But perhaps witnessing how transit is so important to the international sports fan during the World Cup might give a different perspective, perhaps, for Arlington leaders. And we stand by ready to have that conversation whenever it presents itself as an opportunity.”

Besides getting people to the stadium for the games, there will be a need to move people throughout the city. Once it's decided which teams will be playing in Arlington, Landeros said she and her team will begin creating signs in multiple languages to help with way finding and identifying bus stops and other transportation hubs.

Landeros expects heavy ridership on Trinity Metro's Orange Line, which connects downtown and the Stockyards, and the Blue Line, which circulates passengers on a loop through downtown.

“In terms of way finding, those are improvements that we're really excited about because there are things that we've wanted to do, but now the World Cup has given us the urgency to get it done. And we're going to be a better system for it after,” said Landeros.

Sonny Saxton, Fort Worth's director of emergency communications and management, said the city has established work groups to address a variety of concerns around the upcoming World Cup, from infrastructure necessities to beautification efforts to safety and security. He told the City Council that the Fort Worth Police Department, the Fort Worth Fire Department and hospitals have all been involved in planning for crowd management and emergency response.

Michael Crum, director of Fort Worth's public events department, added to that, saying the city will be well prepared by next summer to handle a large number of visitors while ensuring everyday services are not affected.

Home » Libertarian Think Tank Backs Dynamic Pricing in FIFA World Cup Ticket Debate

The CATO Institute is defending FIFA's decision to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, calling the move “fair play” in a new commentary.

The libertarian think tank argued that allowing ticket prices to rise and fall with demand is an efficient way to allocate scarce seats for one of the world's most in-demand sporting events. The 2026 tournament — the first to expand to 48 teams — is expected to draw record crowds across 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

| READ: From $60 to More Than $6K: FIFA's Dynamic Pricing Plan for 2026 World Cup Tickets |

FIFA confirmed that while some tickets will remain at set prices, most will vary based on demand, similar to pricing systems used in concerts and major U.S. sports leagues. Critics, including New York City mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani, have denounced the policy as “greed,” launching petitions to impose caps.

In its piece, CATO countered that fixed pricing would lead to shortages and misallocation, while dynamic pricing allows fans who value the experience most to secure seats — and noted that prices can decrease for less popular matchups.

While consumer groups have long warned that dynamic pricing can push events out of reach for average fans, CATO maintained that market-based pricing combined with FIFA's official resale platform offers a “sensible” solution to distribute tickets fairly.

The Cato Institute, grounded in free-market philosophy, frames FIFA's dynamic pricing strategy for the 2026 World Cup as a legitimate, even laudable move — one that reflects economic realities and promises to shift more surplus value back toward organizers rather than resellers. But whether fans and local regulators will see it as “fair play” depends largely on how openly FIFA communicates its pricing methodology, how steep the demand-based price increases are, and whether protections (for lower-income or local fans) are baked in.

Marcus Rashford risks blowing unique chance to supercharge his career at Barcelona if he keeps repeating Man Utd mistakes","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/marcus-rashford-risks-blowing-barcelona-chance-repeating-man-utd-mistakes/blt78fbf25dce11e8b5","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:06:27 GMT","

When Marcus Rashford was unveiled as a new Barcelona signing in August, he kept coming back to one word: discipline. For a player who had missed training after going on a drunken night out in Belfast a year ago and been forced out of Manchester United by Ruben Amorim for his lack of application, it was an intriguing theme for him to draw upon.

He appeared to be saying that he was ready for this new challenge and had put all his past misdemeanours behind him. ""It's one thing to say you're motivated and determined, but these are things that you know can change day to day, depending on how you're feeling,"" he said. 

""But really, the thing that I bring back to my life, not just the sport, is the discipline. And, you know, discipline is something that stays regardless of whether you wake up and you don't feel like it on a given day. Discipline is the thing that keeps you going.""

However, little more than a month into his loan spell at Barca, Rashford has already shown a lack of discipline after arriving late for a team meeting. 

He was only two minutes late and he is not the first Barca player to have been punished for tardiness by Hansi Flick but the infraction cost him a place in the starting line-up for Barca's game against Getafe, ruining the chance for him to kick on after his tremendous performance against Newcastle.

If Rashford is not careful, then, he risks blowing the incredible chance he has been given to revitalise his career at one of the greatest clubs in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alexander Isak's first goal for Liverpool should have been the story after Tuesday night's 2-1 win over Southampton at Anfield. Instead, it was Hugo Ekitike getting himself stupidly sent off after netting the winner.

Isak opened the scoring in the Carabao Cup third-round clash on Merseyside with a characteristically cool finish just before the interval - and only 58 seconds after Leo Scienza had headed wide with the Liverpool goal at his mercy.

However, Arne Slot's side failed to killed the game and Southampton sensationally drew level with 14 minutes to go when Shea Charles punished a dreadful attempted clearance from Wataru Endo. Unfortunately for the Championship side, Liverpool weren't done and, for the sixth time this season, they scored a late winner, with Ekitike tapping home a pass from Chiesa.

The drama wasn't over, though, as Ekitike clearly forgot that he was already on a booking, meaning the French forward saw red for foolishly removing his shirt to show the crowd the name on the back of his shirt and will, thus, be suspended for Saturday's Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.

EXCLUSIVE: After his a long-awaited USMNT return, the son the former national team coach hopes for more chances to come

HARRISON, N.J. - It was just before one of the U.S. men's national team's matches at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, and Jurgen Klinsmann had wrapped a training session. Tim Howard and Brad Guzan turned for the lockerroom, but a few players wanted to stay on the field to continue their work.

Nick Rimando was there to play in goal, but Klinsmann needed another shot-stopper. He looked around, surveyed the scene and found his 17-year-old son.

""We need help,"" the then-USMNT boss said. ""Hop in.""

That was Jonathan Klinsmann's first USMNT training session, if you can call it that. Now, more than a decade later, he can admit that it wasn't particularly great, nor had he done much to earn it. His dad needed a warm body in goal, and he was the best he had at his disposal at that moment.

""I was so young. I had no muscle on me!"" Klinsmann told GOAL. ""I just remember the speed of the ball. I remember it going right past my head. I ended up somehow saving one. I'm feeling confident, and then Jermaine Jones steps up and rips one right at me. I had it. I had the ball in my hands, but I couldn't hold it. He just hit it so hard. It should have been comfortable, but it was so powerful that it went right through me. Right then, I was like, 'OK, this is different.'""

Klinsmann's path back into a USMNT shirt? Yeah, that's been different, too.

The son of a legendary coach and player, Klinsmann, theoretically, could have had an easy path. Instead, he took a more circuitous route back to the USMNT. It's one that, for many, is still headlined by a tweet he sent as a teenager. Those days are long gone, of course. Much has changed, and life has since sent Klinsmann on his own unique journey through it all.

From college to the Bundesliga to Switzerland to the USL to MLS and, now, finally, after all this time, a starting job in Italy, Klinsmann's path has turned into a story of persistence. At some point at each of those stops, he was benched - if he even got the chance to play at all.

Many times, that's what led to him moving on. Klinsmann's story, generally, is one of a player chasing opportunities that never really went his way. Not until now, at least. He's seized his chance with Cesena in Italy. That earned him a  opportunity with the USMNT earlier this month.

That's how he sees things now - as an opportunity. Finally, at age 28, Klinsmann is beginning develop into the player he always wanted to be. Does that result in more USMNT chances going forward? Perhaps, perhaps not. But, after rejoining the USMNT this month, it's worth dreaming.

The goalkeeper picture seems wide open, and so, fresh off his latest national team chance, it might just be worth wondering if, just maybe, those shots from Jones won't be his only World Cup memory after all. 

""Going to college and then all of these different spots and just not playing, that gets at you a lot,"" Klinsmann says. ""Over the years, it's been waiting and waiting and waiting and, finally, having a chance to get a string of games to be like, 'OK, this is me.' It was being patient for eight or nine years and now finally being told that you can play. 

""I've been playing well enough to get this call, so it all just feels like the culmination of my story, of my career up until now. It's all been about building for years. Being able to put it all together now? It's the best. Coming here tops it all off.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

What began as a small, unsanctioned tournament in Houston in 1970 has grown into a global tour spanning six continents and awarding nearly $250 million in annual prize money, the largest in women's sports.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- On Tuesday, September 23, the WTA celebrates the game-changing group of tennis players known as the Original 9, 55 years after they seized control of their collective destiny by signing $1 contracts with promoter Gladys Heldman to compete in a groundbreaking tournament in Houston, Texas.

Hosted by the Houston Racquet Club, the unsanctioned Virginia Slims Invitational offered a purse of $7,500 in response to the dire prize money ratios on offer for female players, compared to the men, at official tournaments.

While key tennis administrators at the state and local level supported the venture, the governing body of the sport in the United States, the USLTA, threatened to curtail the careers of all involved, as did their Australian counterparts.

The Original 9: 55 Years of a defiant revolution

The nine women who were prepared to risk their careers in order to compete on their own terms were Jane ‘Peaches' Bartkowicz, Rosie Casals, Judy Dalton, Julie Heldman, Billie Jean King, Kerry Melville Reid, Kristy Pigeon, Nancy Richey and Valerie Ziegenfuss -- seven Americans, and two Australians (Dalton and Melville Reid).

They believed in their fight for opportunities to play -- and entertain -- for fair pay.

“The Original 9's bold collaboration with Gladys Heldman sparked a new trajectory for women's tennis and, 55 years later, remains a defining moment in sports,” said Portia Archer, CEO of the WTA. “The courage and commitment to equality demonstrated by these trailblazers has inspired generations of WTA athletes and remains at the heart of the global game fans enjoy to this day.”

The tournament, which saw Casals defeat Dalton in the final, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 proved such a hit that Joseph Cullman III, the tennis-mad chief executive of Philip Morris, extended Virginia Slims sponsorship for a comprehensive circuit of events starting in 1971.

While the establishment's didn't amount to much -- for the Americans, at least -- the sport's politics remained fraught, and the USLTA even mounted a rival women's tour to get a piece of the action. But Heldman and her players worked tirelessly to grow their innovative league, which brought the sport to new cities across America, often in non-traditional venues. Fashion designer Ted Tinling's custom dresses married rhinestone-glamor with sporting prowess and helped to build the brand.

As more players joined the campaign that started in Houston, the success of the Virginia Slims Circuit paved the way for the formation of the WTA, spearheaded by King, in the summer of 1973. Finally, a talent pool of more than 60 players was united, and the stage was set for women's professional tennis to boom.

In 2025, the Hologic WTA Tour is comprised of 51 tournaments across 25 countries and regions on six continents (not including WTA 125 events) with a global audience of more than 1 billion. Prize money, including the Grand Slams, is almost $250 million -- a figure unmatched in women's sports.

In 2012, the Original 9 were reunited at the Charleston Open, where they recreated the iconic dollar bill photo taken at the Houston Racquet Club in 1970. Julie Heldman, who was not present for that historic moment, took her rightful place in the position that had been occupied by her late mother, Gladys.

In 2021, they became the first group of players to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

Yugoslavia tennis officials accused Pilić of refusing to play a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand. He denied it but was still suspended. The International Lawn Tennis Federation (now the ITF) supported the Yugoslav decision but reduced his suspension to one month — but that included Wimbledon.Because Pilić was supported by the new Association of Tennis Professionals, 12 of the 16 top seeds and a total of 81 players boycotted Wimbledon.

Pilić was already a star when tennis turned fully professional in 1968. When U.S. businessman Lamar Hunt backed a new professional tour called World Championship Tennis, the likes of Pilić, John Newcombe and Tony Roche were the first eight men's players signed — called the Handsome Eight.Pilić won nine singles titles and reached a highest singles ranking of No. 6. He lost the French Open final to Ilje Nastase. His six doubles titles included the 1970 U.S. Open with Pierre Barthes against Newcombe and Rod Laver in a four-set final.After his playing retirement in 1978, Pilić coached and won the Davis Cup as a non-playing captain with Boris Becker's Germany (1988, 1989, 1993), and Croatia (2005) and served as an adviser when Serbia won in 2010.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

The F1 Nation team look back on all the biggest news and topics from the Azerbaijan Grand Prix weekend in Baku.

Six-time IndyCar race winner, James Hinchcliffe, and F1 TV's lead presenter, Laura Winter, join Tom Clarkson in the Baku paddock to dissect a chaotic Azerbaijan Grand Prix weekend on the latest episode of F1 Nation.

Max Verstappen's fourth win of the season means he's now 69 points behind championship leader Oscar Piastri.

With seven races and three Sprints left, is the four-time World Champion back in the title fight? Red Bull Technical Director Pierre Wache shares his thoughts and explains how the team have transformed their performance since the summer break.

With Piastri crashing out on Lap 1 and Lando Norris only finishing P7, how big a missed opportunity was this weekend for Norris to close the gap to his title rival? And was McLaren's difficult weekend a ‘hangover' from their team orders in Monza?

You'll also hear reaction from a very happy Carlos Sainz, after he scored his first podium for Williams with a perfectly executed race to P3.

Tom, Laura and Hinch also discuss a much better weekend for Mercedes duo George Russell and Kimi Antonelli, a very important battle between Liam Lawson and Yuki Tsunoda, and if Lewis Hamilton is starting to 'find his groove' despite a weekend to forget for Ferrari.

An ACLU open letter supporting free speech and condemning Kimmel's suspension draws the support of a long list of Hollywood luminaries. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Hundreds of Hollywood celebrities have signed an open letter by the American Civil Liberties Union supporting free speech and condemning Disney's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!


	The letter states that efforts to pressure artists, journalists and others with retaliation for their speech “strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.” The message closes by calling on all Americans to fight to defend our right to speak freely.




	Some of the signatories (full list of names below) include Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and Kerry Washington.

					Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers React to Jimmy Kimmel Returning After ABC Lifts Suspension: ""Late Nightmare Is Over""		
			









	One of the names listed is Pedro Pascal, whose trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu Star Wars movie was released this morning by Disney. 


	“We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, which organized the letter. “The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because together, our voices are louder and together, we will fight to be heard.”

	











	Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host. Carr's threat was followed by affiliate owners Nexstar and Sinclair says they would preempt the show, which spurred ABC to suspend Kimmel “indefinitely.”


	The move by the FCC and ABC has been followed by widespread condemnation — even among some Republican leaders such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — and pledges to boycott Disney and its subsidiaries.


	Here is the letter and the full list of names: 


	“We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.


	Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.


	We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.

	











	Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power — because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.


	This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.”

The short, co-directed by Spike Jonze and Halina Reijn, bypassed fashion convention to launch Demna's first collection for the brand. 


							By 

	Caitlin Huston


Business Writer


Gucci is delving further into the filmmaking world as the venerable house premieres a short film starring Demi Moore and a cast of Hollywood stars. 


	The film, entitled The Tiger, is directed by Academy Award-winner Spike Jonze (Her) and Halina Reijn (Babygirl) and features Moore as the head of Gucci, as well as the fictional chairman of California, with a cast including Edward Norton, Elliot Page, Keke Palmer, Julianne Nicholson and Kendall Jenner.




	The fashion brand premiered the film on Tuesday, both in Milan and with a special event in New York, rather than launching a runway show for the first collection under artistic director Demna, who previously served as the creative director of Balenciaga. Gucci also launched a digital lookbook for his spring 2026 ready-to-wear line, called La Famiglia.

	“From the very beginning, I shaped the collection by imagining a constellation of characters, asking myself what Gucci means to me, from its archive to the many identities it embodies,” Demna said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. “I gathered an imaginary family to carry the story, each figure holding a fragment of the broader narrative. Since my first show will be in February, I felt like the story of La Famiglia should be told through a short film. I shared it with Spike and Halina, whose work I've long admired, and they created their film, ‘The Tiger,' inspired by these characters.”

	The film, which also stars Ed Harris, Alia Shawkat, Heather Lawless, Ronny Chieng and Alex Consani, sees Moore gather her children and a special guest at the family home to celebrate her birthday. Her polished demeanor as the head of the company and host cracks as the night takes a turn. 


	While the intent here is more to showcase the fashion collection than to become a major film producer, fashion houses are becoming increasingly entrenched in the film world.


	Gucci also previously premiered a series of short films with filmmaker Gus Van Sant in 2020, as live fashion shows were suspended by the pandemic. While the pandemic forced many major fashion houses to rethink the traditional runway show, Alessandro Michele, then-Gucci creative director, also proclaimed at the time that the brand would limit the number of its collections and runway shows from five or more a year to just two in order to have more time to breathe. The 2021 feature film House of Gucci also took on the history of the family brand. 


	Speaking just ahead of the premiere, Nicholson, who wears a matching black high-colored dress with Heather Lawless, said she signed on to the project because of the directing team as well as the opportunity to work with the brand. 


	“This is the first time I've done anything like this, and it was sort of the combination of Spike and Halina directing with such an iconic brand, and Demna, being his first collection,” Nicholson said. “I grew up outside of Boston, Massachusetts, and where I grew up, it was largely like Irish-American and Italian-American communities. So Gucci was probably the first major fashion brand that I ever knew about.”

	











	“I had to have like three people fit me into the dress, and had massive bling on my fingers,” she said of being on set. “[Heather and I] would just sort of look at each other throughout the course of the day, like, what is happening here? It felt like we had stumbled into a Fellini film-like dream.”


	“It felt like a real mashup of filmmaking and fashion, which are two very different worlds, actually, but it felt like they forged together beautifully,” she added.

President-elect Michele Mulroney and new board members Mike Royce and Molly Nussbaum have pushed for the union to expand outside its traditional jurisdiction and to empower writers to reject unpaid labor.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	It was no surprise when Michele Mulroney was elected to be the new president of the Writers Guild of America West on Tuesday afternoon, given that she ran unopposed for the top job.


	What was more of an open question was the leaders who would shepherd the union alongside Mulroney over the next few years and the issues they might prioritize — which Wednesday's election results answered, with elected leaders emphasizing the need for the union to organize and to do more to help writers resist doing “free work.”




	Travis Donnelly was elected vice president and Peter Murrieta won the secretary-treasurer job in the election that took place between Aug. 29 and Sept. 23. Incumbents Adam Conover,  Rob Forman, Maggie Levin and Molly Nussbaum were elected to seats on the board of directors, as well as non-incumbents Marguerite MacIntyre, Matt Ross, Mike Royce and Myles Warden.

	Because Donnelly, a board member, still had one year left on his term, Cathryn Humphris was additionally elected to serve out his final year. A little over 2,500 valid ballots were cast in a count supervised by Votenet Solutions.

	Multiple newly elected leaders of the union urged the labor group to organize beyond its usual pool of union members into domains like YouTube, verticals, podcasts and other forms of content creation. Conover ran entirely on a platform devoted to growing the union, while in her statement to members, Mulroney said pointedly, “We are sitting on a shrinking iceberg and must be willing to look beyond our current employers.”

	











	Other themes among those who were elected on Tuesday included ending what seems like a never-ending scourge for writers — requests that they do unpaid work as they audition for jobs and even after they have finished a gig — and protecting the union's health plan. Shoring up that plan for the future is expected to be a major issue in contention during the labor group's 2026 contract negotiations with studios and streamers.


	Also important to elected candidates was protecting union members from threats to their work from generative AI and improving diversity, equity and inclusion at the union. Contract enforcement was on several elected candidates' agendas, as was improving communication from the union to members. “The guild did a wonderful job during the strikes, tapping into the power of social media to motivate us, clear up misinformation and share powerful messages and information,” said newly elected board member Warden. He said he wanted the union to “maintain a similar energy and connectedness year-round.”


	Union members will certainly be hearing more from the WGA West in the next few months as the labor group prepares to go back to the negotiating table with major Hollywood companies for the first time since its sprawling 2023 strike. In a statement on Tuesday, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers — the bargaining representative for studios and streamers — congratulated Mulroney and said it looked forward to “working closely with [her] to address key issues for WGA writers and to strengthen our industry with fair, balanced solutions.”

This week's Five Burning Questions looks at the alt-pop duo's eye-catching first-week number for its latest set. 


	In the mid-'10s, Twenty One Pilots became one of the biggest crossover acts in pop music, scoring a trio of top five hits on the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Billboard 200 with its Blurryface album. A decade later, the Pilots hadn't matched that crossover success on either chart, with no additional top five singles and a number of top five albums, but no subsequent number ones.

	That is, until this week. On the Billboard 200 dated Sept. 27, the duo's latest set Breach — marking the apparently final entry in the decade-long narrative the group started with Blurryface — bows at No. 1. The set posts 200k in first-week units, not only besting even its Blurryface total from 2015, but also bettering the debut number from any other rock album yet this decade.




			Trending on Billboard		







	How did the duo manage this performance? And what other rock acts could rival that number in the years to come? Billboard writers answer these questions and more below. 


1. Twenty One Pilots' Breach debuts atop the Billboard 200 with a career-best 200,000 first-week units. On a scale of 1-10, how excited should Twenty One Pilots be about that performance? 


Kyle Denis: 10. I don't see how anyone wouldn't be over the moon after pulling off a career-best opening week, especially when they debuted 16 years ago. In 2025, cracking 200k first-week is nothing to scoff at for pretty much anyone. And it's incredibly impressive that Twenty One Pilots did this as a rock act without a current crossover hit. 

	











Gil Kaufman: 10. For a group that — as they noted at their tour kick-off in Cincinnati last week — has been around for more than 15 years and never knows if its new music will hit, this is a huge deal. Whether you believe the perpetual “rock is dead” mantra or not, rock has been largely missing from the top of the 200 as of late. Landing the biggest debut for any rock LP in six years is a monumental feat for a group whose chart success hasn't always matched its steady, and still-growing, live appeal.


Jason Lipshutz: A 10. This is a statement opening week — a veteran artist returning with a ton of excitement and a physical-product promo blitz, scoring a notably huge debut number, and reasserting their commercial power unequivocally. Twenty One Pilots have been earning top 5 album debuts for over a decade, but Breach becoming their first chart-topper since Blurryface — which was their mainstream breakthrough in 2015, with their career-best first-week total — is the type of accomplishment that can re-frame the legacy of a group for those who hadn't been paying close attention. More artists wish they could notch a game-changing No. 1 debut like this one.


Andrew Unterberger: Gotta be a 10, right? A number even half as big would've still been pretty impressive for the duo at this point in its career, but 200k with no major hits or pop-cultural momentum behind it? That's a jaw-dropping number, and one that shows how successfully Twenty One Pilots has tended to its fanbase over the years, making sure that even at times when not many new fans were jumping on that no one old was ever jumping off, and continuing to slowly-but-surely grow the core audience to where it is today. 

	











Christine Werthman: A No. 1 album and some career-best numbers? No-brainer: That should register as a big 10 on the excitement meter. On top of that, this is the biggest debut for a rock album since Tool's Fear Inoculum in 2019. Does this thing go to 11? 


2. That 200k number is going to be an eye-opener for a lot of people who assumed that the duo's popularity had declined with its radio dominance. What do you think is the biggest reason the Pilots were able to have such an impressive debut for Breach? 


Kyle Denis: I think there were several factors at play. First, Breach had the luxury of arriving as the final installment in a decade-long album series consisting of Blurryface (2015), Trench (2018) and Sealed and Icy (2021). That hype from fans who have patiently followed the series and unpacked the band's lore is priceless; it also helps that the duo started dropping teases for Breach during the final dates of the Clancy World Tour. 


	Moreover, Breach was available across 15+ vinyl variants, three deluxe CDs and various streaming platforms, giving fans ample opportunity to collect different versions of the record, some of which house bonus tracks or alternative cover art. Finally, 21P's Josh Dun has been a hot topic across socials, particularly TikTok, thanks to the news of him and wife Debby Ryan (a Disney Channel icon for mid-late Gen Z) expecting their first child. Even if the Breach singles weren't necessarily crossing over à la “Ride” or “Stressed Out,” the band's celebrity certainly did. 


Gil Kaufman: The proof is in the band's live draw. This just-launched tour opened with a 21,000-capacity sell-out of a soccer stadium, with the feeling that it could have been even bigger. This band's die-hard fans, the Skeleton Clique, not only buy merch in fistfuls, but they came with their own home-brewed gear, knew every lyric to all of the new songs from an album out less than a week, and ride or die for the duo, in an emo-Swiftian fashion.

	











Jason Lipshutz: A combination of in-demand physical releases — including 15 vinyl variants, which contributed 72,000 copies to that 200,000 total — and music that continues to connect. In addition to Breach wrapping up the multi-album Clancy arc for hardcore fans, the album also included another alternative radio smash in “The Contract,” and set up another arena tour for the duo. While this No. 1 debut is much bigger than expected, Twenty One Pilots is still a very popular band, with a catalog of hits and lots of industry support for their new music. 


Andrew Unterberger: Everybody loves a happy ending, right? Can't say I could really explain the plot the duo's albums have (mostly) been following since Blurryface, but the superfans certainly can — and they were definitely looking forward to what the final installment held in store. 


Christine Werthman: Sales contributed a large part to the album's success, thanks to 15 vinyl variants, three deluxe CD boxsets, a standard CD and more available for purchase. The vinyl alone accounted for 72,000 units, which, according to our own Keith Caulfield, makes it the largest vinyl sales week for a rock album since Luminate started electronically tracking in 1991.  


3. “City Walls” debuts at No. 83 on the Hot 100 this week, the only song from the set to reach the chart thus far. Does it feel like it'll grow into a long-lasting hit for 21P, or is it just an album-release week blip?  


Kyle Denis: I think album-release week certainly helped get the song on the Hot 100, but I'm unsure of how much steam “City Walls” will sustain in the coming weeks. Between the big-budget music video and “Heavydirtysoul” (from Blurryface) sample, this could be the song to get casual 2015-era 21P listeners back on board. For what it's worth, I'd love a world where “Downstairs” gets the single treatment. 

	











Gil Kaufman: That is not the song I think will have legs. Based on the response during the show, the wildly catchy “Drum Show” — featuring the first vocals from silent but deadly drummer Josh Dun — or the super-pop (for them) “Garbage” could/should be this LP's breakout hits.


Jason Lipshutz: “City Walls” might be my favorite Twenty One Pilots single since “Jumpsuit” — it's spacious, moody, a little bit gritty and a hell of a lot of fun to blast with your windows down on early-autumn drives. A shape-shifting, five-minute alt-rock single is not a safe bet to scale the heights of the Hot 100, but I could certainly envision “City Walls” sticking around rock platforms for a while, as a type of late-career jam that logs month after month in heavy rotation. 


Andrew Unterberger: Put me down as another one who thinks “Drum Show” will ultimately be the song from Breach that really sticks — but “City Walls” is a great album opener, and a worthy first Hot 100 hit from the set, even though I sorta doubt it'll be hanging around the chart for too long. 


Christine Werthman: “The Contract” and “Drum Show” preceded “City Walls” as singles and didn't do this well, so it seems like a possible good sign that this latest song has more staying power and isn't a blip. That said, it is the first song on the album, which could explain some of the repeat plays that will eventually taper off. It's also over five minutes long and isn't quite as memorable as, say, “Stressed Out,” so I don't have enormously high hopes for its longevity.  


4. While this is its first No. 1 album in a decade, each of Twenty One Pilots' four new albums since 2015's Blurryface have made the chart's top three. What lessons, if any, would you take from the chart longevity of Twenty One Pilots as an albums act?  

	











Kyle Denis: Deliver good music, never take your core fan base for granted, and bring your music on the road. 21P had one of the splashiest top 40 crossovers of the mid-2010s, but instead of abandoning its base to continue chasing a mainstream pop audience, the duo remained committed to its sound and ethos. In doing so, their later career hits (“Jumpsuit,” “Level of Concern,” etc.) arrived on their own time without needing to be chased down. Furthermore, since launching the Blurryface Tour in 2015, there have only been two calendar years (2020 and 2023) during which 21P was not carrying out a headlining tour. Getting your music in front of consumers and connecting with them on a face-to-face level will always be important! 


Gil Kaufman: See previous answer about their Clique. Like Phish or Taylor Swift or The Dead, 21P have created a universe for their fans that is a self-sustaining mechanism, even if the hugeness of it doesn't always translate into huge chart success. From grade-schoolers who paint their faces and hands black like singer Tyler Joseph — along with their parents — to groups of friends who show up in costumes modeled on the knotty four-album Blurryface epic saga, 21P have forged an ecosystem that may not always spin off hits, but will seemingly always bring out masses of superfans. The die-hards will always check out the new music, but the proof is in the foot traffic.


Jason Lipshutz: While bands like My Chemical Romance and Linkin Park played to huge audiences this summer after prolonged breaks in activity, Twenty One Pilots have taken the opposite approach, grinding out albums and tours and making consistency part of their brand. The mainstream explosion of Blurryface was always going to be hard to replicate, and to their credit, the duo haven't really tried chasing more hits — they've simply followed their muse, made for a reliable radio and touring band, and set themselves up for a commercial renaissance when the time and music was right. 

	











Andrew Unterberger: I'll always think back to 2018, when the duo was readying Blurryface follow-up Trench, and they tabbed the bass-freakout, near-metal throwdown “Jumpsuit” as the set's first single. In the short term, the song basically immediately ended the duo's run as crossover stars, but in the long term, perhaps it helped establish Joseph and Dun as artists who followed their own muse above all else, and who trusted their fans would understand even when radio and streaming didn't. Looking back in 2025, you can't say they haven't been validated there. 


Christine Werthman: For Twenty One Pilots, it seems like if they release it, the fans will come; they've got a loyal fanbase that shows up for their releases. It's not quite a replicable lesson for other acts, but it seems to hold up, considering the band's success, even when they aren't popping off on radio. As for any other important takeaways, what about: rock fans love vinyl? Eh? An untested theory, but perhaps.


5. The first-week total for Breach is the highest debut for a Billboard charts-classified rock act so far this decade. Who's another rock outfit that you could see outdoing that number by decade's end?  


Kyle Denis: If all goes according to my plan and Imagine Dragons headlines the Super Bowl halftime show before 2030 — and launches a new album in conjunction with the performance — my money's on them. 


Gil Kaufman: If they were inclined to do so, the reunited Oasis could smash the charts in a massive way with their first album in nearly two decades, given the rabid response to their hell-froze-over comeback.

	











Jason Lipshutz: If My Chemical Romance ever decides to pair a stadium tour with its first new album in over a decade, watch out — the commercial returns will be astronomical. We've got four years and change left of the 2020s. Let's make it happen, boys.


Andrew Unterberger: Sleep Token is already pretty close — give the band another album or two and 200,000 may very well be within striking distance. 


Christine Werthman: I think Sombr has big potential for big numbers. He gets my vote.

The comedian and podcast host also says he was booted from a warm-up gig in Dubai after mixing it up with Abu Dhabi — and reveals how much money he lost.

	Dave Brooks



Tim Dillon will not be traveling to the Riyadh Comedy Festival next month. The California comedian and host of The Tim Dillon Show podcast says he was fired from the Oct. 8 Saudi Arabia festival for comments he made about the country on Joe Rogan‘s podcast.


	Besides losing a $375,000 payday (an amount Dillon confirmed to Rogan), he also lost a nearby warm-up gig in Dubai two nights before his Riyadh appearance after mixing up the Arab emirate with Abu Dhabi  (the rival cities are both part of the United Arab Emirates).


	“I mixed them up — apparently this is a big deal over there. This is a real problem,” he said on a recent episode of his podcast. “This is not a malicious slander. It's a mistake.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The Riyadh Comedy Festival — which mostly takes place at the Bakr Al-Sheddi Theatre and ANB Arena from Sept. 25 to Oct. 9, features a number of top tier comedians including Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, Gabriel Iglesias, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, Jeff Ross, Chris Distefano, Tom Segura, Jo Koy, Sam Morril, Hannibal Buress, Andrew Schultz, Sebastian Maniscalco, Whitney Cummings, Jimmy Carr, Louis CK, Pete Davidson, Russell Peters and Chris Tucker.


	“Supposedly, MBS is a fan of mine,” Dillon said two weeks ago on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, referring to Saudi head of state Mohammed Bin Salman.


	Dillon was reportedly fired from the festival for claiming that Saudi Arabia relies on slave labor — a controversial take on the country's foreign laborers laws that some groups, including Human Rights Watch, have criticized as “slavery-like.” Legally, slavery was abolished in the Kingdom in the 1960s.


	Dillon said the slavery jokes were a misunderstanding with his Saudi hosts, saying on his podcast, “I was defending them for having slaves. I literally said, ‘Slaves are hard workers and for the most part agreeable.' But they didn't like that.”


	“You can literally support somebody too much,” he added. “In life, this happens. Too many compliments; too much support — and then they turn on you.”


	He clarified his comments further, noting, “If i was a slave — not that I want to be one, but if I was and I built this really nice thing, I might say to my slave children, ‘Daddy built that,'” concluding, “Apparently this got to the people in Saudi Arabia and they were unhappy about it.”


	The Riyadh Comedy Festival opens Sept. 25 with performances by Burr, Maz Jobrani and Andrew Santino and Bobby Lee from the Bad Friends podcast. More here.

For artists who rely on talk shows' promotional power, Colbert's cancellation and Disney's decision to briefly pull Kimmel are potentially troubling indicators of things to come.

For five days, singer Piya Malik believed her dance-pop trio Say She She was one of the final bands to perform on Jimmy Kimmel Live! So she was “elated” when Walt Disney-owned ABC, in a reversal Monday (Sept. 22), announced it would restore the long-running show to the air. “It's a small win that we all needed right now,” says Malik, whose late-night debut was Sept. 10, a week before ABC suspended Kimmel and his show. “When we act together, we can protect free expression and hold these monopolies to account.”

Jimmy Kimmel Live! won't return to full TV strength tonight: Nexstar, which operates 32 ABC affiliates, and Sinclair, which controls another 38 ABC stations, will broadcast news shows instead. And for artists who rely on late-night shows for promotional power, the whiplash of losing, then regaining, Kimmel speaks to the fragility of the medium. “There are fewer platforms on TV that matter and that can move the needle,” says veteran record exec Steve Greenberg, manager of AJR, a pop trio that performed on Kimmel in July. “The few that exist are really important, and it'd be a shame to lose any.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The most immediate reason for this fragility is that some late-night stars, namely Kimmel, Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers, are fiercely critical of the Trump Administration — and the president and some U.S. officials have responded by threatening to cancel them from the airwaves. The Kimmel brouhaha began when FCC chairman Brendan Carr criticized the host last week for his remarks about slain right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. “We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said. Shortly afterwards, Walt Disney, which owns ABC, pulled Kimmel's show from production. It was an echo of CBS's move in July, when it announced The Late Show with Stephen Colbert would be canceled in May 2026, a decision unlikely to be reversed.


	But late-night talk shows are in trouble for reasons beyond politics: After CBS's Colbert announcement, The Wall Street Journal reported the show loses $40 million annually, and TV ad spending for the ABC, CBS and NBC late-night shows declined from $439 million in 2018 to $221 million last year. And while each series has a massive social media following, star-making events like Future Islands performing on a single late-night show, Late Show with David Letterman, in 2014 are rare in today's TV landscape. Earlier this year, Elton John and Brandi Carlile's album Who Believes In Angels? debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 only after the duo made the rounds to several morning and late-night shows. “People are not watching television at the rate people are watching YouTube, Instagram and TikTok,” says Adrian L. Miller, an artist manager who is working with singer Charlie Bereal and label Death Row Records. “Discovery starts on your phone now.”


	Last year, a Chartmetric analysis of 458 artist appearances on prominent TV shows, from Kimmel and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to Ellen and Saturday Night Live, showed that featured artists' monthly Spotify streams increased just 1.78% after their respective performances. A few prominent ones, like Bartees Strange on Kimmel in 2022, prompted greater increases, but 192 artists' streaming activity actually decreased afterwards.


	For Ken Casey — frontman of Dropkick Murphys and an outspoken Trump critic who calls the president “a little crybaby who can't take some criticism, so he has to get the shows canceled” — the Kimmel issue is about the future of the First Amendment and nothing else. “It's hard for me to even think about what's lost for a band's opportunities to perform — that seems so minuscule compared to the larger issue at hand, which is free speech.” But Casey, whose band appeared on Kimmel in 2004, acknowledges the dwindling talk show platform for musicians. “Yes, those opportunities have become fewer and farther between, even before politics,” he says. “Now they're even fewer. I feel like music always finds a way. The message always finds a way.”


	If late-night talk shows are heading for extinction — whether for the disturbing reason of presidents pressuring networks to shut off contrary voices, or the more mundane reason of audiences and advertising dollars drifting to streaming and social media — artists will lose more than performances before large TV audiences. Late-night shows have a history of taking chances on new artists, breaking once-unknown bands like Phoenix on Saturday Night Live in 2009 and Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2015. Today, artists like AJR use late-night appearances as one segment of a broader marketing campaign, sharing the official clips on social media and cutting them into pieces for TikTok.


	“That certainly helped us a lot,” says Greenberg, also founder and CEO of indie label S-Curve. “Fans are pulling the performance and posting their own favorites on social media as well.” 


	Major late-night shows also give artists professionally-produced, well-lit, immaculately-recorded clips they frequently can't achieve elsewhere, including on their own tours. “You can do 250 shows a year and play for 5,000 [fans] a night and grind it out. When you play one of these [late night] shows and reach I-don't-know-how-many millions of viewers they have, it really hits the marker,” says David Shaw, the Revivalists' frontman, who performed on Kimmel in 2017 and calls ABC's initial cancellation “troubling.” “I don't even think we should be talking about losing these shows. We've got to make it not happen. If we even speak it into existence, it adds fuel.”

""Charlie"" also reaches the top 10 on Hot Rap Songs.


													By
												

	Trevor Anderson



Tom MacDonald's “Charlie,” a tribute anthem to the late Charlie Kirk, climbs to No. 1 on Billboard's Digital Song Sales chart (dated Sept. 27) after its first full tracking week.


	The song, released Thursday, Sept. 11, debuted at No. 2 a week earlier with 7,000 downloads sold in the last hours of that Friday-Thursday tracking week, according to Luminate. “Charlie” then sold 18,000 Sept. 12-18 for its coronation.


	The cut, which MacDonald issued on his eponymous independent label, was released following Kirk's assassination, at age 31, on Sept. 10 during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The killing and its aftermath dominated news headlines and social media conversation in the ensuing days amid discourse surrounding political violence and freedom of speech. President Donald Trump, among other notables, attended and spoke at Kirk's memorial service on Sept. 21 in Glendale, Ariz.

	MacDonald collects his eighth No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, all of which have ruled for one week. He first led with 2021's “Fake Woke” and followed with “Ghost” in 2023; two more leaders in 2024, “You Missed” and “Goodbye Joe,” with Nova Rockafeller; and a chart-leading four champs thus far this year: “Daddy's Home,” with Roseanne Barr, “Man in the Sky,” “The Devil Is a Democrat” and “Charlie.”




	In addition to its sales, “Charlie” registered 4.7 million official streams in the United States in its first full tracking week. The combined sums spark the song's entrance on three multimetric Billboard charts: No. 6 on Hot Rap Songs, No. 12 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and No. 77 on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100. The debut gives the rapper his third entry on the foremost ranking, eighth on the middle list and fifth on the Hot 100.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


Disney will soon be parting ways with the union nurses on its Burbank studio lot in favor of subcontracting, less than a year after negotiating a new contract with IATSE.


	Deadline understands the company first notified IATSE Local 80, which represents studio nurses among others, in July that it would be invoking a provision in the union's Basic Agreement to make the switch to hiring subcontracted nurses through a medical staffing company instead. 


	“Their official reason, to me, verbally, is they want to get out of the business of directly providing medical care to the crew, [because] there's a liability, so they're trying to avoid liability,” Local 80 business manager DeJon Ellis tells Deadline, adding that he does not believe this to be a cost-saving measure for Disney.

					Disney Tells Streaming Customers It Is Raising Prices In Move Planned Prior To Jimmy Kimmel Controversy		
			








	A studio source tells Deadline this decision will only impact the Burbank studio lot, and medical services available to employees will not change. The reasoning, they tell us, is to streamline backend processes, staffing and reporting. A rep for Disney declined to comment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	So far, there is no timeline for when Disney will make the move, though it has already created a bit of a firestorm among local crew. A petition to urge Disney to continue hiring union nurses has gained more than 700 signatures, so far.


	“This, to me, is an assault on unionism and and a weaponization of the language [of the contract],” Ellis insisted. “This is just a principled attack, if you will, in my opinion, on the union workers. It's just one less headache for that [labor relations] department.”


	Ellis also says that the local is planning some coordinated action to protest Disney's decision, including an informational picket to let the public know about its concerns, though nothing is set in stone quite yet. Much of that will likely be dependent on the timeline for the transition.


	IATSE's Basic Agreement with the Hollywood studios only prohibits subcontracting work “which has not heretofore been subcontracted in the multi-employer bargaining unit,” which opens the door for Disney to make a move like this. Studio nurses were previously subcontracted at Universal Studios in 1989. 

	











	This line in the contract was a source of great contention during last year's bargaining cycle between IATSE and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Ellis says, adding that leadership spent “hours” trying to get the provision removed altogether.


	“We aggressively went after this,” he said. “We held on to it very deep into the negotiations, trying to get rid of it and then pivoting to putting extra guardrails around this…because what's the benefit of having a contract if you're going to just be able to subcontract our work?”


	The guardrails in the current contract require the signatory studios to notify IATSE in writing of any intention to subcontract work.


	Disney's Burbank studio lot has employed union nurses for 85 years. In fact, Walt Disney himself famously tapped one of the lot's union nurses, Hazel George, to tend to him personally after a neck injury sustained in a polo accident. She would go on to become one of Walt Disney's most trusted confidantes and, in 1952, she is said to have helped him shore up money from studio employees as a show of support for his ambitious theme park plans that would eventually become Disneyland. She eventually became a songwriter for Disney, as well, before returning to be Walt Disney's personal caretaker until his death in 1966.


	Local 80 represents motion picture grips, crafts service, marine, first aid employees and warehouse workers based in and around Hollywood. Studio lot nurses typically provide immediate care to cast, crew, executives and other employees as well as monitor health and wellness protocols on set.

Kudos to the Disney crisis management team: they're playing a public relations blinder this week.

I don't think they can be saved.

The guardrails in the current contract require the signatory studios to notify IATSE in writing of any intention to subcontract work.

…to be a fly on the wall when this solution was suggested and accepted.

	And now, some news from the Department of Awkward Timing: With the Jimmy Kimmel controversy swirling, word has emerged that Disney is raising the price of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ next month.


	Subscribers started being notified on Tuesday that as of October 21, a subscription to Disney+ will go up two dollars a month, to $11.99. Various bundles, with and without ads, are rising for combinations of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+. (A full rundown of pricing as of now and as of October 21 can be found HERE.)


	The hikes are the fourth in four years by Disney, which is far from the only company raising prices in streaming. Across the industry, companies are continuing to lift costs for consumers, with media companies operating linear networks feeling pressure on that side due to cord-cutting.

	After ABC and Disney suspended Kimmel's late-night show indefinitely last week, backlash built against Disney+, with a number of social media posts and celebrity testimonials pointing to canceled subscriptions. It is difficult to know exactly how many subscribers were lost in the short term, and price hikes also often cause churn as subscribers resist the new pricing, though over the longer haul the revenue gain makes it worth it for streaming service operators.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Disney CFO Hugh Johnston addressed the company's outlook on streaming prices during a quarterly earnings call with Wall Street analysts last November. The rate of inflation and the rising cost of a number of consumer goods has weighed on the economy and played a key role in the 2024 presidential election.

	











	“We certainly look to continue to increase pricing in line with the value that we're providing to consumers,” Johnston said. “And a lot of the growth that we're seeing right now is because of the exceptional content that's coming out of both the movie and the TV studios that's obviously our proprietary content. So, that'll certainly enable us to increase pricing over time.”

This timing is pretty great. The only thing that could be better would be if it could have a negative impact on Sinclair and Nexstar.

Cancel disney+…
Stay strong Jimmy K…

Maybe if you renew Doctor Who. If not forget it.

I, uh, I probably would have waited a week or two on this one.

Wow, what an epic fail. They should've held on this. Not gonna get people back this way.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


	“Is there a question?” a weary Dr. Phil McGraw asked a lawyer for Trinity Broadcasting Network. McGraw was on the witness stand today in the battle over a $500 million distribution deal between the TV shrink and the Christian TV network.


	“No question,” Dr. Phil said under his breath, answering his own query in a dispute that has become its own level of legal Hell.


	Amidst gentle reprimands from the judge over how “Yes” or “No” questions work, bickering attorneys, a “trial mantra,” verbal salvos and short fuses, a frequently irritated McGraw Tuesday testified in federal court in Texas on the potential Chapter 11 and various lawsuits surrounding his much hyped and now-diminished Merit Street Media.

	











	It did not go smoothly, to put it mildly. Or, as Dr. Phil suggested at one point, “if we are going to open that can, let's eat the whole thing.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're here because they ignored the fact that the time that it takes for a startup network to get to a point of fruition, and turnaround is four to five years, and they were explained this from the jump,” a bellicose McGraw told Judge Scott W. Everet's courtroom. 


	McGraw went on to describe how the legal squirmish started and the “toxic” relationship — as previously described, between TBN (the “they” here) and MSM — that quickly developed last year with the launch of the latter. “We discussed it on numerous occasions, and they just didn't stay the course long enough for it to get to that point. This was a four-to-five year journey, and if they had just stayed in long enough, I think this would have been the best investment they had ever made.”


	Over and over Tuesday, the 75-year-old Dr. Phil shifted the vast bulk of the blame for the TBN/MSM deal crashing in a matter of months on the Christian broadcaster. “I had as much control as I could have,” he insisted to the court of his role in the fate of the digital endeavor.


	“It was so much fun,” the onetime CBS talk show host muttered, with obvious sarcasm, of all the time he spent with attorneys and accountants in the past year as various schemes were discussed on how to dismantle the TBN deal. A deal that Dr. Phil acknowledges saw TBN make “significant capital contributions” along the way.

	











	Having recently launched a new company Envoy out of the remains of MSM, Peteski Productions owner McGraw moved in July to put MSM in bankruptcy and suing TBN for breach of contract. With a summary judgement hearing looming for later this year, the Matthew Crouch run faith-based company countersued in August, accusing Dr. Phil of “reprehensible conduct,” trying to play them for millions and tying to pull a fast one to get out of the deal.


	Earlier this week, Crouch took to the stand and told the court that Dr. Phil and Merit Street Media were a bust for TBN and never made them any serious money. With notions of a settlement once floated, and debtor loan plans of around $10 million in the mix to make sure lawyers are paid, the lawsuits seemed to have turned into a very un-Christian grudge match.


	The hearing is in recess right now, with lawyers for the TKO Group Holdings-owned Professional Bull Riders set to question the witness for “an hour, maybe more” this afternoon. As he was during the TBN questioning, Peteski (and long time Oprah) lawyer Charles Babcock is in court and raising objections for his client.


	Earlier Tuesday, Dr. Phil walked slowly out of the witness box after the Judge broke for lunch. Having had knee surgery a while back, the 6′ 3″ McGraw appeared to have an issue with his chair being too low. Several members of his team came over to help, trying to adjust the rest and eventually rolling a new chair over for the rest of the day's testimony — which seemed to at least go fine on that level.

This is just about pure greed of people in the end, whether you want to put a Christian label on it or not.

“I think this would have been the best investment they had ever made.”

Oh he THINKS so? Huh. Well there you go. Case closed. Next!

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Emma Watson found film promo ""soul-destroying""","https://www.avclub.com/emma-watson-film-promo-soul-destroying","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:48:00 GMT","

Emma Watson hasn't been in a movie since 2019's Little Women, but she's also “maybe the happiest and healthiest I've ever been.” The Harry Potter actor shared that warm update with Hollywood Authentic in a conversation that delved into her complicated relationship with the craft that put her name in lights before she was even a teenager. “I think what's interesting about being an actor is, there's a tendency to sort of fracture yourself into multiple personalities. I'm not just talking about the roles you play, but having the weight of a public persona, that sort of needs constant feeding and sprucing and glamorising. It's very energy-intensive stuff,” she explained. “And shedding the multiple identities has freed up so much space, I think, for me to be a better sister, daughter, friend, granddaughter, and then artist. And someone who's trying to do some critical thinking of her own.”

Another thing Watson has been glad to leave behind is the hard work of promoting a film. “I do not miss selling things,” she said. “I found that to be quite soul-destroying.” That doesn't mean she doesn't miss the craft itself, however; she just found that “the balance of that can get quite thrown off.” “I do very much miss using my skill-set, and I very much miss the art,” she continued. “I just found I got to do so little of the bit that I actually enjoyed.”

For Watson, acting was an escape. “[T]he minute the camera rolls, and getting to just completely forget about everything else in the world other than that one moment—it's such an intense form of meditation,” she shared. “Because you just cannot be anywhere else. It's so freeing. I miss that profoundly. But I don't miss the pressure. I forgot it was a lot of pressure. I did a small thing for a play, just with my friends. I was like, ‘Bloody hell, this is stressful!' And that wasn't even for a real public audience or anything. I don't miss that.”

Despite her career pivot, Watson is still “working really hard” on other things. She's studying for a DPhil in creative writing at Oxford, runs a sustainable gin brand called Renais with her brother, and advocates for women's rights, environmental justice, and more. She also has something cooking “that I've never done before,” but she didn't want to share what that was “because then people are like, ‘Well, when is it happening? What's going on with this thing?'” Whatever it is, we'll learn it on her timeline. “Oddly, somehow, the less I try to do, the more I get done,” she said. “I don't know how I would shape the distinction between effort and trying. Or maybe what I would say is: I'm caring, and I'm present.” That's what really matters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Paper's Esmeralda Grand is a lot. Is she too much?","https://www.avclub.com/is-esmeralda-grand-the-paper-character-too-much","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

“I react strongly to everything,” Esmeralda Grand (Sabrina Impacciatore) declares in The Paper‘s delightful fifth episode. It's a brief moment of self-awareness in the middle of her denial about being tricked online by someone who looks exactly like Lost‘s Josh Holloway. “Scam Alert!” finally reveals a more vulnerable side to Esmeralda because, halfway through season one, Toledo Truth Teller‘s managing editor has proven herself to be a funny but overbearing drama queen. If the documentary crew's camera isn't pointed at Esmeralda, she finds ways both infuriating and entertaining to steal the spotlight, particularly through the relentless attempts to embarrass and take down the new editor-in-chief, Ned Sampson (Domhnall Gleeson), so she can get his job and keep publishing clickbait to TTT Online. (Her favorite post by far is the lengthy article about how much Ben Affleck tipped his limo driver.) 

At first glance, her traits harken back to those of various employees of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, from the rude Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) to the boastful Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) to the self-obsessed Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling). As a foil for Ned and the newsroom, Esmeralda borrows from Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) playbook and, in classic Michael Scott (Steve Carell) fashion, she tends to disrupt the workday with personal problems, like bringing her pre-teen son in to help him out with an audition for a commercial. Series co-creators Greg Daniels and Michael Koman tip their hats to the previous NBC hit while dialing up her antics. Over 10 episodes, her loud personality becomes a litmus test for how much abrasiveness the audience can actually tolerate from her. Esmeralda Grand will likely make or break The Paper for most people. 

Esmeralda's arc is intentionally crafted to challenge an earnest Ned, who hopes to train volunteer reporters, chase after meaningful stories, and revive Truth Teller‘s reputation. It's a noble crusade that could work—if only Esmeralda would let him “save journalism” in peace. In the process of fighting him, she emerges as both an antihero and a one-liner delivery machine. (“Ned accuses me of sensationalizing stories,”she tells the camera. “Since when is sensation a bad thing? Ask a box of condoms.”) At every step, she threatens to spoil his plans: messing with Ned's first print issue, lying to him about his love interest (Chelsea Frei's Mare Pritti), and making him miss important meetings. She even finds a co-conspirator in bumbling corporate lackey Ken Davies (The Ballad Of Wallis Island‘s Tim Key). The question “Why in the world hasn't she been fired yet?” comes to mind often while watching The Paper. 

Since she's initially painted in broad strokes, it's easy to write off Esmeralda as a problematic figure who gets on everybody's nerves. This attention-seeking, crafty, and hilarious archetype is a staple in a lot of workplace sitcoms. Just look at Abbott Elementary‘s Ava Coleman (Janelle James), Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti), 30 Rock‘s Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), Parks And Recreation‘s Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), or Superstore‘s Dina Fox (Lauren Ash), to name a few. But with time, their narcissistic tendencies softened to make room for emotionally complex development without losing the humor. Thankfully, much like The Office pulled off with Michael and Dwight, The Paper‘s writers start to deepen Esmeralda already while maintaining her specific brand of jokes. 



A single mother and outcast, she wants to fit in and bond with her colleagues, as seen in “Churnalism,” when she begrudgingly teams up with Mare to investigate why a local park bathroom was shut down and actually does a decent job. Even her increasingly jarring attempts to get her kid cast in the Softees commercial come from a good place, with “Church And State” establishing the close bond between mother and son after he refuses to take advice from Oscar (The Office‘s Oscar Nuñez). To contrast those signs of improvement, she incessantly bullies co-workers like Nicole (Ramona Young), spitefully cancels subscriptions to wire services that help the newspaper, and gleefully tries to one-up everybody at the Ohio Journalism Awards in the season finale. 

Impacciatore seems to be having a blast bringing Esmeralda's extreme behaviors to life. After a quietly intense, Emmy-nominated performance in The White Lotus‘ second season, she revels in this chaotic role. The actor crafts a fairly distinct character, nailing everything from her amusing malapropisms to overt expressions, standing out amid the rest of the ensemble's more relatively grounded work. She believably sells that Esmeralda doesn't want to give up her position of power for the greater good, which makes it easy to start rooting for her to change her tune. If its predecessor is any indication, The Paper likely will aim to make that change next. Until then, you can relive the glory of her impromptu song during the awards' “in memoriam” segment, which had lyrics like “Sad dead journalist / You made your final deadline / You are gone.” They'll either leave you clutching your stomach or detesting her guts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","EXCLUSIVE PHOTOS: James Van Der Beek's Emotional Video Message After Missing ‘Dawson's Creek' Reunion","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/james-van-der-beek-dawsons-creek-reunion-video/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 00:57:46 GMT","

The “Dawson's Creek” reunion brought fans to their feet at Broadway's Richard Rodgers Theatre on Monday, September 22, as Michelle Williams, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson, and more original cast members reunited to revisit the iconic teen drama. Cheers filled the theater as Williams, 45, Holmes, 46, and Jackson, 47, slipped back into their beloved roles of Jen, Joey, and Pacey for a live reading of the show's pilot.

While DWTS alum and beloved cast member James Van Der Beek was unable to attend due to illness, his presence still resonated in the room when organizers played a touching video message he had recorded for fans and castmates.

“I can't believe I'm not there,” Van Der Beek, 48, said in the clip. “I can't believe I don't get to hug my cast mates, my beautiful cast in person, and I just wanted to stand on that stage and thank every single person in this theater for being here tonight. From the cast to the crew to everybody who donated their time and has been so generous. And especially every single last one of you. You're the best fans in the world. Thank you for coming.”

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

He then teased the surprise of the night — a very special “understudy” stepping in to play Dawson Leery.

A post shared by James Van Der Beek (@vanderjames)

“Now, obviously on Dawson's Creek, I had an understudy. But this is Broadway,” Van Der Beek joked. He introduced Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda as the one filling in, sparking thunderous applause from the audience.

“But I DO have an understudy. A ridiculously overqualified replacement who would have been #1 on my wishlist (had I ever dreamed he'd be available). Someone my kids would definitely consider an upgrade over me,” Van Der Beek later wrote on Instagram.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

People shared a video that confirmed that although Van Der Beek was grounded in Austin, his wife, Kimberly, made sure he felt included by filming the excited fans waiting outside the theater and sharing the moments with him. Kimberly also confirmed on social media that she attended the reunion with their six children — Olivia, Joshua, Annabel, Emilia, Gwendolyn, and Jeremiah.

On stage, Williams, Holmes, and Jackson were joined by castmates Mary Beth Peil, John Wesley Shipp, Mary-Margaret Humes, Nina Repeta, Kerr Smith, Meredith Monroe, and Busy Philipps. The night doubled as a fundraiser for F Cancer, turning the reunion into both a heartfelt tribute to Van Der Beek and a meaningful celebration for fans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","David Letterman Opens Up About His Wife's Ménière's Disease","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/david-letterman-wife-menieres-disease-update/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:32:06 GMT","

David Letterman shared a rare personal revelation at The Atlantic Festival on Thursday, opening up about his wife of 16 years, Regina Lasko. The legendary late-night host revealed that Lasko has been battling Ménière's disease. This chronic inner ear disorder can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus — a health challenge that briefly pulled him away from one of his dreams.

“She's okay now, she's stabilized,” Letterman said, before joking, “But geez, I resented that.” The late-night legend admitted that her health scare kept him from joining two of his close friends on a movie set.

The 78-year-old explained that when he learned his pal Richard Ayoade was cast in Wes Anderson's new ensemble “The Phoenician Scheme” alongside Bill Murray, he couldn't resist asking Murray to get him in. “I said to Bill, ‘Can you talk to your buddy Wes, and get me in the movie?'” Letterman recalled. “I don't want lines, I don't want a dressing room. I just wanted to be that guy people look at and go, ‘Who is that?'”

Letterman admitted he dreamed of standing on set with both Ayoade and Murray. “In my dreams — me, Bill Murray, and Richard Ayoade — how can that not be a moment for the rest of your life?” he joked, noting that “this is how I get work these days.”

Although Letterman didn't make the final cut of Anderson's 12th feature, the comic crime caper featured an impressive cast, including Murray, Ayoade, Benicio del Toro, Bryan Cranston, Scarlett Johansson, Willem Dafoe, and Riz Ahmed.

Letterman, of course, is no stranger to cameos himself. Beyond his decades on The Late Show, he has appeared in everything from “Murphy Brown” and “The Nanny” to Seinfeld and the 1979 TV film “Fast Times.”

Letterman first met Regina Lasko in the 1980s, but the couple didn't rush down the aisle. They dated for more than 20 years before finally tying the knot in 2009.

“I had avoided getting married pretty good for, like, 23 years, and I — honestly, whether this happened or not — I secretly felt that men who were married admired me … like I was the last of the real gunslingers,” Letterman once joked on the Late Show, per Reuters. 

Before Lasko, the host had been married to his college sweetheart, Michelle Cook. Over the decades, Letterman and Lasko have shared major milestones. They welcomed their only child, son Harry, in 2003, wed in a surprise courthouse ceremony in 2009, and later celebrated the conclusion of Letterman's 22-season run on The Late Show in 2015.

Phaedra Parks is back on the market and she isn't shy about putting herself out there. The “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star sparked buzz at Page Six's inaugural “Virtual Reali-Tea” Awards when she revealed her interest in a younger reality star — and hinted at burying a long-running feud with one of her castmates.

At the New York City ceremony, co-hosts Danny Murphy and Evan Real teased Parks about her red carpet behavior at the 2025 Primetime Emmys.

“I kind of love that you treated the red carpet almost as a dating app,” Murphy said, to which Parks, 51, laughed, “I did.”

The crowd cheered when Real called out her flirty exchanges. “Did y'all see Phaedra getting flirty? Jason Isaacs, Harry Jowsey, Walton Goggins,” he joked.

Parks quickly singled out Jowsey, saying, “Harry Jowsey, make that happen. He is so cute.”

The attorney and former “Married to Medicine” star revealed she told the “Too Hot to Handle” and DWTS alum, 28, not to “count a cougar out.” Jowsey's cheeky reply? “I don't.”

#PhaedraParks and #HarryJowsey are the dynamic duo we didn't know we needed

Parks, who won the Made to Shade award at the event, leaned into the moment with a joke about her financial standing. “I said, ‘I got good credit. I'm very wealthy,'” she quipped.

Parks was previously married to Apollo Nida from 2009 to 2017. The couple split after Nida was sentenced to eight years in prison for fraud charges. The exes continue to co-parent their sons, Ayden, 15, and Dylan, 12. Since then, Parks has been linked to Medina Islam and radio host Tone Kapone, while Jowsey has famously dated Francesca Farago, Jessica Vestal, and actress Lucy Hale.

The Bravo star's night wasn't all about flirty fun. Parks also hinted that her feud with Angela Oakley, which dominated “Real Housewives of Atlanta” season 16, may finally be cooling down.

Oakley accused Parks of orchestrating cheating rumors about her husband, Charles Oakley, through a man named Marcus. At the reunion, Oakley doubled down on the claim, saying, “First and foremost, he told me it was Phaedra. Everything you said about me was a lie.” Parks fired back, “I have not said anything about you, darling, because no one knew about you.”

The two failed to resolve their differences at the reunion, but Oakley has since suggested she's open to reconciliation.

Now, Parks says they're in “a different place.” She told Page Six she believes Oakley's attacks stemmed from her status on the show.

“I think people sometimes come on the show and [they] just come for people at the top,” Parks explained. “The cream rises to the top, so you have to aim for the stars.”

Phaedra Parks will return in season 17 of RHOA, premiering on Bravo in 2026.

The anxiety around the political and cultural reaction to the killing of Charlie Kirk is so high that we could see more media companies on edge about how audiences react to their content. “The Savant,” a limited series starring Jessica Chastain originally set to premiere this Friday on Apple TV+, will be postponed, a rep for Apple TV+ told IndieWire.

While no specific reason was given, nor was any new release date announced, it's believed that current events contributed to the delay.

“After careful consideration, we have made the decision to postpone ‘The Savant.' We appreciate your understanding and look forward to releasing the series at a future date,” Apple TV+ said in a statement.

“The Savant” stars Chastain as a woman who infiltrates online extremist groups in an attempt to discover mass shootings and extremist acts of terrorism before they happen. The series was created by Melissa James Gibson and was inspired by a 2019 article in Cosmopolitan, “Is It Possible to Stop a Mass Shooting Before It Happens?” 

 










The first trailer for the series, which you can watch below, shows her engaging online with extremists, attempting to think like them and expose their actions before reporting them to the authorities. It shows a series of “snipers, bombings, ambushes” — with Chastain specifically trying to bring down someone who wants to make an imprint on history with the type of event people refer to “with a month and a date.” It's also a show that grapples with Chastain's moral dilemma of wondering if it's right to be engaging with such people, even if it's in the name of a greater good.

“The Savant” would not be the first time a show or an episode was delayed in order to provide some breathing room from real-life tragedies. But the fervor over “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” being pre-empted last week (it comes back on air tonight) is likely just the first example of media companies in this very moment looking closely at what's being said and represented on their screens as showrunners reach for the headlines with politically relevant commentary and entertainment.

Earlier this month, we received some troubling news that Jordan Peele‘s fourth feature film, previously scheduled for release in October 2026, had been removed from the calendar. 

Variety reported the guild strikes had something to do with it when it was first dated for Christmas 2024, and though Peele suggested he knew exactly what he had in mind for his next movie, he's still at work on the project and has yet to roll cameras.

So what has Peele been up to? Beyond the release of the football-themed horror movie “Him” that Peele produced, we got a taste of another secretive horror project on Tuesday with an unlikely collaborator: Hideo Kojima.

Kojima is the creator of the classic “Metal Gear Solid” franchise, but also the “Death Stranding” games that IndieWire has been big fans of for their striking cinematic qualities. His new project, in which he collaborated with Peele, is “OD,” and the game's first teaser shares just one terrifying scene from the first-person point of view. The game stars Sophia Lillis, Udo Kier, and Hunter Schafer, and we're even curious if that's the cast for Peele's next film.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The teaser, below, is pretty creepy. It shows a playable sequence in which the protagonist, via a first-person perspective, is given a red card with instructions through a door, then proceeds to a shrine of candles that the player must light one by one, with each creating screams and loud knocks at a door as you proceed. We then cut to a close-up of Lillis as a giant, dark figure approaches her and clutches her face in monstrous gray hands.

Unfortunately, it's hard to know how much, if any, of Peele's specific fingerprints are on this particular teaser. The trailer doesn't have his name anywhere, and Kojima, in a livestream announcing this project, said that “there's a different kind of fear Jordan will do; mine is the fear of the knock. I'm really afraid of the knock sound!” It suggests that Peele's contribution might be for an entirely different chapter of the game.

Regardless, the Kojima-Peele collab is an exciting one. Some of the commenters on the trailer alluded to a game like the universally acclaimed “Elden Ring,” which George R. R. Martin co-wrote and is now itself being adapted into a movie. Peele was also at one point rumored to be directing a film adaptation of “Death Stranding,” but “Pig” and “A Quiet Place: Day One” filmmaker Michael Sarnoski will handle that instead.

 










The other, more astute comparison might be to another game Kojima co-produced with legendary horror director Guillermo del Toro. The game was called “P.T.,” and it was meant to be a “playable teaser” (P.T.) for a new installment in the “Silent Hill” video game franchise. Released in 2014 for free on PlayStation 4, the brief game drew significant acclaim, but when the planned franchise was canceled, distributor Konami famously removed the game from the PlayStation Store and made it impossible to reinstall.

For that reason, commenters on the trailer for “OD” joked that the title actually translates to “Only Demo.” 

Check out the teaser for “OD – Knock” below.

Last Sunday, I found myself inside YouTube's suite above the 50-yard line at Levi's Stadium in San Jose. (The 49ers won against the Cardinals, but no one is reading this for the sports.) YouTube CEO Neal Mohan had gathered some of his platform's biggest creators, along with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodall, to celebrate YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket partnership.

I wasn't there to cheer for football rights. I wanted to know more about the parallel studio system that's connecting creators, platforms, and audiences. It moves faster, costs less, and connects more directly than Hollywood while serving an audience at a scale no studio or streamer can match. But what does that mean in practice?

 








Related Stories What Hollywood Really Wants: The Audience You Already Built Inside the Unconventional Format of ‘Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake),' One of This Year's Best Filmmaking Debuts 

Here's my theory: For now, independent filmmakers and content creators operate in parallel universes. In some respects they're diametrically opposed: Where indies have the auteur theory, influencers study the comments like holy writ. However, Hollywood is watching closely and I think those worlds are beginning to converge.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Over four hours, I managed to pull Dhar Mann, AdamW (aka Adam Waheed), and Mohan away from the deafening suite (rookie observation: NFL games are loud) to hear how they see this future taking shape.

Dhar Mann, who has 26 million subscribers and owns Dhar Mann Studios in Burbank (“the size of two football fields”), specializes in high-drama stories with uplifting messages. Imagine after-school specials as vertical dramas: “Girl KEPT IN ATTIC From EVIL STEPMOM” (860K views in two weeks) or “Kids MAKE FUN OF Boy With AUTISM, They Instantly Regret It” (68M views in 4 years).

For him, this is personal storytelling that stems from memories of his “immigrant upbringing as a 10-year-old wearing a turban in elementary school and feeling like an outcast.” And he tells another personal story.

“I have a friend that's a big Hollywood producer,” he said. “He's like, ‘Dhar, I really want to enter the space.' Hey, that'd be great. Here's what you need to do to succeed. And two months later I see him and he goes, ‘I'm so excited. I'm going to start my own scripted series on YouTube. And I went out to investors, I raised a couple million bucks and I've already written the first 25 episodes.' I was like, ‘I was I so excited about everything until you told me what your plan was.'”

 










Sounds totally practical. It's not.

“YouTube does not operate that way,” Mann said. “If I spent my life savings on one episode, or even 10 episodes, I would've blew my whole life savings because you never succeed on your first time. As soon as you put something out there, you have to look at the community you're building and get real-time feedback. You plan one episode at a time, and once you get feedback then you can iterate.”

Mann's videos have a rapid-fire production schedule and work with less-experienced talent. It looks modest by Hollywood standards, but it's also an aesthetic.

“[Hollywood] can put out much bigger, ambitious projects, but I don't think it takes $100 million to bring an amazing story to life,” he said. “What makes it so relatable is when it feels accessible. So much of our community says they see themselves in our content because it isn't overproduced, it isn't with big-time Hollywood actors. It's with everyday people that look just like us.”

Adam Waheed, best known under his channel name AdamW, has over 20 million subscribers for his comedy shorts that lean into real-world scenarios like overweight luggage or paying for grocery bags. He said relatability drives virality, with the comments section a constant barometer.

 










“The greatest thing about being a content creator is you get feedback in real time,” he said. “You're creating content with your audience rather than for your audience. You can't do that on Netflix or Disney. You get to figure out, ‘What are the things that stuck with people? What did people not like?'”

Waheed describes separating the trolls from the truth-tellers as a dedicated craft, but worth the effort. “It's awesome that you can, in real time, change things,” he said. “Whereas you do a movie, probably takes a year for it to come out, and then you have to listen to X, Y, Z critic give their review about it.”

However, that's what Waheed is about to do. He's prepping his first feature, a romantic comedy set to begin production in Italy and Chicago this fall. Range Media and CAA are handing financing for the $4 million-$5 million budget. And, it will premiere exclusively on YouTube.

“Some people say, ‘You can't release something on YouTube. That's not the business model. You can't make money that way' — until a few people start doing it,” he said. “And then a lot of people start doing it. My prediction is that's going to be the format, and Netflix streamers will be the old format. With or without me, I believe it's going to happen. I'm just excited to be one of the first people to do it.”

 










In theory, Waheed has a built-in audience of 20 million but he estimates a small percentage of his subscribers would be guaranteed to follow him everywhere. (He sets that number around 250,000.) However, he also sees that as the wrong question: Why does he have to go anywhere?

“I don't want to go anywhere else,” he said. “Eventually, I know I will. As I grow, I'm going to have opportunity to do stuff elsewhere. But for now, I mean, in a perfect world, I wouldn't want to leave YouTube.

“I think it's very hard for any streamer to become YouTube and I think it's very easy for YouTube to become any streamer,” Waheed said. “Netflix can't make a social media platform.”

Neal Mohan, who doesn't have a YouTube channel but presides over the platform's over 2.5 billion monthly active users, believes features can be as native to YouTube as its 15-second shorts or 15-hour live streams.

“If you have a creative vision and an idea, then YouTube should be the place to connect with the audience, whatever that format is,” he said.

Mohan cites a deal with Bollywood star Aamir Khan, who released his blockbuster “Sitaare Zameen Par” (Stars on Earth) on YouTube immediately after its theatrical run. Presented in its original Hindi-Turkish format, viewers have a choice of subtitles in 10 languages.

 










“He had the rights, it was his capital upfront. And he literally upended the industry,” Mohan said. “His whole thing was, ‘The ratio of the Indian population to theaters is so not good. I want my project to be seen by as many people as possible. What place to put it other than YouTube?' To me, it was the glimpse of innovation from a distribution standpoint. Will that happen in Hollywood? I don't know. But to me it was a little bit of oh wow, that's interesting. That could be the future.”

Khan makes his money via $6.99 rentals, but Mohan noted he could just as easily use ads, memberships, sponsorships, or commerce integrations.

“You can see here how the brands are engaging with the creators,” he said, referring to the action inside the NFL suite. “And in many cases [creators] may come up with sponsorship ideas. Just like we want to provide multiple creative canvases, we also want to provide multiple different business models for creators.”

Certainly, an idea that would make Christopher Nolan break out in hives; will other filmmakers feel differently? It also means operating in a world where they not only seek out but act on audience response, but Mohan said he believes that's wholly compatible with artistic intent.

“Creators ask me this all the time, ‘What's the path to success on YouTube?” Mohan said. “I can give you a hundred different tactics, but the only thing that really, really matters is true authenticity. It's got to be you. It's got to be your creative vision. It's got to be what you want to say. Yeah, what you hear from your audience is your input, but it's not the thing that's telling you exactly what to do.”

 










If the 20th century belonged to studios and the 21st began with streamers, the next era may belong to creators who operate as both. Hollywood still measures success in opening weekends and festival launches, while creator-led studios measure it in fan engagement and iteration speed. For them, every upload is a premiere, every comment a note, every community a distribution engine. 

At Levi's Stadium, YouTube showed off its football muscle. But the bigger play may be what its creators are building on the platform itself: a new studio system that doesn't move on Hollywood time, but at the speed of culture.

St. Louis emo stalwarts Foxing have announced that they're going on hiatus. “[It] has become clear to us that in our pursuit of our dreams and making the most honest and genuine art we can, our relationship with music, each other, and our sense of self without the band has eroded,” the band wrote in a statement posted to social media.

Foxing will play two farewell shows—one in Chicago and one in St. Louis—in December. See those dates and find the group's full message below.

Foxing was formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2011, by bassist Josh Coll, drummer Jon Hellwig, and guitarist Matthew Piva. The band went through several lineup changes before the 2013 release of debut album The Albatross. By then, Foxing had settled into a five-piece of Coll, Hellwig, vocalist Conor Murphy, and guitarists Ricky Sampson and Eric Hudson. Foxing spent the next couple of years on the road, landing opening slots for fellow emo favorites like the Hotelier and Modern Baseball.

Coll left Foxing between the release of 2015's Dealer and 2018's Nearer My God. Produced by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla, Nearer My God marked the band's leap to anthemic, festival-sized indie-rock. In his review of Nearer My God, Ian Cohen wrote that it “provides the incapacitating rush of watching a broken play develop into a Hail Mary, a half-court buzzer beater, a double steal that actually works—the thrill of its success amplified by palpable risk and an alternate, disastrous outcome that was narrowly avoided.”

After Nearer My God, Foxing released Draw Down the Moon, in 2021, and a 2024 self-titled album.

Foxing:

After 14 years as a band and 12 years of consistent touring, we've decided to take a hiatus from playing shows, writing or doing anything as Foxing.

It feels really scary to say that. This band has been completely inseparable from us as people for our entire adult lives up to this point. It is so much of our identity and our sense of self worth in the world. But it has become clear to us that in our pursuit of our dreams and making the most honest and genuine art we can, our relationship with music, each other, and our sense of self without the band has eroded. We have decided to prioritize these things and need to step away from the band to do so.

These shows in Chicago and St. Louis will be our last for the foreseeable future. Know that if you ever saw us at a show or listened to our records, you were getting the most from us that we could possibly give in that moment. We will come back if/when we feel that we have more to give.

Thank you for everything over the years.

Foxing:

Pulls in Solid Box Office Numbers on Opening Weekend","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kanye-west-documentary-box-office-numbers-opening-weekend-1235433638/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 21:40:24 GMT","

	The box office numbers have arrived for the documentary In Whose Name? from filmmaker Nico Ballesteros, who was granted unvarnished access to Kanye West — now known as just Ye — in the six tumultuous years following his public embrace of conservative politics. The film opened to a limited release, screening at around 494 theaters nationwide. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $776,000, a strong domestic box office performance for a documentary without significant marketing behind it.


	For comparison, the Oscar-winning doc No Other Land logged a cumulative $420,000 a month after opening in January, on its way to earning $2.4 million to date. It's Never Over, the doc about Jeff Buckley, also saw opening numbers in the $420,000 range. Becoming Led Zeppelin, released in February, is 2025's top-earning doc opening to over $2 million, though it screened internationally.    


	Clips from In Whose Name?, including one in which Ye explosively lashes out at Kris Jenner, have been circulating around social media for several days, as the film's unfettered level of access presents a view of Ye that many fans have never seen. The film offers a behind-the-scenes view of some of his most controversial moments in recent years, most notably the aftermath of his White Lives Matter T-shirt and subsequent antisemitic Twitter tirade. 

	











	While In Whose Name? comes short of offering any explanations as to how Ye went from a beloved musical icon to effectively a social pariah, it does provide a clear view into the world of celebrity in our highly digitized and politicized age. The team behind the film hopes to screen it in more theaters in the coming months, as well as make the movie available on streaming platforms. Its strong first-week performance suggests there is, in fact, an audience hoping to decipher the mind of Ye all these years later.

	Back in June, a South African YouTube show about religious prophecies and visions featured an interview with a guest named Joshua Mhlakela. Though later described by viewers as a “pastor,” Mhlakela only said that he was a “simple person” without a church title who had experienced a vision of the biblical end-times.


	“The rapture is upon us, whether you are ready or not,” he said. “God took me to see the future, and then he brought me back.” He recounted meeting Jesus Christ, whom he claimed told him, “I am coming soon.” Mhlakela further revealed that the Christian messiah had given him the date of his return: Sept. 23-24, 2025.


	History is full of countless predictions like this, none of them fulfilled thus far. For whatever reason, some of these have captured the public imagination in a major way. In one famous example, the Baptist lay preacher William Miller declared that by his scriptural calculations, the Second Advent of Christ would occur at some point in 1843 or 1844 — a belief that exploded in popularity across the U.S. as those years drew near. The Millerites, as Miller's followers came to be called, were inevitably dismayed when the window came and went without biblical incident, a collective reaction known as the Great Disappointment.   

	











	But no matter: Judgment Day can always be postponed until tomorrow. And so, Mhlakela's promise of a rapture this week — coinciding with Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year — was seized upon by Christian TikTokers who began to spread the good news to their own followers and friends. “Six days, almost five days till rapture time,” said one such user in a clip posted last week that has been viewed more than 2 million times across social media platforms. “I'm so excited, who else is excited?” She went on to say that it was her birthday, and she was secretly hoping the rapture would have happened early for the occasion.

	Another woman appeared to be concerned that her husband would be left behind as she and other true believers entered the kingdom of God. She shared a TikTok that showed how she was storing preserved foods for him as well as planting a Bible stuffed with cash in his dresser drawers, and even providing an off-the-grid survivalist guide so that he would be able to weather the presumable hellscape of post-rapture Earth. A caption on the video reads, “He doesn't know it yet: But I have been fighting a battle for him.” Other Christian influencers attacked skeptics as they meanwhile speculated on the possibility of Donald Trump being the Antichrist; some shared apocalyptic dreams and alleged “confirmations” of an impending mass ascent into heaven. In one TikTok, posted on Sept. 1, a self-described “rapture watcher” danced happily while holding a calendar, elated that the month of reckoning had finally arrived.

	On rapture eve, a number of the faithful recorded their emotional goodbyes to the material realm. “Jesus please use my account and the remaining videos for YOUR glory and YOUR will,” wrote a TikToker in a caption for one such video. On Tuesday, many more social media users rejoiced. “Today is the day!” shouted one TikToker in a video after releasing a triumphant scream. A few began watching for signs that the rapture had begun, such as a woman filming the sky outside her home in North Carolina shortly after dawn. “I haven't seen anybody floating upwards,” she said. “So maybe it hasn't happened yet.”


	The devout also spent Tuesday trying to pinpoint the exact moment they would be lifted into God's embrace, typically by noting the current time in Israel. Thousands tuned in to a YouTuber's livestream for “The Great Exodus 2025,” featuring a virtual panel of believers, including Mhlakela himself, discussing the end-times. (They took an extended break during the afternoon, with the stream replaced by images of people worshiping, set to bombastic Christian music.) The comments were hopeful, but showed a measure of concern over whether the promised anointment was coming. “We r still in waiting,” read a comment in the chat. “Let's get out of here!!!!!!” wrote another viewer. One commenter advised the rest to “keep the faith until the very end,” because “He is testing us all.” This kind of sentiment was common. “Not over till the trumpet sounds,” counseled a viewer who did not seem too worried that no signs of rapture were forthcoming.

	As the hours ticked by, however, the silence from most prominent rapture influencers grew more noticeable, and the comments on their earlier videos filled up with mockery: “See you on Wednesday” was an especially popular reply. Elsewhere, nonbelievers jokingly complained about having to work during the rapture, noted how it curiously fell on Celebrate Bisexuality Day. “What if you're inside when the rapture happens and you get stuck in the corner of the ceiling like a balloon,” asked an X user in a viral post ridiculing the concept. TV and internet personality Desus Nice advised on X that “greeting your rapture believing coworkers on wednesday with ‘goddamn you're still here?' is not appropriate but totally worth the zoom meeting with HR.”

	











	In sum, it's looking like Christians expecting their eternal reward before the weekend are in for the usual Great Disappointment instead. Will they return to their accounts with some kind of convoluted excuse for the canceled event? Almost certainly. Make no mistake, though — they'll set a new date before long. See you in the hereafter.

Kamala Harris returned to The View on Tuesday, Sept. 23, for the first time since she stopped by the show during her presidential campaign last year. That was the day she was asked what she would have done differently than Joe Biden, to which she replied, “There's not a thing that comes to mind.” 


	A few things come to mind now, but Harris has saved most of those notes for the pages of her memoir, 107 Days. On The View, though, she did admit: “I didn't fully appreciate how much people wanted to know there was a difference between me and President Biden.”


	She added that her current relationship with Biden “is based on mutual respect, having been in the trenches together, and admiration.” She added: “It's sincere.”


	Harris' interview on the show came ahead of a scheduled appearance with The View co-host Ana Navarro in support of 107 Days. During The View, Navaro joked that she hoped local residents would join them, “if you haven't been deported yet.” The comment seemed to catch Harris off-guard. “Oh that's awful,” Harris said while laughing. “Maybe or maybe not she'll be moderating.”

	The topic of deportation came up earlier in the conversation, too, when Harris pivoted the focus away from the glaring promises that Donald Trump sold to votes, but failed to fulfill. “Meanwhile, there are certain promises he did keep, which is he was going to weaponize the Department of Justice and go after his political enemies, that he was going to silence critics against him,” she said. “That he was going to fulfill whatever his fragile ego needed through the tool of our federal government.”

	











	Harris added: “They did what they said they were going to do. I heard a story a friend of mine was telling me about a Cuban-American whose partner was being deported to Sudan — and that person was a big Trump supporter.”

Shane and Bradley Plane say they watched in awe as the lights flickered and moved across the sky. (Supplied: Bradley Plane)

Strange lights have been sighted across WA's Midwest, from the coast to hundreds of kilometres inland, prompting widespread unidentified aerial phenomena speculation.

The Mid West Ports Authority has suggested the lights could be caused by ship light refraction.

But Perth Observatory says the sightings extend well beyond the ocean, with reports coming from far inland.

A string of sightings of strange lights in the sky has sparked community chatter across Western Australia's Midwest, with no clear explanation yet for the phenomena.

Father and son Shane and Bradley Plane were driving near Point Moore in Geraldton, 420 kilometres north of Perth, when they spotted three or four lights in the sky.

""We were driving towards the lighthouse and I said to Brad, 'See that star up there? It's not looking right,'"" Mr Plane said.

Bradley Plane said the objects, which they spotted on September 10, appeared to be moving in various formations.

Perth Observatory said it had received multiple reports of lights across a widespread area around the same time and as far inland as the northern Goldfields.

Spokesperson Matt Woods said the spread and number of the sightings was unusual.

""We've had sightings as far east as Laverton, Mount Magnet and Cue, all the way back to the coast,"" he said.

""It's very confusing.""

Mr Woods said he first checked flight radar for aircraft activity but found nothing.

""Is there something being tested? A company trialling drones, or something new being worked on? It will be very interesting to find out what it is,"" he said.

Matt Woods says Perth Observatory has received multiple reports of strange lights from across the Midwest. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)

The Department of Defence has confirmed there were no military training activities in the area on the night of the sightings.

Lights of this kind are known variously as unidentified anomalous phenomena or unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP).

NASA defines the term as the observation of objects or events in the sky, or other domains such as the sea, that cannot be identified or are not known natural phenomena confirmed through scientific method.

Mid West Ports Authority harbour master Heathcliff Pimento believed the cause was atmospheric refraction — a known phenomenon that can make ship or fishing boat lights appear to hover, drift, or vanish.

Heathcliff Pimento says the lights are most likely the refraction of lights from ships. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)

He said such mirages did not appear on radar.

""You'd see the lights but the object itself isn't actually there,"" he said.

Layers of warm and cool air can refract ship lights into the night sky.  (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)

But Matt Woods is not convinced by the explanation.

""It would have to be a very large refraction for the whole Midwest to see it,"" he said.

""Possibly it could be, but it's interesting that it's been reported as far inland as Laverton.

""I'd be very interested to know what it is.""

Last week, I asked, “In what sense is origin of life a scientific question?” I'd been reading an informative paper by Prof. Robert Endres of Imperial College London. He demonstrates the sheer unlikelihood of the spontaneous formation of life from non-life on Earth. He also asks whether intelligent extraterrestrials might have seeded Earth with life:

While the idea of Earth being terraformed by advanced extraterrestrials might violate Occam's razor from within mainstream science, directed panspermia — originally proposed by Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel — remains a speculative but logically open alternative. Ultimately, uncovering physical principles for life's spontaneous emergence remains a grand challenge for biological physics. 

“The unreasonable likelihood of being: origin of life, terraforming, and AI” by Robert G. Endres, 24 July 2025, arXiv. DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2507.18545 July 25, 2025

Yes, genome mapper Francis Crick (1916–2004) and origin of life theorist Leslie Orgel (1927–2007) did propose that in 1973: “In their scenario, an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, facing extinction or perhaps scientific curiosity, dispatches microbial “starter kits” to habitable planets like ours.” 

Is panspermia (life from space) gaining ground?

Mathematician and astronomer Fred Hoyle (1915–2001) considered it plausible that life originated elsewhere in space (whether or not it was delivered here by ET):

In 1977 Hoyle and I argued that the origin of life on Earth must have involved the importation of viable cells from space, thereby challenging another Holy Grail of science, “The Primordial Soup Theory”, for the origins of life. At first this theory, known as “panspermia”, was regarded as heretical, but new evidence from many directions appears be moving towards a vindication of this point of view…

Now, 34 years on, some form of panspermia theory of life's origins appears to be gaining ground.

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Hoyle's work involves the ideas of pathogenic bacteria and viruses arriving from space, and that the evolution of life may be directed from outside. This work has raised fierce hostility in some circles.

Chandra Wickramasinghe, “Sir Fred Hoyle,” SETI League, August 23, 2001

Is panspermia (life from space) gaining ground? It might be more accurate to say that, of twenty terrestrial origin of life theories, none is more persuasive on the evidence. That may account, in part, for the hostility that Wickramasinghe notes. A sense, perhaps, that the life from space theorists must be put down. But, frustratingly, they can't be put down on the evidence.

What makes a question scientific?

In my post last week, I did not say directly whether I thought terrestrial origin of life (OOL) was a scientific question. That's because it depends on where you stand on a prior question: Can OOL be a scientific question even if the answer can never be known?

It's not clear that a terrestrial OOL can ever be determined by scientific means. Time travel is likely impossible. So the best that researchers can do is this:

However, if we accept that the use of the methods of science on a question makes it a scientific one — irrespective of whether we can ever answer the question definitively — then yes, origin of life qualifies.

Now let's look at panspermia: Life from space

As I noted last week, we're allowed to consider that intelligent design may have got life going provided we locate it somewhere between Star Wars and Star Trek. Thus an idea developed by rigorous scientists facing the awful complexity of life's origin shares cultural attention with Marvin the Martian, the Monolith, and the Borg.

Drowning in kitsch and pop culture is cruel and unusual punishment for a thesis. It's also a bit misleading. Some versions of panspermia assume that life originated spontaneously elsewhere in the universe and randomly traveled to Earth on friendly comets or asteroids. That thesis, of course, kicks the problem of how life got started into orbit, which is not friendly to any resolution of the question.

But the thesis that life might have been seeded by intelligent aliens has a genuine advantage over any claims for spontaneous generation three billion years ago: the advantage the future always has over the past. We can never know for sure what happened in the remote past. But future discoveries could, in principle, either strengthen or confirm the life from space claim.

Researchers scan the skies constantly and something could turn up any day. What turns up might be intelligent life. Or even intelligent life that admits, regretfully, that it is the culprit in creating life on Earth, thus kicking off the current chaos…

Okay, that last one is really a stretch. But the future remains more fertile than the past because it hasn't happened yet. So life from space is a scientific question if we stick to scientific reasoning. 

One thing emerges clearly from the life from space approach: Intelligent design is a viable hypothesis for the origin of life.

Supernatural is known for inventive, well-written, and brilliant episodes, and this list proves that even episodes that were technically 'filler' were some of the show's best. Particularly in the first five seasons of Supernatural, there was a very clear story arc involving Sam Winchester, Dean Winchester, Lucifer, and Michael.

Even after the season 5 finale—which was Supernatural's original ending—though, each season had a clearly defined narrative arc. Throughout the show's many seasons, there were always episodes that fell outside that core storyline, be they monster-of-the-week episodes or simply hilarious one-offs. Of all the filler episodes from Supernatural's 15 seasons, these 10 are the best overall.

Season 5 was easily one of the most story-dense seasons of the entire show, because this was what the first four seasons had been building to, narratively. Because of that, there were many episodes in this season that were essential to the overarching plot. However, season 5, episode 9, ""The Real Ghostbusters,"" was not necessarily one of them.

In this episode, Sam and Dean encounter Chuck, the author who has been writing their life story, once again, this time at a Supernatural-themed convention (the Supernatural books, that is). Humorously, this episode sees Sam and Dean needing to team up with another 'Sam and Dean,' who are really cosplayers, to stop some terrifying ghost children from killing convention-goers.

This episode is absolutely one of the best fillers, especially because it was a risk that totally paid off. When this episode debuted in 2009, Supernatural was very new to the convention circuit, and this was the show's first time really poking fun at fans. Thankfully, it came across as affectionate, not mean-spirited, and remains a fan-favorite episode.

Season 2, episode 20, ""What Is And What Should Never Be,"" is one of the Supernatural episodes considered a masterpiece, but it is also technically a filler episode. In this episode, Dean enters an alternate reality in his mind, through the power of a djinn. In this (much more pleasant) reality, he and his family members never became hunters.

Instead, Dean's mother is alive and well, as is Sam's girlfriend, Jessica, who reveals that she and Sam are engaged. Even Dean is married, to a woman named Carmen who doesn't seem to have a real-life equivalent. Although it would be easy for this episode to come off as funny or a bit goofy, it actually packs an emotional punch.

In fact, Dean's realization that he's willing to sacrifice this life he's craved for so long in order to return to the real world and continue the 'family business' of hunting is a profound moment for his character. Although this episode isn't technically essential to the larger story arc of the show, it is nevertheless one of Supernatural's best.

Another season 5 filler episode, ""The Curious Case of Dean Winchester"" takes its name from a short story (and eventually movie) of a similar title, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Just as that story is about a character who ages unconventionally, in ""The Curious Case of Dean Winchester,"" Dean rapidly ages after playing a poker game with a witch.

Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this episode is the performance by Chad Everett, who plays the older Dean Winchester. Somehow, Everett perfectly captures Dean's mannerisms, intonations, and attitude, so much so that it's easy to forget he isn't actually an older Jensen Ackles.

This episode is also a poignant one, as it deals with Bobby's frustrations around aging and his wheelchair. Likewise, one of the characters in the episode is confronting her own feelings about age and immortality, all of which make this episode an affecting one, yet it still manages to have the Supernatural sense of humor and charm.

There are several episodes of Supernatural that deviate significantly from the show's typical style, one of which is season 4, episode 5, ""Monster Movie."" The entire episode is done in black-and-white, and, as the title of the episode suggests, it plays with a number of monster movie tropes, especially those pertaining to vampires.

Given that this was season 4 of 15, this is a relatively early example of Supernatural being willing to play with genre and take certain episodes in an entirely different direction, which was quite a risk at the time, particularly considering this was still network television.

Nevertheless, this episode proves that Supernatural had the ability to create solid episodes in myriad genres and styles, including when those episodes weren't necessarily essential to the larger plot. In fact, ""Monster Movie"" is perhaps the most separate from that larger narrative on this list, yet it is also hailed as one of Supernatural's best episodes.

Supernatural season 3, episode 13, ""Ghostfacers,"" is largely considered one of Supernatural's best episodes. Like ""Monster Movie,"" this episode was a filler as well as a significant departure from the typical style and structure of Supernatural episodes. Once again, that gamble absolutely paid off.

In this episode, the titular 'Ghostfacers' return (after two members of the Ghostfacers, Harry and Ed, were introduced in season 1, although they weren't called Ghostfacers at the time). The team comprises paranormal investigators who are certainly not cut out for the actually dangerous monster hunting that Sam and Dean do.

This becomes apparent (and hilarious) when the Ghostfacers end up working alongside Sam and Dean. Similar to several episodes on this list, ""Ghostfacers"" has an unconventional approach in that it is filmed in a handheld camera/found footage style, no doubt poking a bit of fun at paranormal shows and movies that are similarly filmed.

Clearly, this episode and the characters in it proved rather popular, as the Ghostfacers have multiple returns to the show after this episode, as late as season 9.

Although filler episodes tend to be spaced out in Supernatural seasons, ""Yellow Fever"" actually follows directly on the heels of ""Monster Movie."" In this episode, Dean gets infected with ""ghost sickness,"" a disease that causes him to experience intense fear—so much so that he could literally be scared to death.

The stakes are therefore high, but this ends up being one of Supernatural's funniest episodes, especially because Dean becomes afraid of things like tiny dogs chasing him. This is also the iconic episode in which Jensen Ackles performs ""Eye of the Tiger,"" climbing atop Dean's beloved car, Baby, in the process.

Many of the inclusions on this list take place in season 5 or earlier, which are generally considered Supernatural's best seasons, but season 11, episode 4, ""Baby,"" is an exception. This episode is artistically beautiful, and it centers on one of the most iconic aspects of the show: Dean's Impala, 'Baby.'

The entire episode is shot from within the car, including everything from the boys driving around together to sleeping opposite one another in the seats. ""Baby"" also contains the scene in which Dean does a full J-turn in the car, which audiences especially love because Ackles himself pulled off the stunt.

Despite being a filler and coming much later in the show, this episode is therefore very meaningful, as it highlights both a major part of the show and proves just how stunning the artistry of Supernatural could be.

Season 3, episode 11, ""Mystery Spot,"" is among the most well-known, beloved episodes of Supernatural for a reason. In the episode, Sam is subjected to watching Dean die over and over again, and each time he does, Sam wakes up, stuck in the same day on loop. Try as he might, and no matter what Dean does differently, Dean dies.

Ultimately, this is revealed to be the work of the Trickster, who is often behind the show's funniest episodes. ""Mystery Spot"" certainly is hilarious, and moments from the show, such as Sam's alarm playing ""Heat of the Moment"" every morning only to be followed immediately by Dean saying, ""Rise and shine, Sammy,"" have become favorite moments within the fanbase.

However, ""Mystery Spot"" is also full of emotional moments, and both Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki deliver stellar performances, particularly in light of the fact that this couldn't have been easy to film. (Both actors have in fact spoken about Ackles struggling with the scene in which they have to say the same lines at the same time.)

Yet another unconventional filler episode, season 6, episode 15, ""The French Mistake,"" is a comedic masterpiece of the show. In this episode, Dean and Sam enter a new alternate reality, this one turning them into actors Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki. Both Ackles and Padalecki are therefore acting as characters, who are acting as themselves, who are acting as characters.

As dizzying as that sentence is, having to act in this episode was undoubtedly much more so, yet it's pulled off brilliantly. At no point does the episode feel overdone or goofy. Instead, it's one of the best-acted and funniest episodes of the show, and it stands out as nearly the best of all Supernatural's filler episodes.

Outside the performances, the writers also had plenty of fun bringing actors like Misha Collins and Genevieve Padalecki (who played brunette Ruby) into the story, the latter proving particularly funny because she played Jared Padalecki's wife in the episode, just as she is in real life.

The single best filler episode of Supernatural is season 13, episode 16, ""Scoobynatural."" As the title of the episode suggests, this story sees Sam and Dean jumping into the cartoon show Scooby-Doo. In addition to the impressive animation throughout ""Scoobynatural,"" this episode manages to hit all the tropes from the actual Scooby-Doo show.

All the funnier is the fact that Dean evidently has a latent Scooby-Doo obsession and is thrilled to be in the show. The episode even ends with Dean recreating the iconic ""Scooby-Dooby-Doo!"" line that Scooby typically yells in the real show. Because of these little details and the overall genius of ""Scoobynatural,"" this really is Supernatural's best filler episode.

 By PNN | Updated: September 23, 2025 18:35 IST2025-09-23T18:33:05+5:302025-09-23T18:35:10+5:30

New Delhi [India], September 23:India is a country where public life is larger than life. Our politicians shape destinies, and our Bollywood celebrities shape dreams. Yet behind the glamour of red carpets and the gravity of political speeches lies a truth not many talk about: when leaders and stars face crossroads, they often turn to spiritual guidance.

For centuries, kings, rulers, and cultural icons have sought the wisdom of sages and mediums. In today's modern India, this tradition quietly continues. From actors deciding on scripts to politicians navigating critical decisions, many of them rely on one man—Psychic Medium Daksh.

Revered as the best spirit medium and a trusted akashic reader, Psychic Medium Daksh has become a confidential advisor to high-profile names across India. While the world sees him as a healer and evidential medium, behind closed doors, celebrities and politicians turn to him for clarity, protection, and direction.

This is the story of how famous akashic reader Psychic Medium Daksh became the name whispered in India's elite circles.

At first glance, you might think celebrities and politicians “have it all.” Fame, power, influence, and wealth. But behind the curtains, their lives are filled with uncertainty, pressure, and unseen challenges.

Unlike common people, their risks are magnified. A wrong film can end a career. A wrong move in politics can end decades of work. This is why they seek more than advice—they seek spiritual clarity.

And when it comes to clarity, Psychic Medium Daksh has proven time and again that his insights are not just comforting—they are accurate, transformational, and life-changing.

In a world overflowing with astrologers, tarot readers, and so-called fortune tellers, why do India's top stars and leaders specifically turn to Psychic Medium Daksh?

The answer lies in three things: trust, discretion, and accuracy.

As one Bollywood insider shared (without revealing identity):

“I walked in doubtful. Within minutes, Daksh described events from my life no one knew about. It wasn't guessing—it was spirit communication. That's when I knew this man was the real deal.”

This is why famous psychic reader Psychic Medium Daksh is quietly becoming the go-to guide for those in the spotlight.

Many call themselves spiritual advisors, but what makes Psychic Medium Daksh the best spirit medium in India? The answer lies in his unique methodology and spiritual ethics.

1. No Prior Information

Daksh's clients don't need to share their names, birth details, or problems in advance. He begins readings without context—and yet delivers information so precise that even skeptics are left speechless.

2. No Tools—Only Spirit Communication

Unlike astrologers who rely on planetary charts or tarot readers who shuffle cards, Daksh channels direct spiritual messages. His connection to the Akashic Records allows him to see beyond timelines, beyond illusions, and into the soul's true path.

3. Healing Beyond Prediction

Daksh doesn't just predict—he heals. Many of his high-profile clients not only ask for readings but also request healing rituals, ancestral healing, or karmic release. This dual ability makes him more than a reader—he is a spiritual strategist.

4. Trust of the Elite

Earning the confidence of celebrities and politicians is no small feat. It requires consistency, honesty, and respect for boundaries. Over the years, Akashic reader Psychic Medium Daksh has built his reputation through word of mouth, with clients recommending him privately to others in their circle.

5. Accuracy That Speaks for Itself

From predicting the success of film releases to offering clarity during political uncertainty, Daksh's insights have proven accurate time and again. While confidentiality prevents details, his clients themselves are the testimony to his unmatched ability.

It's this blend of purity, precision, and privacy that positions famous psychic reader Psychic Medium Daksh as the undisputed #1 psychic reader in India.

While Daksh works with celebrities and politicians, his doors are open to anyone who seeks genuine guidance. Whether you're a student facing confusion, a professional seeking clarity, or someone carrying the weight of grief, you can book a private session.

How to Book a Reading or Healing Session:

Please Note: Due to high demand, bookings are limited. Daksh reviews each request personally to ensure spiritual alignment before confirming.

In the dazzling world of power and fame, where every decision is magnified and every move is scrutinized, the need for spiritual clarity is not a luxury—it's a necessity. When politicians and celebrities need answers they can trust, they turn to one man: Psychic Medium Daksh.

Known as the best spirit medium, a trusted Akashic reader, and a famous psychic reader, Daksh is not just another name in the spiritual world. He is a bridge between the seen and unseen, between destiny and free will, between power and purpose.

For India's most influential figures, Daksh is more than a psychic—he is a confidant, healer, and spiritual protector. And for anyone seeking answers beyond logic, his message is simple:

Finally, action cameras are getting small enough that we can actually carry them around on our bodies without entangling ourselves in a jury-rigged mount shaped like a straightjacket. DJI copied Insta360's homework and then went wild with its new Osmo Nano magnetic wearable camera. There are a few features that could make it your next spy cam, though, as always with DJI, you won't see it available in the U.S.

DJI is mostly known for drones, but its GoPro-like action cameras, such as the Osmo Action 5 Pro, have kept me coming back. As earlier leaks suggested, this bug-sized Osmo Nano camera attaches to a small screen body called the Multifunctional Vision Dock via magnets. This means you can position it forward or backward for selfie or point-of-view footage. The real benefit of the magnetic camera is that you can rig up a surprising variety of mounts, so long as you have another magnet or ferromagnetic metal handy. Sure, you can strap it to your head, but we all know you're going to try and stick it on your cat's collar.

See DJI Osmo Nano at Amazon

While you could argue the Osmo Nano is a continuation of the old DJI Action 2 miniature camera, the drone maker is taking more cues Insta360's Go Ultra. The Osmo Nano includes a 1/1.3-inch sensor, slightly larger than the 1/1.28-inch sensor on the Go Ultra. It will shoot up to 4K resolution and 120 fps at a max 143-degree wide angle to capture all your antics without any handling. It supports 13.5 stops of dynamic range as well as 10-bit color and D-Log M for color accuracy.

I went hands-on with the Osmo Nano at IFA 2025, though I didn't get to capture any footage. The pod weighs 52g, so it's surprisingly light despite its 55mm size. While the DJI Osmo Nano is slightly larger than the Action Pod for the Insta360 Go Ultra, it makes up for that in several key ways. The Go Ultra is limited to a max 60 fps shooting at 4K. For one, the device includes built-in storage, plus access to a microSD card. It can also connect with any of DJI's popular mics, like its recent Mic 3, without a receiver. The device also supports gesture controls that will start recording if you nod your head. Otherwise, you can pat the top of the pod or hit the small recording button.

The Osmo Nano promises to record for 200 minutes at 1080p and 24 fps, but face it, you'll want to record everything in 4K for the sake of better image quality. The pod should get between 55 and 60 minutes at 4K and 30 fps. With those specs, you'll end up needing to charge it up more often than you think. At least it supports fast charging that promises to get to 80% in 20 minutes.

The only problem is that DJI still isn't shipping the Osmo Nano to the U.S. at launch. The company has repeatedly said it is “committed to the U.S. market,” though the federal government has soft-banned its products from entering the States. That's a shame, since the modular action camera is starting at $300 with 64GB of built-in storage on Amazon. The rest of the world can play around with DJI's tiny camera, while we in the U.S. have to rely on competitors.

Megan  Brooks

 September 23, 2025  

The FDA approved a subcutaneous (SC) induction regimen of guselkumab (Tremfya, Johnson & Johnson) for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

Guselkumab is the first and only interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor available as both SC and intravenous (IV) induction options for the treatment of UC and Crohn's disease (CD), the company noted in a news release. 

The approval of SC guselkumab induction in UC was based on results from the phase 3 ASTRO trial, which randomly allocated 418 patients with moderately to severely active UC to receive either induction with 400 mg SC guselkumab at weeks 0, 4, and 8 or placebo.

Following induction, the treatment group either received a maintenance dose of 200 mg SC guselkumab at week 12 and then every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 8 weeks (starting at 16 weeks).

All patients had had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy.

All primary and secondary endpoints demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements with SC guselkumab compared to placebo across all clinical and endoscopic measures, the company said. 

At 12 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with 400 mg SC guselkumab every 4 weeks achieved clinical remission (26% vs 7% with placebo; P < .001) and endoscopic improvement (36% vs 12%; P < .001). 

The results were consistent with the FDA-approved 200 mg IV induction regimen, which previously achieved clinical remission (23% vs 8% with placebo; P < .001) and endoscopic improvement (27% vs 11%; P < .001). 

The efficacy of SC and IV induction was comparable across subgroups with severe or refractory disease and both routes demonstrated a similar time to onset of efficacy. 

SC guselkumab induction followed by SC guselkumab maintenance therapy also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic improvement compared to placebo. 

“Historically, IL-23 inhibitors have required IV infusions at the start of therapy, which can create barriers to starting treatment or be burdensome for some patients and clinicians,” study investigator David T. Rubin, MD, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at University of Chicago Medicine, said in the news release. 

“UC patients and providers now have the choice of starting Tremfya with a self-administered subcutaneous injection, with the same efficacy and safety that were established with IV induction in the prior clinical trials and subsequently seen in our real-world practice,” Rubin said. 

Full prescribing information and medication guide are available online.

At the gym, they are easy to spot. Some were never overweight, yet now they are slim ­— even thin. Nicknamed “jabbers,” they reflect a growing trend of people using weight loss injections, even when medically unnecessary.

Eating disorder charities warn that misuse of the drugs is rising, posing serious health risks for vulnerable groups.

“Medications which cause weight loss can be very attractive to people with eating disorders, but they can also pose severe health risks,” said Tom Quinn, director of external affairs at charity Beat. “For example, if someone isn't overweight, it risks entrenching the illness further and can make them even more unwell,” he told Medscape News UK. 

The GLP-1 receptor agonists tirzepatide (Mounjaro) and semaglutide (Wegovy) are both authorised in the UK for weight management. On the NHS, they are available only for people who meet strict criteria, such as a high BMI and weight-related health conditions, usually through specialist services. Many others, however, are accessing them privately via online pharmacies and clinics.

Around 1.5 million people in the UK are thought to be taking the drugs.

To access the jabs, most online providers expect customers to meet criteria such as a BMI of 30, or 27 with an associated health condition. Recent guidance requires that online pharmacies verify height, weight, or BMI rather than relying solely on self-reported questionnaires. Some providers go further, asking customers to supply a photo of themselves in tight clothing or of their feet standing on scales.

Anecdotally, some people report wearing backpacks filled with dumbbells to tip the scales. There are reports that others have used artificial intelligence to manipulate photos to appear heavier. 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued warnings about fake or unapproved weight-loss pens being sold online without legitimate prescriptions, often via unverified sellers.

There are anecdotal accounts of teenage girls at boarding schools turning to weight-loss drugs. Other reports involve young adults using them regularly, with some even sharing pens. 

A National Pharmacy Association poll in June found that more than 1 in 5 people in the UK had tried to access weight loss jabs through an online or in-person pharmacy, rising to 35% of those aged 16-34.

Daniel Magson, CEO of the eating disorder charity First Steps ED, lived with bulimia for more than a decade before beginning recovery 6 years ago. After writing a blog about weight-loss jabs, he was inundated with ads on social media.

“Twenty minutes after the blog, I went on Instagram and was bombarded with 12 or so adverts about weight loss injections,” he told Medscape News UK. “Adverts from people who are sports influencers, adverts from fitness influencers, adverts from life coaches, actors mimicking therapy sessions — all of them saying discounted weight loss injections, no queues, no checks, no tests.”

Charities say this lack of safeguards leaves people with eating disorders particularly vulnerable.

“We know that people with eating disorders can sometimes get hold of them through illicit means, which is why safety checks are so important,” Quinn said. “That said, losing weight can become a fixation for those unwell with an eating disorder, even if it harms their health, and so people shouldn't be blamed for lying about their BMI.” 

Actress Gemma Oaten, known for Emmerdale and Holby City, spent more than a decade with anorexia and has been in recovery for 15 years. She is now CEO of SEED, an eating disorder support service. 

“It does scare me,” she told Medscape News UK. “These jabs are so normalised it's going against everything that people in eating disorder services or support is being taught — that it's not about how you look. Then all of a sudden extreme thinness is meant to be better, which is really triggering. 

“I've fought for years to try to normalise the conversation around eating disorders, and now when everyone seems to be on these jabs, we are normalising the conversation that being thin is beautiful. We worked so hard to have body positivity — bigger bodies on the catwalk — and this feels like a backward step.” 

Magson said that for some people, weight loss injections trigger harmful patterns they thought they had left behind. Strict eating restrictions can resemble earlier disordered behaviours and negatively affect mental health. 

“We've seen people who've been accessing them through social media or lying about their BMI to access the weight loss injection,” he said. “There is so much messaging out there on social media. A lot of what influencers are talking about is focusing on the weight loss injections.”

Weight loss injections suppress hunger, but only while taken. Privately funded use is expensive, so many eventually stop. When they do, weight often returns — a process that can trigger relapses.

“Yes, we are concerned about what could happen if people struggle if they gain weight,” Quinn said. “In people unwell, or vulnerable to an eating disorder, gaining weight can lead to feelings of guilt and shame, which in turn may trigger dangerous eating disorder behaviours such as restricting their intake, exercising excessively, or bingeing.” 

Magson agreed: “If you come off these injections, we are seeing a rise in people putting the weight back on again and this starts another cycle which can be triggering and end up with tendencies that mimic eating disorders.”

Experts say introducing safeguards retrospectively may be difficult given the drugs' widespread popularity. But charities want tighter rules.

“We'd like to see the current prescribing guidelines go further and include a mandatory mental health assessment, in-person physical health assessments, and robust mental health support — including after someone finishes taking injections,” said Quinn.

“Healthcare professionals can play a vital role in spotting the early signs of an eating disorder and getting patients the specialist help they need without delay,” he added. 

Magson argues that some of the current marketing is “dangerous” and “alarming.”

“Some of the images are of people pinching their bodies and looking at themselves in the mirror,” he said. “I was looking at that from the lens of someone who has recovered from an eating disorder, and it could be very triggering. It's really aggressive marketing around these injections and there really has to be emotional support alongside it.”

His charity is preparing for the potential fallout. “We are already seeing the impact,” he said. “It seems like we are going back to the ‘thinspiration' trend, coupled with the idea you can easily access weight loss products. 

“It's detrimental and not sustainable.”
