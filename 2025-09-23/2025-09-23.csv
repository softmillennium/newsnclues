            President Donald Trump keeps making a mathematically impossible promise.
    


            At event after event this month and last, Trump has declared that the “most favored nation” policy he unveiled in an executive order in May is going to reduce the price of prescription drugs by 1,000% or more.
    


            Trump said in late August: “We have something coming up, favored nations, where I'm going to be reducing drug prices by 1,400 to 1,500%.” He said Saturday: “We're gonna be reducing drug prices down to a level that nobody – not by 20%, 30% – by like 1,000%. Because, you know, we're paying sometimes 10 times more than other nations, and we're not doing it anymore.” He said Monday: “We have something else called ‘favored nations,' where I'm going to be reducing drug prices by 1,000% – by 900, 600, 500, 1,200.”
    


            Trump's numbers make no sense. Because of how math works.
    


            Even if Trump's policy does produce a big decline in drug prices – and that is very much uncertain given that it relies on cooperation by reluctant pharmaceutical companies or hypothetical future regulatory action – he can't actually cut the price of any product by 500% to 1,500%. If he magically got the companies to reduce the prices of all of their drugs to $0, that would be a 100% cut.
    


            Cutting drug prices by more than 100% would mean that Americans would get paid to acquire their medications rather than paying for them. Health economist Timothy McBride called Trump's claims “just not logical,” noting that a 500% price reduction would mean that a drug that now costs $100 would cost…negative $400.
    


            “I know of no drug company in the world that would give a person $400 to buy a drug that they are now pricing at $100,” McBride, a professor in the School of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis, said in an email. “There are times we subsidize prices, but even then it is exceptionally rare for the size of the subsidy to exceed the price of the item, making the net price negative.”
    


            The “most favored nation” proposal seeks to pressure pharmaceutical companies to sell their products in the US for the lowest price they sell them for in any other wealthy country. In confusing comments to Fox News last week, Trump appeared to attempt to explain how he is trying to get companies to both lower prices in the US and raise prices in other countries to offset the financial hit from the US reduction.
    


            “For years,” he said, “we've been paying sometimes for a pill $100 and they're paying $10. And I say, what's this all about? And now the drug companies agree that I'm right. And the countries, if they don't agree, I'll use tariffs to get them to agree. You understand. And we're gonna be reducing drug costs over the next year, year and a half, by not 50 or 60% – by 1,000%. Because if you think, a $10 pill – so it will be raised up from $10 to $20, because it's the world versus us, so the world is a bigger place – so it'll go from $10 to $20; it won't go for $10 to $50 or $60, for them. Which is bearable. And it'll go from $10 to $20 for us.”
    


            The price of a pill going from $10 to $20 in the US would be a 100% increase for Americans, not a 1,000% decrease. If, as seems likely, Trump misspoke and meant that the price of a pill would go from $100 to $20 in the US, that would be an 80% decrease for Americans, again far from 1,000%.
    


            After those comments on Fox, CNN asked the White House to explain Trump's claims that drug prices are going to come down somewhere between 1,000% to 1,500%.
    


            White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded in the manner Trump's team often does when asked about something the president has said that is obviously inaccurate: by ignoring the specific inaccuracy and declaring that Trump is right about a related but different point.
    


            Desai said: “President Trump has correctly identified how Americans pay several times more for the same exact drugs as their peers in other wealthy nations. The Administration is committed to ensuring that drug companies make wealthy countries pay fairer rates for drugs and stop relying on Americans to subsidize the vast majority of global pharma research and development.”
    


            We pressed the White House to specifically address Trump's promised “1,000%” decrease. His team responded only on condition of anonymity. This time, they said they had an example: in 2023, a certain drug was listed for $521 in the US versus just $45 in Australia, so the US price was roughly 1,000% higher.
    


            But reducing the US price of this drug from $521 to $45 would be a 91% decrease, not a 1,000% cut. If the president wanted to say that some drugs cost 1,000% more in the US than in other countries, he could simply say that; instead, he has stuck with the phony claim of a looming 1,000% cut.

            Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor who chairs the Senate health committee, is calling on the Department of Health and Human Services to release any evidence tying acetaminophen use during pregnancy to autism, noting that “the preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case.”
    


            “I understand and applaud President Trump's desire to address this issue and to support HHS. HHS should release the new data that it has to support this claim. The preponderance of evidence shows that this is not the case,” he wrote Monday on X. “The concern is that women will be left with no options to manage pain in pregnancy. We must be compassionate to this problem.”
    


            Trump announced Monday that the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe. Experts say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science showing a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled.
    


Trump links autism to acetaminophen use during pregnancy, despite decades of evidence it's safe



            “They are strongly recommending that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy unless medically necessary,” such as to treat fever, “if you can't tough it out,” Trump said, speaking from the White House alongside US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others.
    


            In February, Cassidy cast a deciding vote to confirm Kennedy to lead HHS. The senator, however, has before pushed back on Kennedy's claims about vaccines and as recently as last week, would not say whether he would vote to confirm Kennedy if given the choice now.
    


            “I am steadfastly not judging until we have a chance to hear the secretary's perspective,” he told reporters, after he led a hearing where the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Susan Monarez, testified about her clashes with the health secretary.
    


            Cassidy is up for reelection in 2026, and given his previous vote to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection after January 6, 2021, the Louisiana senator will be walking a political tightrope to keep the president from endorsing any of his primary opponents.
    


            He has been careful to not directly criticize the president or Kennedy, despite expressing concern at some CDC and HHS actions.
    


            Most recently, Cassidy has warned that the new federal vaccine advisory committee's proposal to change recommendations for the hepatitis B vaccination would put children at risk. The panel ultimately delayed its vote on that proposal. Cassidy, a liver doctor, has long advocated for greater access to the vaccine.
    


            “President Trump and I agree: vaccines save lives. If a mom wants to get a lifesaving hepatitis B vaccine to protect her newborn, she should be able to get it,” he said on X last week. “The proposed (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) recommendation could have put that access at risk, making it harder for that mom or that parent to protect their child against hepatitis B.”

            Backlash has been swift and forceful as other parts of the world woke up to US President Donald Trump's comments blaming – without solid evidence – acetaminophen and certain vaccines for autism in children.
    


            “Don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don't take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists,” UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting said in a televised interview on Tuesday. “I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this.”
    


            It comes after Trump announced Monday the US Food and Drug Administration will notify doctors that the use of Tylenol – the brand name for acetaminophen, known in most countries as paracetamol – during pregnancy can be associated with a “very increased risk of autism.” Despite decades of evidence that it is safe, Trump suggested that women limit Tylenol use during pregnancy “if you can't tough it out.”
    


            The medicine regulatory agencies of the European Union and the United Kingdom also quickly issued statements Tuesday confirming that taking paracetamol during pregnancy remains safe.
    


            “Paracetamol remains an important option to treat pain or fever in pregnant women,” Steffen Thirstrup, chief medical officer of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said in a statement. “Our advice is based on a rigorous assessment of the available scientific data and we have found no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.”
    


            Experts warn that an untreated fever can be dangerous for both the fetus and the pregnant person. Risks include miscarriage, birth defects and high blood pressure. Experts also say there are multiple causes of autism, and the science on a connection between autism and Tylenol is not settled.
    


            A peer-reviewed analysis published in BioMed Central in August looked at 46 studies on acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, the analysis concluded that there was “strong evidence of an association” between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism, but the authors were careful to say that the research could not show that acetaminophen caused autism. The authors recommended judicious acetaminophen use, under medical guidance.
    


            Meanwhile, a 2024 peer-reviewed Swedish study published in the medical journal JAMA found no link between acetaminophen taken in pregnancy and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.
    


            The EMA statement said that in 2019, the agency “reviewed available studies that investigated the neurodevelopment of children exposed to paracetamol in utero and found that the results were inconclusive and that no link with neurodevelopmental disorders could be established.”
    


            Speaking on Britain's ITV News, Streeting said: “I've just got to be really clear about this: There is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.” He encouraged the British public to “follow the science,” especially at a time when “you've got kids in this country now dying of measles, whooping cough, kids not taking the RSV vaccine, when those respiratory diseases can be life-threatening in our children.”
    


            The vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) has long been a target of misinformation and alarm, including by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, following discredited research linking it to autism by a British doctor who has since been barred from practicing medicine. Kennedy publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine amid this year's outbreak that led to three deaths and nearly 200 hospitalizations across the US, but also touted unconventional therapies.
    


            Acetaminophen, or paracetamol, is considered the only safe over-the-counter option for pain or fever during pregnancy. Other common pain relief options like ibuprofen or regular-dose aspirin can increase the risk of serious pregnancy complications, according to experts.
    


            The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: “Paracetamol remains the recommended pain relief option for pregnant women when used as directed. Pregnant women should continue to follow existing NHS (National Health Service) guidance and speak to their healthcare professional if they have questions about any medication during pregnancy.”
    


            On Monday, Trump also advocated for breaking up childhood vaccinations and even pushing back the hepatitis B shot for newborns to age 12. It's “too much liquid, too many different things are going into that baby,” Trump said, without citing scientific evidence.
    


            As a public health strategy, providing hepatitis B shot to infants brought the infection in children to the brink of elimination in the United States.
    


            And extensive research has shown that there's no link between vaccines and autism.
    


            “Extensive safety monitoring in the UK and internationally continues to show that the benefits of these vaccinations outweigh any risks. Hepatitis B vaccines used in the UK have a well-established safety profile and play a vital role in protecting infants from serious illness,” Alison Cave, chief safety officer at the MHRA, said in a statement.
    


            The World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement that vaccination campaigns, which have saved more than 150 million lives in the past 50 years, are being threatened by misinformation.
    


            “Misinformation is increasingly driven from the top, with prominent influencers pushing thoroughly debunked myths, such as the disproven and false claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism,” said WHO's immunization director, Kate O'Brien.
    


Vaccines Fast Facts



            “Pseudoscience, false logic, and selective ‘evidence' are weaponized in ways that sow confusion and doubt among well-meaning parents.”
    


            O'Brien said the consequences of this misinformation were “real and tragic,” pointing to how the drop in coverage of the measles vaccine “is driving a significant rise in measles cases and deaths, including in wealthy countries like the US, Canada, the UK and other European countries.”

Ukraine has to agree to a peace deal with Russia, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said. He added that it is not up to the US to end the conflict, and that the two sides themselves must find a compromise.

Since returning to office, US President Donald Trump has made repeated attempts to mediate the Ukraine conflict, initiating numerous rounds of talks with Russian officials and holding a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in mid-August. The sides described their contacts as productive, but no breakthrough was achieved.

Speaking on NBC's Today Show on Tuesday, Rubio replied that it is “not up to us to end the war” when asked why the conflict continues despite Trump's repeated promises to end it “on day one” of his new administration. “The Russians have to stop the war and the Ukrainians have to agree to a peace deal,” he added.

Ending the conflict is still a “priority” for the Trump administration, Rubio maintained. When asked about Washington's alleged reluctance to impose new sanctions on Russia, the secretary of state said the US would like to retain the role of a “broker” in the conflict for as long as possible.

“The minute we go heavy on the sanctions and everything else, our ability to act as a broker to bring about peace is diminished,” he told NBC. The conflict could then go on for “another two years,” Rubio warned, adding that “we hope to avoid that.”

He also accused Kiev's Western backers of hypocrisy by saying they demand that the US introduce harsher economic restrictions against Moscow, with some “countries in Europe… still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas” from Russia.

Moscow has repeatedly stated it is open to a peaceful resolution of the hostilities at any time, but has maintained that any deal must address the roots of the conflict and respect the realities on the ground. This includes the status of the former Ukrainian territories that joined Russia after public referendums.

Russia has also accused Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky of being in denial and unnecessarily prolonging a conflict he cannot win.

Poland will shoot down any Russian aircraft or missile that crosses into its airspace, Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said at an emergency UN Security Council meeting on Monday.

Earlier this month, Warsaw accused Moscow of deliberately sending at least 19 drones into Polish airspace, which Russia dismissed as “hysteria” promoted by the “European party of war.”

The latest warning came during a meeting convened by another NATO member, Estonia, which also accused Russia of violating its airspace.

“You have been warned,” Sikorski said. “If another missile or aircraft enters our airspace without permission – either deliberately or by mistake – and gets shot down and the wreckage falls on NATO territory, please don't come here to whine about it.”

Moscow responded by saying, “neither Warsaw nor Brussels need the truth.” Russian Deputy Ambassador to the UN Dmitry Polyansky called the gathering the second part of the “blame Russia for everything” spectacle.

Polyansky said the only confirmed damage from the alleged Russian drone incursion was actually caused by a Polish missile fired from a NATO F-16, which struck a residential building.

Moscow offered to hold bilateral consultations over the incident but received “no adequate response,” and Warsaw has yet to provide evidence that the drones were of Russian origin. Poland simply needs “a reason for a new round of a Russophobic campaign,” the diplomat added.

Regarding Estonia's claims that three Russian military aircraft violated its airspace last week, “there is no proof except the Russophobic hysteria coming from Tallinn,” Polyansky said.

Russia treats any accusations against its military “very seriously,” but needs to see clear evidence rather than EU “hysteria” aimed at pushing US President Donald Trump into “an anti-Russian course and undermining the agreements and understandings reached by the Russian and American presidents in Alaska a month ago,” Polyansky added.

French President Emmanuel Macron was stopped on the street by New York City police on Monday as they cleared the way for US President Donald Trump's motorcade. Footage shared by French news channel BFMTV shows Macron calling Trump amid the incident in Manhattan.

Macron was in the city for the UN General Assembly, where France formally recognized the state of Palestine. After his speech, Macron and his entourage were heading from UN headquarters toward the French Embassy when officers blocked traffic to allow Trump's convoy through.

A video released by BFMTV shows Macron standing in the street, speaking with a police officer who apologizes for the delay, explaining that a “motorcade [is] coming right up this way.”

Macron replies, “If you can't see it, let me pass. I'll negotiate with you,” before taking out his phone and apparently calling Trump.

”How are you? Guess what? I'm waiting in the street because everything is closed down for you,” Macron is heard saying.

The French president reportedly had to wait several minutes and then continued towards the embassy on foot.

Trump is reported to have handed out his private phone number to foreign leaders to encourage direct calls and texts. Politico noted in July that Macron was among those in regular contact.

CARACAS, August 19 /TASS/. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has accused the United States of trying to install a puppet regime in the Bolivarian Republic in order to seize its natural resources.

""An imperial plan has been developed to change the regime in Venezuela to install a puppet government of the United States and steal our largest oil reserves in the world, the fourth largest gas reserves in the world, and the first gold reserves,"" the president said on the Venezolana de Television television channel.

Maduro said that for these purposes, the United States has concentrated warships and a nuclear submarine in the Caribbean and is making false accusations against Venezuela. He stressed that ""the United Nations, the European Union, the World Customs Organization and the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have already rejected accusations of Venezuela [of drug trafficking]."" He said that even in ""the United States, no one believes the lies that are being told about me and Venezuela."" The president said that Washington would not achieve its goal and Venezuela would remain an ""independent, free and peaceful country.""

The head of State said that the National Bolivarian Armed Forces are conducting three-day maneuvers ""Caribbean Sovereignty 200"" in the territorial waters of Venezuela. ""The peoples of the Caribbean and South America have the right to peace, and nothing should violate their sovereignty,"" Maduro stressed, expressing confidence that Venezuela has ""a powerful state, a strong, consolidated, well-organized government, as well as a determined people, which guarantee victory in any circumstances.""

The Venezuelan president has repeatedly said that the country is facing the most serious threat of invasion from the United States in the last 100 years. According to Reuters, on August 19, three US Navy destroyers were sent to the southern Caribbean, to the coast of Venezuela ""to conduct operations against drug cartels."" The United States also deployed a nuclear submarine, a missile cruiser, amphibious ships and 4,500 military personnel to the region.

On September 15, US President Donald Trump said three members of a drug cartel, allegedly from Venezuela, were eliminated in international waters. According to him, the strike was carried out at a time when drug terrorists from Venezuela were illegally transporting drugs to the United States. On September 2, the head of the Washington administration said the American army had eliminated 11 members of the Venezuelan drug cartel during an operation in international waters. According to Trump, Venezuela is taking insufficient measures to combat drug trafficking. Moreover, Washington accused Maduro of belonging to the Cartel de los Soles drug cartel, the existence of which Caracas categorically denies.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:tass.com","Press review: West recognizes Palestine pressuring Israel as US-Russia talks to resume","https://tass.com/pressreview/2019909","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 10:01:32 GMT","

MOSCOW, September 23. /TASS/. France and other Western states have backed a wave of recognition of Palestine at the UN General Assembly; Russia may continue adhering to New START nuclear limits for one year after the treaty lapsing in 2026; and Moscow and Washington are preparing a third round of talks to reduce bilateral tensions. These stories topped Tuesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

On September 22, France became another nation in the latest wave to join the recognition of the independent State of Palestine on the sidelines of the 80th session of the UN General Assembly, with the announcement made by French President Emmanuel Macron. According to Ofer Bronstein, special adviser to the French leader on Middle Eastern affairs, such recognition is expected to spark a ""small diplomatic tsunami,"" prompting more states to acknowledge Palestine. Experts interviewed by Vedomosti believe that Western recognition of Palestine is mainly symbolic, but could paradoxically obstruct the creation of a viable Palestinian state while pushing Israel to expand settlements rather than engage in peace negotiations.

According to Politico, Macron's goal is indeed to motivate other Western states to grant recognition. The French move is based on Macron's personal stance, head of the Section for Regional Issues and Conflicts in the Department of European Political Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Pavel Timofeev told Vedomosti.

Recognition from the UK, France, Canada, Australia, and Portugal is largely symbolic - while it may slightly boost the international standing of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), it is unlikely to produce major changes ""on the ground,"" research fellow at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Lyudmila Samarskaya told the newspaper.

Pavel Timofeev agreed that the step is mostly symbolic. ""According to France's concept, if moderate groups win elections in Gaza and Hamas is sidelined, this will enable Western nations to deliver financial and other backing to a 'democratic Gaza', steering it toward dialogue with Israel under a two-state framework,"" the expert noted.

Samarskaya added that ""this new recognition wave also shows the decline of Israel's foreign policy standing, particularly among European states. While personal sanctions carry little influence, any EU economic restrictions against Israel would be highly sensitive, since the union is one of Jerusalem's top trading partners. Yet such measures are unlikely to be serious. The psychological effect would be far greater.""

At the same time, Samarskaya stressed that the ongoing wave of recognition complicates the chances of building a viable Palestinian state, giving grounds for implementing the Knesset's decision to annex the West Bank. Although extending Israeli sovereignty over the entire West Bank or even part of it appears too risky given the Abraham Accords with Arab states, expanding settlements in response may well be the path Israel opts for, she suggested.

 

Russia is willing to adhere to the key restrictions of the New START Treaty for one year after its expiry in February 2026, President Vladimir Putin announced during a meeting with members of the Security Council. According to the president, Moscow is prepared to take this step in order to avoid provoking a strategic arms race. At the same time, Putin acknowledged that the situation in the field of strategic stability keeps worsening. Experts believe the Russian leader's remarks are a signal of intent to preserve New START and negotiate new agreements. However, further dialogue will depend on Washington's willingness to consider the arsenals of NATO allies - namely, France and the United Kingdom.

""Russia is ready, after February 5, 2026, to continue for one year to uphold the central quantitative limits of the New START Treaty. Thereafter, based on an assessment of the situation, we will make a decision regarding the future maintenance of these voluntary self-restrictions,"" Putin declared.

In early 2021, the two sides prolonged the treaty until February 5, 2026. It was expected that during this period, Russia and the United States would develop a document or a set of documents on strategic stability to succeed New START. Until February 2022, Moscow and Washington indeed held consultations, but with the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine, that dialogue was suspended at Washington's initiative.

Putin's latest remarks represent a clear sign of readiness to resume such dialogue, research fellow at the Center for International Security of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations Vasily Klimov told Izvestia. ""Putin's statement indicates readiness, taking into account the requirements set out in 2023, to preserve this vital arms control agreement and to begin negotiations on arrangements that would replace New START,"" the expert said.

Nevertheless, rapprochement between Russia and the United States on issues of strategic stability is still distant, Director of the Center for Military and Economic Studies at the Higher School of Economics' Institute of World Military Economy and Strategy Prokhor Tebin said. ""Tense relations between Russia and the West remain. As for the United States, there are certain hopes for improvement, but they have not yet led to a substantial change in the situation,"" the expert emphasized.

Unless the United States agrees to include the nuclear arsenals of the United Kingdom and France and acknowledges the link between strategic offensive and defensive weapons, speaking of convergence in the sphere of strategic stability is premature, Vasily Klimov stressed.

 

Russia and the United States are currently coordinating the time and venue for the third round of consultations aimed at removing ""irritants"" in bilateral ties, the Russian Foreign Ministry told Izvestia. The ministry stressed that it expects the meeting to occur soon. Following two previous rounds of talks, Moscow and Washington managed to resolve the most pressing issues, with the resumption of direct air service now priority on the agenda. Experts told Izvestia that the pause in negotiations has lasted too long and that a new impetus is necessary to revive the Russia-US dialogue.

""The timing and location of the third round of consultations on the so-called irritants in Russian-American relations are currently being coordinated. We expect them to take place in the near future,"" the Russian diplomatic service told Izvestia.

""Without delving into technical details, we would like to point out that the current agenda includes genuinely important matters, the resolution of which requires time, political will, and a certain sensitivity in conducting negotiations. This is why logistical parameters inevitably take a back seat,"" the Foreign Ministry underlined.

The pause in negotiations has been lengthy, and the initial drive toward restoring Russia-US relations that was visible earlier this year has faded, Valdai Club expert Andrey Kortunov told Izvestia. ""Although these are technical issues, they depend on the overall climate of bilateral relations and on decisions made at the highest level,"" the expert noted.

Despite the difficulties of the Ukrainian settlement process, Moscow and Washington have already signaled interest in cooperation in several areas. Direct flights between Russia and the United States could be restored by the end of 2025, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Special Presidential Envoy on Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation, suggested in mid-June.

A second promising area is space cooperation. Joint manned flights to the Moon with the United States are feasible, Deputy Director General for manned space programs at Roscosmos Sergey Krikalev told Izvestia.

Opportunities also remain open in the economic sphere. Putin previously declared Russia's readiness to cooperate with the United States in the extraction of rare-earth metals. In March, Dmitriev told Izvestia that Moscow and Washington were holding discussions on joint projects in this sector.

 

The concept of an ""Arab NATO,"" proposed by Egypt in response to Israeli strikes on Qatar earlier this month, has collapsed at the stage of initial discussions. Experts doubt that Gulf states will abandon the Abraham Accords, noting that Israel's supply of advanced surveillance technologies has made regional security structures heavily reliant on Israeli intelligence, Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.

Sources from the Emirati newspaper The National reported that the recent summit of the League of Arab States (LAS) and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Qatar was expected to focus on the idea of an ""Arab NATO."" According to their information, the proposal was submitted by Egypt in response to the Israeli strikes on Qatar on September 9. Under this project, a military bloc based on the LAS could have been formed, with forces able to operate on land, in the air, and at sea, in order to counter existential threats.

Middle Eastern and North African states were unable to reach consensus on the idea of an ""Arab NATO,"" sources told the Qatari portal The Middle East Eye (MEE). According to them, the process stalled due to several factors, including disputes among Arab actors over who could take command of the bloc's forces. Egypt, as one of the key architects of the idea, maintained that it should oversee the military mechanism, while Saudi Arabia sought the same role, MEE's sources said. Another version, previously circulated, claimed that the creation of the bloc was blocked by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who preferred an ""Arab NATO"" under Gulf leadership.

As a result, Arab states opted for the idea of diplomatic pressure on the administration of US President Donald Trump, which they believe wields the greatest influence over the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

Contacts at Le Figaro within French intelligence working with the Persian Gulf expressed skepticism about the ability of Gulf players to fully give up the Abraham Accords. According to a Le Figaro source, the transfer of advanced Israeli spyware to Arab countries had been a central element of Israeli diplomacy for over a decade. The source warned that Israeli intelligence services had invested so deeply in the security framework of the Gulf that regional players are now completely dependent on them.

 

The price of gold futures on the New York Comex exchange on September 22 climbed past $3,750 per ounce for the first time in history, rising 1.23% in Monday morning trading to $3,751.5. Previously, the precious metal had set a record on September 17, when it rose above $3,744 following the US Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time this year by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4-4.25% annually. Analysts interviewed by Vedomosti agree that gold's rally is driven by Fed easing, declining faith in the dollar, central banks' reserve diversification, and geopolitical risks.

The upward movement in gold prices has persisted for three years and is being supported by three key factors, Alexander Golovtsov, head of the analytical department at PSB Asset Management explained. First, the global cycle of monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve has ended, giving way to monetary easing: interest rates in advanced economies and in China are approaching zero, heightening inflation risks and increasing the appeal of gold as a store of value. Second, the situation with Russian currency reserves has pushed many central banks to boost their gold holdings while cutting their exposure to the dollar and the euro. Third, concerns over fiscal stability in the US and other advanced economies have undermined confidence in paper currencies overall and strengthened the desire of investors to diversify into tangible assets, the expert concluded.

Gold prices are rising primarily due to expectations of further Fed rate cuts, as the US economy shows signs of cooling, senior analyst at Sinara Investment Bank Sergey Krivokhizhin told the newspaper. This is happening against the backdrop of a weakening US dollar, which typically supports commodity markets and gold.

Analysts at Finam also identified geopolitics as one of the factors bolstering gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. The conflict in the Middle East is far from resolved, while tensions surrounding Venezuela are also escalating, Finam analyst Nikolay Dudchenko noted.

The current price reflects waning trust in the US dollar as the world's reserve currency, director of the wealth management department at AF Capital Ruslan Klyshko said. Accordingly, the forecasts of major banks anticipate a price range of $3,800-4,000 per ounce by the end of the year, with the possibility of surpassing these levels under favorable conditions, the expert believes.

NEW YORK, September 23. /TASS/. The Washington administration is not inclined to impose new sanctions on Moscow while US allies in Europe are purchasing large volumes of Russian oil and gas, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in an interview with Fox News.

""But he's also said that before we do that, Europe needs to do it,"" Rubio noted. ""They're demanding all these things of us, and yet you have countries in Europe still buying massive amounts of oil and natural gas from Russia,"" the top diplomat added, referring to Washington's European allies.

The gift, one of Scott's largest single donations, will help UNCF build a $370m pooled endowment for its 37 HBCUs

Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott has donated $70m to the UNCF, as the nation's largest private provider of scholarships to minority students works to raise $1bn to strengthen all 37 of its historically Black colleges and universities.

The gift is one of Scott's largest single donations ever and among the first to be publicly disclosed in 2025. Famously private, Scott only discusses her donations through her website and does not confirm them until after the recipients do.

“This extraordinary gift is a powerful vote of confidence in HBCUs and in the work of UNCF,” the non-profit's president and chief executive officer Dr Michael L Lomax told the Associated Press in a statement. “It provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our member institutions to build permanent assets that will support students and campuses for decades to come.”

Lomax said Scott's donation would be used for UNCF's pooled endowment, which aims to establish a $370m fund – $10m for each UNCF member HBCU. That fund will be invested and designed to pay out about 4% annually, which will then be divided among the HBCUs to help stabilize their budgets. Increasing HBCU endowments is a priority since they trail endowments at non-HBCUs by 70%, according to the UNCF.

The broader $1bn fundraising effort is an attempt to help HBCUs address the funding disparity they face when compared to other colleges and universities. A 2023 study by philanthropic research group Candid and ABFE, a non-profit that advocates for investments in Black communities, found that the eight Ivy League schools received $5.5bn from the 1,000 largest US foundations compared to $45m for the 99 HBCUs in 2019.

Since Scott, a novelist who received the bulk of her fortune after divorcing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, signed the Giving Pledge in 2019, promising to donate more than half her wealth, HBCUs have been among her favorite grantees. She previously gave UNCF $10m in 2020.

Though Scott hasn't addressed HBCU donations specifically, she wrote in 2020 that her funding decisions were “driven by a deep belief in the value different backgrounds bring to problem-solving on any issue”.

Scott hasn't made any announcements about her giving since she acknowledged $2bn in gifts in 2024, bringing her total to $19.2bn. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is now about $34bn.

Her unusual donations – which are much larger than most foundations give at one time and carry no restrictions on when they can be used or what they can be used for – financially strengthened the non-profits that received them, said Phil Buchanan, president of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which studied Scott's giving over three years.

“We didn't see the fears people predicted come to pass,” said Buchanan, who disclosed that The Center for Effective Philanthropy received a one-time $10m grant from Scott. Though some worried that the large gifts would cause the recipients to increase staffing too much or hurt their fundraising efforts, Buchanan said their study of 2,000 nonprofits saw little evidence of that. “Folks are pretty prudent,” he said. “This shows that if you carefully vet nonprofits, we can trust them to make good use of funds.”

It's a lesson that UNCF hopes other funders will learn, following Scott's example.

“We are deeply grateful for MacKenzie Scott's continued support,” Lomax said. “By entrusting UNCF to decide how best to use these funds, she affirms that HBCUs merit investment at this scale and her generosity will strengthen our member institutions and provide pathways to success for tomorrow's changemakers.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Suspect accused of firing into KXTV lobby left notes citing politics and Trump allies, court docs show

A man accused of shooting up an ABC affiliate station in Sacramento, California, on Friday may have been motivated by the network's suspension of talkshow host Jimmy Kimmel, prosecutors say.

There's “circumstantial evidence” that Anibal Hernandez Santana, 64, had “a political motive behind” the shooting, Sacramento county district attorney Thien Ho said. “There are some indications here that the motive behind the shooting of the ABC news station was political in kind,” Ho remarked.

The county prosecutor noted that Hernandez allegedly “chose a very particular target, and with … notes that he left behind” along with Kimmel's temporary suspension, “there's circumstantial evidence there to show that this was a politically motivated crime by this individual”.

The statement comes as Kimmel was due to return to his late night TV hosting slot Tuesday, though Sinclair, which owns numerous ABC broadcast affiliates, has said it will not carry the show.

Kimmel had criticized the Trump administration's reaction to the killing of rightwing youth organizer Charlie Kirk on 10 September in Utah. In turn, the chair of the Federal Communications Commission – who is loyal to Donald Trump – had threatened to pull ABC affiliate broadcast licenses if the network did not act against Kimmel.

According to a federal complaint filed Monday by the US attorney's office in Sacramento, Hernandez wrote a note invoking late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, once a friend of Trump – and said that high-level officials of the president's administration were “next” while making reference to FBI director Kash Patel, the agency's deputy director Dan Bongino and US attorney general Pam Bondi.

The complaint said that during a search of Hernandez's home and vehicle, law enforcement discovered a weekly planner attached to his refrigerator.

Under “Friday,” there was a handwritten note that read: “Do the Next Scary Thing.” Law enforcement also found in his car a handwritten note that read: “For hiding Epstein & ignoring red flags. Do not support Patel, Bongino, & AG Pam Bondi. They're next. – C.K. from above.”

State authorities first arrested Hernandez in connection with the gunfire at KXTV. The FBI then arrested him soon after he was released on bail Saturday.

Federal prosecutors on Monday have charged Hernandez with possessing a firearm within a school zone, discharging a firearm within a school zone and interfering with a radio communication station.

Prosecutors say Hernandez fired three shots through a window into the lobby of KXTV – and one from across the street “in the direction of the station”, which is near a school.

A demonstration had taken place outside KXTV's offices a day earlier.

A statement by Hernandez's said that his client is entitled to due process. “He is innocent unless and until he is found otherwise,” the lawyer, Mark Reichel, said. He said Hernandez would plead not guilty in both the state and federal cases against him. A detention hearing is tentatively scheduled for Thursday.

Hernandez is described in court documents as a former political lobbyist. He reportedly worked for more than two decades as a legislative advocate for healthcare, tribal and labor interests and other organizations.

Officials at ABC's parent company Disney said in a statement on Monday that Jimmy Kimmel Live! would return to the airwaves and explained that it had made “the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country”.

“It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive,” the statement said. “We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

The station Hernandez is said to have fired on is owned by Tegna rather than Sinclair. Sinclair and Nexstar had said they would pre-empt Kimmel's show on its ABC affiliates over the host's Kirk comments prior to the temporary suspension imposed by the network.

A statement from Nexstar on Tuesday said it would follow Sinclair's lead as far as pre-empting Kimmel's show despite his suspension being brought to an end.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US agency dismantled hidden telecom network that would have unleashed chaos ahead of UN general assembly

US politics – live updates

While close to 150 world leaders prepared to descend on Manhattan for the UN general assembly, the US Secret Service was quietly dismantling a massive hidden telecom network across the New York area – a system investigators say could have crippled cell towers, jammed 911 calls and flooded networks with chaos at the very moment the city was most vulnerable.

The cache, made up of more than 300 sim servers packed with over 100,000 sim cards and clustered within 35 miles (56km) of the United Nations, represents one of the most sweeping communications threats uncovered on US soil. Investigators warn the system could have blacked out cellular service in a city that relies on it not only for daily life but for emergency response and counter-terrorism.

Coming as foreign leaders filled midtown hotels and motorcades clogged Manhattan, officials on Tuesday said the takedown highlights a new frontier of risk: plots aimed at the invisible infrastructure that keeps a modern city connected.

The network was uncovered as part of a broader Secret Service investigation into telecommunications threats targeting senior government officials, according to investigators. Spread across multiple sites, the servers functioned like banks of mock cellphones, able to generate mass calls and texts, overwhelm local networks and mask encrypted communications criminals, officials said.

“It can't be understated what this system is capable of doing,” said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office. “It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? … You can't text message, you can't use your cellphone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with [the UN general assembly], you know, use your imagination there – it could be catastrophic to the city.”

Officials said they haven't uncovered a direct plot to disrupt the UN general assembly and note there are no known credible threats to New York City.

Bloomberg noted that it was unclear if the so-called “smishing” network was linked to incidents earlier this year when there were attempts to impersonate White house chief of staff Susie Wiles and secretary of state Marco Rubio.

A US state department cable sent over the summer that an unknown person left voice and text messages for at least five people, including “three foreign ministers, a US governor and a US member of Congress” after creating a Signal account that falsely posed as Rubio's.

The outlet said that the UK had already taken steps to restrict so-called sim farms when the home office announced a ban on the possession or supply of sim farms without a legitimate reason.

It cited the role of sim farms in “smishing” – a word derived from SMS texting and email “phishing” – that use fake text messages to impersonate commercial services or induce recipients into downloading malware, share sensitive information or sending money to cybercriminals.

Forensic analysis of the New York discovery is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors – perpetrators from particular countries – used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point.

“We need to do forensics on 100,000 cellphones, essentially all the phone calls, all the text messages, anything to do with communications, see where those numbers end up,” McCool said, noting that the process will take time.

When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with sim cards. More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network's capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and sim cards alone.

The operation had the capability of sending up to 30m text messages a minute, McCool said.

“The US Secret Service's protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled,” the agency's director, Sean Curran, said in a statement.

Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, when networks collapsed under strain. In this case, he said, attackers would have been able to force that kind of shutdown at a time of their choosing.

“Could there be others?” said McCool. “It'd be unwise to think that there's not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

MAEBASHI — A blue-eyed doll on display at the main entrance of Tone Elementary School in Numata, Gunma Prefecture, is one of 12,739 dolls gifted as a token of friendship by the United States before World War II.

While many of them were targets of hatred as dolls of the enemy and destroyed, this school's doll, named Mary-chan, was hidden away in a cupboard and survived unscathed. The doll is now preserved as a reminder of the importance of peace for children.

Mitsu Araki, 97, from Maebashi, first saw Mary-chan in 1934 when she entered the then Azumamura elementary and junior high school in Numata, where her father, Takeo Kaneko, served as vice principal. Araki said she still remembered when she first encountered the 40-centimeter-tall doll sitting on a cabinet in the school staff room and thought Mary-chan was “cute, with strong features different from Japanese dolls, and wearing a pretty cape.”

The blue-eyed dolls were gifted to Japanese kindergartens and elementary schools by a private group in the United States in 1927. Following the enforcement of the Immigration Act of 1924, which banned immigration from Japan to the United States, a missionary with a positive view on Japan was concerned about bilateral relations souring and called upon Americans to send friendship dolls to Japanese children. Of the 12,739 dolls collected, about 140 arrived in Gunma Prefecture. Mary-chan was one of those dolls.

Welcoming ceremonies were held across the prefecture, and the dolls “met” Japanese dolls brought by children at the Hina Matsuri Doll Festival in March. The situation changed dramatically when the war between Japan and the United States began in 1941. They were seen as dolls from an enemy country, and many were stabbed with bamboo spears or burned.

At the Azumamura school, teachers had many meetings to discuss what to do with Mary-chan, but no conclusion was reached. Kaneko, who was entrusted with the decision, thought he could not destroy the doll because it came as a messenger of peace. He hid it in a sewing room cabinet while on night duty.

Back then, his students were being drafted one after another, and Araki said, “My father may have been making a plea, saying ‘I am protecting you, so please don't take the lives of Japan's young people.'”

Mary-chan saw the light of day again in 1966. It was found when the school building was being demolished to build a new one. After its story was featured on a television program in 1973, other friendship dolls were discovered nationwide, with over 300 confirmed to date.

During the war, Araki studied at the prefectural teacher's school in Maebashi while living in the dormitory. She did not know that her father was agonizing over the doll. Even after the war ended, he had never spoke of the hidden doll to others. However, after the TV program, he started talking about the doll with his family.

“I want to honor him for his courage to hide the doll and wish for peace,” Araki said as she reminisced about her deeply sincere father.

Araki visited her alma mater for the first time in 13 years last spring to meet Mary-chan at the entrance. It will soon be 100 years since the doll's arrival in Japan.

“Thank you for your long service,” she said.

Another doll also called Mary-chan is at Niragawa Elementary School in Ota, the same prefecture. The then principal hid it away in a cupboard as “the doll did nothing wrong.”

This Mary-chan is displayed in the principal's office but had been exhibited at the city's Nittanosho History Museum until the end of August.

The exhibition was organized by Tetsuya Maezawa, 65, a modern military history researcher and historical writer. His uncle, who graduated from Niragawa, died in battle in the Philippines in 1945 at the age of 25. Maezawa displayed a panel photo of his uncle in the exhibition.

“I was finally able to reunite my uncle with Mary-chan. I hope children will feel how precious peace is,” Maezawa said.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and will be updated.

Airports in Copenhagen and Oslo suspended operations for several hours late on Sept. 22 following drone sightings in the area, forcing flight diversions and disrupting travel for thousands of passengers.""CPH (Copenhagen) Airport is currently closed for takeoffs and landings, as two to three larger drones have been observed flying in the area,"" the police said in a statement posted on X at approximately 8:46 p.m. local time. 

A spokesperson confirmed to Reuters that all traffic at Denmark's largest airport had been suspended but declined to provide further details. At least 15 flights were diverted to other airports, according to flight-tracking site FlightRadar24.

Elsewhere in the region, two foreign nationals were arrested in Oslo for flying drones near a military site. 

""Two foreign nationals arrested for drone flying within the prohibited zone,"" Oslo police reported at 9:10 p.m. local time.

Copenhagen Airport reopened at around 0:30 a.m. local time after being shut for nearly four hours. In Norway's Oslo, flights also resumed following roughly four hours of restricted airspace.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the incident must be viewed in the context of recent cyberattacks against European airports and Russian aerial incursions inside NATO territory.

Many European NATO members have been on edge after recent airspace violations by Russian drones in Poland and Romania and fighter jets in Estonia.

When asked whether Copenhagen suspects Russian involvement in the latest incident, Frederiksen said the option cannot be ruled out.

""I cannot rule out that it is Russia. We have seen drones over Poland that should not have been there. We have seen activity in Romania. We have seen violations of Estonian airspace,"" Frederiksen said.

""Therefore, I can only say that, in my view, this is a serious attack on critical Danish infrastructure.""

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed suggestions of Russian involvement as ""unfounded.""

The type of the detected drones was not disclosed. Copenhagen's deputy police inspector said at a press conference that Danish police will work with Norwegian authorities to determine whether the two incidents are connected.

""We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,"" Danish Police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told journalists on Sept. 23. ""It's an actor who has the capabilities, the will, and the tools to show off in this way.""

Swedish outlet Sydsvenskeren reported that several flights were diverted to Malmo, a city in southern Sweden, located east of Copenhagen across the Oresund strait that separates the two countries.

Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are all NATO members and have been staunch allies of Ukraine since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.

""The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft. This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders,"" Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

""Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia,"" U.S. President Donald Trump told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.

""Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,"" NATO said in a statement. 



Former detainees reported experiencing a broad array of torture and ill-treatment during their captivity. Commonly described methods included severe beatings with various objects such as batons and sticks,  electric shocks to different body parts, mock executions, kickings, threats of death, and violence directed either to a detainee or their loved ones, according to the report.

Ukrainian forces struck the 8-N linear production dispatching station near the village of Naitopovichi in Russia's Bryansk Oblast overnight on Sept. 23, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The IMF reportedly persuaded Ukraine to raise its initial $38 billion estimate to $65 billion after a protracted disagreement on the issue.

All flights at Denmark's Copenhagen Airport were halted after police reported two to three large drones in the area.

Victor Tregubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, also denied these claims, saying that Russia is trying to advance toward Kupiansk from the north.

""The door is always open for allies,"" Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in response to the Telegraph's question whether the Baltic NATO ally is ready to host the U.K.'s nuclear-capable aircraft in the future.

Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi said on Sept. 17 that a bug had been discovered inside one of the phones on his desk, specifically in the phone's charging stand, which also served as a holder.

Polish national Jerzy Tyc was the head of the Kursk Association, an organization involved in restoring Soviet war memorials in Poland.

The Kyiv Independent has launched a new newsletter — “One story from Ukraine” — designed to bring readers essential stories from Ukraine directly to their inbox.

A listening device was found in the office of Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi after several top Ukrainian officials and foreign guests had visited, he said in an interview with Ukrainska Pravda published on Sept. 23.

His comments come days after he first revealed on Sept. 17 that a bug had been discovered inside one of the phones on his desk, specifically in the phone's charging stand, which also served as a holder.

Andrii Sadovyi, 57, has served as mayor of the western city of Lviv since 2006 and has been elected to the position four times.

Sadovyi said that the phone started malfunctioning and was sent for repairs, where the listening device was discovered. The mayor said he rarely used that particular phone, but believes the device may have recorded conversations held in his office.

Over the past month, Sadovyi met there with Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Parliamentary Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk, and several foreign visitors.

""If those conversations go public, it's not great. Although, to be honest, we didn't say anything particularly special,"" said Sadovyi.

According to the mayor, so far, no one has confirmed whether there was a court order authorizing the bugging in his office.

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) is investigating the case.

Editor's note: The story was updated with additional details.

Estonia is ""always open"" to hosting allied forces, including British nuclear-capable F-35A fighter jets, Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur told the Telegraph in comments published on Sept. 23.

""The door is always open for allies,"" Pevkur said in response to the Telegraph's question whether the Baltic country is ready to host the U.K.'s nuclear-capable aircraft in the future.

The comments come days after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets entered Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Sept. 19 and remained there for 12 minutes before departing. Tallinn said the jets crossed without permission, while Moscow denied any violation.

The incident led to a further escalation of tensions between NATO and Russia after a Russian drone also entered Romanian airspace, and several other were downed over Poland.

The U.K., one of the three nuclear powers in NATO alongside the U.S. and France, unveiled plans to purchase at least 12 nuclear-capable American-made F-35A fighter jets by the end of the year.

Unlike other F-35 jets the British military already operates, these models are capable of carrying B61 nuclear bombs, as well as conventional arms.

Estonia, a Baltic country at Russia's border, lacks its own fighter jets. Therefore, it relies on NATO allies — including the U.K. — for air policing.

An undisclosed source connected to the British military told the Telegraph that the U.K. may decide not to send the nuclear-capable jets to Estonia, as they would ""act less as a deterrence, more as an agitator.""

Pevkur confirmed already in June that his country is ready to host NATO jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, drawing backlash from the Kremlin.

Separately, Pevkur warned on Sept. 20 that Russian provocations are aimed at forcing NATO countries to focus on their own defense rather than helping Ukraine.

""And when we start talking about whether we should bring in more fighter jets or air defense systems, this is exactly what Russia wants — to divert our attention away from helping Ukraine, and to focus on our own backyard,"" the minister told the Estonian parliament's defense and foreign affairs committee.

The latest incursion prompted calls across Europe to shoot down Russian aircraft in case of violations. Pevkur warned that such a step should be approached with caution, but stressed the alliance is prepared to use force if necessary.

NATO allies met to discuss the incident on the morning of Sept. 23 after Estonia invoked Article 4 — the second time the alliance met for consultations under this article this month after the Russian incursion into Polish airspace on Sept. 10.

The alliance called the violation of Estonian airspace ""part of a wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behavior.""

""Russia should be in no doubt: NATO and allies will employ, in accordance with international law, all necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves and deter all threats from all directions,"" the statement read.

""We will continue to respond in the manner, timing, and domain of our choosing. Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.""

NATO previously announced the launch of the Eastern Sentry mission, which aims to curtail Russia's ability to interfere in alliance members' airspace.

""The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft. This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders,"" Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

""Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia,"" U.S. President Donald Trump told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.

""Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,"" NATO said in a statement. 



Former detainees reported experiencing a broad array of torture and ill-treatment during their captivity.

Kenvue KVUE-N  bounced back sharply at the opening bell Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump instructed pregnant women around a dozen times during the White House news conference Monday, also urging mothers not to give their infants the drug, known by the generic name acetaminophen in the U.S. or paracetamol in most other countries.

Shares of the New Jersey consumer brands company tumbled 7.5 per cent Monday. At the open of trading, shares bounced back by more than 6 per cent.

The announcement, which appeared to rely on existing studies rather than significant new research, arrives as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic, advances the Make America Healthy Again movement that has focused on what it sees as potential causes of autism.

Kenvue disputed any link between the drug and autism this week and warned that if pregnant mothers don't use Tylenol when in need, they could face a dangerous choice between suffering fevers or using riskier alternatives.

What the research says about Tylenol, pregnancy and autism

Kenvue was spun off from Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical and medical device divisions in 2023 because it was thought that the companies could function more efficiently if they were independent from each other. Aside from Tylenol, the consumer health company makes Band-Aids, Listerine and other household brand names.

Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni wrote that he sees a limited risk of new lawsuits after Trump's announcement, but thinks “there could be risk to Tylenol consumption given the negative headlines.”

Falorni anticipates a positive reaction for Kenvue's stock at the opening bell on Tuesday given the lack of new scientific evidence.

The company has fought hundreds of lawsuits related to the product and its alleged ties to autism, but most have been dismissed.

Tylenol made headlines in the 1980s when seven people in the Chicago area were killed after taking the over-the-counter painkiller laced with cyanide. The incident triggered a nationwide panic and led to an overhaul in the safety of over-the-counter medication packaging. No one was ever charged in the deaths.

Canada has dropped two legal challenges of United States duties on Canadian softwood lumber.

The U.S. has long accused Canada's softwood lumber sector of violating rules on anti-dumping – flooding a market with cheaper, subsidized products to disrupt a domestic industry.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced plans last month to nearly triple duties on Canadian softwood lumber to just over 20 per cent.

The Wall Street Journal first reported this week that Canada dropped long-standing appeals earlier this month on two U.S. anti-dumping reviews dating back to the previous decade.

Analysis: Can Canada finally sell more of its lumber overseas?

Lumber prices haven't bottomed yet. Here's when they will

Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman Dina Destin says Canada made the decision after consulting with industry players and provinces, and in the interest of securing a long-term deal on softwood lumber with the United States.

She says Canada still believes U.S. anti-dumping duties on softwood lumber are unfair and Ottawa is still pursuing six other legal challenges on the matter.

The West African states, led by military juntas, said they don't recognize the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction and want to create ""indigenous mechanisms"" to secure peace and justice.

Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger on Monday announced their withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC).

In a joint statement, the military-led West African states said that the court's jurisdiction had ""transformed into an instrument of neocolonial repression in the hands of imperialism.""

Because of this, the neighboring states accused the ICC of becoming ""a global example of selective justice.""

""The ICC has proven itself incapable of handling and prosecuting proven war crimes, crimes against humanity, crimes of genocide, and crimes of aggression,"" the West African states said.

The military-led countries have previously used this same argument to justify their withdrawal from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

The three states also said they wanted to create ""indigenous mechanisms for the consolidation of peace and justice"".

The juntas, which toppled the governments in Bamako, Ouagadougou and Niamey after coups between 2020 and 2023, have since formed a confederation called the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).

They have actively distanced themselves from the West, notably from former colonial ruler France and have moved closer toward Russia for military cooperation.

The West African countries are currently in the grip of deadly violence from jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda and the so-called ""Islamic State"", but their armies have also been accused of committing crimes against civilians. 

The ICC is a permanent international tribunal to prosecute individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. It is intended to complement existing national judicial systems.

The court is headquartered in The Hague, and has prosecuted some of the world's worst crimes such as genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity since 2002.

Global powers, the United States, China, and Russia are not members of the ICC because they have not ratified the Rome Statute, which is the treaty which established the court.

Israel is also not a member and does not recognize ICC jurisdiction over its nationals or territory.

Donald Trump has strongly criticized the United Nations in his speech to the UN General Assembly, where leaders from over 140 countries have gathered. DW has more.

Read below for a roundup of the latest news, analyses and videos on the United Nations' 80th General Assembly session on September 23, 2025.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Germany's recognizing of the state of Palestine was ""a question of when.""

Speaking to DW's chief political editor, Michaela Küfner, in New York as the UN marks its 80th anniversary, Wadephul said EU member states ""are all united in the goal of a two-state solution"" and ""only the question of when to recognize the state of Palestine is dividing us.""

Unlike the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France and other Western allies of Israel, Germany has yet to formally recognize Palestinian statehood.

""You know that Germany is reluctant to do this step. It's more a question of time, of course, because we are engaged in building a Palestinian state, but that needs some time, and that needs especially negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians,"" Wadephul said when asked about European allies' recognition of Palestinian statehood.

On the infringement of Estonian airspace and Denmark's reports of a drone attack, Wadephul said NATO was standing together ""very firmly"" and making it clear that ""we defend every inch of NATO territory."" 

Wadephul said ""a flexible response"" was always NATO's strategy.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan used his UN General Assembly address Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.

""A genocide is continuing in Gaza,"" Erdogan said. ""Even as we meet here innocent people are dying.""

He said he was speaking ""on behalf of the Palestinian people,"" who he said had been silenced.

""There is no war in Gaza, there are no two sides. This is an invasion, a genocide, a policy of mass massacre,"" he added.

The Turkish leader's comments come after an independent commission of the UN Human Rights Council found that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.

During his speech, Erdogan held up photos of women waiting for rations, an emaciated child and a street filled with displaced Palestinians.

US President Donald Trump called renewable energy a ""joke"" and the idea of man-made climate change ""the greatest con job ever.""

Trump made the remarks during a wide-ranging speech to world leaders at the UN General Assembly.

The US leader's denial of climate change goes against the overwhelming scientific consensus that fossil fuels and climate change are going to have devastating consequences for the environment and for humanity.

Trump also accused other nations of violating rules on pollution, even though the US continues to be one of the world's most worst polluters.

The US president also repeating his criticism of ""open border"" migration policies.

""Immigration and the high cost of so called green, renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet. Countries that cherish freedom are fading fast,"" Trump said.

""We need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again,"" he said as he concluded his speech, which lasted nearly an hour — well over the 15 minutes allotted to each speaker.

US President Donald Trump questioned the purpose of the United Nations in his speech to the General Assembly, saying the UN had ""so much potential"" that it hadn't realized.

""Empty words don't solve wars,"" he said, seeming to accuse the body of inaction, after he took credit for saving ""millions of lives"" by stopping seven wars, though he did not clarify which ones he was referring to.

""A dramatically better future is within our reach,"" he said, but added that the world would have to leave behind ""the failures of the past.""

In a series of statements in which he addressed his and his wife's physical fitness, his real estate acquisitions and interior design, Trump also made a joke about a teleprompter that stalled mid-speech.

He took aim at Iran, calling it the ""world's number one state sponsor of terrorism,"" before blaming Tehran for ending the nuclear deal that he pulled out of during his first term. 

Trump also called on Hamas to release the Israeli hostages still believed to be held in Gaza, to mild applause. He added that ""the war in Gaza has to stop.""

But he condemned recent announcements from Western nations recognizing Palestinian statehood, saying the moves are a ""reward"" for Hamas.

He went on to criticize China and India for ""funding the war in Ukraine"" by continuing to do business with Russia, as well as European allies for continuing to buy Russian oil and gas.

He also called ""uncontrolled migration"" the greatest issue of the present age, and accused the UN of funding it, though he did not cite evidence for this claim.

Brazil President Lula da Silva was the first head of government to address the General Assembly on Tuesday.

The left-wing leader used the opportunity to warn that ""anti-democratic forces"" were targeting institutions such as the UN.

""Throughout the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms,"" he said.

In what was seen as a jab at US President Donald Trump, who had supported his predecessor, the far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, da Silva said, ""Brazil sent a message to all aspiring autocrats and those who support them: Our democracy, our sovereignty, are nonnegotiable.""

Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his attempt to overturn the results of Brazil's presidential election. Trump had threatened massive tariffs on the South American nation over the case.

One world leader who won't be addressing the United Nations General Assembly is German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. 

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is representing Germany as Merz stays home to focus on the federal budget week and a key Constitutional Court election in the Bundestag.

The Green Party has criticized Merz for staying in Germany.

Agnieszka Brugger, who is deputy parliamentary leader of the Greens, warned that his absence could hurt Germany's security, prosperity and bid for a non-permanent UN Security Council seat next year, saying the country ""cannot afford"" such disengagement in serious times.

Check out our blog from DW's newsroom in Bonn for more of the stories that Germany is talking about.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that reductions in development aid are ""wreaking havoc."" 

As he addressed the General Assembly, Guterres did not name specific countries, but said the cuts threaten futures around the world. His remarks came ahead of a scheduled speech by the US president, whose government has made significant aid reductions.

""Development aid cuts are wreaking havoc,"" said Guterres. ""They are a death sentence for many. A stolen future for many more.""

""This is the paradox of our time: We know what we need — yet we are pulling away the very lifeline that makes it possible.""

Guterres also called on member states to reaffirm international law and condemn nations ""acting as if rules don't apply to them.""

""Far too many crises continue unchecked. Impunity prevails. Lawlessness is a contagion. It invites mayhem, accelerates terror, and risks a nuclear free-for-all,"" he said.

The UN leader highlighted civilian suffering in Sudan and urged all sides to protect civilians. He also called for a lasting ceasefire and peace in Ukraine.

Guterres said ""nothing can justify"" the October 7, 2023, attacks in Israel, and pressed for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, more humanitarian aid to the territory and the release of all hostages.

A video went viral on TikTok on Tuesday morning, apparently showing French President Emmanuel Macron attempting to get to the UN building — only to be blocked by President Trump's motorcade.

In the video, Macron speaks with a New York police officer who does not appear to understand who the French president is.

Macron then gets on the phone with Trump to ask what can be done while walking down the street.

The US Secret Service said it dismantled a network of about 100,000 SIM cards in New York that agents suspected were part of a plan to disrupt communications during the UN General Assembly.

""In addition to carrying out anonymous telephonic threats, these devices could be used to conduct a wide range of telecommunications attacks,"" the agency said in a statement.

""This includes disabling cell phone towers, enabling denial of services attacks and facilitating anonymous, encrypted communication between potential threat actors and criminal enterprises.""

Without naming exactly who they thought was behind the plan, the Secret Service said the threat was linked to ""nation-state"" actors.

The United Kingdom, Canada and Australia have formally recognized a Palestinian state. The move comes in the run-up to the UN General Assembly in New York.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the recognition would endanger Israel's existence and reward Hamas terror.

DW News asked Middle East analyst Fawaz Gerges for his assessment.

Fifty countries founded the United Nations after World War II, pledging to promote global peace and human rights.

Eighty years later, as divisions deepen, the United Nations is struggling to overcome deadlocked conflicts, such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

The relevance of the United Nations in a world of unresolved crises is being questioned by many.

Further highlighting tensions at the UN General Assembly is the fact that Brazil, Spain and Chile are hosting a high-level meeting on the sidelines to discuss the state of global democracy.

Unlike in previous years, the United States has not been invited. This reflects changing global perceptions about the health of American democracy amidst increasing clampdowns from the Trump administration on free speech, immigration, and the neutrality of the courts.

Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa will be the first head of government from Damascus to attend the UN General Assembly since 1967.

The last Syrian leader to attend was President Nureddin al-Atassi, who ruled the country before the Assad family came to power in 1971.

The international community has tentatively accepted the legitimacy of al-Sharaa's government amid his promises to walk back some of the more extreme positions his HTS group used to be known for and promises to hold free elections.

However, the current Syrian government has been criticized for excluding areas with Kurdish and Druze majorities, such as Sweida, where sporadic fighting has broken out.

Tuesday and Wednesday will see dozens of world leaders address the General Assembly. The very first speaker will be Brazilian President Lula da Silva, followed by US President Donald Trump, who has supported da Silva's predecessor and rival Jair Bolsonaro.

Also included in the morning sessions will be President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. King Abdullah II of Jordan and Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar are also scheduled.

In the afternoon, French President Emmanuel Macron and Poland's Karol Nawrocki will address the gathering, amongst others.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Wes Streeting has urged the public to pay no attention whatsoever to Donald Trump after his comments linking paracetamol to autism.

The Health Secretary spoke out after the US president claimed the drug “is no good” and urged pregnant women to “fight like hell” to avoid taking it.

Many medical experts have criticised the comments, calling them dangerous.

On Tuesday, Mr Streeting said “I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this”.

He told ITV's Lorraine: “I've just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.

“In fact, a major study was done back in 2024 in Sweden, involving 2.4 million children, and it did not uphold those claims.

“So I would just say to people watching, don't pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don't take even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists, the NHS.

“It's really important that a time when you know there is scepticism – and I don't think scepticism itself, asking questions is in itself a bad thing, by all means, ask questions – but we've got to follow medical science.”

The US president and Robert F Kennedy Jnr, his health secretary, told pregnant women to “fight like hell” to avoid taking Tylenol, a brand name for the painkiller.

A spokesman for Kenvue, Tylenol's manufacturer, has denied that the painkiller is linked to autism, while British medical experts condemned the “fearmongering” in the US over the suggestion.

Mr Trump also pledged to increase production of the “amazing” drug leucovorin, which is typically used to treat the side effects of cancer medications, for use with autism patients.

Early medical trials have shown that leucovorin could help children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) speak to and understand others better. However, researchers have argued that larger studies are needed.

Mr Trump announced a wide-ranging effort to study the causes of ASD including a long-debunked theory that blames vaccines and described the moves by his administration as “historic”.

His claims over the unproven, and in some cases discredited, ties between Tylenol and autism have been met with criticism by scientists and researchers, who also voiced alarm over Mr Trump's rush to present drugs and solutions before proper research has been carried out.

Mr Kennedy claimed during the press conference: “The FDA is responding to clinical and laboratory studies that suggest a potential association between acetaminophen [paracetamol] used during pregnancy and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including later diagnosis for ADHD and autism.”

Mr Trump also said parents should not give their children the painkiller, before more broadly urging: “Ideally, you don't take it at all.”

The FDA issued a notice to physicians that struck a more measured tone, pointing out that while some research suggested a link, “a causal relationship has not been established” between acetaminophen and autism.

Mr Kennedy singled out the Amish community, whose use of prescription drugs is generally low, as potential evidence that the drug was contributing to a rise in autism among children.

“I think I can say that there are certain groups of people that don't take vaccines and don't take any pills, that have no autism,” Mr Trump said, deferring to Mr Kennedy, who referred to Amish communities.

Mr Trump also added to long-debunked claims that ingredients in vaccines or that timing shots close together could contribute to rising rates of autism in the US.

The president claimed, without evidence, that hepatitis B vaccines should not be given until children are 12 years old, and that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) jab should be taken “separately”.

“When you mix them, there could be a problem. So there's no downside in taking them separately,” Mr Trump said. “When chickenpox got mixed in, it really was bad. There's no reason to give a baby that's almost just born hepatitis B.”

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists denounced Mr Trump's announcement as “irresponsible”.

“Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” Dr Steven Fleischman, the organisation's president, said in a statement.

The Trump administration's announcement was also met with significant concern in the UK.

Dr Alison Cave, the chief safety officer at the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said: “Patient safety is our top priority. There is no evidence that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism in children.”

She added: “Our advice on medicines in pregnancy is based on rigorous assessment of the best available scientific evidence. Any new evidence that could affect our recommendations would be carefully evaluated by our independent scientific experts.”

Professor Claire Anderson, the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: “Paracetamol has been used safely by millions of people for decades, including during pregnancy, when taken as directed.

“A large study conducted in 2024 found no evidence of a link between paracetamol use in pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children.”

Recommended

Mr Trump has vowed to address rising autism rates as a major health priority for his administration.

Mr Kennedy, who has spent decades spreading misinformation about vaccines, has claimed, without providing evidence, that the US is in the grip of an “autism epidemic” fuelled by “environmental toxins”.

Since becoming the top US health official, he has repeatedly suggested MMR shots are linked to autism. It did not appear that Mr Trump was making this link on Tuesday. That link has been widely debunked, but it continues to contribute to a decline in vaccine uptake across the US.

“When you mix them, there could be a problem. So there's no downside in taking them separately,” Mr Trump said.

However, spacing out the shots can lead to an increased risk that children become infected with a vaccine-preventable disease before returning for another visit.

MMR vaccination rates have been declining across the US, fuelled by misinformation that vaccines are harmful often put forward by Mr Kennedy.

It has resulted in a spike of measles outbreaks in under-vaccinated communities, including this month in Texas, Utah and Arizona. Health officials say the US is experiencing the highest number of cases in more than 30 years.

In recent decades, autism is being diagnosed at higher rates amongst children, particularly in the US. Experts say it is likely due to increased awareness, testing and the broadening definition of ASD.

Monday's press conference was a culmination of efforts by Mr Kennedy's “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement that has been pushing for answers on the causes of autism, and repeatedly suggesting links between vaccines and autism – claims not supported by science.

In June, Mr Kennedy sacked the entire US vaccine committee, known as the ACIP, replacing them with those who share his anti-vaccine beliefs.

The White House is “systematically destroying” protections for renters and homeowners, Sen. Elizabeth Warren says.

A group of whistleblowers from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) alleges that the agency is abdicating its duty to enforce federal civil rights and fair housing laws. 

On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) sent a letter to Brian Harrison, the acting inspector general for HUD, urging him to investigate the allegations. 

“Right now, if you're a mom protecting your kids from living with an abusive father, or if you're getting denied a mortgage because of the color of your skin, you have civil rights protection under U.S. law,” Warren said in a video posted to X on Monday. 

She continued: “But the Trump administration has been systematically destroying these federal protections for renters and homeowners, and now new internal documents shared with my office from whistleblowers inside the Department of Housing and Urban Development show the extent of the Trump administration's attack on civil rights and show how the administration appears to be ignoring the law.” 

Warren's letter to Harrison quotes extensively from a “Letter by Named and Anonymous OFH [Office of Fair Housing] Attorneys” sent to the senator.

HUD leadership, they wrote, has “placed the Department on an unalterable course towards violating its statutory and regulatory obligations to safeguard the equal distribution of federal funds, to combat housing discrimination in the public and private sectors, and to protect the lives of countless survivors of domestic violence.”

The attorneys allege that HUD staff were told that “fair housing was ‘not a priority' of the administration, that less civil rights work would be performed under this administration, and that there was an ‘optics problem' with [OFH] being as large as it was,” as per Warren's letter. 

Warren condemned the idea that “optics” should have an effect on the enforcement of federal civil rights laws. 

“Imagine thinking that defending Black families from being denied a mortgage because they're Black, or protecting a mom and her kids from living with an abusive father is a quote, optics problem,” Warren said in the video. “Imagine thinking that it's an optics problem to help the dad with a bad knee whose landlord refuses to install a handrail on the stairs.”

A New York Times investigation, published on Monday, found that “internal communications, memos and other documents …. show efforts by the Trump administration to limit enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, the landmark civil rights law that has prohibited discrimination in housing for nearly six decades.”

The Times reports that since Trump's second presidential term began, “hundreds of pending fair housing cases were frozen, and some settlements revoked, even when accusations of discrimination had been substantiated.”

In addition to enforcing anti-discrimination laws, HUD is tasked with implementing the housing provisions in the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA.) 

“In its 2022 reauthorization of VAWA, Congress expanded HUD's role in implementing VAWA, and OFH became ‘instrumental in ensuring that survivors [of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and/or human trafficking] are provided with emergency transfers to safe housing and that they are not retraumatized by being evicted because of an assault,'” Warren wrote.

But HUD leadership has reassigned 75 percent of the VAWA team, including its supervisors, which would leave just two attorneys in the unit, according to the whistleblowers. 

“These are life and death requests,” HUD attorney Paul Osadebe told the Times. “These women are legitimately in mortal danger, and often without the government stepping in, nothing will be done.”

The Times reports that Osadebe and other HUD attorneys filed a federal lawsuit on Monday seeking to halt their reassignments. 

“This is a deliberate plan, and it's about shutting down fair housing,” said Osadebe, who is also an organizer with the Federal Unionists Network, a coalition of federal workers fighting the Trump administration's mass layoffs and budget cuts. 

Before Trump took office, HUD's Office of Fair Housing employed 31 people, according to Warren's letter. There are now just 11 staff members, including six staff attorneys. The whistleblowers allege that HUD officials told OFH attorneys “they could go to almost any other office [within the agency]; they must simply abandon fair housing work,” according to Warren's letter. 

“The Trump administration is firing and reassigning as many people from the Civil Rights Office as they possibly can, and why?” the senator said in the video posted on X. “To make it impossible for the few staff that remain to actually do their jobs and help people the way the law says.”

Before becoming president, Donald Trump was a real estate developer and property owner. In the 1970s, the Department of Justice sued Trump and his father for refusing to rent to prospective Black tenants in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Trump hired Roy Cohn, a virulent anti-communist, to defend him. The Trumps eventually settled the case, but the Justice Department later accused them of violating the terms of the settlement.

 More Drones and Missiles Are All That Can Stop Russia

 Andriy Zagorodnyuk

Ever since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House, officials across Europe have scrambled to craft a peace deal that could work for Ukraine. They know by now that, at the moment, Russian President Vladimir Putin is not interested in stopping his offensives, and they fear that shifting American priorities may leave Ukraine without a critical source of support. As a result, they are racing to find a way to provide Kyiv with security guarantees that could deter Russia and allow for an armistice.

In conversations about security guarantees, officials have tended to focus on a handful of measures: placing a small number of European troops in Ukraine to shore up the country's defense (so-called reassurance forces), levying additional sanctions against Russia, and providing Ukraine with more weapons, including conventional ones. They have also mused about committing themselves, on paper, to Ukraine's defense. Two of these actions—more weapons and sanctions—could take place before any cease-fire. The rest would go into effect only after the fighting ends.

These proposals have certain virtues. But by themselves, they are not enough to guarantee Ukraine's security. Since the start of Russia's invasion in 2022, Putin has been transparent about his objective—the destruction of Ukraine as an independent nation—and has subjected many people to almost unimaginable suffering in order to achieve it. He will not be deterred by words, a smattering of NATO troops, or by more agony (including if it affects Russians). In fact, he will not stop the war unless Russian troops literally cannot advance any further.

Right now, some U.S. and European analysts are pessimistic that Ukraine can completely halt Russia's aggression, and understandably so. NATO countries, after all, have been arming Kyiv for years, and Moscow keeps making incremental gains. But Ukraine need not destroy every element of the Russian military to achieve strategic neutralization—stripping away the enemy of its ability to achieve its objectives. And the conflict has recently changed in ways that have made it easier to freeze. Today, the war is being fought less with traditional military equipment and more with newer, cheaper technologies that Ukraine helped pioneer. In fact, Ukraine has already done a great deal of what's needed to deter Russia for good. But Europe must stop focusing on which traditional capabilities it should provide to Ukraine or on establishing written security guarantees. Instead, the continent should get serious about investing more in Ukraine's war effort by flooding the country with more advanced technologies. It needs to invest heavily in the country's sophisticated defense industry. It must cooperate more directly with Kyiv on matters of military manufacturing and on air defenses. Such measures will indeed be daunting, but not any more than NATO's original effort to help Ukraine. And ultimately, Europe has little choice. They are the only way to bring peace.

Throughout the past century, powerful states have sought to provide security guarantees to weaker partners. Those guarantees, however, have only conferred a real benefit when they created tangible shields. During the Cold War, NATO effectively deterred the Soviet Union because the United States situated substantial forces and firepower on the continent, including some nuclear weapons. In Asia, the mutual defense treaty between South Korea and the United States works to deter a North Korean invasion because tens of thousands of American troops remain on the peninsula, where they jointly plan and train with their South Korean partners. In the 1930s, by contrast, the British and the French backed their pledge to defend Poland with nothing but rhetoric; as a result, Nazi Germany felt free to invade the country. Likewise, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which a consortium of states (including Russia) promised to protect Ukraine's sovereignty if it gave up its nuclear weapons, did nothing to stop Russia from invading its neighbor multiple times because it offered no military resources to Kyiv.

After Russia launched its first invasion of Ukraine, sending troops into Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk in 2014, the United States and Europe did begin supplying Kyiv with defensive and, eventually, offensive assistance. But it was only in late 2021, after it became clear that Russia aimed to invade the entire country, that NATO states got somewhat serious about arming Ukraine. That support, however, proved effective: rather than quickly conquering Ukraine, as much of the world expected, Russia quickly became bogged down.

In fact, in some domains, Ukraine has managed to functionally defeat its enemy. Consider the battle over the Black Sea. From the outset of its full-scale invasion, Russia sought to strangle Ukraine's economy by cutting off its maritime access. Moscow's Black Sea Fleet blockaded Ukrainian ports, occupied Snake Island, and threatened Odessa, the country's main coastal city. Allied attempts to negotiate a partial end to this blockade failed. But by the fall of 2023, the Ukrainian military succeeded in breaking it with naval drones, precision missiles, and air-launched bombs—a substantial portion of which came from the United States. (Ukrainian-made weapons, of course, were also essential to this victory.) Although these strikes only destroyed part of Russia's fleet, Kyiv made it impossible for Putin's ships to sail near Ukraine's main ports, and Moscow was left with no choice but to move most of its fleet to the east.

Ukraine has had success in the air, as well. Russia began its 2022 war confident it could establish air dominance within days, allowing it to quickly march on Kyiv. Instead, Ukraine's innovative defenses have made it impossible for Russia to achieve superiority. In an air denial operation undertaken in the first days of the invasion, now known as Ghost of Kyiv, Ukraine used its limited air capabilities to intercept many Russian fighter jets and effectively push these planes out of its airspace. During its more complex 2025 “Spiderweb” operations, Ukraine has used innovative uncrewed systems to destroy a substantial portion of Russia's strategic aviation fleet, or the aircraft Russia uses to launch numerous cruise missiles at all areas of Ukraine. Kyiv has not been able to make its skies safe enough for commercial air-traffic transit, and it experiences constant missile and long-range drone attacks. But it has been able to force Russian manned aircraft to operate tens of kilometers from the frontlines, launching glide bombs rather than conducting close air support operations to help ground forces.

Fully liberating Ukraine would take more than just such measures, at least for now, and it would require considerable additional capabilities. But strategic neutralization is attainable without waging a multidecade war of attrition. To obviate Russia's threat, Ukraine does not need to kill off every Russian soldier. Instead, it can paralyze the military by targeting essential functions such as logistics, coordination, mobility, and firepower. In this way, it can follow a template pioneered by Israel, which neutralized Egypt's far larger air force in 1967 not by destroying every aircraft but by taking out many of them and eliminating its runways and command systems. As a result, Israel preserved its existence without annihilating vast opposition forces.

Ukraine is closer to paralyzing Russia than most people think. Russia's jets do still strike Ukrainian targets, albeit from a great distance, and Russian ground forces continue to seize small chunks of territory. But with drones, remote mines, precision artillery, and constant surveillance, Ukraine has transformed large stretches of the front into persistent kill zones: areas where forces find it nearly impossible to maneuver without being detected and then immediately hit. Only by throwing thousands upon thousands of troops at Ukrainian targets can Russia advance through a few of these regions. If Ukraine can widen these kill zones—by surveilling more territory and striking behind Russia's current forward lines—and deny Russia the ability to mass men and materiel in its rear, Russian formations will be unable to generate any momentum. Future offensives by Russia would then become strategically futile, and thus not worth attempting.

To succeed, however, Ukraine will need more drones and high-tech weapons. And helping Kyiv get these systems will necessitate that NATO change its presumptions and priorities. When the war broke out, it made sense for the United States and Europe to pump Ukraine full of traditional weapons systems. But as the operational environment has evolved, many legacy systems have become largely obsolete. For instance, some sophisticated assault weapons, such as tanks, are now disabled almost as soon as they enter the kill zone by simpler, cheaper uncrewed aerial vehicles. They therefore do little to help either party.

Ukraine's allies must refocus their attention on helping Ukraine innovate and integrate new technologies at the scale needed to stop Russia. These allies have what they need. Europe alone has financial resources, scientific capabilities, and an industrial base that Russia cannot match. If the continent uses these capacities alongside Ukraine, it could help the Ukrainian military develop and produce many advanced and affordable precise, long-range systems—including missiles and uncrewed aerial vehicles—as well as communications gear, positioning and targeting equipment, air defenses, and electronic warfare systems.



The continent has already taken meaningful steps in this direction. The European Union has launched several programs designed to channel money into Ukrainian defense-industrial factories. Kyiv has also forged bilateral deals with a variety of countries to scale up its drone and ammunition production. But these partnerships must be expanded dramatically. Europe must, of course, spend more on Ukraine and increase its own production of material. But it must also focus on speeding up design, testing, and scaling.

There are other ways Europe can assist Kyiv. Perhaps the most important is a European Sky Shield for Ukraine: an initiative proposed by a group of international and Ukrainian military experts. In it, a collection of European states would establish a no-fly zone, first over western Ukrainian territory and later over central Ukraine. Participating states would mobilize roughly 120 combat aircraft, which would fly from European bases and shoot down missiles and drones over the covered territory. In addition to safeguarding Ukraine's infrastructure and economy—by, for example, shielding Ukrainian nuclear plants and export corridors—it would free Ukraine's own air force to concentrate on the eastern front. The model, which is based on the air policing missions Europe has conducted over the Baltics for 20 years, carries some escalation risks. But Russia is unlikely to interfere, since direct, air-to-air combat would not work to its advantage.

NATO states will also have to continue supplying Kyiv with some traditional weapons. Ukraine will need more F-16 fighter jets to defend its skies. It still requires long-range missiles, like the U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) and British and French Storm Shadow and SCALP missiles, to hit the many Russian logistics hubs, command centers, stockpiles, and troop formations located beyond the battlefield. Ukraine's allies should also earmark certain stockpiles of ammunition, drones, and spare parts housed in eastern Europe for Ukraine, so that they are never again vulnerable to political delays in Washington or European capitals. And the United States must continue providing Kyiv with military intelligence, which has been indispensable to tracking Russian troop movements and missile strikes. Such high-end enablers will remain cornerstones of any meaningful security guarantees.

But tanks or other legacy equipment would be of little use on their own. Giving Ukraine another paper commitment to its security, even one modeled on NATO's Article 5, as some European states have discussed, would do nothing. And without tangible support that's tailored to today's Ukrainian battlefield, even European reassurance forces would be of dubious value. Unless NATO countries decide to station large numbers of combat-ready troops or send over instructors, these deployments would have the main effect of being expensive and politically risky within their home countries. The troops are unlikely to stop, or be spared from, Russia's military.

After more than 11 years of war, the lesson from Ukraine is clear: the security guarantees that matter are the ones that practically shape the battlefield. If the goal is to make Russian aggression futile, then the United States and Europe must channel resources into capabilities that deny, disrupt, and paralyze the Russian military. Nothing less will succeed.

Giving Ukraine what it needs does not only help Kyiv. If Putin's military is not stopped somewhere in Ukraine, it may march on a NATO member. Putin has made no secret of his desire to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union and establish Russian dominance over Europe's east. Over the last several weeks, he has floated drones and fighter jets over NATO's boundary in a clear test of the alliance's integrity. At a minimum, more of these provocations are likely to happen unless NATO helps Ukraine neutralize Russia's military.

The EU seems aware of this. In European Defence—Readiness 2030, a report published in early 2025, the European Commission explicitly framed Ukraine's survival as central to Europe's own security. It called for a “steel porcupine” strategy—or fortifying Ukraine so that future Russian offensives fail by design—and investing in Ukraine's defense industry as part of creating a shared European capacity. But the EU and NATO must do more to help Ukraine firmly prevail over Russia's technologies and deny Moscow any further battlefield victories. Its members need to plow more resources and in-kind technology contributions into Ukraine's defense industry. They must help Kyiv quickly develop and massively scale up new systems. Then, and only then, will Europe be able to breathe.

 But Symbolic Statehood Is No Panacea for the Palestinians

 Shira Efron

On September 21 and 22, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, and six other countries recognized a Palestinian state. Israel has responded defiantly. Following Sunday's recognitions, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a Hebrew-language video statement: “It will not happen. A Palestinian state will not be established west of the Jordan.” Although Netanyahu will only make a final decision on Israel's full response when he returns to the region after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, his coalition has repeatedly threatened to annex West Bank territory and collapse the Palestinian Authority entirely.

This tit-for-tat serves nobody's interests. Israelis will lose as the momentum around recognition and their government's aggressive response accelerate their country's diplomatic, economic, and cultural isolation. Palestinians will lose, too. On their own, the recognitions fail to afford real, tangible benefits to the Palestinian people or to help the struggling PA escape crisis. Instead, they give hard-line elements of the Israeli government more pretext to try to suppress Palestinian self-determination and further weaken the PA. Even before the recognitions were formally announced, the Israeli government had begun to cite them in fresh steps to expand settlements in the West Bank. On August 20, Israel approved the construction of the controversial E1 settlement that effectively bisects the West Bank; Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich explicitly framed the move as a response to calls for Palestinian statehood. “This reality finally buries the idea of a Palestinian state,” he said, “because there is nothing to recognize and no one to recognize.”

But something good could still come out of the momentum toward recognition if both the Israeli and Palestinian leadership look beyond the symbolism—and if international actors work to market recognition not as a unilateral action but as a small part of an arduous multilateral push for mutual recognition by Israel and Palestine, the normalization of diplomatic ties between Israel and its neighbors, and greater regional integration. The recognizing governments need to more clearly situate their decision within the so-called New York Declaration (endorsed overwhelmingly on September 12 by the UN General Assembly) and the July UN conference on a two-state solution co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. Both propose more practical ways forward—and Israel should take the opportunity that these initiatives offer. The New York Declaration outlines a comprehensive framework for ending Israel's military operations in Gaza, returning the remaining hostages, dismantling Hamas, and rebuilding the strip and backs these steps with security guarantees and initiatives to boost regional integration.

All these measures are consistent with Israel's military and political objectives. Israeli leaders must look past the ideological rigidity that drives them to oppose any notion of Palestinian self-determination. They need to use this moment to engage with France and Saudi Arabia on how to implement the New York Declaration, to ask the Palestinians and other regional actors to recognize Israel as the Jewish people's homeland (as the 2020 Abraham Accords did), and to demand that Palestinian leaders be held accountable to their obligation under international law to prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel. If they do so, they may well find that the momentum toward recognition has advantages for Israel. The recognizing states will have to step up, too, by making their security guarantees concrete and by helping shape a Palestinian state that does not threaten its neighbors and dignifies its people by providing functioning institutions and proper services.

The state of Israel was established by a UN General Assembly resolution, which theoretically means that Israel cannot selectively accept the legitimacy that created it while rejecting a Palestinian state formed under the same framework. But Israeli opposition to a Palestinian state has only hardened since Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack. A June 2025 Pew survey found that only 21 percent of Israelis agreed that “peaceful coexistence with a Palestinian state is possible,” the lowest proportion since the polling organization first asked the question, in 2013. A September 2024 joint poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR) and Tel Aviv University's International Program in Conflict Resolution and Mediation found that most Israelis believed that if a Palestinian state were established, terrorist attacks on Israel would persist or increase.

After October 7, Israelis have become extremely risk-averse and reluctant to make territorial concessions, especially given the ongoing terrorism threat from the Palestinian territories and the PA's dysfunction. Even centrist leaders who persistently oppose Netanyahu have come out strongly against recognition. Benny Gantz, a centrist retired army general who served in Netanyahu's war cabinet, lamented that recognition now “ultimately only emboldens Hamas, extends the war, distances the prospects of a hostage deal, and sends a clear message of support to Iran and its proxies.” On September 21, Yair Lapid, Israel's opposition leader, said that “the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state by Britain, Australia, and Canada is a diplomatic disaster, a harmful step, and a reward for terror.”

Many Israelis, with some justification, share the sentiment that the timing of the recent recognitions rewards Hamas—a view that Hamas officials have encouraged. On August 2, Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told Al Jazeera that “the initiative by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state is one of the fruits of October 7. We proved that victory over Israel is not impossible, and our weapons are a symbol of Palestinian dignity.”

Beyond the trouble with this narrative, Israelis have other valid concerns. Recognition will fundamentally alter the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under international law, committing recognizing states to review their agreements with Israel to ensure that they do not violate their obligations to the state of Palestine. A wide range of Israeli military operations, including its thousands of annual raids to arrest terrorists or destroy weapons in Palestinian territory, could be recast from counterterrorism to violations of the sovereignty of a UN member. Before September, nearly 150 UN member countries already recognized a Palestinian state. But adding France and the United Kingdom to that list—two permanent Security Council members—as well as G-7 countries such as Australia and Canada may well subject Israel to much more scrutiny and pressure by lawmakers and civil society groups, including substantial legal challenges at international courts. Germany, Italy, and even the United States may eventually feel that they have no choice but to follow their Security Council peers' lead. It will also strengthen Palestinians' standing in international forums and pave the way for Palestine's transition from a permanent observer at the UN to a full member—which would make its status as a state unquestionable despite Israel's objections.

In the near term, recognition is likely to hurt Palestinians the most. By the standard definition of a state, Palestine clearly does not fully qualify at present: although it has partially functioning institutions, it has no defined territory it truly controls, no monopoly on the use of force, no independent economy, and no coherent governance. Whatever nominal Palestinian state exists on paper thanks to the recognition announcements will have no real viability—and recognition's aftermath may well further undermine the PA's ability to govern even in the limited territory it supposedly controls.

The PA is teetering on the brink of insolvency. Public schools in the West Bank have postponed the start of the school year and are now only open three days a week, affecting more than 600,000 children. The PA has been forced to slash the salaries of its public servants by as much as 50 percent and to delay payments to private-sector contractors. Government departments such as the Ministry of Health provide only partial services. The West Bank's economy has shrunk to less than a sixth of its 2022 size, and unemployment stands at over 30 percent. The PA enjoys little popularity among its people: a May PCPSR poll found that 81 percent of Palestinians want President Mahmoud Abbas to resign and that 69 percent believe that the PA will not succeed in accomplishing the reforms necessary to govern.

This week's recognitions do nothing, in practice, to give the PA more capacity or shore it up against Israeli aggression. Instead, they put Palestinians even more squarely in the crosshairs of Israeli officials seeking to render Palestinian statehood impossible. On September 18, Smotrich threatened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that if the Israeli government does not annex the West Bank in response to the recognitions, he will use his authority as finance minister to fully collapse the PA. Speaking at a September 20 event at Maale Adumim, a large settlement near Jerusalem, Netanyahu declared, “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state. This place belongs to us.”

The consequences for Israel, however, go well beyond the symbolic and cannot easily be neutralized with annexations. This wave of recognitions will likely increase anti-Israel sentiment globally, accelerating divestments and boycotts. And the very governments that sought to address domestic opposition to Israeli policy by announcing recognitions will come under more pressure to impose formal sanctions. The European Union is Israel's largest investor, contributing nearly twice as much annually to the Israeli economy as the United States does; the main destination for Israeli investments; and Israel's largest trading partner.

Some European institutions have already divested from Israeli enterprises: in August, for instance, Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund divested from Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing an “unacceptable risk” that its investments were contributing to human rights violations. Countries with more investments in Israel, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, could follow suit. Many economic ties between EU member states and Israel are governed by the 2000 EU-Israel Association Agreement, which can be canceled only by unanimous consensus, an unlikely outcome given Hungary's continued support for Israel. A European Commission proposal in mid-September to partially suspend the agreement—which required only the backing of a majority of member states—was vetoed by Germany and Italy.

Yet the trajectory of European opinion that the recognition wave represents could push Germany and Italy to lift their veto. In such a scenario, Israel could lose its free trade agreement with the EU as well as its access to the $100 billion Horizon Europe research program, the EU's flagship fund for research and innovation. Israel is a major beneficiary of the program, but this year to date, its approval rates for projects with Israeli collaborators has already dropped by 68.5 percent. In May, David Harel, the president of Israel's Academy of Sciences and Humanities, said that if Israel were excluded entirely it would be a “death sentence for Israeli science.”



The alienation of Israeli academics represents a broader trend. The country's athletes are less and less able to compete with their peers abroad. The executive committee of the Union of European Football Associations is expected to vote soon on suspending Israel's national team and all of its clubs from its competitions, which would exclude Israelis from a leading venue for its favorite sport. Cultural institutions face equally severe pressure—pressure that will only increase after this week's recognitions. In early September, the Flanders Festival Ghent, in Belgium, canceled a performance by the Munich Philharmonic solely because its conductor, Lahav Shani—who has called for peace in Gaza—also directs the Israel Philharmonic; over 4,000 actors and filmmakers have pledged not to cooperate with Israeli institutions.

It may seem trivial to outsiders, but the growing possibility that Israel could be ejected from the Eurovision Song Contest hits Israelis especially hard. The competition is one of Israel's most cherished events of the year, and Israelis take pride in their exceptional record: Israel has won four times, and the fact that an Israeli contestant reached the 2025 final felt enormously comforting to Israelis, reassuring them that their artists could still be loved in countries where protests against their government are common. But Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Spain have all threatened to boycott Eurovision 2026 if Israel participates. The recent recognitions and Israel's aggressive counterreaction may well push more countries to issue similar threats.

At a Finance Ministry conference last week, Netanyahu acknowledged that Israel is entering “a kind of isolation.” But he has sought to claim that the country could manage this isolation, suggesting that Israel can adopt an economy with “autarkic features” and become a “super-Sparta.” Netanyahu appears to have forgotten that Israel's economic success owes much to Oslo's peace dividend and that Israel has become an export-driven economy that relies on the tech sector and a highly educated, globally connected workforce. Its continued success depends on thriving relationships with the rest of the world. This is why Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, famously said in 1955 that “Israel is not destined to become a new Sparta.” Regardless of Israel's military engagements, he continued, “we must not be distracted” from the fact that “our ultimate goal in our relations with our neighbors is peace and coexistence.”

After the diplomatic circus at the UN subsides, there will still be an opportunity to make lemonade from lemons—if Israel and other countries turn their attention back to the New York Declaration. That declaration's objective was to avoid the pitfalls of previous unsuccessful diplomatic initiatives by proposing time-bound, tangible steps toward a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict within a regional framework that shuns Hamas and incentivizes Arab states to play major roles. Unfortunately, the escalatory rhetoric and mutual threats surrounding recognition took attention off these measures. But they could provide the Israeli government with an off-ramp to end its war in Gaza, which is unpopular among Israelis.

The Israeli government has long insisted that five conditions must be met before its military operations can halt: Hamas must be disarmed, all living and deceased hostages must be returned, Gaza must be demilitarized, Israel must retain security control over the Gaza Strip, and an alternative civilian administration run by neither Hamas nor the PA should be established. The New York Declaration is perfectly aligned with Israel's first three goals, and it implicitly accepts that in the near term, Israel will maintain peripheral security control over Gaza and that Hamas will not return to power. Its vision for PA authority over Gaza is conditioned on reforms that would make the PA a more trusted neighbor than it is today.

In reality, the gap between what Israel wants and what international actors hope for can be bridged. France, Saudi Arabia, and the governments that endorsed the New York Declaration should immediately start taking practical steps to operationalize its proposed measures, such as by designing a mechanism to disarm Hamas, training a multinational security force that could properly monitor and enforce a cease-fire, acquiring real commitments from international players to stabilize and reconstruct Gaza, and developing a concrete plan to deradicalize Palestinian armed-resistance movements. In addition, the governments that signed the New York Declaration should invest in more effective marketing to the Israeli public. They need to demonstrate why their proposal offers a viable alternative to the Israeli government's current zero-sum approach to the Palestinians. They also should seek to bring the United States on board in their September 23 meeting with Trump, which is expected to cover a post-war vision for Gaza.

Israel, for its part, has shown that it can be pragmatic when it needs to be. For instance, during the six-week cease-fire in January 2025, it allowed PA security forces carrying the Palestinian flag to patrol the Rafah border. Now is the time to be even more pragmatic. This week's recognitions are a fait accompli. Whether even more powerful states will recognize Palestine is a question of when, not if. And Israel will face an isolation that its people cannot survive in the long term unless it accepts that the PA will have to play some role in ending the war in Gaza.

In fact, recognition could have advantages for Israel. If the international community begins to treat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a dispute between legally equal entities rather than between an occupier and an occupied people, that could force the UN and other international forums (including international courts), as well as the Palestinian leadership, to recognize that Israel does face a security threat from the Palestinian territories. It will also clarify the obligations that Palestinian leaders have to abide by international law, prevent their territories from being used as a base to attack Israel, and stop Hamas's terrorist activities.

In the Middle East, if you do not take a seat at the table you will likely end up on the menu. Instead of flat-out rejecting the rest of the world's attempts to intervene, Israel should make it clear that it accepts key components of the New York Declaration, join discussions on how to implement them, seek conversations on elements of concern, and ask for critical additional measures such as a recognition of Jews' right to self-determination within Israel. Only then can the course of events in the Middle East change from unilateral recognition, regional fragmentation, and international isolation for Israel to regional integration and enhanced security for Palestinians and Israelis alike.

            It's a new chapter for London Fashion Week. The first to take place under the British Fashion Council's new CEO Laura Weir, who has made her message clear: “fashion matters.”
    


            In her opening speech on Friday, Weir doubled down on her ambition to make London “a sensational showcase of creative fashion design talent” by reducing the barriers to entry and opening the schedule to “new energy, new thinking and new ideas.” That includes participation from new and returning brands, but also a wider breadth of international editors and buyers to platform the UK capital on the global stage. Backstage, designers both new and established were cautiously optimistic at the promises being made.
    


            Already, there are signs that the city is being taken more seriously. Earlier in the week, members of Parliament gathered to discuss whether London Fashion Week was in the national interest — marking the first time the event had been debated at government level. “We know as an industry that there is often a lapse of respect for fashion and the contribution it brings to the UK,” Weir said. “The world is watching this week. Let us show them what only London can do.”
    


            Indeed, there were blockbuster moments from the likes of Burberry — who closed out the week's schedule with a star-studded show at Kensington Palace Gardens, attended by Elton John, Olivia Dean and Vanessa Williams — as well as H&M (the latter opened the week with a celebrity-filled catwalk walked by Romeo Beckham and with a performance from “Messy” singer Lola Young). But smaller designers also gave plenty to talk about — from noteworthy milestones, including the various anniversaries of Roksanda, Harris Reed, Ashish and Fashion East (the incubator that launched Jonathan Anderson's career), to the innovation from newcomers including Oscar Ouyang, Maximilian Raynor and Johanna Parv.
    


            “It really feels like there's a renewed sense of energy in London right now,” said Daniel Fletcher, who designs for his namesake label as well as the Chinese brand Mithridate.
    


            While members of the UK government were considering the country's relationship to fashion, a handful of designers were distilling their own experience of British life onto the runway. Patrick McDowell, a Liverpudlian designer based in London, staged his first catwalk since winning the prestigious Queen Elizabeth II Award for Design in May. Dedicated to his home county, the collection was titled “Lancashire Rose,” and featured cinched blazers in jacquard fabric and sandy colored trench coats reimagined into strapless tops and full skirts. Fletcher, who presented his second collection for Mithridate, said he was inspired by two British archetypes: the country folk and the town dwellers. His fusion of these two “very different worlds” manifested in pink sequined party dresses layered over Oxford shirts and tall riding boots paired with sparkly underwear. “It's a clash that shouldn't really work, but somehow does,” he told CNN backstage.
    


            But a few renegades creatively defected across the pond, looking instead at America for inspiration. The eponymous designer Yuhan Wang was inspired by David Lynch's “Mullholland Drive” (2001), while the cult British-Bulgarian brand Chopova Lowena created an entire cheer squad with tinsel hair extensions and rhinestone eyeliner.
    


            Inspired by the community and culture that comes with cheerleading, there were letterman jackets, T-shirts that read “Popular” in varsity typeface, and knitted hoodies emblazoned with pom-pom yielding models, who walked to the tune of AC/DC's “Thunderstruck,” which has become synonymous with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders following their hit Netflix show. “It was a lot of healing high school trauma in a way,” co-founder Emma Chopova said after the show. “It reframed things that happened to us, who were, and who we wanted to be.”
    


            Streetwear, a pillar of UK dressing for several decades, was made new again by a slew of designers redefining urban style. Yaku Stapleton, founder of YAKU, designed hoodies, capes and camouflage pants that looked like they were inspired by role-playing games (RPG). His models could have been downloaded from Zelda, with cargo pants that held axes and sword sheaths remade in fabric.
    


            Lueder's take on modern medieval feudalism, with knitted hoods and 3D-printed horned clogs, was inspired by the historical summer camps designer Marie Lueder went to as a child, where she role-played periods in history (costumes and all) from 300 BC to the end of the 15th century. For his first ready-to-wear collection the mononymic designer HARRI, known for his circus-like inflatable pieces, stuck with his signature fabric of latex. This time, however, there were bomber jackets, mesh shirts and Bermuda shorts — the kind of everyday clothing you'd see on the street, though some items, such as a cap and body vest, were aerated for old times' sake.
    


            Elsewhere, Johanna Parv continued to design for “the woman who is living in the city right now,” she told CNN, particularly “brave” cyclists, with nylon dresses, skirts and rain jackets that can be adjusted for whether one is commuting, working, partying or exercising.
    


            Royalty may be on the mind of many, following the new exhibition on Marie Antoinette's style in London, which has many of the French queen's extravagant gowns on show. Panniers — undergarments that sit on the hips to expand the silhouette outwards — have also been seen on recent red carpets. At the Venice Film Festival earlier this summer, Italian actor Alba Rohrwacher turned heads when she stepped out in a Dior haute couture gown complete with a protruding bustle.
    


            No surprise, then, that voluminous hips were a seasonal feature on the runway. See the Chinese-Irish designer Simone Rocha whose dresses and skirts had wired crinolines on show, rather than hidden underneath. Backstage, Rocha shared her inspiration — a “disgruntled debutante” — and the desire to push herself by working with tried-and-tested materials albeit in new ways. She also nodded to her heritage with pops of red, an auspicious color in Chinese culture.
    


            At Dilara Findikoglu, models looked like ladies in waiting that had risen from the dead; wearing antiquated corsetry that was dirtied and torn. Sharp hip bones jutted out above low-slung lace-up leather pants, at times accentuated further by draped body chains. Others were padded in ruffles and lace. The collection was titled “Cage of Innocence,” in a nod to the silenced women of history. Findikogulu's uncompromising and subversive vision, along with her meticulous understanding of the female body, has made her one of London Fashion Week's hottest tickets.
    


            One notable feature of London designers is their desire to experiment and seek alternatives to the status quo.
    


            Backstage, Oscar Ouyang said the word that summarized his debut show was “reinvention”. He experimented with bird feathers, seen on the collar of a shortened car coat and a pair of shorts. Fresh-faced models wore sprigs of down in their hair, like the lost boys in “Peter Pan.” The Beijing-born designer, who studied a MA course in knitwear at Central Saint Martins, didn't stop there: He used a combination of machine and hand-knit techniques to create cartoon-sh proportioned T-shirts and braided bags and tunics out of straw.
    


            Pauline Dujancourt, a womenswear designer also specializing in knitwear, was also inspired by the symbolism of birds. Dujancourt's hauntingly beautiful gowns were a mixture of chunky Argyle knit, delicate lace and frothy tulle ruffle — but the sum was greater than its parts. “I discovered all those techniques from my grandmother,” Dujancourt told CNN after the show.  She also emphasized the importance of craft, and modernizing the artform for new generations.  “It's really important to go back to that but offer a new rationale so people will actually want to knit and want to wear knitwear.”
    


            Elsewhere, rising designers Paolo Carzana and Susan Fang continued to challenge material boundaries, resulting in garments that are thoughtfully designed, adaptable and aesthetically unique. Carzana's selling point is using repurposed materials and vegetable dyes, which encourages a more considered approach to clothes (not to mention, unexpected color pairings like violet with burnt orange). They popped against the backdrop of books in the British Library, where the show was held. Fang, meanwhile, took to the leafy conservatory of the Barbican, where she showed dresses made using beads and 3D-printed patchwork that looked like flower petals as the models — including Korean it-girl Irene Kim — walked.

                    “We're just really proud to be showing here. As a sensibility our brand has such a global audience. But that spirit of a London woman is really reflected in the collection.”
                


                    Camille Perry, TOVE designer and co-founder
                


                    “It's really important to support British fashion. And for me, London is my home.”
                


                    Daniel Fletcher, Mithridate
                


                    “It's not just protect the dolls. It's employ the dolls. It's champion the dolls.”
                


                    Conner Ives
                


                    “People always look at sequin clothing and think it's so delicate, you can't do stuff in it. And I was like, well it's not. You can chuck it in a suitcase and go to a club in it.”
                


                    Ashish Gupta, Ashish
                


                    “At the end of the day we're here to reinvent fashion and try new things.”
                


                    Pauline Dujancourt
                


                    “Knitwear has always been this traditional craft, people have a stereotypical idea of it being for grannies, or being vintage. We obviously reference that… But it's always about reinventing your ideas.”

They found 300 servers capable of crippling New York's cell system","https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/23/us/swatting-investigation-server-network-discovered","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:01:05 GMT","


            On Christmas Day 2023, a man called the suicide prevention hotline claiming he had shot his girlfriend and threatening to kill himself. Police barreled toward the address but turned around before they arrived.
    


            It was a hoax – a swatting call at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's Georgia residence.
    


            Five days later, GOP Sen. Rick Scott's home in Florida was swatted.
    


            The wave of false alarms about shootings and violence continued to assail high-level government officials: the federal judge overseeing Trump's election subversion case, then-Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, Maine's Democratic secretary of state.
    


            Within a month of Donald Trump clinching his second presidential election win, several of his Cabinet picks and administration appointees also were targeted with threats, including calls about bombs and swatting, his transition team said.
    


            The threats weren't legitimate. There were no shootings, no violence.
    


            Still, the surge of swatting calls against high-ranking officials posed a real and “imminent threat” to the Secret Service's prote﻿ctive operations, said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the agency's New York field office.
    


            So, a fledgling unit of the service set out six months ago to unmask the layers of burner phones, changing phone numbers and SIM cards swatting American officials.
    


            The Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit, along with a flurry of other law enforcement agencies – the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the New York Police Department, and other state and local law enforcement – began unraveling the web.
    


            What they found was an operation apparently capable of chaos far beyond masking swatting calls to potentially disabling cell phone towers, disrupting emergency services and enabling spies, hackers and organized crime.
    


            The new unit traced the swatting signals to an apartment just outside New York City.
    


            They found another rented space.
    


            Then, more.
    


            No one was inside.
    


            Instead, they found a vast and stunning network of more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 SIM servers – the largest seizure ever of such devices by the Secret Service – all concentrated within 35 miles of New York City.
    


            The servers could be commanded remotely to create massive amounts of phone traffic in a stealthy and unceasing operation that switched out SIM cards quickly to keep federal law enforcement off its trail.
    


            The hidden electronic maze was so powerful, it could have sent an encrypted and anonymous text to every human being in the United States within 12 minutes, McCool said. It could have overwhelmed cell towers, toppling New York City's cell service and preventing every Manhattan resident from accessing Google Maps.
    


            The electronic safe houses were found in places including Armonk, New York; Greenwich, Connecticut; Queens, New York; and across the river in New Jersey – essentially forming a circle around New York City's cellular network infrastructure, officials briefed on the investigation said.
    


            The Secret Service hasn't announced any arrests connected to the operation. But its early forensic analysis suggests foreign governments and criminals in the US have used the network to run their organizations, McCool said.
    


            “That includes cartels, that includes human traffickers, that includes terrorists,” he told CNN. “It is absolutely well funded and well-organized.”
    


            The network has been taken down and is no longer a threat to New York, law enforcement officials said.
    


            But, McCool cautioned, “It would be unwise to think that there's not other networks across the country.”
    


            The Secret Service unit is now working to identify other similar networks, he said.
    


            “The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” US Secret Service Director Sean Curran said.

            President Donald Trump is no stranger to federal government shutdowns, having presided over a record-long impasse in his first term.
    


            But with another shutdown looming in a week, the Trump administration has yet to make public federal agencies' contingency plans for how they'll handle the shuttering of operations until Congress approves their funding for the coming fiscal year. It follows the president's overhauling of the size and scope of the federal government upon returning to office.
    


            The plans, which are traditionally posted on the White House Office of Management and Budget's website, lay out what federal services will continue to be provided and which workers must remain on the job, often without pay. It can be crucial information for residents, businesses, contractors and others who engage with the federal government.
    


            The plans also reflect what federal activities each administration deems critical to the protection of life and property, which can include emergency response or national security efforts, said Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center.
    


            The OMB's site had the agencies' plans posted in mid-March, when the US last faced a potential shutdown, according to the Wayback Machine, an internet archive. But as of publication Tuesday morning, it was blank.
    


            Neither the White House nor the OMB responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Some departments, such as the Social Security Administration and Environmental Protection Agency, have posted their plans on their websites, while others say the plans are in the process of being updated. CNN reached out to more than a dozen major agencies, but only a handful responded.
    


            “We're just in this holding pattern for guidance and next steps,” said Snyderman, a former career staffer at OMB.
    


            Tuesday officially marks one week before the government funding deadline, setting in motion the standard procedure laying out the steps toward bringing non-essential government functions to a halt.
    


            “One week prior to the expiration of appropriations bills, regardless of whether the enactment of appropriations appears imminent, OMB will communicate with agency senior officials to remind agencies of their responsibilities to review and update orderly shutdown plans, and will share a draft communication template to notify employees of the status of appropriations,” reads a budget document from the OMB.
    


            The lack of publicly available plans is “troubling,” said Michael Linden, a former senior OMB official during the Biden administration. The contingency preparations can be relatively cut and dry for many agencies, who have gone through this exercise multiple times in recent years.
    


            “There's only so much wiggle room, in theory,” said Linden, now a senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “There is some room for interpretation, but not that much, or shouldn't be.”
    


            The plans also provide a mechanism for accountability and oversight, said Linden.
    


            One thing that has changed this year is the Trump administration's massive reorganization of federal agencies. About 200,000 federal workers have left the government, and many departments have restructured their operations, eliminating certain offices and functions.
    


            Many of them are experienced federal workers who know how to navigate the shutdown process, said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that focuses on improving the federal government.
    


            “That's going to create a whole other layer of extra difficulty,” he said. “Even if you have the plans there, do you have the people to implement the plans effectively? There's going to be very large gaps across the government because of the haphazard and large-scale firings that have taken place.”
    


            Also, Stier noted, an administration has latitude to determine what government functions should continue during a shutdown, which could further empower Trump to dismantle – at least temporarily – elements that he doesn't like.
    


            Since Congress has not yet approved appropriations for any federal departments, all would be affected.
    


            Every agency has its own set of plans and procedures for a shutdown. The plans include how many employees would be furloughed and how many would work without pay, how long it would take to wind down operations in the hours before a shutdown and which activities would come to a halt. Those plans can vary from shutdown to shutdown.
    


            (Federal workers are guaranteed to receive back pay once Congress approves a funding package.)
    


            Previous shutdowns have closed national parks and museums, stalled food inspections, canceled immigration hearings and delayed some federal lending to homebuyers and small businesses, among other impacts. Though air traffic controllers have to remain on the job, many called in sick during the most recent shutdown in the first Trump administration, snarling flights.
    


            Some essential government functions continue even if agencies shut down. Notably, Social Security recipients will receive their monthly payments, and Medicare and Medicaid benefits will continue.
    


            The Social Security Administration pointed to a contingency plan from last September that showed only 8,100 of its roughly 59,000 employees at that time would be furloughed if the government shut down. The plan noted that people would still be able to apply for benefits, request appeals and change their addresses, among other services, but they would not be able to correct their earnings records or get replacement Medicare cards.
    


            The Justice Department said its fiscal year 2026 contingency plan is currently under review, while the US Department of Agriculture said it is “prepared for all contingencies regarding Department operations, including critical services and supports.”
    


            During Trump's first term, a 35-day impasse shuttered part of the government just before Christmas in 2018. It ended in late January 2019, when Trump agreed to a temporary funding measure that did not include billions of dollars for a border wall.
    


            However, the shutdown wreaked havoc on the lives of many Americans and federal employees, including causing flight delays, canceling immigration hearings and making it harder for some families to obtain student loans.

            A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding that it froze at the University of California, Los Angeles.
    


            US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction on Monday, saying the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires specific procedures and explanations for federal funding cuts. Instead, the government informed UCLA in generalized form letters that multiple grants from various agencies were being suspended but offered no specific details.
    


            In August, UCLA announced that the Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.
    


            Lin issued a ruling later that month that resulted in $81 million in grants from the National Science Foundation being restored to UCLA. She ruled that those cuts had violated a June preliminary injunction where she ordered the National Science Foundation to restore dozens of grants that it had terminated at the University of California, which operates 10 campuses across the state.
    


            The White House did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting comment on Monday's ruling.
    


            The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.
    


            Two Ivy League institutions, Columbia and Brown, struck deals to preserve funding that was held up by the Trump administration over similar claims that they had not done enough to respond to campus antisemitism.
    


            In the case of Harvard, which pushed back with a lawsuit over cuts to its funding, a federal judge in early September ruled the funding freeze amounted to illegal retaliation for Harvard's rejection of the Trump administration's demands.
    


            The Trump administration had proposed to settle its investigation into UCLA through a $1 billion payment from the institution. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called it an extortion attempt.
    


            UCLA has said that such a large payment would “devastate” the institution.
    


            Monday's ruling concerns hundreds of medical research grants from the National Institutes of Health that include studies into Parkinson's disease treatment, cancer recovery, cell regeneration in nerves and other areas that campus leaders argue are pivotal for improving the health of Americans.

FARMINGDALE, N.Y. (AP) — The Ryder Cup had moments of inspiration in vastly different forms during a quiet Monday start to golf's most chaotic week. There were tears for the Americans as they gathered on the first tee at sunrise and a strong reminder for Europe as it goes after a rare road win.

U.S. captain Keegan Bradley had his entire team on the first tee before the gates open, no one in the massive grandstands that come Friday will be packed with flag-waving fans.

He had Chris Mascali, a New York firefighter whose father died during the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, speak to the team. Mascali brought his uniform, along with the helmet of his father, Joe Mascali. Those now are in the team room for the Americans.

Bryan Robinson from FDNY Ladder 16 sang the national anthem as the large video board showed great moments in Ryder Cup history.

“I had this vision of doing that for about a year,” Bradley said. “And to be out there and see it, and see how emotional the guys got, was a really special time for our team.”

The Americans walked solemnly across the bridge from the first tee complex, headed to the practice area, then played 18 holes of the Black Course.

Team Europe spent two days at Bethpage Black a week ago and then dispersed — some to American homes, others playing some of Long Island's best golf courses — until returning to Bethpage for what it expects to be a big challenge.

The Americans have lost at home only four times since the Ryder Cup began in 1927. European captain Luke Donald had his team wear salmon-colored pullovers or sweater vests, a subtle reminder of what can be done.

That was the Sunday color for the European team in 1987 when it stunned the Americans at Muirfield Village to win its first Ryder Cup away from home. Europe has won three more times on U.S. soil since then, the most recent 13 years ago in what became known as the “Miracle at Medinah” because of the Sunday rally.

“That's motivating to the guys that it can be done, it has been done, and again, we're here to try and do it again,” Donald said.

Europe is coming off a resounding win at Marco Simone and returns 11 of the 12 players from the Italy matches in 2023 — the exception is Rasmus Hojgaard, the identical twin of Nicolai Hojgaard, who played in the last Ryder Cup.

But the Europeans lost by nine points in 2021 at Whistling Straits, by six points at Hazeltine in 2016 and by five points at Valhalla in 2008.

“I think it's always important to rally around something,” Donald said. “We always have things that we come up with that are important to us. History and our unity and celebrating what we've done in the past and the legends that have kind of come before us is really important.

“This is going to be a difficult challenge.”

There were not many surprises in the way Bradley grouped his three groups of four players for the only full practice round they play this week.

Justin Thomas and Cameron Young were together, as they were in the Procore Championship two weeks ago in Napa, California. Ben Griffin, one of four Ryder Cup rookies, was with Bryson DeChambeau, who was not in Napa because he's with LIV Golf and thus ineligible for PGA Tour play.

Scottie Scheffler was with Russell Henley — they formed a tough partnership in the Presidents Cup last year at Royal Montreal — along with U.S. Open champion J.J. Spaun and Harris English.

The final group had Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele, partners for most team matches over the last six years, along with Sam Burns and Collin Morikawa, who won a fourballs match in Marco Simone at the last Ryder Cup.

Schauffele and DeChambeau have gone about a month since last competing. DeChambeau finished the LIV season on Aug. 24, and Schauffele missed the Procore Championship while at home with a newborn son.

The captains are good friends, both living close to each other in South Florida, and shared one sentiment about the Ryder Cup. As tense as it has become, the goal is to enjoy the week not knowing if the opportunity will come up again.

Bradley played in two Ryder Cups, the last one in 2014. He has not been back in any capacity until the 39-year-old who played college golf at St. John's was named captain last year.

He felt that sentiment as his team gathered on the first tee to listen to Mascali.

“It was a powerful moment,” Bradley said. “You're looking around and seeing all the guys staring at what we were doing and so into it in such an emotional way. A lot of people have worked really hard to get to this point in their lives.

“Sometimes in your life and in your career, you have to take stock in what's happening around you,” he said. “I think one of my biggest regrets earlier in my career wasn't enjoying things more. And for that moment out this morning, guys were really taking that in and enjoying it, and that was a beautiful thing.”

President Donald Trump on Monday used the platform of the presidency to promote unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism as his administration announced a wide-ranging effort to study the causes of the complex brain disorder.

Today's live updates have ended. Read what you missed below and find more coverage at apnews.com.

President Donald Trump on Monday promoted unproven ties between Tylenol, vaccines and autism without offering new medical evidence.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump instructed pregnant women around a dozen times during the unwieldy White House news conference, also urging mothers not to give their infants the drug, known by the generic name acetaminophen. He also repeated long-debunked claims that ingredients in vaccines or timing shots close together could contribute to rising rates of autism in the U.S., without providing medical evidence.

The rambling announcement, which appeared to rely on existing studies rather than significant new research, comes as the Make America Healthy Again movement has been pushing for answers on the causes of autism.

Here's what to know: 








The New York City mayoral candidate is open again to participating in a town hall hosted by a local ABC outlet now that the national network says Kimmel's late night show has been reinstated.

Mamdani said hours ago that he was pulling out of the event following ABC's recent decision to suspend the late-night host for comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which sparked a backlash.

“Last week, Disney/ABC caved to Trump administration pressure. Millions of Americans helped them find their backbone. Whether you watch Jimmy Kimmel or not, today's decision is a victory for free speech,” the Democrat wrote on X. “We've reached out to WABC to reschedule the town hall.” 

Mamdani is facing former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November election.

President Trump repeatedly told Americans not to use Tylenol during pregnancy, going far beyond more measured language published by his health regulators.

“Don't take Tylenol,” Trump said of the bestselling form of acetaminophen, raising his voice. “There's no downside. Don't take it.”

But a letter published by the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's afternoon news conference says only that doctors “should consider minimizing the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy.”

The FDA points to recent evidence suggesting an association between the pain reliever and conditions like autism and attention deficit disorder. But it also includes the qualifier that “a causal relationship has not been established.”

U.S. physicians are not bound by FDA guidance and can prescribe and recommend medications for alternate uses. Medical experts say untreated fever during pregnancy carries significant risks to moms and babies, such as miscarriage and birth defects.

That's according to a person granted anonymity because they are unauthorized to discuss the situation.

The Democratic leaders Rep. Hakeem Jeffries and Sen. Chuck Schumer had requested the meeting in a weekend letter to the president, imploring him to open talks over their demands to protect health care program funds as part of any deal.



Another person familiar with the talks said the meeting between Trump and the two Democratic leaders is now scheduled for Thursday. The person also was given anonymity for lack of authorization to speak publicly.

The former Senate majority leader echoed concerns first raised by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that some government officials may violate First Amendment principles by coercing private individuals and companies to remove speech some find distasteful.“

As a First Amendment guy, myself, I think he's probably got it right,” McConnell wrote on X. “You don't have to like what somebody says on TV to agree that the government shouldn't be getting involved here.”

President Donald Trump and multiple senior officials in his administration have called on Disney, which owns the ABC network, to remove late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel from the airwaves and said the federal government may use its leverage to force a change. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said that comments Kimmel made in the aftermath of Kirk's killing may prompt retaliatory action from the telecommunications regulator.

“We can do this the easy way, or the hard way,” Carr said at the time. Carr denied on Monday that he threatened to revoke ABC's local station licenses because of Kimmel's remarks.

Lindsey Halligan was sworn in Monday as interim U.S. attorney for the prestigious prosecutors' office that's overseeing separate criminal investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

She replaces Erik Siebert, a longtime prosecutor who resigned Friday amid pressure from administration officials to indict James.

Halligan will immediately face intense scrutiny given Trump's public calls on the Justice Department to move forward with prosecutions against the president's perceived political foes.

Halligan has been part of Trump's legal orbit for the last several years, including serving as one of his attorneys in the early days of the FBI's investigation into his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.

The Food and Drug Administration is taking the first steps to try and approve a decades-old generic drug for a new group of patients, including some who may have autism.

The agency said it will seek approval of leucovorin for patients believed to have low levels of folate, one form of vitamin B, in the brain. That may include some people with autism.

The agency's highly unusual move is based on a review of small studies performed between 2009 and 2024.

Several studies have recently suggested the drug may help with autism symptoms when given to certain children. But autism experts say much larger, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm any benefit.

The discontinued drug, previously marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, was sold in tablets to treat side effects of chemotherapy. It's currently available in other forms.

Trump is flying to New York to give a speech Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly.

His departure from the White House has been delayed by about a half an hour because the autism announcement started nearly an hour behind schedule.

As part of the president's announcement, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya said his agency has launched the Autism Data Science Initiative to “turbocharge” autism research. He said millions of dollars will be spent to collect the data.

The NIH and other research institutes have studied autism for decades.

The link between genes and autism dates back to studies of twins decades ago. Some are rare genetic variants passed from parent to child, even if the parent shows no signs of autism.

Besides warning people about taking Tylenol during pregnancy, the Trump administration on Monday raised unfounded concerns about vaccines contributing to rising rates of autism, which affects 1 in 31 U.S. children today, according to the CDC. 

Any concern that measles vaccine — or other vaccines — could be linked to autism has been long debunked, stress scientists and leading advocacy groups for people with autism.

While Trump insists there's no downside to not treating a fever during pregnancy, obstetricians disagree.

The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine says untreated fevers in pregnancy, particularly the first trimester, increase the risk for miscarriages, preterm birth and other problems.

The manufacturer of Tylenol, the best-selling form of acetaminophen, says it “strongly disagrees” with the suggestion that its drug may cause autism.

Kenvue said in a statement that “sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism.” The company pointed to scientific reviews by multiple government regulators worldwide, including those previously published by the FDA.

Shares of Kenvue Inc. fell 7.5% in trading Monday, reducing the company's market value by about $2.6 billion.

Tylenol's original manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, spun off the best-selling brand in 2023.

In addition to Tylenol, acetaminophen is used in hundreds of other over-the-counter cold and flu formulas.

The president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said Monday that suggestions that Tylenol use in pregnancy causes autism are “irresponsible when considering the harmful and confusing message they send to pregnant patients.”

“Today's announcement by HHS is not backed by the full body of scientific evidence and dangerously simplifies the many and complex causes of neurologic challenges in children,” Dr. Steven Fleischman said in a statement. 

“It is highly unsettling that our federal health agencies are willing to make an announcement that will affect the health and well-being of millions of people without the backing of reliable data.”

Tylenol is “an appropriate medication to treat pain and fever during pregnancy,” the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said.

The expert group says untreated fever during pregnancy carries significant risks to moms and babies, such as miscarriage and birth defects.

There has been research on a potential link between Tylenol during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism in children, but it “does not establish a causal relationship,” the society said in its statement. It said the studies have significant limitations.

The president said Monday that the Food and Drug Administration will be notifying doctors that the use of acetaminophen “can be associated” with an increased risk of autism.



Trump, several minutes into the announcement, has not offered medical evidence for the FDA's new recommendation.



Still, Trump said the FDA will strongly recommend that pregnant woman not take Tylenol unless “medically necessary.”



“Ideally you don't take it at all,” Trump said.



American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has long recommended acetaminophen as a safe pain reliever option during pregnancy.

The president has started his remarks on the issue.

He is speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House, accompanied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., and other administration officials who focus on health.

ABC will reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's late night show in the wake of criticism over his comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, officials with the network said Monday.

“We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,” said a statement from the network.

ABC suspended Kimmel indefinitely after comments he made about Kirk, who was killed Sept. 10, in a monologue. Kimmel said “many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk” and that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them.”

The White House is standing behind “border czar” Tom Homan following reports that he had accepted $50,000 from undercover agents posing as businesspeople during an undercover FBI operation last year, leading to a bribery investigation that was shut down by the Trump administration Justice Department.

MSNBC first reported Saturday that Homan had accepted the cash during a 2024 encounter with undercover agents who were posing as businesspeople seeking government contracts that Homan suggested he could help them get in a second Trump term.

Two people familiar with the investigation, who were not authorized to discuss a sensitive law enforcement inquiry by name, confirmed details of it to The Associated Press on Monday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt characterized Homan's encounter with the undercover agents as an effort by the Biden administration to “entrap one of the president's top allies and supporters, someone who they knew very well would be taking a government position.”

She said the White House and Trump stand by Homan “100 % because he did absolutely nothing wrong.”

The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider expanding President Donald Trump's power to shape independent agencies by overturning a nearly century-old decision limiting when presidents can fire board members.

The justices have allowed the Republican president to carry out some high-profile firings while lawsuits play out, signaling the conservative majority is poised to overturn or narrow a 1935 Supreme Court decision that found commissioners can only be removed for misconduct or neglect of duty.

The high court agreed to take up the case of Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission who was reinstated by lower courts under a 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor. In that case, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D. Roosevelt as the president worked to implement the New Deal. The justices unanimously found commissioners can be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.

Leavitt said Trump “is aware” of an offer by Russian President Vladimir Putin to extend by a year an arms control treaty limiting both sides' nuclear capabilities.

She said, “I think it sounds pretty good” but that Trump “wants to make some comments about it himself” and that she'd “let him do that” when the president speaks to reporters in the Oval Office during an unrelated announcement on autism coming up later Monday.

Leavitt said the White House had gotten a letter from Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro but would not detail its contents.

Venezuela said over the weekend that Maduro wrote to Trump, rejecting implications his government was involved in drug trafficking.

“I think there were a lot of lies that were repeated by Maduro in that letter,” Leavitt said.

She added, “We view the Maduro regime as illegitimate” and that Trump “has clearly shown that he's willing to use any and all means necessary to stop the illegal trafficking of deadly drugs from the Venezuelan regime.”

Trump previously announced fatal U.S. strikes on alleged drug smuggling vessels associated with Venezuela, and the president said Friday that a third strike took out another vessel, without providing location details.

A federal judge on Monday rule that the Trump administration can't continue to keep work paused on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project has been stopped since Aug. 22, when the Interior Department halted the project over unspecified national security concerns.

Both the developer and the two states sued in federal courts seeking to resume the project. Danish energy company Orsted sought a preliminary injunction in U.S. District Court in Washington that would allow the project to move forward.

Judge Royce Lamberth granted it, citing likely irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.

Several U.S. allies, including Canada, Australia and Britain, have announced support for a Palestinian state, putting them at odds with Trump.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt says Trump feels such recognition won't do anything to secure release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas, nor will it end the war between Israel and Hamas.He also believes such recognition rewards the militant group operating in Gaza.

“So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies,” Leavitt said, adding that Trump would address the issue in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is denying that Trump is attempting to weaponize the Justice Department by urging his attorney general to go after his perceived political foes.

Leavitt was asked at a White House briefing Monday about a social media post over the weekend that Trump directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi in which he demanded action on investigations related to public officials including former FBI Director James Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James. 

His post came one day after the top federal prosecutor in charge of the Eastern District of Virginia resigned his position amid pressure to bring charges against James in a mortgage fraud investigation.

Leavitt told reporters at the White House that Trump was merely trying to demand accountability. She denied that he had weaponized the Justice Department and instead blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for having done that.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has met with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa who is in New York this week as the first Syrian leader to attend the United Nations General Assembly in nearly 60 years.

Neither man spoke as they posed for photos ahead of their U.S.-hosted meeting at Rubio's midtown Manhattan hotel.

The last time a Syrian head of state attended the General Assembly was in 1967. That was before the 50-year rule of the Assad family dynasty, which came to an end in December when then-President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive led by al-Sharaa. Assad's fall also brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war.

Since then, al-Sharaa has sought to restore ties with Arab countries and the West, where officials were initially wary of his past ties with the al-Qaida militant group. The rebel group he formerly led, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, was previously designated by the United States as a terrorist group.

The State Department waived Assad-era visa restrictions on Syria for al-Sharaa and his delegation for them to participate in the general assembly's high-level week, which kicks off on Tuesday.

Trump flies to New York City later Monday to be in place for what White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said will be a “major speech” to the world body on Tuesday on the “renewal of American strength around the world” under his leadership.

Leavitt said Trump will also hold one-on-one meetings with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, and the leaders of Ukraine, Argentina and the European Union.

Trump on Tuesday will also hold a group meeting with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

He'll return to Washington after hosting a reception Tuesday night with more than 100 world leaders.

The Trump administration is appealing an appellate court panel's ruling that it cannot use an 18th century wartime law to speed deportations of people it says belong to a Venezuelan gang.

The administration appealed the 2-1 ruling from the panel on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — one of the most conservative in the nation — to the entire circuit. In doing so, the administration opted against an immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The administration argues the majority of the panel erred in second-guessing President Donald Trump's determination that the gang constitutes an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” under the Alien Enemies Act.

Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendan Carr is denying that he threatened to revoke ABC's local station licenses if the broadcasting company did not fire late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, despite saying last week that “these companies can find ways to take action on Kimmel or there is going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”

“Jimmy Kimmel is in the situation he's in because of his ratings. Not because of anything that's happened at the federal government level,” Carr said at the Concordia Annual Summit.

Carr said late night television hosts abandoned their role as “court jesters that make fun of everybody” and became “court clerks, where they were enforcing a very narrow, sort of partisan view.”

“And that's not for me, ultimately, to judge,” Carr said. “That's for the ratings and the audience to judge.”

The Trump administration has barred Iranian diplomats based in or visiting New York from shopping at wholesale club stores like Costco.

They also must get specific permission from the State Department before purchasing luxury goods.

The department's Office of Foreign Missions determined that diplomatic memberships in wholesale club stores as well as diplomats' ability to buy items like furs and jewelry are a “benefit” requiring U.S. government approval. 

However, the only country whose diplomats were specifically targeted is Iran.

Mike Waltz, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, appeared before the Security Council for the first time Monday.

Waltz spoke during the emergency meeting of the U.N.'s most powerful body on the topic of Russia's recent incursion into Estonian airspace.

“As we said, nine days ago, the United States stands by our NATO allies in the face of these airspace violations,” the former Republican congressman said.

“And I want to take this first opportunity to repeat and to emphasize the United States and our allies will defend every inch of NATO territory.”

Trump said Saturday that he will award Ben Carson the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, the third such award he's announced this month.

A former neurosurgeon who ran against Trump for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, Carson, 74, went on to serve as Housing and Urban Development secretary during Trump's first administration.

The one-time rivals developed a strong bond, and Carson — seen at one point as among the top contenders for Trump's running mate in the 2024 campaign — served as Trump's national faith chairman during last year's race.

Tech giant Oracle will receive a copy of TikTok's algorithm to operate for U.S. users, according to a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration on Monday.

Determining next steps for the algorithm, currently owned by the Beijing-based ByteDance, has been one of the most closely watched issues during negotiations over TikTok's future.

The Trump administration official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the emerging deal, said they believe the plan will satisfy national security concerns over a Chinese company potentially manipulating what is being shown to platform users.

Full details on investors have not been released. However, the official confirmed that Silver Lake, a private equity firm, is part of the investment group.

President Joe Biden, a Democrat, signed bipartisan legislation before leaving office requiring ByteDance, the Chinese company behind TikTok, to sell its assets to an American company or face a ban.

Trump, a Republican, has extended the deadline several times as he worked to reach a deal to keep TikTok available. He spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.

John Jovanovic, Trump's recently confirmed chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, vowed no more “business as usual” in public remarks criticizing a trade system he said has placed vital supply chains under the control of free market opponents.

“EXIM will no longer be focused on distractions, namely anything that does not help create jobs here in America and ensure American companies are treated fairly in every market in which they operate,” Jovanovic said at the Concordia Annual Summit in New York.

The event, scheduled for 4 p.m. in the Roosevelt Room, will be closely watched by scientists and advocates.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promised earlier this year to determine the cause of autism by September. 

The announcement alarmed experts because Kennedy has promoted discredited theories that routine childhood shots cause the developmental disability.

Speaking at a memorial for Charlie Kirk on Sunday, Trump said “I think we found an answer to autism.""On the flight back to Washington, he suggested that children receive too many vaccines. “It's like you're shooting up a horse,” he told reporters.

Through decades of ups-and-downs, bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River. Five months after its latest flood, production is back to normal, and few visible reminders exist of the mud-caked, debris-strewn mess. (AP Video: Dylan Lovan)

FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — The long history of bourbon production at Buffalo Trace Distillery has been connected to the Kentucky River — summed up as a blessing and curse by a plaque on the grounds.

In the 1800s, long before the Buffalo Trace name was attached to the distillery, the river served as a floating highway to bring in grain and other production essentials and to transport barrels of whiskey to markets along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. Even today, river water cools down production equipment. But the river flowing past the distillery flashed its destructive side in April.

A massive flood, caused by days of unrelenting rain, sent the Kentucky River surging over its banks, inundating most of the 200-plus-acre distillery grounds on its main campus in Frankfort. Nearly every phase of production was impacted, as were several warehouses where whiskey is aged.

“It was just something that was hard to process, but we knew we couldn't take too much time to process it,” said Tyler Adams, a distillery general manager. He said they had much to do to recover from the reservoir of murky water that swamped the bourbon-making campus.








Five months later, production at the distillery is back to normal, including of some of the most sought-after bourbons. Its lineup includes the namesake flagship brand, Buffalo Trace, as well as Eagle Rare, W.L. Weller and Blanton's. Pappy Van Winkle bourbons are distilled and aged at Buffalo Trace while the Van Winkle family remains in control of the coveted brand.

The distillery recently filled its 9 millionth barrel of bourbon since Prohibition, just two and a half years since filling the 8 millionth barrel. It has also introduced new whiskeys to its catalogue and is renovating a campus building into a cafe and events center.

The cleanup enlisted hundreds of plant employees and contract workers. Buffalo Trace fans swamped the distillery with offers to pitch in, Adams said. The distillery politely declined and suggested they might assist area residents instead.

Crews removed debris, sanitized equipment and pumped out what was left after floodwaters receded. Bourbon barrels swept into the parking lot caught some attention, Adams said. No chance for sneak samples, though — the barrels were empty.

Few visible reminders remain of that mud-caked, debris-strewn mess.

Some filled whiskey barrels touched by floodwaters were still being cleaned and tested, but the meticulous task of examining thousands of barrels was nearly complete, the distillery said. Quality control assessments found only small amounts of aging whiskey were impacted. High water marks are etched into some buildings and tour guides casually remind visitors of the epic event.

Danny Kahn, a master distiller for Buffalo Trace's parent company, says he still experiences “a little PTSD” when recalling those frantic days. River flooding has been a sporadic part of the distillery's history — including big ones in 1937 and 1978, but in early April, the floodwaters surged to previously unseen heights. Buffalo Trace had also just completed a decade-long, $1.2 billion expansion to double distilling capacity.

“It actually looked kind of calm, but I knew that it was not calm because we could see buildings were under 10 feet (3 meters) of water,” Kahn said. “It was really quite overwhelming.”

Activating their flood plans, workers shut down the distillery and did what they could to safeguard equipment. After that, all they could do was watch and wait. Distillery officials observed the devastation from higher ground and via drone footage.

Once the river crested, it took a few days for the floodwaters to fully recede, but operations gradually sprung back to life. Finished whiskey shipped out the day after the rain stopped. Bottling soon resumed and a makeshift gift shop opened until the visitors' center was repaired. Tours eventually resumed. But bourbon production halted for about a month as the cost for cleanup and repairs surpassed $30 million.

Several storage tanks shifted off their foundation. Some were repaired, others replaced. Dozens of electrical control panels were destroyed. About three-fourths of gift shop inventory was lost.

“It was just defeating to watch all this flooding and to realize that we're going to be down for a while,” Kahn said. “Just the apprehension of how much work this is going to be to fix. And when we finally got it done, it was really a sigh of relief and we get back to business as normal.”





For the American whiskey industry as a whole, it's been anything but business as usual.

After years of growth, prospects turned sour for the sector amid sluggish sales and trade uncertainties as President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs.

In 2024, American whiskey sales in the U.S. fell nearly 2%, the first such drop in supplier sales in more than 20 years, the Distilled Spirits Council said. Initial data for the first half of 2025 showed a continued decline, it said. American whiskey exports dropped more than 13% through July of this year compared to the year-ago period, it said. The American whiskey category includes bourbon, Tennessee whiskey and rye whiskey.

Lower domestic sales stem from a mix of market challenges, including supply chain disruptions and changes in consumer purchasing trends, said Chris Swonger, the council's CEO.

“While there's ongoing debate about whether these are temporary headwinds or signs of a more fundamental shift in consumer behavior, large and small distilleries across the country are under pressure,” Swonger said in a statement.

Kentucky distilleries producing such prominent brands as Buffalo Trace, Jim Beam, Maker's Mark, Woodford Reserve, Wild Turkey and Four Roses can weather downturns better than small producers.

Heaven Hill Brands, another large producer, recently celebrated its new $200 million distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky, taking a long view of market prospects by significantly boosting bourbon capacity.

“As an independent, family-owned company, we don't have to chase quarterly trends; we're building for the next generation,” said Kate Latts, co-president of Heaven Hill Brands, whose brands include Evan Williams and Elijah Craig. “This distillery reflects that philosophy.”

At Buffalo Trace, its future is entrenched alongside the Kentucky River, realizing that more floods could come in the years ahead. The distillery learned lessons to be even better prepared next time.

“This area being a National Historic Landmark, being right on the river, there's only so much you can do to hold back that water,” Adams said. “Your best bet is to prepare for it, do what you can. But holding back that water? It's really inevitable it's going to make it into some spaces.”

AUBURN, Ala. (AP) — Auburn coach Bruce Pearl announced his retirement Monday less than six months after finishing the Tigers' best season in program history with another trip to the Final Four.

Pearl's 38-year-old son Steven Pearl, who has been on his father's coaching staff for all 11 seasons at Auburn, will take over as coach.

“I just feel when I can't give 100% it's time to pass the torch,” Bruce Pearl said in a 14-minute video posted on social media.

Pearl, 65, is the school's winningest men's coach and took the Tigers to their only two Final Four appearances. He will move into an ambassador role as an assistant to Auburn's athletic director, and isn't going into politics after rumors had circulated about a potential senate run.

“Many of you know that I thought and prayed about maybe running for United States Senate, maybe to be the next great senator from the state of Alabama,” said Pearl, who was a college head coach for over 30 seasons with four schools. “That would have required leaving Auburn, and instead the university has given me the opportunity to stay here and be Auburn's senator. I need to focus now on being a great husband, being a great father, being the best grandfather I possibly can be.”

Pearl advanced the Tigers to their first Final Four in 2019, defeating Kansas, North Carolina and Kentucky in successive games. They lost to eventual-champion Virginia by one point. Last season, led by All-American Johni Broome, the Tigers earned the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and had a school-record 32 wins before losing to Southeastern Conference rival Florida in the national semifinal.

SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey credited Pearl with helping to elevate the competitive level and popularity of men's basketball in the league with his “dynamic leadership and relentless energy.” 




“While his on-court achievements are well documented, it is his genuine connection with fans, media and the broader community that truly distinguishes his impact,” Sankey said.

Pearl and Rick Pitino, who ushered in a quick turnaround at St. John's, last season shared The Associated Press men's college basketball coach of the year award. It was the first tie in the 58-year history of the award.

Pearl had a 246-125 record at Auburn, but the school recognizes only 232 of those wins after vacating games from the 2016-17 season because of NCAA infractions involving former assistant coach Chuck Person. Pearl received a two-game suspension for failure to monitor his assistant and adequately promote compliance.

Tennessee had fired Pearl in 2011 after the NCAA charged him with unethical conduct and then additional violations surfaced. He was 145-71 and made the NCAA Tournament all six seasons with the Volunteers from 2005-11, getting to the Sweet 16 three times, and advancing to their first regional final in 2010.

Auburn hired Pearl in March 2014, when he was in the final months of his show-cause penalty, to take over a program that hadn't been to the NCAA Tournament since 2003. The Tigers went six times, all in the past seven seasons.

Before his two SEC stops, Pearl won an NCAA Division II national championship in 1995 with Southern Indiana while going 231-46 in his first head coaching job from 1992-01. He then was 86-38 in four seasons at Milwaukee, going to the NCAA Sweet 16 in 2005 before getting hired by Tennessee.

Steven Pearl played 101 games for his father at Tennessee from 2007-11. He was a medical sales representative for three years before joining the Auburn staff in 2014, and was promoted to associate head coach before the 2023-24 season.

“There is nobody more qualified or in a position to maintain our culture of faith, family and doing it the Auburn way than Steven,” Bruce Pearl said. “He's actually tougher than I am, and just as competitive. Out of loyalty to Auburn and me, Steven passed on several previous chances to pursue head coaching opportunities, choosing instead to invest in our men's basketball program and help it reach unprecedented heights.”

When Bruce Pearl served his two-game suspension early in the 2021-22 season, Steven Pearl was the acting head coach in a pair of lopsided wins.

Auburn AD John Cohen said when he took the job three years ago, Bruce Pearl made it clear he was nearing the end of his career. Cohen said there was an internal national search to prepare for when that happened.

“Throughout our detailed process, it became obvious to me and our staff that Steven Pearl was clearly the best fit for Auburn,” Cohen said. “His expertise in coaching defense, his skills as an evaluator, recruiter, teacher and motivator, and his relationships with our student-athletes and staff were paramount.”

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino reports on the latest in the Ryan Routh trial on 'Fox Report.'

Jurors in Fort Pierce, Florida, began deliberations Tuesday in the federal criminal trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at his Palm Beach golf course last year.

Routh, 59, faces five federal charges, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. If convicted, he could face life in prison.

Prosecutors used their closing arguments Tuesday to emphasize both the digital and forensic evidence presented at trial and what they described as Routh's clear intent: to kill Trump. 

""This was not a publicity stunt,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Browne told the jury. ""The evidence has shown one thing and one thing only — the defendant wanted Donald Trump dead,"" Browne said, adding that the worst part was that he ""almost got away"" with it.

Browne told jurors that Routh ""excessively"" stalked Trump's locations and whereabouts in the weeks before the alleged assassination attempt on Sept. 15, 2024. 

He noted that Routh allegedly traveled on 17 separate occasions to scope out the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. These were ""reconnaissance"" missions, Browne argued.

Browne reminded jurors that there were 19 rounds found in the magazine of the SKS rifle recovered at the scene, including one in the chamber. 

There is ""no doubt, no reasonable doubt, no doubt whatsoever that it was the man,"" Browne said, pointing at Routh, ""who was hiding"" in the sniper's nest. 

Browne told jurors that his motives were also on clear display, pointing to lyrics from a rap song Routh wrote about killing Trump with a sniper rifle — one he penned after he was caught and arrested by the FBI. 

""It's not every case where the defendant writes down his intent on a piece of paper,"" Browne said.

The prosecution spent most of its time Tuesday focusing on count one of the five federal criminal charges Routh is facing: Attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate.

The contrast between Routh's defense and federal prosecutors is a dynamic that has been on stark display throughout the trial. 

Federal prosecutors spent roughly two weeks walking jurors through hundreds of exhibits and testimony from 38 witnesses to make their case against Routh.

Prosecutors methodically built their case with cellphone data placing Routh at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where they said he created a ""sniper's nest"" near the sixth hole. They also introduced bank records, burner phone purchases, and DNA evidence linking him to the SKS rifle recovered at the scene.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon has grown increasingly frustrated with Routh's decision to represent himself without a law degree or formal training. Before adjourning Monday, she warned him that any arguments must be ""reasonably tied to the admitted evidence.""

Routh confirmed he understood and told Cannon he would not testify on his own behalf, despite her repeated offers for him to reconsider and consult with standby counsel.

President Donald Trump got laughs from world leaders when saying that the teleprompter operator is ""in big trouble,"" during his Tuesday address to the United Nations General Assembly.

President Donald Trump drew laughs from world leaders within moments of taking the stage at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.

Trump joked about a broken escalator in the UN building as well as the broken teleprompters right in front of him.

""Thank you very much, I very much appreciate it,"" he said to the applause as he took the stage.

""And I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working,"" he said as the leaders laughed.

""I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless, and that way you speak more from the heart. I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,"" he added, drawing more laughter.

Trump again drew laughs later on by recounting his dissatisfaction with the UN's assistance in global conflicts.

""I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of these countries and never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalizing the deal,"" Trump said. ""All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that on the way up stopped right in the middle.""

""If the first lady wasn't in great shape she would've fallen. But she's in great shape, we're both in good shape. We both stood,"" he added, drawing more laughter.

""These are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter,"" he said.

‘Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream previews her show on the FBI raid of former National Security Advisor John Bolton's home and potential charges over alleged confidential emails on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

FIRST ON FOX: The House Oversight Committee is setting its sights on insurance companies that may have discriminated against entities with right-wing views.

The panel is also looking into whether retirees' pension accounts were being used to invest in progressive policies they may not necessarily agree with, Fox News Digital has learned.

""The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating improper restrictions on access to capital and capital markets of individuals and entities based on political viewpoints or involvement in certain industries (such as cryptocurrency, energy, and firearms),"" Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

""The Committee has engaged with whistleblowers who had their insurance policies cancelled for widely-held political positions or for operating legal businesses considered out of favor by progressive activists.""

HOUSE PASSES TRUMP-BACKED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

The move is an expansion of the House Oversight Committee's ongoing investigation into whether public financial institutions engaged in debanking against people and entities with right-wing views.

Comer is also probing whether companies implementing progressive policies are doing so at the expense of millions of retired Americans' personal investments.

He wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in his capacity as acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that his panel ""is investigating the prolific use of proxy proposals and other activism targeting corporate boards of directors by activists pursuing political agendas at the expense of the retirement and personal savings of Americans.""

BILL BARR TESTIFIES HE DIDN'T SEE INFO THAT WOULD 'IMPLICATE' TRUMP IN EPSTEIN CASE, COMER SAYS

""Specifically, the Committee seeks to understand how giant investment managers and pension fund managers, aided by proxy advisory firms, sidestepped or abandoned their fiduciary duties to beneficiaries to pursue a political agenda and whether new legislation is needed to protect investors,"" Comer stated.

""At a minimum, Americans deserve to fully know if their hard-earned savings are being used in a progressive playbook.""

The letter accused certain large asset management firms like BlackRock of putting clients' money into green energy initiatives, for example, rather than more profitable areas, in order to promote a left-wing agenda.

BlackRock pushed back on such accusations in a public statement on its website, however.

""One of the most critical tasks of an asset manager is to provide clients with insights on short- and long-term trends in the global economy that can impact their portfolios. We do this across all sectors – from healthcare to technology to energy,"" the company wrote.

""Climate risk is one such trend given its implications for the economy. We believe that companies that better manage their exposure to climate risk and capitalize on opportunities will generate better long term financial outcomes.""

BlackRock's website also asserted that the ""choice of where to invest ultimately rests with our clients.""

""We are bound to adhere to their investment guidelines and objectives. We do not dictate particular investment strategies,"" it said.

And on a broader scale, the committee looking into whether publicly-traded companies are running afoul of President Donald Trump's executive order outlawing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices by simply listing it under another name.

""[T]he Committee remains concerned following reports of publicly traded companies intentionally camouflaging or rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies to hide such discrimination from ""the Trump Administration, courts or influential activists,'"" Comer wrote to several organizations opposing corporate discrimination, including the Alliance Defending Freedom. 

""At minimum, shareholders and retirement plan beneficiaries deserve transparency around discriminatory practices employed by corporate directors and officers as such behavior is rebranded. Replacing DEI and ESG titles with 'employee engagement' or ‘inclusion and impact' represents yet another deceptive practice.""

Trump's order, signed in January 2025, barred financial institutions, major corporations, colleges and universities, law enforcement agencies and specific industries like medicine and commercial airlines from promoting or implementing DEI standards.

Comer accused the previous White House of promoting discriminatory practices, however, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""The Oversight Committee is investigating discriminatory practices in the American financial system and the Biden Administration's role in supporting them,"" he wrote. ""Whether it is using the boardroom to achieve what the political left could not accomplish at the ballot box, or canceling Americans' insurance policies and debanking them for their political views, these actions are wrong and deprive Americans of their constitutional rights.""

President Trump is among dozens of world leaders taking the podium as the UN General Assembly begins in NYC.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday once again called on all European partners in the NATO alliance to cut dependence on Russian oil.

In his lengthy address to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump accused NATO allies of ""funding the war against themselves.""

""Who the hell ever heard of that one?"" Trump mocked.

TRUMP DEMANDS NATO ALLIES HALT RUSSIAN OIL PURCHASES BEFORE NEW US SANCTIONS

""China and India are the primary funders of the ongoing war by continuing to purchase Russian oil,"" he said. ""But inexcusably, even NATO countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products, which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago, and I wasn't happy.""

European nations have drastically cut their reliance on Moscow's oil following Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, though they have not cut it off entirely.

Hungary, Slovakia, France, Belgium and Spain remain Europe's top importers of Russian energy. 

While Hungary and Slovakia continue to purchase Russian oil, France is the second-largest European purchaser of Russian energy and continues to import liquefied natural gas (LNG).

TRUMP SAYS HE'S RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WITH PUTIN 'FAST' OVER UKRAINE CONFLICT NEGOTIATIONS

LNG has largely bypassed EU sanctions and Paris' continued import of Russian energy is down to pre-exsisting ""take or pay"" contracts that run through the early 2030s that require France to either continue to import the energy or face penalties. 

Trump earlier this month took issue with European nations that continue to purchase Russian oil, but on Tuesday he adjusted his comments to include all Russian energy imports – notably a shift that came one day after France broke with the U.S. over the issue of Palestinian statehood.

""In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly,"" Trump said. ""But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.""

""You're much closer to the city. We have an ocean in between. You're right there, and Europe has to step it up,"" he added. ""They have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia, otherwise, we're all wasting a lot of time.""

Trump said he will speak with Euroepan leaders about the issue while at the UN this week.

Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss political tension on Capitol Hill surrounding a bill for government funding and how it could possibly lead to a government shutdown.

President Donald Trump canceled a meeting with top congressional Democrats on Tuesday over ""unserious and ridiculous demands"" as the deadline to fund the government fast approaches.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., were set to meet with Trump on Thursday to discuss a path forward to avert a partial government shutdown before the Sept. 30 deadline.

Lawmakers are still away from Washington, D.C., this week to observe the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, and the Senate is expected to return on Sept. 29. Meanwhile, the House is expected to be out until the deadline passes.

But Trump nixed the meeting in a lengthy post on his social media platform Truth Social, where he blasted the duo for pushing ""radical Left policies that nobody voted for."" 

""I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,"" Trump said. 

The now canceled meeting with Trump came on the heels of a letter from Schumer and Jeffries sent over that weekend where the top congressional Democrats laid the possibility of a shutdown on his and Republicans' feet.

They argued that the Trump-backed short-term extension was ""dirty,"" which would mean it had partisan policy riders or spending attached to it, and panned it for continuing ""the Republican assault on healthcare,"" ignoring expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium subsidies, and possibly leading to the closure of hospitals and other healthcare facilities across the country.

""With the September 30th deadline fast approaching, Republicans will bear responsibility for another painful government shutdown because of the refusal of GOP congressional leadership to even talk with Democrats,"" they wrote at the time.

But Trump argued that their bill would allow for the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts in his ""big, beautiful bill"" to be repealed, and also blasted the Democratic continuing resolution (CR) for ending his megabill's $50 billion rural hospital fund. 

TRUMP-APPROVED PLAN TO AVERT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SCUTTLED BY SENATE

""We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed,"" he said. 

""I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter,"" Trump continued. ""They must do their job! Otherwise, it will just be another long and brutal slog through their radicalized quicksand. To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court. I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for. DO THE RIGHT THING!""

Schumer and Jeffries last month demanded a meeting with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to strike a deal, given that Thune will need Democratic support in the Senate.

However, that meeting has so far not come to fruition — though Thune has pushed back on Schumer's characterization and argued that if the Democratic leader wants to talk, it's on him to make it happen.

""After weeks of Republican stonewalling in Congress, President Trump has agreed to meet this week in the Oval Office,"" they said in a joint statement. ""In the meeting, we will emphasize the importance of addressing rising costs, including the Republican healthcare crisis. It's past time to meet and work to avoid a Republican-caused shutdown.""

The last time Schumer went to negotiate with Trump at the White House ahead of a looming deadline in 2018, the government shut down for 35 days, which marked the longest partial closure in history. At the time, Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., were at odds with Trump on a deal to fund construction of a wall on the southern border.

Prior to the meeting being announced, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that if the government shuttered, it ""would be the fault of the Democrats.""

""We want a clean funding extension to keep the government open, that's all we're advocating for,"" she said.

SENATE REPUBLICANS BLOCK DEMOCRATS' 'FILTHY' COUNTEROFFER AS SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS

However, the House Republicans' bill is relatively ""clean,"" save for tens of millions in spending for increasing security measures for lawmakers in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Congressional Democrats' counter-proposal, which also failed last week, included more funding for member security, but also sought to repeal the healthcare portion of Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" claw back billions of canceled funding for NPR and PBS, and permanently extend the expiring ACA credits.

Thune noted last week that CRs ""aren't places to load big health policy changes in.""  

""I think that we are open to the conversation about what we do with the ObamaCare premium tax credit,"" Thune said. ""Is that something in which members, Republican senators, and I think, for that matter, Republican House members, have an interest, as well.""

""But this isn't the place to do that,"" he continued. ""This is the place to fund the government, to allow our appropriations process to continue that issue.""

OutKick founder Clay Travis weighs in on ABC's decision to bring back Jimmy Kimmel from suspension on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Nexstar Media Group, Inc., announced on Tuesday that it will continue preempting ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" despite Disney allowing the show to return to ABC. 

""We made a decision last week to preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve,"" the company said in a statement. 

""In the meantime, we note that ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets,"" Nexstar added.

Nexstar owns 32 ABC affiliate stations. 

Sinclair Broadcast Group, which operates 30 ABC affiliates, also announced Monday it would continue to preempt the show. 

""Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,"" the company's statement read.

Kimmel's late-night show was initially pulled off the air last Wednesday after Kimmel's remarks about the alleged assassin of Charlie Kirk sparked outrage and a veiled threat from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Disney decided to suspend the show after Nexstar and Sinclair pulled airings of Kimmel from their stations, and Kimmel reportedly had told executives he would not apologize for his comments.

The situation caused outrage among liberals, who said Kimmel was being punished for exercising freedom of speech. Conservatives countered that Kimmel's comments suggesting Kirk's suspected killer was a MAGA member were outrageous and false. 

Disney announced Kimmel's return on Monday. He is expected to address the controversy on the show Tuesday night.

The saga began last Monday when Kimmel accused conservatives of reaching ""new lows"" in trying to pin a left-wing ideology on 22-year-old suspected Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson.

""We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,"" Kimmel said.

Kirk was assassinated during a college event at Utah Valley University Sept. 10. The 31-year-old father of two was answering a question about transgender mass shooters when Robinson allegedly shot him in the neck, killing him. Robinson was romantically linked to a transgender partner, and text messages released by the FBI purport to show him confessing to the murder. 

On Wednesday, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr called Kimmel's comments ""some of the sickest conduct"" and suggested there were potential ""avenues"" the FCC could pursue.

Nexstar Media Group is the largest local television broadcasting group in the U.S., with more than 200 owned or partner stations that serve 220 million people in 116 U.S. markets.

Last month, Nexstar announced a deal to acquire broadcast media company Tegna for $6.2 billion, which Nexstar said will help ensure the viability of local news and programming. 

Nexstar noted that its station footprint overlaps with Tegna in 35 of Tegna's 51 market areas, while also boosting its affiliate network in key election markets like Phoenix, Atlanta, Toledo, Ohio, and Portland, Maine, to increase political advertising revenue. 

Nexstar's acquisition of Tegna requires the approval of the FCC.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Google vows to restore YouTube content creators banned over political speech","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/technology/3819776/google-vows-restore-youtube-creators-banned-political-speech/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:02:41 GMT","

Google has indicated that it plans to restore YouTube content creators who were banned for violating the platform's past political speech policies, the House Judiciary Committee announced on Tuesday.

Under the Biden administration, Google targeted conservative accounts for covering politically divisive topics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election.

A lawyer for Google's parent company admitted the Biden administration exerted its executive authority, pressuring the tech company to censor people and remove certain content in a new letter to Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.

“Senior Biden Administration officials, including White House officials, conducted repeated and sustained outreach to Alphabet and pressed the Company regarding certain user-generated content related to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not violate its policies,” Alphabet counsel Daniel Donovan wrote.

“While the Company continued to develop and enforce its policies independently, Biden Administration officials continued to press the Company to remove non-violative user-generated content.”

The lawyer called the Biden White House's censorship pressure “unacceptable and wrong,” adding that Google “has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds.”

Google's statement came as a result of Jordan's March 6 subpoena to Google as part of his investigation into the company, according to a Judiciary Committee press release.

In the letter, Google committed itself to protecting free expression and applying its community guidelines and terms of service “equally to all users” and “to all types of content, regardless of the viewpoints expressed.”

Google removed channels for violating its policies on election-related content through 2023 and COVID-19 content through 2024, Donovan said.

The company has since overhauled its policies that unfairly targeted political speech.

“Reflecting the Company's commitment to free expression, YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect,” the letter reads.

The Washington Examiner contacted Google for further comment.

TECH COMPANY PENALTIES HANG OVER TRUMP'S UK STATE VISIT

Among the top conservative figures who were removed from YouTube are now-Deputy FBI Director Dan Bongino, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and current Trump deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka. Each of them were permanently banned for speaking on alleged misinformation about COVID-19 or the 2020 election, which President Donald Trump claimed was rigged against him.

It remains to be seen whether previously banned content creators take up Google on its offer to return to the video platform.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump used his address to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly to decry the state of the organization and detail his vision for a new world order.

Acting as a metaphor for the U.N. as a whole, Trump complained that he was met with a broken escalator and a malfunctioning teleprompter, before tearing apart the organization itself over the course of an hour. He compared the failures of the U.N. with his own domestic accomplishments, including immigration and the economy, and his foreign policy achievements.

“Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world that was prosperous and at peace in my first term,” Trump told the U.N.'s annual leaders summit on Tuesday. “Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents,” he said, referencing the Russia–Ukraine and Israel–Hamas conflicts.

To that end, Trump asked the crowd what the purpose of the U.N. is, contending that it “has such tremendous potential” but that “it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.”

“For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a strongly worded letter and never follow that letter up,” he said. “It's empty words, and empty words do not solve war. The only thing that solves war is action.”

LIVE UPDATES: WORLD LEADERS GATHER IN NEW YORK FOR 2025 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY

Trump escalated his criticism, claiming that not only did he not receive a phone call from the U.N. as he tried to negotiate peace deals, but that the organization “is actually creating new problems,” particularly regarding immigration.

“All I got from the U.N. was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle and a teleprompter that didn't work,” he said. “The best example is the No. 1 political issue of our time — the crisis of uncontrolled migration. Your countries are being ruined. The U.N. is funding an assault on Western countries.”

Trump, who also said, “Everyone says I should get the Nobel Peace Prize,” acknowledged the foreign policy challenges posed by the likes of Israel, Gaza, Russia, and Ukraine, in addition to Iran and Venezuela. At the same time, he underscored a new dynamic between the United States, Europe, and China.

Of Iran, Trump repeated that his position “is very simple: the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon.”

Then, of Israel and Hamas, Trump reiterated that the terrorist organization should reduce its demands and instead release its remaining hostages “now.”

Regarding Russia and Ukraine, Trump criticized China and India as “the primary funders” of the war because they continue to rely on Russian energy before alleging that NATO allies are “funding the war against themselves” through similar oil purchases.

“In the event that Russia is not ready to make a deal to end the war, then the United States is fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs,” he said. “But for those tariffs to be effective, European nations would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.”

Trump had a particularly stark warning for Europe, again regarding immigration, asserting London Mayor Sadiq Khan, for example, wanted to introduce Sharia law toi his city to murmurs from the audience.

“It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now,” he said. “I can tell you. I'm really good at this stuff — your countries are going to hell.”

A senior diplomat, who made a quip about the U.N. headquarters building, particularly its air conditioning, told the Washington Examiner it was “great” that Trump “recognizes the potential of the U.N.” 

“He mentioned Europe multiple times,” the source said. “This I take as an evidence that the U.S. is ready to engage with its closest ally. There are things we [have] already done like a trade deal. There are things where the [European Union] moved much faster on support for Ukraine and sanctions.”

During his bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, Trump appeared to temper his address, telling the former Portuguese prime minister that the U.S. is behind the U.N. “100 percent.” 

“I think the potential of the United Nations is incredible. Really incredible. It can do so much. I'm behind it. I may disagree with it some times, but I am so behind it,” he said. “The potential for peace with this institution is so great. So I just want to thank you for treating us so lovely.”

During his address, before he scrutinized climate change and renewable energy policies as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” Trump announced that his administration would “lead an international effort to enforce [the] Biological Weapons Convention, which is going to be meeting with the top leaders of the world by pioneering an [artificial intelligence] verification system that everyone can trust.”

“I'm really good at predicting things,” he said. “During the campaign, they had a hat, a bestselling hat, ‘Trump was right about everything.' And I don't say that in a braggadocious way, but it's true. I've been right about everything.”

At the start of the address, Trump seemed to enjoy a warm welcome, mentioning that the teleprompter was not working for his remarks as first lady Melania Trump, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, newly confirmed U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz, and Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff watched on.

“Whoever is operating this teleprompter is in big trouble,” he said to laughs.

During his own address to the U.N. General Assembly, Guterres bemoaned decreases in foreign aid funding as “wreaking havoc” on advancements made since the U.N. was established 80 years ago.

“They are a death sentence for many,” he said. “For so many more, a stolen future. This is the great paradox of our time. We have the solutions, but we are siphoning off the fuel that would make it possible to make progress. To choose dignity, we must choose financial justice and solidarity. We need to reform the international financial architecture so it drives development for all.”

For American Enterprise Institute senior fellow Brett Schaefer, Trump “undermined his message by going off script for extended moments that distracted the listener and blurred what precisely he wanted the U.N. and the assembled governments to do to support to America's priorities and respond to its concerns.”

“This was not a wasted opportunity, but one that could have been better utilized,” he told the Washington Examiner.

Trump and the first lady arrived together on Tuesday at the U.N. headquarters, where they were greeted by U.N. officials and interested onlookers alike at the delegate entrance. Some observers waved to Trump, with the president responding with fist pumps after having to walk up the escalator that was not working.

Trump is expected to with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after his address and take part in a multilateral sit-down with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

“After these important meetings, the president will attend a reception tomorrow night with more than 100 world leaders before returning to Washington, D.C.,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday canceled a sit-down with Democratic congressional leaders less than 24 hours after a meeting was confirmed on the looming government shutdown.

The president said that after reviewing the “unserious and ridiculous” demands from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), he determined no meeting could “possibly be productive.”

“There are consequences to losing Elections but, based on their letter to me, the Democrats haven't figured that out yet,” Trump said in a post to Truth Social.

The Washington Examiner confirmed on Monday that a meeting between Trump and the leaders would take place on Thursday. Less than a day later, the president changed his mind, telling Jeffries and Schumer that the “ball is in your court” and they “must do their job.”

“I look forward to meeting with you when you become realistic about the things that our Country stands for,” Trump said.

The president is the latest Republican placing blame for a possible government shutdown on the Democrats despite the GOP holding the White House and both chambers of Congress. Historically, any shutdown reflects badly on the party in power, but Republicans have been quick to argue that they are advocating a short-term spending deal that maintains Biden administration spending levels and that Democrats want unnecessary additions such as an extension of Obamacare subsidies.

Jeffries said in a post to X that Trump “Always Chickens Out.”

“Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,” Jeffries said. “The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America.”

Schumer said in a statement, “Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there. While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job. Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.”

The deadline is fast approaching on Sept. 30, when the federal government will shut down. House lawmakers passed a short-term spending deal on Friday and sent it over to the Senate, but that proposal and an alternative from Democrats both failed on the floor.

House members are expected to be in a two-week recess until after Oct. 1, while the Senate is likely to return on Sept. 29 for last-minute negotiations on the continuing resolution to fund the government. The bill extends funding until Nov. 21 to allow lawmakers to continue working on passing all 12 appropriations bills for the fiscal year.

DEMOCRATS RISK SHUTDOWN BLAME GAME WITH GOVERNMENT FUNDING HARDBALL

Democrats offered a proposal that would include money for member security in addition to the funds proposed in the GOP's continuing resolution, as well as include provisions to extend the Obamacare tax credits that expire at the end of the year. Schumer and Jeffries have been in lockstep when it comes to a blockade, arguing they won't vote for it unless there are healthcare concessions.

Here he goes again. The self-deluding Barack Obama hit a new low last week when he tried to absolve his presidency of any responsibility for the deep divisions in America that led to Charlie Kirk's assassination. Instead, Obama blamed President Donald Trump.

“Those extreme views were not in my White House,” Obama claimed in remarks to the Jefferson Society. “I wasn't empowering them. I wasn't putting the weight of the United States government behind them. When we have the weight of the United States government behind extremist views, we've got a problem.”

Either I've misremembered Obama's two terms in the Oval Office, or he's delusional. 

Beginning with a 2010 Univision interview, in which he urged Hispanics to “punish our enemies” in the midterm elections, Obama started dividing Americans into friends and foes. Obama was the first modern president to rally voters against the opposing party by calling them “enemies.” That kind of divisive rhetoric hadn't been used since the Civil War. In the Univision interview, Obama said publicly what he'd been saying privately for over a year. In the spring of 2009, the populist tea party movement sprang up in response to the Federal Reserve's bailouts of Wall Street, while Main Street businesses went under and millions of Americans lost their homes.

Its supporters were largely the class of Americans Obama belittled at a San Francisco fundraiser as “bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment.” Primed by his own prejudices to see these fellow Americans as a political threat, Obama went on offense. His strategy was to use the media to smear tea party patriots as bigots. Obama directed White House aides to put the word out to legacy media that the movement was motivated not by the individual liberty, pro-market, and small government principles it proclaimed but by racism, pure and simple.

Suddenly, millions of Americans found themselves labeled as racist enemies of the Obama White House. Soon thereafter, the tea party was under scrutiny by the IRS. Lois Lerner, head of the tax agency's Exempt Organizations Unit, oversaw the denial of tax-exempt status to tea party-affiliated groups and demands for lists of donors. In congressional testimony, Lerner pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid incriminating herself and was censured by Congress as a result.

In his memoir A Promised Land, Obama reveals how his hatred of the tea party morphed into his belief that Republicans were the “enemy.” He attacked Sarah Palin, the 2012 GOP vice presidential candidate and subsequent leader of the tea party movement. “Through Palin,” Obama wrote, “it seemed as if the dark spirits that had long been lurking on the edges of the modern Republican Party — xenophobia, anti-intellectualism, paranoid conspiracy theories, an antipathy toward black and brown folks — were finding their way to center stage.”

Victor Davis Hanson was on to Obama's game years earlier. In a January 2012 CBS News column titled “Barack Obama's Most Disturbing Legacy,” he chronicled Obama's propensity for dividing Americans by race and ethnicity. He termed it “racial tribalism.” Hanson explained the political calculus behind Obama's racial tactics.

“Any short-term damage incurred by engaging in racial tribalism can easily be later erased by soaring teleprompted speeches on racial harmony; the media will either not widely report his emphases on race or generally support his charges; a person of color can hardly be culpable of racial polarization himself given the history of racial discrimination in this country,” Hansen wrote.

“There will be many legacies of Barack Obama,” Hansen concluded. “Racial divisiveness is proving the most disturbing.”

Hansen's prediction of polarization was prescient. In January 2017, Gallup released a poll headlined “Obama Job Approval Ratings Most Politically Polarized By Far.” Under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, polarization was minimal. It began its climb during George W. Bush's presidency and then soared under Obama to a 70% gap between Democrats and Republicans. 

Obama's worldview that Republicans, especially white Republicans, were “enemies” and all opponents racists and bigots drove polarization to extremes. In his second term, he harped on race. 

“Racism, we are not cured of,” Obama said on a 2015 podcast with comedian Marc Maron, “and it's not just a matter of it not being polite to say ‘n*****' in public. That's not a measure of whether racism still exists or not. Societies don't overnight completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior.”

Obama foreshadowed Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo's critique of America as systemically racist. This was pure critical race theory, a harbinger of the CRT and diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives that relied on a concept psychologists term “splitting,” in which the world is divided into moral absolutes like oppressors and the oppressed, or anti-racists and racists, with no shades of gray.

Splitting, psychologists tell us, is an ego-defense that helps people cling to a rigid belief system, aka political ideology, when confronted with facts that don't fit into their orthodoxy. The conscious self safeguards the ego's belief system from challenge, but the unconscious self realizes the difference between belief and reality.

Self-deception results as a related ego-defense mechanism.

With some people, the self-delusion is so extreme that they can lie, believing at a conscious level that they're telling the truth. That's why Obama maintains with a straight face that he and his White House were not extremist when the facts plainly present otherwise.

A telecommunications network posing a threat to senior United States officials at the United Nations General Assembly meeting this week has been “dismantled,” the Secret Service announced on Tuesday.

If successful, the network of electronic devices would have disabled cellphone towers and effectively shut down the cellular network in New York City. It would also have enabled denial of services attacks and facilitated anonymous, encrypted communications between threat actors and criminal enterprises.

The Secret Service says the plot no longer represents a threat to the New York tristate area.

“The potential for disruption to our country's telecommunications posed by this network of devices cannot be overstated,” Secret Service Director Sean Curran said in a statement. “The U.S. Secret Service's protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled.”

LIVE UPDATES: WORLD LEADERS GATHER IN NEW YORK FOR 2025 UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY 

Over 100,000 SIM cards and 300 colocated SIM servers were discovered across multiple sites within 35 miles of the U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.

The federal agency moved quickly to thwart the telecommunications threat, given that President Donald Trump and other high-ranking U.S. officials are attending the global meeting.

The investigation remains ongoing, and no arrests have been made.

The Secret Service led the investigation in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations, the Justice Department, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the New York City Police Department.

In a video, Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool revealed foreign actors may have been communicating with people known to federal law enforcement based on early analysis. He declined to share further details, given the sensitivity of the investigation.

McCool said law enforcement would continue investigating whether the plot was designed to disrupt the U.N. meeting.

The late Rep. Raúl Grijalva's (D-AZ) daughter is expected to sail to victory in Arizona's special election Tuesday, slimming Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) razor-thin majority and likely forcing a House vote on Jeffrey Epstein's case files.

Adelita Grijalva is poised to beat Republican Daniel Butierez in a race to fill her father's 7th Congressional District seat, marking the second special election this month. She won the crowded Democratic primary with many endorsements from both Arizona Sens. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ), along with those on the progressive Left, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT). 

Raúl Grijalva died of complications from cancer treatments at the age of 77, just two months after having begun his seventh term in the House. Adelita Grijalva is seeking to finish her father's term, a situation similar to when the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee died and her daughter, former Rep. Erica Lee Carter, finished her term. 

The special election could be a turning point in the release of more files related to Epstein, the deceased convicted sex offender. 

MAJOR HOUSE REPUBLICAN PLAYERS HEAD FOR THE EXITS, LEAVING GAPS IN THE LOWER CHAMBER

Rep. Thomas Massie's (R-KY) and Rep. Ro Khanna's (D-CA) discharge petition is merely one signature short of forcing Johnson to put their Epstein transparency bill on the House floor for a vote. Tuesday's special election could deliver the final signature needed. The so-called “discharge petition” must reach 218 signatures before the authors can call a vote after seven legislative days. All Democrats have been joined by four Republicans, making up the 217 signatures as of Monday.

Adelita Grijalva confirmed to the Washington Examiner earlier this month that she would sign the Epstein discharge petition if she wins the special election on Tuesday and is sworn into Congress.

The current House GOP majority is two seats, with 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats, after Virginia held its special election earlier this month to replace the late House Oversight ranking member Gerry Connolly. Connolly's former chief of staff, Democrat James Walkinshaw, won the seat, meaning Johnson can only afford to lose two GOP votes and still pass legislation along party lines. Grijalva's special election won't change the margin if a Democrat wins, due to House numbers.

MAJOR HOUSE REPUBLICAN PLAYERS HEAD FOR THE EXITS LEAVING GAPS IN THE LOWER CHAMBER

But if Democrats hold on to the late Rep. Sylvester Turner's (D-TX) seat, Johnson's majority would shrink to just a one-vote margin. That election is set for Nov. 4, and Turner's seat is expected to remain blue, given that it is a D+21 district.

Another special election will be held to replace former Tennessee Republican Rep. Mark Green. This election is set for Dec. 2 and would give Republicans a slight reprieve heading into the new year. A Republican victory would help Johnson back up to a two-seat margin.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

For the first time in more than 30 years, attacks by the far left outnumber those by the far right.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

No matter how hard ideologues try to exclusively blame their political foes for acts of political violence, the truth is that violent extremists today emerge from across the political spectrum. We have studied this problem and believe that our data can help illuminate an issue too often defined by partisan finger-pointing. As part of a study to be published this week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, we compiled and analyzed a data set of 750 attacks and plots in the United States from January 1, 1994, to July 4, 2025. Our research focuses only on incidents of terrorism, which we define as attacks or plots by a nonstate actor attempting to achieve a political end and exert a psychological influence on a broad population. Among other details, the data set includes the types of weapons used, the intended targets, the number of fatalities, and the ideology of the perpetrators.

We found that left-wing terrorism has increased since President Donald Trump's rise to political prominence in 2016. Indeed, 2025 marks the first time in more than 30 years that left-wing attacks outnumber those from the far right. Despite its recent increase, however, left-wing terrorism is not nearly as common today as it was in the 1960s and early '70s. Those years marked the height of groups such as the Weather Underground and the Symbionese Liberation Army, best known for kidnapping the newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. In the '80s and early '90s, left-wing terrorism declined while jihadist and right-wing terrorism rose, particularly in the forms of anti-government and white-supremacist violence.

Following that trend, according to our analysis, violence on the left accounted for four plots and attacks from 1994 to 2000, compared with 144 on the right. That difference narrowed in the following decade, but the right continued to account for significantly more attacks and killings than did the left.

Read: Strawberries in winter

The year 2016 was a turning point for left-wing terrorism, even as right-wing incidents remained much more common. Trump's political ascent and the expansion of the MAGA movement seem to have reenergized left-wing violent extremism, which accounted for 37 incidents from 2016 to 2024, most of them motivated by either anti-government or partisan sentiment. By July 4 of this year, far-left extremists had already been responsible for five terrorist attacks and plots, putting 2025 on pace to be the left's most violent year in more than three decades.

On July 4, for example, law-enforcement officials say that an assailant shot and wounded a police officer who was responding to reports of a disturbance at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Texas; meanwhile, another alleged assailant fired at ICE correctional officers. Authorities apprehended 14 suspects, who now face federal charges including attempted murder of federal officers and firearm-related offenses. Details about Kirk's alleged killer are still emerging, but preliminary evidence indicates that he had left-wing motivations, and could add to this year's tally. 

In many cases, categorizing the ideology of a perpetrator is difficult, if not impossible. Some extremists pick from a “salad bar of ideologies,” as the former FBI Director Christopher Wray once said, many of which don't fit the traditional right-left dichotomy. In other instances, such as the 2011 shooting of Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords, a perpetrator's beliefs are so muddled that even calling them “political” exaggerates their coherence—despite the fact that the target is a political figure.

A major shift in politics, however, can cause the losing side to become more combative. Just as Trump's election led to a rise in left-wing violence, President Barack Obama's election corresponded with a surge of violence from the right. From 2009 to 2016, right-wing extremists were responsible for 106 terrorist attacks and plots, nearly double the 58 right-wing incidents that occurred in the eight years prior. These tend to be more lethal than left-wing attacks, which generally target specific individuals, such as the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last year or the assassination attempt on Trump at his West Palm Beach golf course. Right-wing extremists, by contrast, are more likely to target whole groups. In the past decade in the United States, 36 left-wing attacks have killed 13 people, whereas 152 right-wing attacks have killed 112.

The Biden administration took important steps to counter the rise of far-right extremism. After January 6, 2021, the U.S. government brought charges against more than 1,000 people, disrupting violent right-wing networks such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. The administration also made right-wing groups a counterterrorism priority, taking measures to reduce the presence of extremists in the military. The far-right-terrorist death toll fell under Biden, compared with the previous four years, but lethal attacks persisted.

This year, however, violence on the right has plummeted. Only one right-wing-terrorist incident occurred in the first six months of 2025: the June assassination of the Minnesota state legislator Melissa Hortman and her husband. This extraordinary drop-off is too recent to allow for any definitive explanations—and the number of terror incidents often fluctuates over short periods—but Trump's reelection could be a key factor. His victory deflated election conspiracies that had once motivated many extremists. Since then, Trump has taken a maximal approach on some of the far-right's highest-priority issues, particularly immigration. Enrique Tarrio, the former Proud Boys leader and a convicted seditionist whom Trump pardoned, recently summed up the president's potential psychological effect on the violent far right: “We won. We've got what we wanted.”

Under Trump, right-wing extremists may feel less need to mobilize, because they sense that their interests are already being taken care of. But Kirk's death could change this calculus. Conservatives, including members of Congress and online influencers, have used the assassination to support the contention that the left is engaged in “war.” Trump himself has claimed that a network of political organizations fund and support violence, and must be neutralized. This sort of rhetoric could encourage right-wing vigilantism or presage a government crackdown on left-leaning organizations—which in turn could inflame left-wing extremism and pose a grave threat to free speech.

Jonathan Chait: Stephen Miller's hypocrisy is right there in his speech

Exaggerated rhetoric across party lines helps explain why both Republicans and Democrats believe that more than 40 percent of the other side supports murder if it serves their political interests. In reality, less than 4 percent of Americans support partisan violence such as assault or arson, let alone murder. Even that number is too high, of course, but it would surely drop if partisans stopped misconstruing their opponents.

Actually stanching political violence will require America's leaders to commit to fighting all forms of extremism, not just those associated with their opponents. The Trump administration has prioritized combatting the rise of left-wing terrorism but not right-wing terrorism, which remains a concern despite its decline this year. Developing the programs and expertise to suppress different forms of terrorism takes years, and ignoring a long-term threat to go after a more immediate one could be deadly over time.

Condemning all political violence, especially when it emanates from one's own side or targets one's opponents, is also an important means of breaking the cycle of distrust. Many prominent Democrats have done this since Kirk's shooting. So did many Republicans after the assassination of Hortman and the attack on Paul Pelosi in 2022. Still, both sides need to improve, as evidenced by some left-wing celebrations of Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of Thompson, the health-care executive, and the failure of some conservative leaders to expressly condemn white supremacists, Hortman's assassin, and other violent extremists.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox has served as a model in unequivocally denouncing extremists, which makes them outcasts instead of heroes. Cox described Kirk's killing as “an attack on all of us.” And he offered a simple exhortation that would benefit both sides, particularly in moments like these, when violence can spiral: “Disagree better.”

In the White House adviser's view, violent rhetoric is allowed only when he and Trump are the ones spewing it.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Yesterday, Stephen Miller delivered a eulogy for Charlie Kirk that served as a battle cry for the Trump administration's state-sponsored war on his perceived foes—a war for which Miller is the primary strategist. The speech was a jarring piece of rhetoric. It is a perfect encapsulation of the ethos of Trumpism, boiling away the president's idiosyncratic habits of mixing insult comedy and weird digressions into his rhetoric and leaving, in Miller's tongue, the residue of pure ideology and will to power.

Miller's theme was that President Donald Trump's side embodies pure good, his opponents pure evil, and the former is destined to utterly destroy the latter. Republicans have never stopped complaining that Hillary Clinton once described a portion of Trump's base as “a basket of deplorables.” Yet over the weekend the president's most powerful adviser depicted half the country as worthless, irredeemably wicked, and fated for destruction.

“We are the storm. And our enemies cannot comprehend our strength, our determination, our resolve, our passion,” he thundered. “Our lineage and our legacy hails back to Athens, to Rome, to Philadelphia, to Monticello. Our ancestors built the cities. They produced the art and architecture. They built the industry.”

I feel less confident than Miller does that future historians will laud Trump's distinct additions of legalized bribery, casino-style decor, and Ultimate Fighting Championship matches on the White House lawn as cultural and philosophical advances. Yet Miller confidently conscripted the pillars of Western civilization into his domestic political war.

Miller's peroration managed the difficult combination of being redundant and short. In place of uplift, he brought bludgeoning repetition. “The light will defeat the dark. We will prevail over the forces of wickedness and evil,” he said at one point. “We will defeat the forces of darkness and evil. And we will stand every day for what is true, what is beautiful, what is good.” he proclaimed shortly thereafter.

Miller directed much of his speech to the enemy camp. “And to those trying to incite violence against us, those trying to foment hatred against us,” he said, “what do you have? You have nothing. You are nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy. You are envy. You are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing. You can produce nothing. You can create nothing.” In case any member of the audience had dozed off, which seems unlikely given the volume at which he spoke, Miller reiterated the point a few sentences later: “And what will you leave behind? Nothing. Nothing. To our enemies, you have nothing to give. You have nothing to offer. You have nothing to share but bitterness.”

Having nothing to share but bitterness is a strange insult for Stephen Miller, of all people, to hurl. But part of the Miller worldview is an almost proud insistence on holding his enemies to standards he refuses to abide by. The Trump camp has insisted that the fault for last year's attempts on Trump's life lies with anybody who has attacked him as dangerous or authoritarian. Yet Trump himself attacks his enemies in such terms routinely, and Miller seems to be attempting to exceed his boss's Manichaean style by depicting their opponents as the literal embodiment of malevolence.

In some ways, Miller's speech was the distilled antithesis of Barack Obama's rhetorical style. Obama gained fame with a stirring 2004 speech arguing that America's cultural divisions were surmountable—that red America and blue America had more in common than the pundits appreciated. Miller's view, like that of his boss, is that America is even more divided than we think, and the only resolution to this state of affairs is for one side to subjugate the other.

Ten years ago, a white supremacist gunned down nine worshippers at one of the oldest Black churches in the South, including Clementa Pinckney, a pastor and member of the South Carolina state Senate. The horrific event provides a striking contrast to the aftermath of Kirk's murder. In his eulogy, Obama did not scour the internet for conservatives making insensitive comments about the event—even though many such cases could be found, including on Fox News—let alone use the tragedy as a pretext to delegitimize the opposition.

Obama described the murderer in the singular and spoke of reconciliation. “The alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court—in the midst of unspeakable grief, with words of forgiveness,” Obama said. “He couldn't imagine that.” Miller's speech used the third person plural to describe Kirk's assassination: “They cannot imagine what they have awakened. They cannot conceive of the army that they have arisen in all of us because we stand for what is good, what is virtuous, what is noble.”

Miller made no effort to distinguish the vaguely defined multitudes that he implicates in Kirk's murder from Trump's political opponents or the Democratic Party—which, at other times, he has said is “not a political party. It is a domestic extremist organization.”

Miller taunted his opponents, “You have no idea the dragon you have awakened.” To the contrary, his targets seem very aware of the administration's instinct to take revenge. But given Miller's past statements, I question the premise that Kirk's murder “awakened” Miller's desire to crush the right's enemies. It seems to have merely provided a convenient pretext.

Apps are promising to ease the job of child-rearing—but they're missing something crucial.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A few weeks before my daughter's fourth birthday, I stumbled across an AI party planner called CelebrateAlly. “Looking to plan a themed party, a surprise bash, or just a relaxed get-together?” read a banner on its website, which promised that the app would take care of “all the details—themes, activities, and decorations.” It also offered to write birthday cards, “capturing your heartfelt sentiments beautifully!”

The offer had a certain appeal. I was overwhelmed, entering the phase of planning where I actually had to execute on my daughter's vision for her bash. We'd been talking about the party for months, and her requests were specific yet constantly changing. (She wanted a unicorn cake—no, a unicorn piñata; to invite only her cousins—then a few of her friends too, and then all of the kids on our block.) But I was genuinely curious to hear them. Each question I asked her was a way to draw closer to her: I learned about who she is right now while, I hope, showing her that I really want to know. After all those conversations, using AI would have felt like a betrayal.

So I didn't—but I've found it impossible to avoid the ads for AI tools cluttering my social-media feeds. A few months ago, Welch's Fruit Snacks launched a “Lunchbox Notes Translator” on their website, which promised to transform “candid parental sentiments into heartfelt messages”—for example, turning “You make me tired” into “I love how independent you can be!” The forthcoming app Trove offers “AI-guided storytelling”; another app, Kidli, says that it will use AI to “help you raise happy, healthy, and smart kids” (though exactly how is unclear). Then there's Snorble, a $300 AI robot designed to help kids sleep better. In its promotional video, when a child wakes in the night with a bad dream, Snorble smiles and says, “It's okay, I'm here with you,” presumably soothing the child back to sleep, no human interaction necessary. Milo, an AI tool that claims to help with the organizational tasks of running a family, summed up the mindset espoused by many of these apps: “Don't ask Mom, ask Milo.”

Some of these tools are yet to be fully funded or launched. The Lunchbox Notes Translator, which was much maligned on social media, is now on a “snack break.” But others are already quite popular. Last year the parenting influencer Becky Kennedy (a.k.a. “Dr. Becky”) released an app that, among other things, lets parents bring dilemmas to an AI chatbot named GiGi. It now has more than 90,000 paying members, one spokesperson told me, and may be a sign of AI's coming influence on child-rearing.

For parents, 41 percent of whom are often “so stressed they cannot function,” according to an advisory issued last year by then–Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, any offer of help may be alluring. With these apps promising to enable people to parent better—responding to messages from school, laying out perfectly Tetris-ed play-date calendars, preparing carefully calibrated scripts to respond whenever a child has a tantrum—it's perhaps no wonder some are taking off.

Yet when parents outsource the work of raising their kids to a bot, both adults and children are bound to miss out. In my case, with CelebrateAlly, the app might have made for a more picture-perfect bash—but the party wasn't the point. What my daughter needed from me, and what the time we spent planning together gave her that an AI never could, was my attention and care. Apps may promise to optimize parenting, but ultimately, they threaten to sap its intimacy and humanness.

Take the apps that create scripts for difficult conversations with kids. The AI might seem omniscient, but parents know much more about their children than any large language model ever could. “I know that if I give my kid a hug, in this way or at this moment, they're going to lean into me and be all cuddly,” Rebecca Winthrop, a senior fellow and the director of the Center for Universal Education at the Brookings Institution, told me. Winthrop called information like that “tacit knowledge”—the small, intangible things about a child that only another human can pick up on. Decisions based on this type of knowledge—not those made by a chatbot—are what help make a child feel truly cared for.

As I read about the Lunchbox Note Translator, for instance, it occurred to me that when I pack my 7-year-old son's lunch, the love letter I include is a Starburst. I take extra care to make sure that I put in his favorite color (red) on big days. That chewy little square is just one way I show him that I know him as only I can.

My gesture may seem small—but, contrary to what some AI tools may seem to imply, in most cases, small is plenty. And that points to another problem with AI's promises of optimized parenting: Rather than dismantling families' to-do lists, the apps tend to encourage a do-it-all model of parenthood (and of childhood) that constantly demands more from parents. Milo, for example, promises to help filter through “school apps, sports schedules, and endless group texts” to make a to-do list. But after the app arranges the list, parents are still responsible for completing it. If my family's daily activities ever balloon to the point of needing digital project management, I'd rather reevaluate our priorities than ask AI to help us juggle more. Instead of downloading yet another app, other parents, too, might be better served by trusting their own instincts and doing less for their kids: scaling down the birthday party, skipping the lunch-box note entirely, saying no to the third (or fourth, or fifth) after-school activity.

Of course, many parents still want and need help. And AI may be useful for some household tasks. But parents risk isolating themselves if they turn to AI too frequently, rather than to friends and family. Kennedy told me that the idea for her app's bot came out of conversations with followers who desperately wished they could text her during their tougher parenting moments. She said that she would never want to replace mom-to-mom interactions. But I struggle to imagine that paying for Kennedy's app wouldn't stop some moms from texting their friends: Why risk exposure and vulnerability with a fellow parent when they can ask an AI bot that has been carefully trained to speak only words of encouragement?

Read: AI will never be your kid's friend

If they hold off on reaching out to friends and family when the going gets hard, though, parents may lose out on more than just in-the-moment guidance. Asking for help “is often the way we build community,” Winthrop told me. The friends a parent calls when they run into a tricky situation may become part of their bigger support system—a network that parents need. As Winthrop put it: “A chatbot's not going to feed your cat or take your kid to school when you have a work call.”

A chatbot is also not going to show up to your child's birthday. As is often the case with celebrations for little kids, the guest list for my daughter's party included as many grown-ups as children. There was the school mom who knows how passionate my daughter is about Frozen and suggested hiring the same Elsa actor who had been a hit at her own daughter's party. There was the mom next door who knew just where I could order the rainbow-shaped cake my daughter wished for. We didn't have balloon arches, the cake came out a bit funky, and the Elsa experience was unbelievably awkward for the adults (though the preschoolers loved it). Still, I am so glad we all planned it—me, my daughter, and our community—slowly, imperfectly together.

From the back of a cargo plane dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza, I could envision a better future.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

We were stuck in a holding pattern, circling in Jordanian airspace near the border with Israel while awaiting the order to proceed. Our five-plane aerial convoy was part of a Jordan- and United Arab Emirates–led effort to air-drop food into the Gaza Strip, to mitigate the disastrous humanitarian conditions that its population is facing almost two years into the war. Once we received permission, we flew over Israel and out to the Mediterranean Sea. And then, as we descended to 2,000 feet, I was able to see my home for the first time in 20 years.

In some desolated areas, there was nothing left standing. But I was also able to spot some pockets of life that had not yet been entirely destroyed. Tents covered long stretches of the dusty landscape. And from above, I could see Israel Defense Forces convoys and camps, maneuvering tanks, and the flash of ongoing strikes. The back of the plane opened, and I watched the pallets of aid slide out and deploy their parachutes.

The airdrop was a stop-gap solution; it could not possibly deliver aid at the necessary scale. But it was also a pragmatic way to surge food to Gaza's civilian population. Delivering food by truck is a time-consuming process requiring coordination with the Israeli authorities and cooperation with local NGOs to distribute the aid within the Strip. By early summer, as Israeli restrictions effectively halted such deliveries, the situation within Gaza grew desperate. Even after deliveries resumed, much of the population remained dangerously malnourished.

Airdrops allow civilians immediate and direct access to food, bypassing the complicated and dangerous process of delivery and distribution on the ground. The method isn't without its challenges. Dropping heavy packages runs the risk of injuring people on the ground. On a per-pound basis, it's a much more expensive way to deliver the food. But at the moment, no perfect mechanism exists for delivering aid in Gaza. And as the Israeli military's ground invasion of Gaza City in the north promises to compound the suffering of the Strip's civilians, every bit of aid helps.

Claire Porter Robbins: ‘We're trying to do the best we can before we die'

I spent my time at the King Abdullah air-force base in Jordan, where the flights originated, talking with crews and volunteers about why they backed the aid drops. Many cited the difficulty of getting aid into the Strip; the drops gave them a chance to help. Indonesia sent two C-130 aircraft to participate in the airdrops. The country lacks diplomatic relations with Israel, but the airdrops gave it a mechanism to help Palestinian civilians. And beyond the immediate assistance they provided, the airdrops demonstrated something else, too: Gaza's airspace can be reopened, in a way that addresses Israel's security concerns.

Seeing Gaza in ruins has redoubled my determination to do two things. The first is to expose Hamas's criminality and the futility of its terror, which has led to the annihilation of Gaza. And the second is to secure a better future for the people of Gaza, by pushing for pragmatic solutions.

The insistence on comprehensive solutions has held back progress. We cannot wait until the fighting stops, the hostages are released, and Hamas retreats before starting to make necessary changes. Instead of arguing about a day-after plan, discussions should focus on today. I've been pushing for greater international cooperation, the involvement of regional actors in stabilization, and community-centric governance—under the auspices of what I've called the Gaza Transitional Service.

But any transitional plan should focus on restoring access to the Strip, with an independent mechanism for entry and exit, and freedom of movement within it, in a manner that addresses Israeli security needs. The most creative solutions are also, given the current constraints, perhaps the most pragmatic. An artificial peninsula could be constructed on the coast of the Gaza Strip, built in phases from the rubble that the war has produced. Even a small peninsula could host a basic airfield and seaport to facilitate the movement of people and aid, severing Gaza's unhealthy dependency on Israel and Egypt. And over time, it could be enlarged to accommodate expanded facilities. Multilateral parties trusted by Israel, the Palestinians, and the United States could provide technical, security, and logistical support and services to ensure compliance with necessary codes and standards.

Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib: Hamas wants Gaza to starve

The same pragmatism on display in the flights over Gaza provides the best chance for overcoming entrenched divisions and narratives. The immediacy of the horror unfolding in Gaza City, and the cataclysmic conditions facing civilians there, should not foreclose the possibility of thinking about a better future. Gaza's population, which has suffered immensely, is in desperate need of security, prosperity, stability, and a fundamentally different path forward.

The president has given autism the MAHA treatment.

At a press conference today, President Donald Trump dispensed one clear piece of medical advice to American parents in a rambling, repetitive monologue: Don't. Take. Tylenol. He told pregnant women that they could help keep their children safe from autism by not taking the drug whenever they could avoid it (“fight like hell,” he instructed). He advised parents not to give Tylenol to their young children. He denounced giving the hepatitis B vaccine to infants and suggested that parents space out their children's immunization schedule. (“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies, it's a disgrace,” he said.) He declared that children ideally should be given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines separately, though such individual shots are not available in the United States. “This is based on what I feel,” the president said.

Trump had been hinting at his big announcement for weeks, and it was evident that he wasn't interested in making sure the contents had passed through the normal research process. “I don't want to wait any longer. We don't need anything more. And if it's wrong—it's not going to be wrong, but—if it is wrong, it's fine. We have to do it,” Trump told the audience at a dinner for the American Cornerstone Institute on Saturday. Today, instead of opting for measured guidance, or urging additional research, Trump borrowed a strategy from his health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.: pushing ahead with a sensational conclusion based on a handful of disputed studies.

Researchers have been studying possible causes of autism for decades, and they generally dismiss singling out one culprit like a drug or a vaccine ingredient. (Instead, the consensus is that genetics play a large role, along with an array of environmental factors.) Some studies have found a possible association between acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders. In 2015, the FDA issued a notice about a possible link between prenatal Tylenol use and ADHD, though it also mentioned that the cited studies had design flaws. Last month, Andrea Baccarelli, the dean of Harvard's school of public health, published a review of other studies in which he and his co-authors concluded that acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, and that pregnant women should be advised to limit their use of the drug. (Baccarelli was invited to appear at today's announcement but did not attend, a Harvard spokesperson told me. In a statement sent to reporters shortly before the White House announcement, he wrote that his August review suggests the “possibility of a causal relationship” between Tylenol and autism, but also noted that acetaminophen is “an important tool for pregnant patients and their physicians.”)

Read: RFK Jr. is neglecting a legitimate autism concern

Two recent large studies, meanwhile, challenge any connection at all. A Swedish study, published last year, analyzed the health records of more than 2 million children and found that acetaminophen use was not associated with autism. A study of more than 200,000 Japanese children, published earlier this month, likewise didn't find any meaningful association. That paper suggested that links in other studies could be explained, at least in part, by “misclassification and other biases.” A spokesperson for Kenvue, the company that makes Tylenol, told me in an email, “We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism. We strongly disagree with any suggestion otherwise and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents.”

None of that nuance was aired during the announcement. Instead Trump professed to feel “very certain” about the Tylenol theory, and repeatedly warned Americans off the drug. This is not how science—or public health—normally works. The president of the United States doesn't tease that he's figured out the cause of a disorder before the research has been done to support that conclusion. Nor does he warn the American people against a common medication or the childhood-vaccine schedule without detailed evidence of his reasoning, or the full support of his staff. “It may be stronger from me than from the group,” he said in his speech, referring to Kennedy, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya, and Mehmet Oz, his head of Medicare and Medicaid. “They are waiting for certain studies. I don't—I just want to say it like it is.” (Trump's spokesperson, Kush Desai, wrote in an email that “the Trump Administration does not believe popping more pills is always the answer for better health” and that “there is mounting evidence finding a connection between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism.” The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment.)

Trump also went further than his deputies in calling out even fringier theories of autism. Of all the speakers at the White House today, Trump was the most explicit in blaming vaccines for poor health outcomes—a notion that has been repeatedly debunked—and he did so at length, at one point going on an extended tangent about a worker at Trump Tower whose son was supposedly “fried” by a fever following a childhood immunization. As I reported earlier this month, Kennedy has been in regular contact with a former Duke University researcher, William Parker, who believes that Tylenol given to young children is mostly responsible for autism. (Parker's theory is such an outlier that none of the autism researchers I spoke with had heard of it, or him.) Today, Kennedy, Bhattacharya, Makary, and Oz didn't bring up Parker's theory, though Trump seemed to endorse it. “Don't have your baby take Tylenol,” Trump said.

Read: RFK Jr.'s calls with a scientist who says kids get autism from Tylenol

Ever since Trump announced that his administration would find the cause of autism within months, researchers have feared that the team would jump to unsupported conclusions. But Trump hardly seems to care if he's wrong. Besides, he repeatedly insisted, eschewing Tylenol during pregnancy has “no downside.” (Tylenol is considered the safest fever reducer available for pregnant women.)

During today's announcement, Kennedy at least acknowledged the trade-offs inherent in scaring pregnant Americans off Tylenol, and allowed that, sometimes, using it is unavoidable. “The FDA also recognizes that acetaminophen is often the only tool for fevers and pain in pregnancy, as other alternatives have well-documented adverse effects,” Kennedy noted in his remarks. “HHS wants therefore to encourage clinicians to exercise their best judgment in the use of acetaminophen for fevers and pain in pregnancy by prescribing the lowest effective dose and shortest necessary duration, and only when treatment is required.” (Today, the FDA posted an even more measured notice to physicians, signed by Makary, that underscored a possible association between acetaminophen and autism is “an ongoing area of scientific debate.”) Trump, meanwhile, repeatedly instructed pregnant women to “tough it out.” Sowing doubts regarding vaccines, going all in on fringe theories, and opting for extreme positions instead of embracing nuance: At MAHA's big reveal, Trump seemed determined to steal Kennedy's spotlight.

A former U.S. ambassador to Russia says powerful Russians were too eager to go along with Vladimir Putin.

Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts

The similarities between what is happening today and what I witnessed in Vladimir Putin's Russia are frightening: the creation of an oligarchy, the proclamation of a one-party system, and, perhaps most troubling, a promised crackdown on free speech. We are seeing Donald Trump and those around him pick targets to go after, and make them obey the administration's wishes.

My guest today, Michael McFaul, witnessed such moves when he was the U.S. ambassador to Russia from 2012 to 2014, and he has a warning for Americans today.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

[Music]

Garry Kasparov: When people ask me what I make of Donald Trump and the state of American democracy, I tell them that alarm bells are ringing everywhere. The similarities between what is happening today in America and what I witnessed in Vladimir Putin's Russia are frightening.

We are seeing the creation of an oligarchy, where those in power and those with money slowly merge. We are seeing the proclamation of a one-party system. And, perhaps most troubling, we are seeing Donald Trump and those around him pick targets to go after, and make them obey the administration's wishes.

To anyone who has witnessed an autocrat come to power, this is chilling. And it's why we're bringing you a special episode.

[Music]

Kasparov: From The Atlantic, this is Autocracy in America. I'm Garry Kasparov.

My guest today is Michael McFaul, the U.S. ambassador to Russia in the years following Putin's return to the presidency. He saw an autocracy take hold before his eyes, and he has a warning for those in America who seem ready to capitulate to the Trump administration.

[Music]

Kasparov: Mike, I want to thank you for joining the show. For those who are not familiar with you, I believe you are one of the best American experts about Russia. You have long studied Russia as a country and a place, and you speak Russian fluently. But we should have this conversation in English, okay?

Michael McFaul: (Laughs.) Yes, of course. Well, thanks for having me, Garry. It's a real honor to be on with you. And you've studied Russia for a long time, and you're actually fluent in Russian, too, so I hope this will be a conversation, because you know as much about this topic as I do. So great to be with you, though.

Kasparov: Okay. Very good. One of the earlier guests on this show was Jake Sullivan, and I asked him about American foreign policy toward Russia, just to cover the 25 years since the appearance of Vladimir Putin as the top man in Russia, or you can go even back to 1991. Something did go wrong. Very quickly, can you summarize it before we start talking about your own experience there?

McFaul: So when the Soviet Union collapsed—and that was a euphoric moment for me personally— there was a bet by the West, and most certainly by the United States, that if we could facilitate the consolidation of democracy and capitalism in Russia, that would be good for security in Europe and be good for the United States. And I was a part of that. I moved to Moscow. I've lived there before, during the Soviet period, but I moved in the summer of 1992 to open the offices of an organization called the National Democratic Institute. And our commitment was to facilitate ideas about democracy, institutions about democracy.

And that was a bet that I think Democrats and Republicans made together. I think it was the right bet, by the way, with one big mistake. We should have had a hedge to that bet. We should have had a hedge to the rest of Europe, and we should have brought in the rest of Europe that wanted to join NATO faster. And to those that did not, were not qualified to join, we should have armed them in case that project failed. Because, as we all know, that project did fail.

Kasparov: Okay. So you have been actively engaged in formulating Russian policy and advising, but at one point you became the center man of United States policy to Russia as an ambassador in Moscow. So you arrived in Russia in 2012 as the architect of the [Barack] Obama–administration effort to engage with Russia, the so-called reset policy. By the way, is it fair to call you the architect of it?

McFaul: I don't know. That's an overstatement, I would say, but I was most certainly was part of that process for sure. Because I was working at the White House at the time.

Kasparov: So now to tell us about your experience in Russia.

McFaul: Well, let me start a few years earlier, with the origins of the Obama administration and our approach toward Russia. So we had this approach that I took right out of George Shultz's memoirs—George Shultz was the former secretary of state in the [Ronald] Reagan era, and I think it's chapter 27 where he talks about reengaging the Soviets. And this is years before [Mikhail] Gorbachev came along—and his strategy was a very clear one, which is that on some issues we have to deal with Moscow.

Back then, the early years of Reagan, they had no contact with Moscow at all. That was the Evil Empire. And Shultz said, No, we've got talk to them about, like, arms control and nuclear stuff. But we're gonna do that without 1) checking our values at the door and without 2) throwing other countries under the bus. And I'm paraphrasing, of course; he didn't write in such blunt terms. But that was his strategy. And I thought that should be our strategy.

So with the government, we had some things we wanted to get done that only engaging with the government we could do. The biggest one was the new START [Strategic Arms Reduction] treaty. The old one was expiring in 2009. We thought it was in America's national interest to do a new one. And we did. And we reduced by 30 percent the number of nuclear weapons in the world. But I wanna be clear; it wasn't holding hands and singing “Kumbaya” with [Dmitry] Medvedev or Putin. And these were really concrete things, but we had this other strategy that was very controversial in our own government.

Garry, just so you know, and you actually sparked—I don't know if you know this, I'm gonna tell you now—you actually sparked this debate. Because we had this idea of dual-track diplomacy: that we're gonna engage with the government, but we're also gonna engage with civil society, business students, and even the political opposition. And so my first trip to Moscow working at the National Security Council, we were doing the invite list for a reception at Spaso House. And I put your name on the list, and there was pushback. There was like, Oh my goodness; we're in this moment of engagement with the Russians. We can't invite Garry Kasparov. The people in the Kremlin will be upset about it. But I prevailed, and I just tell that vignette because I want to be clear that that was the strategy. The president agreed with that strategy. So when we came in July for his first visit to Moscow as a president, he had his meetings with Medvedev. Then we, the next day, we went out and spent four hours with the prime minister, Putin. And then the rest of the day, he spoke to students at the New Economic School. He went to business summits. He then attended a civil-society summit, which Medvedev chose not to do, and he ended his day in a roundtable with Russian opposition leaders. Garry, you were there too. I have that photo on my desk.

It's important to understand that, because when things were more cooperative, that dual-track diplomacy—it wasn't big news. It wasn't, Oh my goodness, Obama's fomenting regime change in Russia. But by the time I got to Moscow in 2012, as you know well, there was a massive mobilization against falsified elections in December of 2011, a parliamentary election. And it was just falsified, kind of like a normal Russian—it was nothing, nothing exceptional or extraordinary about the level of falsification to us. But that's not the way Russians, including you and people like you, perceived it.

And with technology, there were these massive mobilizations against the regime. First for free and fair elections, and then for a Russia without Putin: that became one of the slogans. And when that happened, the Kremlin blamed us. In fact Medvedev, even before I got to Moscow, called President Obama, and he said, What are you guys doing? You're funding NGOs that are seeking our overthrow. Your secretary of state sent a signal—this is what he said—to protest against our regime. And he was obviously just mimicking the words handed to him by Putin, but that the mood had changed radically.

So by the time I got there, I was perceived as, and portrayed as, somebody sent to Moscow to foment revolution against Putin. And I wanna be crystal clear. That was not my assignment. If it was, we would've messed it up anyway, right? We're not very good at that. But there's no doubt that, whether they believed it or not, Putin adopted an extremely hostile position toward me.

And he expressed that, by the way, to me from time to time personally. He said, We know what you're doing here, and we're gonna stop you. I'm paraphrasing, but he said that to me a couple of times. So, for the rest of my time in Moscow, I mean, I had, ironically or paradoxically, I did have relations with other parts of the government, but not with Vladimir Putin.

Kasparov: I can confirm that American participation in the protest of 2011, 2012 was minimal. I can even add that those groups—those NGOs mentioned by Medvedev that were funded by Americans—they were the least radical. As a matter of fact, the real push to become more aggressive and just to go to the streets and to protest these fake elections came from people like myself that were not on the funding list.

McFaul: Exactly.

Kasparov: It's quite a paradox. But you describe what I saw—and I, by the way, believe at that time it was a mistake—a lot of American goodwill. So you tried. But Vladimir Putin's agenda, to my knowledge, was already quite clear. I mean, he was quite consistent in expanding Russian imperial influence. So what did go wrong? I mean, at what point do you—and again, I say you [meaning] Americans—recognize that this policy was a failure?

McFaul: Well, let me tell you about me personally, and then the Obama administration and later the Biden administration. We'll get to it. So for me personally, I never had any illusions about Putin and his agenda. There was no doubt when he became interim president and then president that he had an antidemocratic agenda, to me. And I—people can go look it up, so you don't think I'm just making this up post facto—I wrote my first anti-Putin piece in The Washington Post in March of 2000, even before he was inaugurated as president, saying it's very clear he does not believe in democracy. That was clear to me. For me, the day that Putin announced that he was running for president again—September 23 or 24, 2011—that was the day that the reset ended for me.

And I actually briefed the president after that a few days later. And I just said, we're not gonna be able to work with this guy at all. And [Obama] said—he kind of agreed with me analytically, and then he was like, Well, but we don't have a choice. We don't get to choose who we have to interact with. But for me—and that, I want to emphasize, that was before the massive protest, right? And I'd already been nominated to be the U.S. ambassador. And I even thought about whether I should withdraw because I just—for me, that was it, that was the end. But not everybody agreed with me. If you're working on arms control, you don't care about protests, and you don't want to get in the way of talking about these other things. But that was, that was it for me.

I think for the rest of them, I think it took until Putin invaded the first time in 2014 and seized Crimea, when at least the Obama administration thought all bets were off. But then we would get to the Biden folks. They came in, and their first big idea about Russia was We want a—I'm paraphrasing, but pretty closely—a stable and predictable relationship with Russia. And, you know, they tried to achieve that. And they even had a summit in Geneva to try to stabilize Russia, if you will, so that they could focus on China. So even they kind of relitigated where the end of the Obama administration was.

Kasparov: Now, as of today, there are some who argue that there is still room to engage with Russia. In fact, one of the guests on this podcast earlier this season, George Friedman, made that very case. What do you think?

McFaul: Just, I'm hard—I'm hard pressed to think what that might be. I mean, maybe some extension of the START treaty that's gonna expire next year? That could be one area.

Kasparov: But can you trust Putin?

McFaul: Well, my general strategy and thinking is no. And we have to go back to a modern, modernized version of containment, including economic containment, just like we had this thing called CoCom [the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] during the Cold War. We need that in place as a way to contain the pernicious elements of interaction with Russian elites, including Russian companies today.

Kasparov: We'll be right back.

[Break]

Kasparov: So you were in Moscow in the period when Putin was reelected and consolidated his power and rule.

McFaul: Yes.

Kasparov: So last week you wrote that many Russian oligarchs didn't resist Putin's early autocratic moves because he offered them some kind of deals; he cut their taxes. And then years later they regretted their passivity when they had the power to resist. Can you be just more specific? Describe more about that.

McFaul: Yeah. So when Putin first came in—and he was an accidental president, you know, he wasn't, he didn't have some great movement behind him, picked by some of these oligarchs as a way to stop another guy, [Yevgeny] Primakov, from becoming president. There's a mythology, including here in the United States, that there was this groundswell of support for Putin's style of illiberal nationalism. And that's just—it's just not true. I mean, that's just not true. He was picked by [Boris] Yeltsin.

Right away, he did two things simultaneously. On the economic side, he brought in those, you know, in Russia they would be called liberal reformers. Here in the United States they would be called conservatives. And in particular, he cut individual income tax to a flat tax at 13 percent. He then cut corporate taxes, and for the business community and the oligarchs, they welcomed that.

At the same time, he went after media very aggressively. And that was the first thing he went after. He wanted to control the media, and he took over the two state-controlled channels pretty easily. And one of the oligarchs had to flee and later died mysteriously in London, who controlled that. Boris Berezovsky.

But the real drama, as you'll remember, was about NTV, an independent station owned by another oligarch. [Vladimir] Gusinsky was his name. And they did a couple of things. First of all—and this is the echoes of the moment we're in, in the United States—eventually one of the state-owned enterprises loyal to Putin, Gazprom, and its branch called Gazprom Media, took over NTV. And it was all, Oh, it was just a business interest. Right? You know, that's what we hear today. It's just a business interest, just, you know, no big deal. And then two years later one of the most famous satirical shows, called Kukly [“Puppets”], was taken off the air. And that's the echo of the moment we're in now.

Then—and these are not, I wanna be careful. History rhymes, but it's not exactly the same. And I don't want to stretch the metaphor. And there's some good things about America that we have, that Russia did not have then, that you've written, talked about recently.

But there was this other pivotal moment. It was this horrible tragedy, as you remember: this terrorist attack on a school in Beslan, Russia. And it was just horrific, the whole thing. And that moment of tragedy was used as an excuse by Putin to cancel gubernatorial elections, to cancel elections for the equivalent of American states.

And there—one more moment that was in this troika that was really important. It happened in 2003, when somebody you know well, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, at the time the most successful and richest businessman in Russia. And he wasn't just the richest businessman in Russia, by the way. He was also an entrepreneur. He was not an oligarch, owning a state-owned enterprise. That gets garbled in American media sometimes. But he also began to see the trend lines with Putin. And he tried to do some things about it. And he got arrested, and he spent another decade in jail.

Kasparov: And his company has been first nationalized and then taken by one of Putin's closest henchman.

McFaul: Right. Igor Sechin. And you put those three things together. That's when this notion that He's gonna cut our taxes, and everything's gonna be okay, that's when those people—and I don't wanna overemphasize how well I knew them, but I knew some of these people, and I knew them when I worked in the government. I think had they—they now lament A) that they thought that Putin was going to be safe for their own economic interests. It turns out that he wasn't. And B), maybe, had we tried a little harder to stop him in those early years, we might've had more success. But by the time they tried to stop him it was too late.

But then you already echoed that when he came back, there was a period of a little bit of freedom. I don't wanna overstate it. Russia was still an autocracy, but it was a softer autocracy than it is today. It was in that Medvedev era. And that's when you had, you know, organizations like TV Dozhd, TV Rain, I think was founded around that time. That's when [Alexei] Navalny's anti-corruption organization was founded.

And it was a more free time. You were part of it, Garry. You were living it, and you can tell people better than I can. But after Putin came back a second time, he gradually and then dramatically began to shut it all down. With, you know, arresting people that were protesting—most famously May 6, 2012, calling NGOs “foreign agents” and using that as a blunt tool to shut down their funding. And then, you know, it gets even much worse after he launches his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Kasparov: Mike, but to be fair, the attack on the Republic of Georgia in 2008 technically happened under Medvedev. So that's why I believe Putin never lost control. And so he was the power behind the throne.

McFaul: Absolutely. You're right about that.

Kasparov: All these tragic episodes of modern Russian history: They bring us to the recent news of the attacks on free speech coming from Donald Trump and his advisers here in the United States after the Charlie Kirk assassination. And I'd like to go through a couple of things that have happened and to contextualize them in terms of your experience dealing with Russia. So one is promises of new scrutiny for nonprofit groups that support certain political causes. We know what kind of causes. Then next, the attorney general's warning that she and the DOJ [Department of Justice] would prosecute hate speech. And one more just to add to the collection: the threat to revoke the broadcast licenses of television stations that carry messages the president doesn't approve of. For me those were frightening parallels with what's happened in Russia.

But many Americans believe that America, it's not Russia. America has long-standing democratic traditions. There is an American constitution. And it's an exaggeration even to bring Russia in this context. Do you think so? Or do you believe, as I do, that the threat to American democracy is existential?

McFaul: Well, I think the threat is real. We shouldn't underestimate it. That list that you just ticked off are frightening things. And of course, we could add to that list in other dimensions.

Kasparov: Oh, absolutely. I just, you know, just don't have time—

McFaul: Yes, headlines. And I think, not only Russia, but other places that had drifted from democracy to autocracy—it can be this kind of salami tactics, right? Bit by bit by bit. And then you wake up one day, and the most important element of a minimal democracy—free and fair elections—are no longer available. And we haven't got there yet, but let's talk about that. We're creeping toward that.

So I think it's very serious. Most certainly the most serious challenge to democracy in my lifetime. And having studied democracy around the world—and colleagues here at Stanford, we have a big group that works on democracy here—I think most of my colleagues who are real experts on global democracy think this is the greatest threat since the Civil War. That's how grave it is. That's the bad news.

Second, to add to more bad news, it just is becoming increasingly clear to me that the president doesn't think in terms of democracy and autocracy. I do. That's the title of my new book, by the way, Autocrats vs. Democrats. He doesn't use that analytic framework to think about global politics; most certainly that's obvious. But I don't even think he thinks about that in American terms. He thinks about “us and them”: us versus our enemies, right? And whether they're democrats or autocrats, it's immaterial.

So he's not afraid to use the power that he has against his enemies. So he is not himself—he doesn't seem to have these democratic norms embedded in him. I don't know about the people around him, but I don't see a lot of people pushing back.

And the Constitution—this is a point you made last week, which I agree completely with—it's just a piece of paper unless there are groups and people that actually try to enforce what's written down there. And Russia, again, is another example of that. The Russian constitution became too super-presidential back in 1993 for my taste, but it wasn't—the constitution was not an antidemocratic constitution when Putin took it over. He just used it in certain ways, and the piece of paper didn't hold him back.

So what will preserve our democracy is not a piece of paper, and it doesn't seem like it'll be motivation from within the regime. It'll be resistance from small-d democrats in American society. And I said that very specifically—small-d democrats—because I don't see the fight for democracy as being a partisan issue. And in some ways I think that may be a tactical mistake here in our society, that we're allowing it to be framed that way. And I was really, really pleasantly surprised to see Senator [Ted] Cruz, for instance, to denounce the removal of Jimmy Kimmel from the air. We need this to be a movement and a resistance for democracy, not for one political party or the other.

Kasparov: Now the title of your book that you mentioned, Autocrats vs. Democrats, is well suited to the podcast. I want us to ask you, because when I was younger and you were younger, the clear divide in the world between autocracy and democracy—it was between the Soviet Union and the United States and the respective blocs these countries led, right? What about today? I mean, the divide today is no longer geographic, right?

McFaul: Yeah. So I agree, but let me explain. There are many theorists here in the United States that think that regime type doesn't matter. Ideology doesn't matter; it's just about power. John Mearsheimer is probably the most prominent theorist in academia that thinks that way. And my book is explicitly a rejection of that way of thinking about the world.

But when I went through the projects for autocratic export—looked really closely at both what Xi Jinping is doing and what Putin's doing—I've got to tell you: I started in one place and ended in another. I started believing and animated by the hypothesis that the ideological threat from China was the biggest one of all, and that Russia was just kind of a sidekick. I ended reversing that. That dynamic and that ideological struggle is playing out in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia. And by the way, we're retreating from it now. I think this is a giant mistake by the Trump administration. That's over there.

There's another ideological struggle that's autocrats versus democrats, but it's—you know, I'm gonna oversimplify—but it's illiberal nationalism, that Putin has been propagating for two decades now, versus liberal internationalism, or just democracy. You know, oversimplify.

And that is not just between states. That is within states. And I think—and I learned this from you, Garry, so I want to give you credit for that. Many years ago, you got me onto this threat from Russia, and I go through in the book all the instruments that Putin uses to propagate these ideas. And the harshest, of course, are his soldiers invading and sweeping lands and taking them over as he's doing in eastern Ukraine right now. But it's RT, it's the church, it's NGOs, it's finding affinity with podcasters in America, where you see this weird world—that, again, you know better than I do—of the overlap of their illiberal nationalists with illiberal nationalists in Europe and the United States. And that struggle is happening within Hungary, within Slovakia, within Italy, within France, and within the United States. And I'm struck by how, you know, Putinism and Putin's friends—how successful they've been. And I would say, tragically, that that illiberal autocratic project—it's been very successful. I'll just leave it at that, and we ignore it at our peril.

Kasparov: So it's fair to say that Trump's administration is pushing America toward autocracy?

McFaul: I think there are definitely certain elements of his policies that are antidemocratic. I'm still cautiously optimistic that we're strong enough as a society, and we have deep, deep-enough values that go back hundreds of years. That's something Russians didn't have in the 1990s, as you know. But we have these strong traditions. There are these autocratic tendencies, and they are achieving some successes. There are pushbacks, and they are achieving some successes too, right? So I see this is a struggle now. It is a struggle for—and I really want to emphasize, I am not talking about Democrats versus Republicans. I'm talking about the struggle for democratic practices, democratic institutions, democratic values.

It's a struggle now. I know that this is not the first time we've been through this. Obviously the worst was the Civil War, but we got through that too. But just because we did in the past doesn't mean we will in the future. And so I should be careful about predicting the future.

Kasparov: Yeah. But now we have the president and his administration that are pushing an illiberal agenda. And we have to resist. So it's—we are in agreement that this threat is real.

McFaul: Yes.

Kasparov: And election 2026—the midterm elections—could be the most fateful elections in our lifetime.

McFaul: Yes; I agree. And to underscore the point, you are absolutely right that you did not have the office of the president, was not the source of these antidemocratic tendencies. And right now, it's all three major branches of government—they're in alignment. The good news is that not all states are, and Trump, you know, he wants you to believe that he won a Ronald Reagan–type landslide election. But people should go and look at the maps from 1984 versus our last presidential election. He did not. I think the contingency of that election gives me hope. And again, I'm sounding, again, like I'm a partisan. I'm a pretty centrist guy, by the way. But in this moment, we need the checks and balances in our system to work. And that's why the 2026 election is so important—that there might be at least one branch of government that is not beholden to the White House. Because I want to say one other thing that really makes my skin crawl, Garry, and it reminds me of living in Russia. I know, and you know, some of them were even, I would've called friends of mine 20 or 30 years ago. That when the tides turned and Putin was in control, they flipped, and they started supporting Putin. And then they went beyond that. They didn't just support Putin. They started praising him and idealizing him and treating him—the way I remember, you know, propaganda when I lived in the Soviet Union would talk about [Leonid] Brezhnev. And that is strange to me, because I know they don't believe it. There's this “cult of a personality” thing that is also, you know, seeing Trump's giant poster over one of the government buildings in D.C. the other day. Just for you and I, that reminds me of all those posters from the Soviet era.

Kasparov: But it's not just about posters. I'm sure you know, you can name a few people, at least a few people—probably your former friends here in America—that now are just trying to excuse any of Trump's illiberal actions.

McFaul: Yes.

Kasparov: That's another parallel. So there are too many parallels. But overall, you remain optimistic. And I understand that your book—it ends on a hopeful note about the renewal of America. And I always like to end the episodes of this show with such a positive note. So just summarize, in the last minute, your belief in American democracy, in the strengths of this democracy, and the renewal of America—not only domestically, but internationally regaining its historic role of being, for people like myself, a beacon of hope.

McFaul: Well, on the domestic side, I'm nervous, like I've expressed. But I'm also cautiously optimistic, because I do think tens of millions of Americans believe in democracy. And the polling shows that. And I think we're in a period of overreach for the president, and I think there'll be a backlash against that. And I think in the long run we will have this renewal of American democracy, and that will be good for the markets. And that will be good for our power and the world as well.

And second, on the international stage, I'm also worried about isolationism, retrenchment, pulling back. But when I look at the long stretch of history, the arc of history is pointing toward more freedom. If you go back hundreds and hundreds of years, the evidence is just overwhelming. Then, finally, we got better ideas. Garry, our ideas are better than theirs. Most people around the world think it's better to elect your leaders rather than have God or the Communist party or the military choose who should lead you. And the data on that is just overwhelming. So I think if we get back our confidence—we just had such a loss of confidence right now—we have more power, and we have better ideas. And in the long run, I'm quite optimistic even about the victory of democracy over autocracy in the world, as well as here at home.

Kasparov: Mike, thank you very much for this optimistic note. I think it's very important, both for our audience and for the public at large to hear the reassurance from an expert of your caliber, who actually saw the rise of autocracy in Russia and is capable to calibrate the threat to democracy in America. Thank you very much for joining the show, Mike.

McFaul: Thanks for having me, Garry. It was a really great conversation.

Charlie Kirk, Jimmy Kimmel, and the end of American democracy.

After the Trump administration pressured late-night host Jimmy Kimmel off the air last week, my colleague Zack Beauchamp wrote about what it tells us about President Donald Trump's roadmap to ending American democracy. I spoke with him about some of his big takeaways, including what we can do to prevent that kind of democratic erosion, for Vox's daily newsletter, Today, Explained. Our conversation is below, and you can also sign up for the newsletter here for more conversations like this.

It was an eventful week. What changed in your understanding of the Trump administration and democracy?

My view for most of the second Trump administration has been that they are pursuing a policy agenda that threatens American democracy, but that they were doing so poorly and haphazardly (and thus were likely to ultimately fail).

But recently, and especially since Charlie Kirk's death, they seem to have gotten a lot more serious about consolidating power. By that, I meant that the White House has taken credible steps toward policies that would materially stack the deck in favor of the Republican Party.

A few examples include striking a deal to spin off TikTok USA and put it in the hands of MAGA-friendly ownership; threatening to go after leading liberal NGOs using RICO, an anti-racketeering law designed for mob prosecutions; and weaponizing a little-used FCC rule to threaten station licenses if they air Jimmy Kimmel, leading to his suspension.

No single one of those policies, on its own, destroys democracy. But they point to a generalized pattern: one in which policy is bent toward crushing the financial and civil society support base that allows for meaningful democratic politics.

You write that you're afraid of the US sliding toward “competitive authoritarianism.” What is that?

Authoritarian governments come in lots of different styles. This one doesn't involve the outright criminalization of the opposition, formal martial law, or even Russian-style fake elections. Instead, it depends on perverting the law, modifying and twisting it with the intent of incrementally undermining the opposition's ability to compete fairly in elections.

Competitive authoritarian regimes target opposition parties through burdensome tax audits, dubious criminal investigations, and uneven application of campaign finance regulations. They also focus on attacking the civil foundations of the opposition — meaning attacking the donors who might fund them, the activist groups who might stand up for their rights, and the free media they depend on to get their message out.

Silence or co-opt enough of these voices, and the ruling party doesn't actually have to outlaw political opposition or stuff ballot boxes. The opposition will simply be weak enough that letting them compete poses little threat.

In the US, this would look like a country where corporations depend on the goodwill of the White House to remain profitable, leading the wealthy to cease meaningful support for Democrats. The press would be owned — in large part, though not entirely — by the regime's favored and trusted oligarchs. And what remains of the independent media and liberal activist class would be subject to relentless state harassment, draining the resources they would need to fight back on an increasingly uneven playing field.

How far are we down that road? 

There are roughly four areas you should be watching for progress.

First, Trump using hiring and firing powers to purge career civil servants from key agencies, like the Justice Department, and erode the traditional barriers preventing undue political influence on law enforcement and regulatory decisions.

Second, Trump using the power of these newly Trumpified agencies to target dissent in civil society — a broadening of the assaults on Ivy League universities.

Third, Trump bullying and bribing large corporations until significant economic power is concentrated in the hands of regime allies dependent on the president's goodwill for their survival

And fourth, Trump turning this accumulated power against the political opposition — turning elections into facially free contests where, in fact, Democrats face enormously unfair hurdles (and would likely be unable to govern even if they managed to succeed).

Of these four, I think there has only been significant progress in the first. He has extensive control over the executive branch, thanks in part to the willingness of key officials like Pam Bondi, Kash Patel, Andrew Ferguson, and Brendan Carr to play ball. But American civil society remains vibrant, large corporations and the media mostly independent, and the opposition still relatively free to act.

But what's happened recently looks a lot like Trump offensives in the other areas, especially the second and third. This is a serious emergency.

What can we do to prevent that future? 

Actually, a lot!

The slide toward competitive authoritarianism in America depends, crucially, on acquiescence — on the idea that people are unwilling to bear the costs of standing up to each individual attack on liberty before they can combine into true authoritarian control over society.

Even the most pessimistic assessments would say we're not there yet: that Trump can't pull something like what he did with Kimmel and expect to avoid mass pushback. Trump is immensely unpopular, and Republicans are likely to lose at least one house of Congress in the midterms, which could significantly limit his ability to silence other prominent voices.

Trump's approach also depends on a tactic that political scientists call “salami slicing”: cutting off one little bit of democracy at a time by targeting one specific person or group, thus avoiding a sense that the collective needs to stand up for shared rights. That's why we've seen not an attempt to criminalize dissent per se, but a series of discrete efforts like the Kimmel threats and the New York Times lawsuit.

Defiance, collective defiance, can make a big difference. The more that people across sectors take public and coordinated action — Congress, the media, the business world, even ordinary civil society — the more they can puncture Trump's sense of inevitability, by fighting against and delaying his power grabs until 2027, when Democrats could hold real power to stop and hold him accountable for them.

This means, specifically, that we need more senators talking about democracy the way Chris Murphy does. It means more business organizations refusing to implement Trump's directives and working with pro-democracy organizations like Leadership Now to demand nonpartisan regulatory policy. It means donors making a show of putting more money, not less, toward anti-Trump causes in general and toward the legal funds of targeted institutions in particular. It means media refusing to bend to Trump and providing relentless coverage of situations like Kimmel's.

And it means individual citizens attending protests and volunteering with the organizations under threat, as well as with political campaigns that could change things in 2026.

The internet loves to point and laugh at names like Oaklynn and Haleigh. There's real anxieteigh behind it. 

Before K-Anna Stephens posted her daughter's name to the Facebook group “that name is a tragedeigh,” she knew that the response wasn't going to be kind. Internet strangers aren't usually known for being nice, and the more than 154,000 group members were gathered specifically to mock and judge “tragic names.”

Stephens herself knows how hard it is to have a distinctive name. Named after a grandmother and distant relative (Kay + Anna), she's heard all kinds of pronunciations and remarks, and dealt with the never-ending headache of trying to submit the dash in “K-Anna” on government websites and filing systems. Still, she says, at almost 30 years old, she's become desensitized to it.

Still, even K-Anna Stephens, with her three decades of unique name experience, didn't know just how mean the internet could get when it came to her daughter's name: Sadilynn.

“It's Say-di-lynne,” Stephens tells Vox of the pronunciation. “After the first 10 or 20 comments, I turned the comments off and tried to forget about the post.”

Sadilynn, Stephens says, came about because she liked the name “Sadie” pronounced like Sadie Hawkins. A relative told her he had a dog named Sadie, which prompted her to add -lynn, combining her first choice with another name she liked. In 2016, when Sadilynn was born, Stephens says she noticed parents using -eigh and -lynn sounds in their children's names and followed the trend.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

When she submitted Sadilynn to the Facebook group — and it's worth noting, there's a similar congregation on Reddit called r/Tragedeigh, with 764,000 weekly users — she was looking for constructive criticism. What she got was a deluge of insults about her education, her sanity, her finances, her employment status, and her lack of compassion for her daughter.

“How would I put that into words? Like, Oh, my God, she's one of those people. Was she on drugs during pregnancy? What was going through her head?” Stephens tells me. “Those comments, they're quite literally what's in the back of my head.”

Alternatively spelled names are a peculiar trend — inherently hard to track, since uniqueness is a key factor. But they're undoubtedly inspiring both copycats and vitriol, often rising into the public consciousness through mockery. What's behind the drive to create these one-in-a-billion names? Why do they garner so much abuse, so much that they can sustain multiple internet forums with six-figure memberships? What do they mean for the children who bear them, and why do they make unrelated adult strangers so, so, so very upset?

As with so many things we dislike, our ire says a lot more about us than it does about any child named Sadilynn.

According to baby name experts and linguists, the insertion of Ys or addition of features like a -lynne or -eigh to a more common, already-existing name are part of a trend known as “alternatively spelled” or “uniquely spelled” names, more colloquially and less professionally referred to as “Utah Mom” names.

“Utah is sort of an early warning system for things that are going to become popular,” Cleveland Evans, a professor and former president of the American Name Society, told NPR earlier this year when speaking about the rise of Oaklynne, Oaklee, Oakleigh, and its variants. Perhaps the most internet famous example of Utah Mom naming conventions is “Chalkboard Mom” aka Beehive State resident McKinli Hatch, who went viral standing beside a list of names like “Mckarty” and “Nayvie.” (She chose “Lakynn.”)

But the naming phenomenon is not exactly exclusive to or even born from Utahns.

In July, the Toronto Blue Jays honored pitcher Jeff Hoffman, who was born in New York, with a bobblehead giveaway. Accompanying Hoffman for the first pitch that night were his sons Tytan and Houstyn and his daughters Jetsyn and Lennyn.

“Technically, it's not a new concept,” says Colleen Slagen, a baby name consultant, of the desire to purposely switch up conventional the spelling of a name and create a new one in the process. Slagen says that riffing on names goes back to the Puritans, the first Americans. The tradition goes back even further to William Shakespeare who Slagen says invented the name Jessica, the 775th most-popular girls' name in 2025 as of this writing, according to Babycenter. Some scholars speculate that Shakespeare anglicized the name from the original Hebrew name “Jesca.”

Perhaps the way we think of Oakleigh now is how Shakespeare's peers thought of Jessica back in 1598. Maybe we'd think of Oakleighs differently if playwrights, poets, and pilgrims were the people trial-ballooning these monikers, instead of people we see on Instagram.

“These days, this style — intentionally changing the traditional spelling of a name — is getting more popularized through social media and influencers,” Slagen says. Familiarity breeds likeness. For those who enjoy an influencers' aesthetics and see their lives as aspirational, a baby name is just one more facet of their lives to admire and perhaps copy.

Most of the names people are selecting to jazz up already exist, and spelling them differently gives them enough of a twist without going too far. “This is a way to choose a name that looks unique, but doesn't sound unique — like spelling the name Peyton Paytyn,” Slagen says.

The motivation to spell a name differently may go beyond the craving for quirkiness. Taylor Humphrey, a baby name consultant and expert in the immense world of things parents call their children, explains that certain sounds and features in names can connote things like femininity and masculinity. Changing the spelling of a traditional boy's name and implementing a feminine feature can upend the binary.

The switch can offer “daughters the strength of masculine name, while simultaneously feminizing the name so as to make it clear it was a girl's name,” Humphrey tells Vox. She explained that in the 1930s, increasingly popular names like Dolores, Frances, Florence, Beatrice, Gladys had the masculine “s” sound that appeared in historical names found in ancient Rome (e.g., Aurelius).

Humphrey expanded on this theory, noting that more popular masculine names today end with a “n” sound (e.g., Benjamin, Tristan, Hudson). If parents want a name that has that girly twist on a traditional boy name, it would mean finding a way to incorporate that “n” sound.

“I think girl moms are once again opting for that masculine strength, and included the ‘n' ending on names that may have otherwise ended in a or y.” Emily, then, becomes Emmersyn; Oakley, Oaklyn; and Trista, Tristan, or Tristyn.

Whether it's Sadilynn or Oaklee or Houstyn, these names strike a nerve. Jokes, insults, unserious accusations of “child abuse,” concern about future bullying, and comparisons to the characters from George R.R. Martin's Game of Thrones tend to follow. With some regularity, they make their way to the Tragedeigh forums of Facebook and Reddit. Why all the anger?

While these names are still too new to be studied thoroughly, the existing research on how the general public views unique names isn't too promising. It might explain, though, why people get so mad.

Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn't.

Over and over, researchers have found that people tend to judge others more favorably and as more trustworthy when they have easy-to-pronounce, familiar names (famously to the disadvantage of immigrants and people of color). It seems that Americans are more likely to trust doctors and accountants with names like Pete and Laura rather than leave their taxes and health to Houstyns and Everleighs.

People like things they know, and don't seem to trust other people's novelty.

“English doesn't always have consistent spelling rules,” Humphrey says. “When parents add -eigh or swap in a y, it can feel like breaking the social contract of ‘how names should be spelled.'”

Ashleigh Zosel-Harper has dealt with that disconnect her entire life. She says that about once a month, she'll get asked why she spells her name with an -eigh instead of Ashley. It's a question that her parents, whom she says wanted a more feminine version of the name, would be better equipped to answer.

Some of curiosity though, may be specific to millennial Zosel-Harper's age. In the late '80s, “Ashley” boomed in popularity, and became the more common variation. “Ashleigh” had a small rise in popularity in the early '90s, right after the “Ashley” boom — perhaps a reflection of how unique spellings are a response to how popular an existing name becomes.

Zosel-Harper notes that the questions and the implication that “Ashley” is the more correct spelling, never really bothered her too much. “I think it made me feel like less of a stereotypical Ashley,” Zosel-Harper tells me. “I didn't fit that stereotype super well, so it made me feel more independent of my name.”

But she also says that she never really “loved” the name in either spelling (the extra letters, she says, are “kind of fussy”). There were so many Ashleys growing up, that it didn't feel unique. It was nothing compared to her high school classmate, Bradleigh.

“Bradley but spelled B-R-A-D-L-E-I-G-H? It totally blew my mind,” Zosel-Harper says.

But sometimes the backlash is more than just playful curiosity.

Humphrey, the baby name consultant, explains that a part of the backlash to these names is rooted in classism. Humphrey cited an argument from The Cut in 2022 when the publication explored the backlash to names like Loyal, Ozzy, Emberlyn, and theorized it was due to those names projecting an idea of being poor or uneducated, or someone poor and uneducated enough not realize that a name could convey all of those things.

Even though the names have changed, the status policing hasn't.

Recently, there's been a growing, vocal obsession of “old money” and “quiet luxury” aesthetics. It's the idea of elegant consumption and behavior that only people with real wealth and class understand and access. This refined consumerism manifests itself in accessories, clothes, cars, hair color, schools, home goods and, even names. (Names considered “old money” like Amelia, Charlotte, Olivia, and Emma are all in the top 10 girls names of 2024, while Theodore, James, Henry, and William are in the top 10 boys names).

The throughline between these seemingly vast and disparate items and identifiers is understatement and tradition. Only people who understand quiet luxury will be able to spot quiet luxury, and anyone who can't is in the out-group.

Names like Tytan, Oakleigh, Jetsynn, Lennyn, are outliers. They're flashy, attention-grabbing, and meant to be noticed. They threaten structure and usurp tradition. Parents like Stephens are well aware of how these names are supposed to be spelled, and still don't follow.

“Sarah, Hannah, Emily — they're beautiful names, but I don't know, they're just not for me,” Stephens says. Despite the internet furor, Stephens says hasn't received much pushback to Sadilynn's name in real life except for when she asks teachers and faculty not to shorten it to Sadie.

“I had no intention of trying to make Sadilynn stand out,” Stephens tells me. The name “just brought me a lot of happiness.”

Humphrey pointed out to me that names were each given to less than 25 girls in 2024, like Tristyn (24), Lakynn (16), and Houstyn (5). Oaklynn, perhaps one of the most popular of these “Utah Mom” names, was given to 1,898 babies. Considering there were 3.6 million births in the US, the notion of these names becoming extremely popular feels a bit exaggerated.

It might be more helpful to look at the rise of these names (and the ensuing backlash) as part of a larger trend of Americans grappling with identity and tradition. Choosing a unique spelling for a name is a way for parents to signal individuality. They're also a way for parents to shift the way we think about gender (i.e., giving girls names that sound like boys' names but spelled with feminine features). Those trends feel more everlasting than the names people choose.

If the idea of more -y, -leigh, and -lynn names troubles you that greatly, there may be light at the end of the tunnel.

Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular.

“Here's the twist: Every year, the most popular names are actually getting less popular,” Humphrey tells me.

Essentially, there are less people naming their babies the most popular names. Today, the most common names don't dominate the way Michaels, Jessicas, and Sarahs did decades ago. Americans still have their favorites like Liam and Olivia — the top names in 2024 — but they aren't as saturated.

“Parents are naturally spreading out across a wider pool of options, which means the need for creative spellings may eventually solve itself,” Humphrey says.

Or maybe — maybeigh — it won't.

The war in Gaza has changed the global debate on the two-state solution. But is it too late?

Palestinian statehood has never had so much international support — or seemed less attainable.

As world leaders gather in New York City on Monday for the UN General Assembly, the question of Palestinian statehood is at the top of the agenda. On Sunday, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia confirmed that they now recognize Palestine as an independent state, following France, which announced its intention to do so last July and formalized it with a speech by President Emmanuel Macron on Monday. Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg, and Malta, among others, have announced plans to recognize Palestine as well.

On Monday, representatives of most of the world's countries — but not the United States or Israel — gathered on the sidelines of the assembly for a meeting, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, to discuss implementing a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas also missed the meeting after being denied a visa to travel to New York by the United States, but addressed the assembly by video. Monday's meeting followed the passage, on September 12, of a UN General Assembly resolution now being referred to as the “New York declaration,” outlining “tangible, timebound, and irreversible steps” toward a two-state solution. The resolution was backed by 142 of the assembly's 193 members.

“Denying statehood would be a gift to extremists everywhere,” UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said at Monday's meeting. “Without two states, there will be no peace in the Middle East, and radicalism will spread around.”

In Washington, a new resolution cosponsored by eight senators calls on President Donald Trump to recognize Palestinian statehood. Calling for a two-state solution is hardly a radical position in US politics, but calling for unilateral recognition of Palestine — rather than supporting a process by which a Palestinian state would emerge out of negotiations — is a more dramatic step, and it's unlikely the resolution would have gotten even this level of support before the war in Gaza. Still, even though none of those senators are Republicans, and the resolution is unlikely to pass, the level of support for a measure that calls for unilateral recognition is an indication of how politics on this issue have shifted in the United States.

Not that any of this is swaying the Israeli government. “There will be no Palestinian state. This place is ours,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared earlier this month at a ceremony announcing Israel's expansion of the West Bank settlement of Maale Adumim. In fact, his government is weighing formally annexing parts of the West Bank in retaliation for the wave of recognition by Western governments. This in turn prompted a warning from the United Arab Emirates — arguably the most significant of the Arab countries that normalized relations with Israel as part of the Abraham Accords during Trump's first term — that it would downgrade diplomatic ties if Israel went ahead with annexation. At the same time, the war in Gaza is only escalating, as the Israel Defense Forces advance into Gaza City and thousands flee.

The reality in Israel and Palestine is so intractable that it raises the question of whether the global mobilization behind statehood is anything more than political theater. It also raises the possibility that the world may be coming to consensus on Palestinian statehood just as it slips out of reach as a realistic possibility.

Since former Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally declared independence in 1988, some 145 countries have recognized Palestine, including the recent additions, according to a tally by Agence France Presse. That includes nearly all of Africa, Latin America, and the former Communist bloc. Most of those who do not recognize it are close US allies like Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Western Europe had, for the most part, refrained from recognizing, but that has shifted rapidly during the war in Gaza, with Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia making the decision to recognize Palestine last year.

The additions of Britain and France to the list are particularly significant, as it means that the United States is now the last permanent member of the UN Security Council that does not recognize a Palestinian state. Palestine currently has “permanent observer status” at the UN, meaning it can participate in debates, but not vote on resolutions in the main UN bodies. The Security Council has to approve new members and all five permanent members have veto power, so membership is not on the table for now. But the Senate resolution suggests that won't necessarily be the case forever.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), one of the cosponsors of the resolution, told Vox that the senators pursued it because “we have to create some light at the end of the very dark tunnel in the Middle East right now.” He added: “I do believe that the best way to ensure security and dignity and self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians is through a two-state solution.”

In an interview with CBS on Sunday, Macron said that “recognizing the Palestinian state today is the only way to provide a political solution to a situation which has to stop.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has charged that France's move is a “reckless decision that only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace.” Macron countered that in fact it would “isolate Hamas from the rest of the Palestinians” and provide an alternative political vision. Notably, the New York declaration, which the majority of Arab states supported, calls for disarming Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza.

Skepticism about the recognition declarations has come not just from supporters of Israel, but also from its critics, who see recognition as a means for governments to deflect criticism over their failure to hold Israel to account for the carnage in Gaza.

“This is worse than political theater,” said Tamara Kharroub, deputy executive director of the Arab Center in Washington, DC. “It's a smokescreen to mask their decades-long failure to implement this very two-state solution and to end Israel's occupation and apartheid, and their complicity in the genocide that has been taking place in Gaza for the past two years.”

Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said the flurry of activity around Palestinian statehood at the UN this week would be a form of “fantasy diplomacy.”

He added that the leaders of these countries “felt they had to make a declaration, but there isn't really a plan to go with it. The only way that you can really back this up would be for these countries and the wider UN membership to agree to some sort of framework for sanctions against Israel. I just don't think the political will is there to put the amount of pressure on Israel that you would need to actually dissuade Netanyahu and his government from the current course of action.”

Meanwhile on the ground in Israel and occupied territories, a two-state solution looks farther off than ever. Only 21 percent of Israelis believe their country can coexist peacefully with a Palestinian state, according to a Pew poll, down 14 percentage points since before Hamas's October 7, 2023 attacks. (The infeasibility of a two-state solution may ironically be one of the few things Israelis and Palestinians can agree on.)

As the war in Gaza drags on, members of Netanyahu's government like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich are now publicly discussing proposals to annex parts of the enclave if Hamas does not surrender; late last week, Smotrich touted the territory as a potential “real estate bonanza.” Those comments are in line with Trump's apparently still active proposals to turn Gaza into a tourist resort after the “voluntary” relocation of its civilian population.

Israeli officials have also discussed responding to the wave of Palestine recognitions by formally annexing parts of the West Bank. This could take several forms: from annexing Israeli settlements close to Israel, to annexing the area along the border between the West Bank and Jordan, to annexing all of what's known as “Area C” — the 60 percent of the West Bank currently under Israeli security control. Far-right ministers like Smotrich have proposed going even further and dissolving the Palestinian Authority entirely.

Van Hollen, who recently visited the West Bank, dismissed these threats, saying it's clear that plans for annexation are already underway. “For them to pretend that the actions they're taking in the West Bank are in response to calls for recognition of a Palestinian state is just a cover story,” he said. “It's a big lie.”

Yoel Guzansky, a former Israeli government adviser who now leads the Gulf Program at the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, told Vox that Netanyahu “needs a green light from the Trump administration” to move ahead with annexation. “He could not do it without it.”

Trump and his advisers have sent mixed signals on the issue over the years. Axios has reported, citing Israeli officials, that Rubio, who visited Israel earlier this month, has signaled that the Trump administration is not opposed to annexation, but other administration officials disputed the Israeli characterization. While a “two-state solution” was long bipartisan orthodoxy in Washington, Trump has suggested in the past he's not wedded to the idea, and some members of his administration, such as Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, are openly annexationist.

What may deter Trump from giving Netanyahu a green light is the effect that annexation would have on one of his signature accomplishments: the Abraham Accords. Even a “limited” annexation of West Bank territory would likely drive a deeper wedge between Israel and its erstwhile partners in the Arab world. West Bank annexation would be another red line crossed, and the government of the UAE — which has close relations with the Trump administration — has warned the White House that it could unravel the accords, entirely.

Guzansky said that the Abraham Accords countries “might not cancel the agreement entirely” if Israel went ahead with annexation, but that the agreements are “becoming an empty shell of something that was once seen as a model peace agreement between Israel and its neighbors, a ‘Cold Peace' agreement.” That could mean the Arab states continue cooperating with Israel on security, but do so without the people-to-people exchanges or deeper political and economic integration that the accords had promised.

A few years ago, Netanyahu likely would have also pointed to normalizing relations between Israel and countries like the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco as one of the crowning foreign policy achievements of his long era in office. The grand prize, normalization with Saudi Arabia, seemed at least a realistic possibility. The Abraham Accords saw many Arab governments willing to sidestep the Palestinian issue to find common ground with Israel on trade and their shared rivalry with Iran.

The sheer level of devastation in Gaza, though, and the global reaction to it, have made that sidestepping much more difficult for even the most jaded and autocratic governments to maintain. Israel's military strikes throughout the Middle East in recent months, particularly the recent airstrike on Qatar, have further convinced these governments that Israel is increasingly a source of regional instability.

In a recent speech, Netanyahu warned Israel that it would likely have to accept an increasingly isolated position on the world stage for the time being, and transform into a “super Sparta” and “adapt to an economy with autarkic characteristics.”

Regional integration and good relations with its neighbors would be nice, in other words, but in the Israeli government's view, if the price is a negotiated end to the war in Gaza and serious steps toward accepting Palestinian statehood, it's just not worth it.

This week's events in New York are unlikely to bring about a Palestinian state in reality — or end the carnage in Gaza — but they may one day be seen as an inflection point in Israel's path toward isolation on the world stage.

Trump's H-1B plan is a bad solution to a real problem.

Donald Trump just transformed America's high-skill immigration system.

In a proclamation Friday, the president imposed a $100,000 fee on all new applications for H-1B visas (although the administration would retain the right to offer companies exemptions at will).

Such visas have long been controversial. The H-1B program is meant to help American employers hire foreign workers with rare intellectual abilities. It aims to ensure that the US “knowledge economy” is not undermined by shortfalls of highly-skilled labor.

Yet some companies have used the program to essentially replace US workers with immigrants — less because the latter boast exceptional skills than because they have lower wage expectations.

Trump's $100,000 fee is ostensibly meant to fix this problem. In theory, employers won't pay that hefty charge to hire a garden-variety foreign coder over an American one. Rather, a company would only be willing to foot that bill for extraordinary foreign talent.

If the president's policy addresses legitimate complaints with the H-1B system, however, it does so in a needlessly costly manner. Trump's exorbitant fee would undermine American scientific research, technological progress, and economic growth. And this would translate into lower wages for American workers in the long term.

The problems with H-1B visas mostly stem from how they're allocated.

Demand for such visas far outstrips their supply: In 2023, 446,000 people sought an H-1B visa, but America only provides 85,000 of them each year (20,000 of which are reserved for workers who have attained a master's degree or higher from a US institution of higher education).

Whether a given worker secures an H-1B visa is left largely to chance. Instead of prioritizing the most skilled applicants — or those pursuing the highest-paid jobs — the government selects them at random through a lottery.

This process actually favors low-wage employers seeking to hire workers with middling abilities. If you're an AI firm that's looking to hire one particular machine learning engineer who holds superlative skills, you will probably lose the H-1B lottery. After all, any individual applicant has a low chance of getting selected.

On the other hand, if you're an outsourcing company that's looking to hire lots of foreign workers with basic IT skills, your odds of winning the lottery are quite good. Such companies don't need any specific candidate, only a large number of interchangeable laborers. So, they can sponsor many more workers than they actually need and then take whichever ones happen to make it through the filter. If too many of their workers get selected, they can simply decline to complete all of their applications. By flooding the lottery in this way, IT staffing and outsourcing firms secured 40 percent of all H-1B visas in 2023, according to a Bloomberg investigation.

This is suboptimal for the American economic dynamism. Helping cutting-edge tech firms access top talent is better for innovation than helping outsourcing companies hire mediocre IT support specialists. And doing the latter also entails higher tradeoffs for native-born workers, since outsourcing firms subvert the H-1B program's labor protections.

To secure an H-1B visa, companies must pledge that they will pay their applicant at least as much as they currently pay similar American employees. A company, therefore, cannot lay off its existing IT workforce and then hire lower-wage H-1B workers in their place.

Yet a firm can eliminate its IT department — and then delegate those functions to an outsourcing company, which is largely staffed by H-1B workers. In this way, companies can use the H-1B program to effectively replace domestic workers. And some have in fact done this.

Trump's $100,000 application fee constitutes one answer to the H-1B program's allocation problem. Outsourcing companies aren't going to shell out that kind of money for entry-level IT specialists.

By contrast, a well-capitalized firm seeking a specific, exceptionally talented foreign worker may consider $100,000 to be a “rounding error” (as one tech CEO called it Sunday).

The president's policy is therefore likely to increase the proportion of H-1B visas going to immigrants with genuinely rare skills,

Nevertheless, Trump's fee entails far greater costs than benefits.

On the latter front, the White House's policy won't necessarily safeguard the jobs and wages of native-born IT specialists. Companies can often replace their American tech support staff with remote workers abroad. And as the Economist notes, top outsourcing companies responded to the last crackdown on their H-1B access by shifting their hiring towards India. Meanwhile, AI is enabling the rapid automation of many IT functions.

If Trump's policy would do relatively little to insulate American IT workers from competition, it would do a great deal to undermine economic growth.

This is because the president's fee wouldn't merely change the distribution of H-1B visas, but dramatically reduce their total supply.

For one thing, it's not clear that private sector employers would be willing to sponsor 85,000 visas a year, at the price of $100,000 per application.

More critically, the statutory cap on H-1B visas does not apply to many universities and nonprofits. If forced to pay $100,000 per worker, however, such research institutions would likely need to turn away many exceptional foreign scholars. Scientific research often generates large economic and social benefits in the long term, but scant profits in the short run. Thus, in many cases, universities will not be able to finance guest workers' applications, even if their labor is highly valuable to the United States.

At the very least, many schools and smaller American companies would struggle to offer foreign workers competitive wages, if they were forced to eat $100,000 on each hire: A European university that has a $350,000 budget for a research position could actually offer a higher salary than an American university with a $400,000 for an analogous position, because the latter school would need to spend $100,000 just to get its applicant into the country.

American science is already reeling from the Trump administration's cuts to NIH grants and revocation of student visas. The president's H-1B policy threatens to further undermine the competitiveness of US research institutions and chase more academic talent abroad.

To some on the populist right, sustaining American universities' access to international scholars may seem like an elitist concern. From this perspective, the priority must be improving American workers' wages and job opportunities. If US schools can't find enough native-born scientists to staff their labs, then they should do a better job of educating their American students.

But this perspective grossly underestimates the economic benefits of immigration in general, and high-skill migration in particular.

Even in its current, dysfunctional form, the H-1B visa program appears to boost wages and employment opportunities for American workers. This is true for at least three reasons:

There's reason to think this same pattern holds at the national level — that companies are more likely to invest in countries that have lots of highly skilled labor. Researchers have found that when multinational firms lose access to H-1B workers, they tend to replace them by increasing hiring abroad. This effectively transfers dollars out of the US economy and into foreign ones.

For these reasons, any reform of the H-1B system that reduces high-skill immigration in the US will hurt American workers in the aggregate.

The H-1B visa program is falling short of its official objectives: It leaves many cutting-edge firms unable to hire top foreign talent, and undermines the bargaining power of some native-born workers.

But there are better ways to address these issues than Trump's $100,000 fee. For example, the government could distribute visas on the basis of compensation rather than a lottery: Rather than distributing 85,000 slots at random each year, it could award them to the 85,000 applicants offered the highest-paying jobs.

But the president's approach would reduce America's dynamism and living standards — while tilting the economic playing field towards the administration's cronies (who are liable to have an easier time securing fee exemptions). In this way, it is of a piece with Trump's broader agenda.

Business Insider Edition 

Philanthropist Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will contribute $912 million to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, while warning that global health funding cuts could disproportionately affect Africa.


        Speaking at a Reuters Newsmaker event in New York, Gates noted the risks facing African children. “A kid born in northern Nigeria has a 15% chance of dying before the age of 5. You can either be part of improving that or act like that doesn't matter,"" he said.
    


        The Gates Foundation's pledge matches its donation in 2022; the last time the Global Fund, a Geneva-based independent nonprofit, raised money on its three-year budget cycle. The announcement comes amid reductions in aid from governments worldwide, led by the United States.
    


        “The Goalkeepers event celebrates and seeks to accelerate progress on United Nations global development goals set for 2030, including improving health and ending poverty,” Gates said.
    


        “I am not capable of making up what the government cuts, and I don't want to create an illusion of that.” he added.
    


        Founded in 2000 by Gates and his ex-wife, the foundation is one of the largest funders of global health initiatives worldwide. Its work focuses on ending preventable deaths of mothers and babies, tackling infectious diseases, and lifting millions out of poverty.
    


        In countries like Ethiopia, its initiatives to expand vaccination coverage and improve maternal healthcare have been credited with significantly reducing child and maternal mortality rates. However, challenges remain in sustaining progress across the globe.

        Global development assistance dropped 21 percent between 2024 and 2025, hitting a 15-year low, according to the U.S.-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
    


        Experts warn that this decline could put at risk the progress that has halved child mortality since 2000, saving five million lives each year.
    


        Bill Gates said maintaining funding for the Global Fund and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, prioritising primary healthcare, and rolling out innovations like the long-acting HIV prevention drug lenacapavir could save additional lives. Organisations including the Global Fund are racing to secure funds before the end of the year to prevent setbacks.
    


        “What's happening to the health of the world's children is worse than most people realize, but our long-term prospects are better than most can imagine,” Gates added.
    


        Africa continues to bear a disproportionate share of the global burden of AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. According to the World Health Organization, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for nearly 70 percent of all people living with HIV worldwide, and the region records the highest rates of tuberculosis infection and death.
    


        Malaria remains endemic in most African countries, with children under five and pregnant women among the most vulnerable. These diseases continue to strain healthcare systems and contribute significantly to preventable deaths.

        Despite these challenges, Bill Gates said there is still an opportunity to save millions of lives and eliminate some of the deadliest childhood diseases by the time he donates the remainder of his fortune in 2045.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Hybrid creep' is spreading as more companies tighten RTO rules","https://www.businessinsider.com/hybrid-creep-employers-increasing-rto-days-office-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 10:04:00 GMT","

Sorry, home-office enthusiasts. So-called ""hybrid creep"" is gaining traction.

Employers are gradually increasing the number of days that workers must show up at the office. For example, this month Intel began requiring staffers to come in at least four days a week, up from three previously. NBCUniversal, Starbucks, and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. recently implemented similar mandates.

A new survey of 2,000 full-time US workers found that nearly a third of employers revised their remote or hybrid work policies in the past year. Video-conferencing company Owl Labs, which commissioned the poll and claims it came up with the term ""hybrid creep,"" found that 34% of respondents are now required to be on-site at least four days a week. That is up from 32% in 2024 and 23% in 2023.

""This is the boiling-frog concept,"" Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Boston-based Owl Labs, told Business Insider. Instead of suddenly demanding workers return to the office full-time after several years of hybrid — and before that, fully remote — schedules, they've been taking things slow, he said.

It's likely that employers going with a baby-step approach aren't using stricter return-to-office mandates as a way to nudge workers to resign, said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

""Nobody's quitting now anyway,"" he said.

Instead, companies may be easing staff back into commuting incrementally to avoid stirring resentment, which can hamper productivity. Just because workers aren't handing in resignations as frequently as they used to doesn't mean they're happy with less flexibility, Cappelli said.

Companies generally want workers back at the office so they can monitor them more closely and spur more collaboration. Yet five-day RTO mandates have come with some hiccups, as Business Insider previously reported.

Amazon's shift in January from three to five mandatory office days left workers scrambling for desks and meeting rooms, while Dell's March orders for employees living near an office to come back full time resulted in uneven compliance. Some workers at the tech company resumed eight-hour office days, while ""coffee badgers"" showed up only briefly.

Still, returning to a fully in-person workweek may result in some employees resigning, even in today's job-hugging economy, because of child- or elder-care needs, said Pace University management professor Andrew Coggins.

Returning to fully in-person schedules ""can be a big jump,"" he said.

Owl Labs's survey suggests that more workers are warming up to office life. Some 21% of respondents said they'd like to be on-site as many as four days a week, an increase from 17% in last year's report. Yet nearly half of workers polled said they still lack the overall work flexibility they want, and 37% said they'd decline a job offer from a company that doesn't allow flexible working hours.

It's possible that hybrid creep is a sign that the era of flexible work is coming to an end — at least at some companies. ""I think employers would prefer five days,"" said Coggins. ""They have more control.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Here are the jobs most and least likely to be transformed by GenAI, according to a new index from Indeed","https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-index-indeed-skills-jobs-change-roles-immune-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

Generative AI is steadily rewiring the DNA of work, radically transforming some jobs, while other professions remain relatively immune.

That's according to a new analysis from Indeed, a job-listings platform, that created an index to track these workplace changes.

Indeed's GenAI Skill Transformation Index measures how much generative AI could change the way different skills or jobs are performed. Instead of measuring whether this technology will fully replace human workers, it examines how skills may be applied going forward and how human involvement with those skills and tasks could evolve.

The study and index assessed the cognitive and physical demands required across nearly 2,900 work skills and the capacity of generative AI to perform them. Indeed focused on two particular criteria:

Problem-solving ability: The degree to which a skill requires cognitive reasoning, applied knowledge, and practical judgment, and how well generative AI can replicate this.

Physical necessity: Whether a skill requires physical execution. Until general-purpose robotics advances significantly, these tasks remain mostly human-exclusive, according to Indeed.

Based on this evaluation, skills were grouped into four distinct categories based on their potential to be transformed by generative AI: minimal transformation, assisted transformation, hybrid transformation, and full transformation.

Under this framework, Indeed found the following:

When Indeed ran an initial version of this analysis a year ago, no skills were rated as ""very likely"" to be fully replaced by GenAI. Today, 19 skills (0.7% of all skills analyzed) were assessed to be ""very likely"" to be fully replaced by GenAI, still small in absolute terms, but a significant signal of progress.

""GenAI has gotten (and continues to get) smarter,"" Annina Hering, senior economist at Indeed's Hiring Lab, and Arcenis Rojas, a data scientist at the lab, wrote. ""As long as physical execution is not required — an admittedly big caveat — and GenAI capabilities continue to grow, more skills are likely to cross the threshold into realistic automation as work continues to evolve.""

The latest findings reveal that childcare, nursing, and construction are the least likely to be transformed by generative AI.

Meanwhile, software development is most likely to be transformed by generative AI. Eighty-one percent of the skills involved in these jobs will experience a hybrid transformation in which GenAI leads and humans provide oversight, according to Indeed's index.

Data & Analytics and accounting were second and third, behind software development, as most likely to be transformed by GenAI.

The overall message is pretty blunt: no job is entirely immune, but not all jobs are equally exposed. Technical and information-heavy roles will feel the brunt of automation, while jobs grounded in physical presence and human touch will remain mostly shielded.

For businesses, that means redesigning workflows and training pipelines. For workers, it means leaning into uniquely human strengths, such as physical dexterity, informed oversight, and empathy, that AI still can't replicate well.

Here's the full breakdown of jobs and skills:

In 2025, quitting might be something you only dream about when work piles up or you get the side-eye from your boss. Many employees are simply holding on to their jobs because, for the first time since 2021, there are more people in the US looking for work than there are open roles.

The lackluster job market is yet another reason that it pays to quit well. Here are three things to consider:

If you're having a lousy time at work, don't quit on a bad day, said Laura Labovich, who runs an outplacement firm in the Washington, DC, area.

""A lot of people run away from a bad workplace, but they have nothing to run towards,"" she told Business Insider.

Instead, Labovich said, create a plan for leaving. Unless you're in a toxic work environment, considering what you want to do next is often a lot easier while you still have a paycheck and benefits.

Sketching out a strategy before you pull the ripcord also doesn't mean you have to stay forever. Most workers don't. Younger baby boomers held an average of 12.9 jobs from ages 18 to 58, the Labor Department reported. It also found that the oldest millennials — those born in the early 1980s — had nine jobs, on average, from age 18 to their mid-30s.

If you're heading for the door, it's wise to show gratitude, thank your boss and others for the opportunity, and explain why the role might no longer be an ideal fit for you, said Jim Detert, a professor at the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business Administration.

One way to frame it, he said, is to focus on advancement opportunities. That's not threatening to those you're leaving behind, and it allows them to say that there wasn't a great fit for your growth or passions at your employer, Detert said.

""That doesn't make people angry at you,"" he told Business Insider.

Detert said that if you're departing for a management position, for example, you can credit your boss with that by saying they've inspired you, by being a solid mentor, to go into leadership.

In any case, Detert said, it's often wise to give credit.

""You can say things like, 'The whole reason I'm at this stage now of being so ready for X, is that you have given me so many opportunities up to this point,'"" Detert said.

An exit interview could be one of the last big things you do in your job. So, just as you want to consider how you leave things with your boss, it's smart to do the same with an exit interview, Detert said.

He cautioned against firing off a litany of complaints about the organization. That's because if leadership wasn't listening to you before you said you were leaving, it's unlikely to start doing so when you depart, Detert said.

""I don't think I've ever heard of a case where exit interviews were the basis of any meaningful change,"" Detert said.

One reason, he said, is that HR staffers tend to conduct exit interviews, rather than senior execs. That means there's a lower likelihood of a big payoff from carrying out ""a therapeutic purge,"" Detert said.

He said that in his many years of studying the impact of speaking out, there are two key considerations: Is it safe, and is it worthwhile? If you're leaving, you don't have to worry about a boss withholding a promotion, for example. Yet, Detert said, you still might meet colleagues at future employers. It's another version of the don't-burn-a-bridge idea.

""If you think that, 'Now I'm leaving and it's safer,' you may be mistaken,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Family-owned American diners are a dying breed. I visited 2 in New Jersey to see if they can survive.","https://www.businessinsider.com/visited-2-new-jersey-diners-summit-tops-food-community-business-2025-9","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:38:00 GMT","

Diners are disappearing across America. From the 1950s to the 2000s, the number in the US dropped from roughly 6,000 to 2,500.

I've seen headlines decrying a 50-year-old one becoming a marijuana dispensary and a San Fransico institution that closed after eight decades.

But are American diners truly on their way out? I went to New Jersey's busiest diner, and one of the state's oldest, to find out.

New Jersey is the diner capital of America, boasting more than any other state. But even there, it's estimated that 150 have closed in the last decade.

Located just a 45-minute drive outside Manhattan, Tops is in a prime location to get traffic from New York City, Philadelphia, and New Jersey. It serves nearly 13,000 people a week.

Tops is a far cry from the diners of my youth. Four hundred people can squeeze into these tan booths. Dozens of workers buzz around the floor. And music blasts overhead.

For the middle of the week, I thought it'd be quieter. Boy, was I wrong. Behind the scenes, the kitchen was firing food nonstop. Cooks go through 21,600 eggs a week. Stephen McCormick, the Executive Chef of Tops, told me people order pasta with Alfredo sauce at 8 in the morning, and stacks of pancakes late at night.

Many of the plates pull inspiration from around the world: a Mexico City burger, Dominican Breakfast, beignets, Lomo Saltado, and Bang Bang Shrimp. The prices were steeper than I was expecting: $7 for a chai latte and $27 for eggplant Parmesan.

I tried a lot of dishes. The big serving of fried chicken and waffles ($26) had a nice crisp to it. The waffles were big and fluffy.

The egg rolls ($15) came with a sweet and spicy Thai chili and honey mustard sauce. I was impressed with how much Philly cheesesteak flavor they packed into a tiny bite. But these were so rich that I probably wouldn't be able to eat a full order alone.

This is a New Jersey classic: a pile of fries smothered in gravy and topped with melty mozzarella. The gravy was rich, the cheese deliciously springy, and the fries somehow held their crunch. This is such an indulgent dish. I can see why Disco Fries are a favorite late-night eat in the state.

To make the gravy for the Disco Fries, the restaurant roasts vegetables and bones for 24 hours. Cooks hand roll those Philly Cheesesteak eggrolls. They smash avocados through a cooling rack for guacamole.

The restaurant serves meat from Pat LaFrieda, the same supplier of burgers to Shake Shack and prime cuts to Brooklyn's oldest steakhouse, Peter Luger. In addition to Pat LaFrieda, Tops' Executive Chef Stephen slices many of the cuts himself.

Here, a team of bakers pumps out pancake batter, expertly fills cheesecake molds, and swiftly decorates Tres Leches cakes. I was floored to learn they were even making their own syrup for pancakes.

Golemis says diners are becoming extinct because owners face long working hours. It's a tough business to be in, and diner bosses burn out. He credits volume and constant innovation for Tops' success. Recently, in 2020, Golemis and his brothers renovated the restaurant, adding more seats and parking, ultimately tripling the space.

After my meal at Tops, I left wondering if this place can still be considered a diner. It's more expensive and expansive than any I'd ever seen. But that scale has allowed Golemis to experiment with new flavors and bring in a lot of hungry eaters. Is this the diner of the future?

I went on another Wednesday morning, and just like Tops, Summit Diner was buzzing. Located in Summit, New Jersey, the diner opened in 1928. It's one of the oldest left in the state and one of the last remaining examples of a pre-fabricated diner manufactured by the Jerry O'Mahony Diner Company.

Diners can trace their roots back to Rhode Island in the 1870s. First, they were horse-drawn lunch wagons serving sandwiches to newspaper workers on the night shift.

But it was New Jersey's factories that built most of the pre-fabricated diners shipped across the US in the 20th century.

It's estimated that the Jerry O'Mahony Company built 2,000 diners by the time it shuttered in the 1950s.

Owner Jimmy Greberis' family bought Summit Diner in 1964 after immigrating from Greece. Greberis started working here when he was 19. Over the last 40 years, he's seen the clientele shift from Wall Street bigwigs to everyday construction workers.

The tiled floor, mahogany walls, neon red stools and booths, and tables are all from 1939. Greberis said these original touches are expensive to maintain and hard to replace because the company that built this diner went out of business in the 1950s.

I spoke with Summit employee Maelin Mejis, who said that when she was first hired, the waitresses were practically singing. She'd memorize the orders and holler to the cooks: ""Two eggs over easy. One corned beef hash!"" Now, she dances around the restaurant, writing down orders with a pen and paper and figuring out tabs with a calculator. No credit cards are in sight.

There was no paper menu. You just look up and scan. I found that it allowed for a lot more conversation with the staff when I was looking up at a menu instead of looking down. And unlike Tops, Summit only had a few dozen options to choose from, so I didn't find it overwhelming.

This was the first time I'd ever tried a Taylor Ham roll. I was blown away. Somehow, the sandwich tasted nostalgic to me. Salty pork paired perfectly with melty American cheese and a Natale's soft roll, baked up the road.

Dare I say the pancakes were better than Tops'? They're fluffy, with a nice crust on the outside. Smothered in syrup, they feel like a warm hug.

He's tried experimenting with fruit, but people don't order it. And avocado? He said he won't serve it because it goes bad quickly, and his team doesn't know how to work with it. After 40 years in the business, Greberis says he knows what works best, and he sticks to the classics.

It's clear how much Summit means to the town, and how much Greberis has put back into the community. He gets bread from Natale's, a local bakery. That giant log of Taylor Ham comes from an hour up the road.

Labor's gotten more expensive, and food costs have soared. Eggs surged from $1.20 a dozen before COVID to $8.60. They've since leveled out to $3.75. Small diners like this just don't have the volume to be able to absorb those costs. Greberis had to raise his prices, but at $9.25 an omelet, nearly half the price of Tops', his prices still seem more than fair.

Despite surviving all these challenges, a more humble threat might spell the end of Summit. Greberis' kids don't want to take over the family restaurant. He worries about selling the business to another family because he said the land is worth more than the business, and they might tear it down. I wondered, could it even be Summit Diner without Jimmy?

The pancakes and Taylor Ham were amazing. But more than the food, this place is a vibe. It's comforting. You feel like you've known the staff for years, even if you just walked through the doors. It's as if the whole town squeezes into just a few booths. The mayor just happened to be eating lunch the day we visited!

While Summit and Tops have taken two very different approaches to an American diner, I think they represent a path forward for the waning category.

Tops has innovated, firing up bold flavors and slinging out liquor, much to its customers' delight. Whereas Summit stuck with tradition, and that's worked because the town revels in its history.

If there's going to be a future for diners, there has to be room for both kinds. But the real reason I think diners are forever isn't the food; it's the people—the owners, cooks, and waitresses who keep the energy humming and the hungry diners who keep coming back for more.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that weakness in the labor market is outweighing concerns about stubborn inflation, leading to a decision he backed to lower the central bank's key interest rate last week.

The Federal Open Market Committee's first cut of the year came amid signs that both supply and demand of workers is waning at the same time that near-term impact from tariffs has pushed inflation higher.

At such times, Powell said, during a speech to business leaders in Providence, R.I., the Fed's job is to ""balance both sides of our dual mandate"" for stable prices and low unemployment.

""Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside — a challenging situation,"" he said. ""Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path.""

The conditions Powell described in the speech are consistent with stagflation, in which growth slows and inflation is high. While the current situation is far less severe than what the U.S. encountered in the 1970s and early '80s, it nonetheless has presented a policy challenge for the Fed.

Powell, however, said he is comfortable with the central bank's current policy path though he indicated the possibility of additional cuts should the FOMC see the need to be more accommodative.

""The increased downside risks to employment have shifted the balance of risks to achieving our goals,"" he said. ""This policy stance, which I see as still modestly restrictive, leaves us well positioned to respond to potential economic developments.""

Stocks reacted little to Powell's comments though Treasury yields edged lower.

On the labor market, Powell noted ""a marked slowdown"" in supply and demand. ""In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment have risen,"" he said.

Indeed, payroll growth has slowed dramatically, averaging below 30,000 during the summer months while benchmark revisions showed nearly a million fewer jobs created in the 12 months prior to March 2025.

At the same time, inflation has cooled substantially since hitting a more than 40-year peak in 2022 but is still considerably above the Fed's 2% goal. Commerce Department data to be released Friday is expected to indicate that personal consumption prices rose 2.7% on an annual all-items basis and 2.9% when excluding food and energy, Powell said.

Adding to uncertainty is the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The president continues to negotiate with major U.S. trading partners about the ultimate level for the duties, with a key deadline with China coming up in early November. Fed economists for now are viewing the tariffs as mostly a temporary rise in prices, though that could change.

""Uncertainty around the path of inflation remains high,"" Powell said. ""We will carefully assess and manage the risk of higher and more persistent inflation. We will make sure that this one-time increase in prices does not become an ongoing inflation problem.""

Powell is presiding over a Fed that has come under intense criticism from the White House and is seeing an unusually wide dispersion in views among officials. The FOMC meeting concluded with participants narrowly split, 10-9, over whether one or two more quarter-point cuts would be appropriate this year. Trump appointee Stephen Miran has pushed for a much more aggressive course, but his term as governor ends in January.

Earlier Tuesday, Governor Michelle Bowman warned about the dangers of moving too slowly to address the labor market. Bowman, also a Trump appointee, said ""we are at serious risk of already being behind the curve in addressing deteriorating labor market conditions.""

""I am concerned that the labor market could enter into a precarious phase and there is a risk that a shock could tip it into a sudden and significant deterioration,"" she said.

While Powell has not provided his expectations for future rate moves, Bowman said she hopes the recent action is ""the first step"" in an ongoing move back to a neutral interest rate level.

In this article

Morgan Stanley is months away from offering crypto trading to retail customers through its E-Trade division as the Wall Street giant embraces what it called a transformative moment for the wealth management industry.

The firm is working with the startup Zerohash — which Morgan Stanley also took an investment stake in — for liquidity, custody and settlement around crypto trading, according to a memo obtained by CNBC.

""We are well underway in preparing to offer crypto trading through a partner model to E-Trade clients in the first half of 2026,"" Jed Finn, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley, said in the memo.

Morgan Stanley is among the most aggressive of big banks in embracing crypto after the U.S. government's stance toward the technology flipped with the election of President Donald Trump. Wealth management accounted for nearly half of Morgan Stanley's total revenue last year, making it more reliant on the industry than its other big bank peers.

The move is the latest sign of crypto adoption by financial incumbents. In an earlier wave about four years ago, banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs began offering bitcoin funds to their wealthy clients. That gave clients exposure to the asset class though crypto firms including Galaxy Digital that managed the funds.

But what Morgan Stanley is doing now is preparing to offer direct ownership of crypto, which cuts out some third-party management fees and comes with greater risks. Morgan Stanley will first offer bitcoin, ether and solana trading, according to Bloomberg News.

Morgan Stanley is preparing for a future in which wealthy clients expect to see traditional and digital assets managed in the same environment, Finn said in the memo.

The bank is working on a wallet that will allow it to be the custodian for clients' digital assets, a key part of its overall strategy, he said.

""Offering clients the ability to trade crypto is the tip of the iceberg,"" Finn said.

The bank expects to help clients hold not just crypto, but also tokenized versions of traditional financial assets, according to the memo.

Tokenization — or creating a digital representation of assets including cash, stocks, bonds and real estate on a blockchain — will ""significantly disrupt"" the wealth management industry, Finn said.

""Tokenized substitutes for cash begin paying interest as soon as it hits the wallet,"" Finn said. ""The rest of the asset classes will follow suit in seeking this efficiency.""

""We see immense power in the cryptocurrency space, not just with crypto as an investment for our clients, but also around DLT and tokenization more broadly,"" he said, using the acronym for distributed ledger technology, the concept underpinning blockchain.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday cancelled a planned meeting with the two top Democrats in Congress to address issues holding up a funding deal that could avoid a federal government shutdown.

Trump scrapped the sit-down set for this week just a day after people familiar with the situation said that his meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries would happen.

Trump's move increases the likelihood of a shutdown.

The two New York lawmakers are insisting that any stopgap deal to avoid a Sept. 30 shutdown include protections for health-care programs, including by extending Affordable Care Act enhanced tax credits. 

Those credits, which are usable for health insurance plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces, are due to expire at the end of the year.

In a Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote, After reviewing the details of the unserious and ridiculous demands being made by the Minority Radical Left Democrats in return for their Votes to keep our thriving Country open, I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.""

Jeffries quickly tweeted in response: ""Trump Always Chickens Out.""

""Donald Trump just cancelled a high stakes meeting in the Oval Office with myself and Leader Schumer,"" Jeffries wrote. 

""The extremists want to shut down the government because they are unwilling to address the Republican healthcare crisis that is devastating America,"" the Democratic leader wrote.

Schumer, in a statement, said, ""Trump is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there.""

""While Americans face rising costs and a Republican healthcare crisis, Trump would rather throw a tantrum than do his job,"" Schumer said.

""Democrats are ready to work to avoid a shutdown — Trump and Republicans are holding America hostage. Donald Trump will own the shutdown.""

In a letter requesting the talks on Saturday, Schumer and Jeffries wrote, ""We do not understand why you prefer to shut down the government rather than protect the health care and quality of life of the American people,"" they wrote.

Trump, in his post on Tuesday, slammed Democrats' demands, accusing them of seeking to fund an array of ""Radical Left Views and Policies"" related to health care, immigration, and crime.

""The Democrats in Congress seem to have totally lost their way,"" Trump wrote.

""I look forward to meeting with them if they get serious about the future of our Nation,"" he wrote. ""We must keep the Government open, and legislate like true Patriots rather than hold American Citizens hostage, knowing that they want our now thriving Country closed.""

""I'll be happy to meet with them if they agree to the Principles in this Letter,"" the president wrote. ""To the Leaders of the Democrat Party, the ball is in your court.""

While close to 150 world leaders prepared to descend on Manhattan for the U.N. General Assembly, the U.S. Secret Service was quietly dismantling a massive hidden telecom network across the New York area — a system investigators say could have crippled cell towers, jammed 911 calls and flooded networks with chaos at the very moment the city was most vulnerable.

The cache, made up of more than 300 SIM servers packed with over 100,000 SIM cards and clustered within 35 miles of the United Nations, represents one of the most sweeping communications threats uncovered on U.S. soil. Investigators warn the system could have blacked out cellular service in a city that relies on it not only for daily life but for emergency response and counterterrorism.

Coming as foreign leaders filled midtown hotels and motorcades clogged Manhattan, officials say the takedown highlights a new frontier of risk: plots aimed at the invisible infrastructure that keeps a modern city connected.

The network was uncovered as part of a broader Secret Service investigation into telecommunications threats targeting senior government officials, according to investigators. Spread across multiple sites, the servers functioned like banks of mock cellphones, able to generate mass calls and texts, overwhelm local networks and mask encrypted communications criminals, officials said.

""It can't be understated what this system is capable of doing,"" said Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office. ""It can take down cell towers, so then no longer can people communicate, right? .... You can't text message, you can't use your cell phone. And if you coupled that with some sort of other event associated with UNGA, you know, use your imagination there, it could be catastrophic to the city.""

Officials said they haven't uncovered a direct plot to disrupt the U.N. General Assembly and note there are no known credible threats to New York City.

Forensic analysis is still in its early stages, but agents believe nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries — used the system to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations, McCool said. Authorities have not disclosed details on the specific government or criminal groups tied to the network at this point.

""We need to do forensics on 100,000 cell phones, essentially all the phone calls, all the text messages, anything to do with communications, see where those numbers end up,"" McCool said, noting that the process will take time.

When agents entered the sites, they found rows of servers and shelves stacked with SIM cards. More than 100,000 were already active, investigators said, but there were also large numbers waiting to be deployed, evidence that operators were preparing to double or even triple the network's capacity, McCool said. He described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise, one that cost millions of dollars in hardware and SIM cards alone.

The operation had the capability of sending up to 30 million text messages a minute, McCool said.

""The U.S. Secret Service's protective mission is all about prevention, and this investigation makes it clear to potential bad actors that imminent threats to our protectees will be immediately investigated, tracked down and dismantled,"" the agency's director, Sean Curran, said in a statement.

Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. In this case, he said, attackers would have been able to force that kind of shutdown at a time of their choosing.

""Could there be others?"" said McCool, ""It'd be unwise to think that there's not other networks out there being made in other cities in the United States.""

In this article

Crypto infrastructure startup Zerohash has raised $104 million in funding with backing from financial firms including Morgan Stanley and SoFi, CNBC has learned.

The Series D round was led by Interactive Brokers, the global automated trading firm, and includes strategic investors who are also clients of Zerohash, founder and CEO Edward Woodford told CNBC in an interview. The company is valued at $1 billion, he said.

""We wanted to raise from the largest, most trusted brands in the world and have that be the bridge into this new technology,"" he said.

Funds managed by Apollo also participated in the round, according to Zerohash.

The startup is among a wave of firms, both publicly traded and privately held, taking advantage of the more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies under President Donald Trump.

After Trump took office this year, the government flipped from being highly skeptical of crypto under former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler to embracing it as a nascent technology.

Suddenly, the CEOs of financial firms including Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were expressing confidence that they would get involved. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto told CNBC in April that he was ready to bring crypto trading back after the regulatory shift.

Founded in 2017, Zerohash provides banks and fintech firms with the ability to offer blockchain-based products in three major areas: crypto trading, stablecoins and tokenization, according to Woodford.

""Part of this raise is obviously accelerating [adoption] across all three of those verticals with a range of customers who are also investors,"" he said.

Interactive Brokers already uses Zerohash for crypto trading and custody and will launch a stablecoin product with the firm, Woodford said.

While Woodford said he couldn't comment on whether Morgan Stanley and SoFi were also clients, he suggested announcements will be coming. Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and SoFi declined to comment.

""These groups aren't VCs,"" Woodford said. ""You can assume that there's obviously a couple of announcements coming down the road with these other investors.""

Later Tuesday, Morgan Stanley said in a memo obtained by CNBC that it was close to offering crypto trading though its E-Trade division with the help of Zerohash.

Tom Brady struck a partnership with robotic massage device maker Aescape to provide the company with exclusive rights to his recovery and longevity protocols, Aescape announced on Tuesday.

As part of the deal Brady has been given the title of chief innovation officer for the company. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

Brady's business partner Alex Spiro will also join Aescape, as a strategic advisor. They will support both product development and Aescape's growth into capital markets, the company said.

Brady, a 7-time Super Bowl champion, played in the NFL until age 45 and is arguably one of the best quarterbacks to ever play in the league. He attributes much of his success and longevity to his training and recovery efforts. Aescape will work with the MVP to integrate his daily routines into its personalized robotics platform.

""After 23 years playing professionally, there's no way I could have accomplished what I did professionally without all the massage work and recovery protocols,"" Brady told CNBC. ""The reason why I'm still able to do what I love to do is because of the bodywork, the care that I received on a daily and weekly basis, and I want to try to make that available for everybody.""

Aescape was founded in 2017 by entrepreneur Eric Litman. The New York-based company uses AI technology to provide a fully automated and customizable massage. It has more than 100 locations and has delivered more than 25,000 massages using its automated robots.

Aescape's partners include high-end fitness company Equinox and select Four Seasons, Marriott, and Ritz-Carlton hotel properties across North America. The company is backed by $130 million in funding from investors that include Valor Siren Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, BroadLight Capital, Crosslink Capital and AlleyCorp.

""Our bodies are these machines that need significant ongoing maintenance, and with better maintenance and better care, they can last substantially longer,"" said Litman, Aescape's CEO.

Litman said he has seen firsthand the growth of massages in consumers' habits. He said Aescape is an attractive option for many customers because it's lower in cost (starting around $30 per service), you don't have to shower before or after a session, and treatments can be shorter than a traditional massage.

For Spiro, an investor and attorney, the focus is on Aescape's scale and growth plan — whether it's in the football training room, internationally or one day getting massage robots into people's homes.

""As the machine's price comes down and this company becomes better known, it will democratize access so that everyday people can use it, get their backs better, return to work, and allow us to do something really good for society,"" he said.

In this article

Amazon and the Federal Trade Commission are squaring off in a long-awaited trial over whether the company duped users into paying for Prime memberships.

The lawsuit, filed by the FTC in June 2023 under the Biden administration, alleges that Amazon deceived tens of millions of customers into signing up for its Prime subscription program and sabotaged their attempts to cancel it. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing.

The trial is being held in a federal court in Seattle, Amazon's backyard. Jury selection began Monday and opening arguments are slated for Tuesday, with the trial expected to last about a month.

Launched in 2005, Amazon's Prime program has grown to become one of the most popular subscription services in the world, with more than 200 million members globally, and it has generated billions of dollars for the company. Membership costs $139 a year and includes perks like free shipping and access to streaming content. Data has shown that Prime members spend more and shop more often than non-Prime members.

Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos famously said the company wanted Prime ""to be such a good value, you'd be irresponsible not to be a member.""

Regulators argue Amazon broke competition and consumer protection laws by tricking customers into subscribing to Prime. They pointed to examples like a button on its site that instructed users to complete their transaction and did not clearly state they were also agreeing to join Prime for a recurring subscription.

""Millions of consumers accidentally enrolled in Prime without knowledge or consent, but Amazon refused to fix this known problem, described internally by employees as an 'unspoken cancer' because clarity adjustments would lead to a drop in subscribers,"" the agency wrote in a court filing last week.

The FTC says the cancellation process is equally confusing, requiring users to navigate four webpages and choose from 15 options — a ""labyrinthian mechanism"" that the company referred to internally as ""Iliad,"" referencing Homer's epic poem about the Trojan War.

Amazon has argued that the Prime sign-up and cancellation processes are ""clear and simple,"" adding that the company has ""always been transparent about Prime's terms.""

""Occasional customer frustrations and mistakes are inevitable — especially for a program as popular as Amazon Prime,"" the company wrote in a recent court filing. ""Evidence that a small percentage of customers misunderstood Prime enrollment or cancellation does not prove that Amazon violated the law.""

The FTC notched an early win in the case last week when U.S. District Court Judge John Chun ruled Amazon and two senior executives violated the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act by gathering Prime members' billing information before disclosing the terms of the service.

Chun also said that the two senior Amazon executives would be individually liable if a jury sides with the FTC due to the level of oversight they maintained over the Prime enrollment and cancellation process.

Amazon's Prime boss, Jamil Ghani, and Neil Lindsay, a senior vice president in its health division who previously oversaw Prime's technology and business operations, are named defendants in the complaint.

Russell Grandinetti, Amazon senior vice president of international consumer, is also named in the suit, but Chun argued he had ""less involvement in the operation of the Prime organization"" compared with Ghani and Lindsay.

Chun also scolded attorneys for Amazon in July for withholding thousands of documents from the FTC and abusing a legal privilege to shield them from scrutiny. Among the documents was a 2020 email where Amazon's retail chief, Doug Herrington, said ""subscription driving"" was a ""shady"" practice and referred to Bezos as the company's ""chief dark arts officer.""

Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay told CNBC in a statement, ""The bottom line is that neither Amazon nor the individual defendants did anything wrong — we remain confident that the facts will show these executives acted properly and we always put customers first.""

The company also faces a separate lawsuit brought by the FTC in 2023 accusing it of wielding an illegal monopoly. That case is set to go to trial in February 2027.

The Prime case is part of the FTC's broader crackdown on so-called dark patterns, which it began examining in 2022. The phrase refers to deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward buying products or services or giving up their privacy.

The agency brought a similar dark patterns lawsuit against Uber in April, accusing the ride-hailing and delivery company of deceptive billing and cancellation practices tied to its Uber One subscription service. Uber has disputed the FTC's allegations.

Earlier this year, it reached settlements with online dating service Match and online education firm Chegg over claims that their subscription practices were deceptive or hard to cancel.

U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to place $100,000 fees on H-1B visa applications will disproportionately harm America's startup space, founders and venture capitalists told CNBC this week.

H-1B visas — which allow companies to temporarily hire foreign workers in skilled occupations such as IT, healthcare and engineering — were already difficult to secure for U.S. startups, due to limited annual quotas. 

Over the past year, Desmond Lim, CEO and co-founder of HR, payroll and hiring tech platform Workstream, said all of his startup's H1-B applications had been rejected — something he called ""very disappointing"" as he tries to secure more top engineering talent.

The year prior, however, Workstream did secure a couple of H-1B hires that Lim told CNBC were ""life changing, both for the employees and for the company.""

""As an early-stage startup, every hire is precious, and we only choose the best to go through the H-1B program, because it not only costs money, but also takes time,"" he added. 

Now, securing this talent is set to become even harder. The White House plans to require companies to pay a $100,000 fee when submitting petitions for new H-1B visas, though many details remain unclear.

Lim said the fee would be too high to justify for early-stage companies like his, complicating recruitment strategies.

Lim's not alone in his concern — startups across the country, along with workers on H1B visas, have been left worrying about the implications of the new fees. 

Alma, a San Francisco-based legal tech startup that provides immigration advice to professionals and other startups, told CNBC it had seen a 100x spike in inquiries since the White House's declaration on Friday. 

""Over the past couple of days, clients have been scared and anxious, because the size of their companies suggests that they won't be able to pay $100,000 and compete in terms of salaries,"" Alma founder and CEO Aizada Marat said. 

Alma not only advises companies on hiring H-1B talent, but also hires candidates under the program itself. 

""The main problem becomes: is there enough local supply to meet demand if this international talent goes away?"" Marat questioned. Startups often rely on finding ""undiscovered"" foreign talent to gain an edge over larger competitors, she added.

Marat said she had been advising companies to wait for more clarity on the H-1B visa changes before altering hiring strategies. 

Venture capitalists and innovation experts agreed that startups will be hit hardest by H-1B visa fees. 

A $100,000 fee ""disproportionately hurts early-stage startups,"" as they lack the resources of large incumbents to absorb the cost and rely on global talent to scale, Alexandre Lazarow, managing partner of Fluent Ventures, told CNBC in an email.

He added that startups often struggle to hire the engineers and specialists they need locally, but choose to import talent through immigration, rather than building remote teams outside the country.

Meanwhile, Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, argued that just a few talented employees from overseas can often be a deciding factor in a startup's success. 

Foreign talent can also help startups establish stronger overseas networks and customer bases, he added. 

Opponents of the H-1B visa program argue that it removes job opportunities for U.S. nationals. But an unintended consequence of the $100,000 fee could be a reduction in entrepreneurship and venture capital funding more broadly.  

A 2020 survey found that startups hiring workers through the H-1B visa process were associated with an increase in the likelihood of obtaining external funding, going public or being acquired, and of making innovative breakthroughs.

Now, the new fee could ""dampen PE and VC appetite for early-stage U.S. names that rely heavily on H-1B workers, many of whom may now look abroad to secure their careers rather than risk further uncertainty in the U.S.,"" Crossbridge Capital's Chief Investment Officer Manish Singh told CNBC in an email Monday. 

Singh added that changes to the visa program could instead create a stronger case for investors to deploy capital into markets such as the U.K., Canada and Europe. 

""U.S. startups may experience reduced funding momentum, while Europe could see a relative uplift in both talent inflows and investor attention,"" he added. 

Many markets, including in Europe, have been reporting problems with ""brain-drain"" in recent years, referring to a phenomenon where skilled and educated workers emigrate to seek better opportunities in countries such as the U.S. 

This movement is often associated with the development of high-skilled industries and entrepreneurship in the receiving country.

Now, uncertainty surrounding U.S. immigration, including the H-1 B development, could be a real turning point for tech talent that has been on the fence about moving to the U.S., said Laura Willming, head of people and talent at Octopus Ventures, one of Europe's most active venture capital investors. 

Talented individuals who once saw the U.S. as the obvious destination are now seriously considering other markets, such as the U.K. and Europe, to build their careers, she added.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development upgraded its global economic growth forecast on Tuesday, with many economies appearing more resilient than expected so far this year.

The OECD now expects global growth of 3.2% this year, compared to the 2.9% expansion it had forecast in June. Expectations for 2026 were unchanged at 2.9%. This would mark a slowdown from the 3.3% growth seen in 2024.

Growth expectations for the U.S. were also lifted, to 1.8% for 2025, compared to June's 1.6% estimate. This still marks a significant fall from 2024's 2.8% growth, however. The organization forecasts 1.5% growth for the U.S. in 2026.

""Global growth was more resilient than anticipated in the first half of 2025, especially in many emerging-market economies,"" the organisation said in a new report.

""Industrial production and trade were supported by front-loading ahead of higher tariffs. Strong AI-related investment boosted outcomes in the United States and fiscal support in China outweighed the drag from trade headwinds and property market weakness,"" it noted.

Alvaro Pereira, chief economist of the OECD, on Tuesday told CNBC's Charlotte Reed that individual economic events in emerging markets including Brazil, Indonesia and India also boosted the world economy.

""But to be honest with you, for most of our forecasts we have not changed significantly the forecast for virtually all the G20 countries and we still expect a slowing in the second part of the year after this front loading took place in the first quarter,"" he said.

The OECD warned, however, that ""significant risks to the economic outlook remain,"" as investment and trade continue to be hit by high levels of policy uncertainty and elevated tariffs.

Sweeping duties on goods entering the U.S. came into effect in August after months of policy changes, temporary pauses, and threats from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Countries and regions around the world now face tariff rates as high as 50% on their exports to the U.S., with some still trying to negotiate trade frameworks.

""US bilateral tariff rates have increased on almost all countries since May. The overall effective US tariff rate rose to an estimated 19.5% at the end of August, the highest rate since 1933,"" the OECD said.

""The full effects of tariff increases have yet to be felt – with many changes being phased in over time and companies initially absorbing some tariff increases through margins – but are becoming increasingly visible in spending choices, labour markets and consumer prices,"" it added.

Labour markets are showing signs of softening as some countries see higher unemployment and fewer job openings, according to the report, while the disinflation process appears to have flattened.

The OECD's Pereira said that ""the tariff shock is bringing more inflationary pressures in many countries.""

""We expect it will be additional price impacts for firms not only in the United States but other parts of the world too,"" he said.

The OECD now expects headline inflation to amount to 3.4% across G20 countries in 2025, slightly lower than June's 3.6% projection. Inflation expectations for the U.S. were revised down more sharply, with the OECD now forecasting price rises of 2.7% in 2025, down from the previous 3.2% forecast.

Looking ahead, further tariff increases and a return of inflationary pressures were flagged in the organization's report as two key risks, alongside growing concerns about the fiscal situation and the possibility of repricing in financial markets.

""High and volatile crypto-asset valuations also raise financial stability risks given growing interconnectedness with the traditional financial system. On the upside, reductions in trade restrictions or faster development and adoption of artificial intelligence technologies could strengthen growth prospects,"" the OECD noted.

In this article

Major global semiconductor stocks rose on Tuesday after Nvidia announced plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI.

The deal between Nvidia and OpenAI is on a large scale. The artificial intelligence lab plans to build and deploy Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, which is equivalent to 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, or GPUs, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

The news sparked a rally on Wall Street, with positive sentiment flowing through to the global chip sector and especially touching companies with ties to Nvidia.

In Taiwan, shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which manufactures chips for Nvidia, closed 3.5% higher.

In South Korea, SK Hynix, whose memory chips are used in Nvidia's systems, saw its shares end the session more than 2.5% higher. Rival Samsung also closed up 1.4%. Samsung does not yet supply Nvidia with its high-bandwidth memory chips, but markets are hoping that the company will gain the green light to do so imminently.

Equipment suppliers, such as Tokyo Electron which is listed in Japan, was also higher at the close of trade in the country.

""Ultimately this is a broad market with lots of suppliers. It certainly isn't a zero-sum game with only one winner, and indeed it appears investors are recognising that,"" Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC.

""While this deal may be negative in the short-term for Nvidia's competitors, it is a sign that the AI trade is a alive and well.""

The chip stock rally in Asia filtered through to Europe, where the picture was nevertheless a little more mixed.

STMicro, Infineon and BE Semiconductor were all higher in early trade in Europe.

However, semiconductor equipment firm ASM International said it expected its fourth-quarter revenue to come in below previous expectations, sharply weighing on shares. The news also dragged down other chip equipment names such as ASML, whose machines are required to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in the world.

""In Europe, the strengthening of the AI ecosystem is particularly beneficial to equipment manufacturers"" including ASML and ASMI, ""which will all benefit at some point from solid demand from TSMC who is the manufacturer of NVIDIA advanced chips,"" Stephane Houri, head of equity research at ODDO BHF, said in a note to clients Tuesday.

U.S. Treasury yields were relatively unchanged on Tuesday as investors look ahead to remarks due out from central bank officials this week, including a speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell expected later in the day.

The 10-year Treasury yield was less than one basis point lower at 4.139%. The 2-year Treasury yield was flat at 3.601%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield rose less than a basis point to 4.764%.

One basis point equals 0.01%, and yields and prices share an inverse relationship.

One of the key economic updates expected this week is the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index — the Federal Reserve's favored inflation measure — which should give a glimpse of inflationary pressures and the state of the broader U.S. economy.

Last week, the Fed delivered its first rate cut of the year, meeting market expectations by lowering its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point.

""Given there haven't been material data developments since last week's press conference, our US economists expect his tone to align closely with his remarks last week,"" Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a research note.

The Fed's ""dovish shift"" during the September assembly of the Federal Open Market Meeting Committee should be positive for interest rate markets over the next several months, said global asset manager Eastspring Investments in a note published Tuesday.

Shares of Danish renewables giant Orsted jumped on Tuesday, after a U.S. judge ruled the embattled firm can resume construction of an offshore wind farm that was halted by the Trump administration.

The decision means Orsted can resume work on the nearly completed Revolution Wind project off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company were among the top performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index during morning deals. The stock price, which notched a fresh record low last month, was last seen up around 6.6%.

The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Monday granted a preliminary injunction sought by Orsted to overturn the Trump administration's stop-work order, allowing construction on Revolution Wind to resume while the lawsuit progresses.

Orsted on Monday said it would start work on the project ""as soon as possible.""

The company's shares have tumbled 22.4% this year amid the Trump administration's more aggressive stance towards renewables. 

On Sept. 5, the Danish firm cut its full-year operating profit outlook following lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds during July and August. Orsted also received approval from shareholders for an emergency 60 billion Danish krone ($9.48 billion) rights issue to raise capital. Norwegian energy group Equinor said it would pledge almost $1 billion of fresh capital as part of the fundraising. 

The court victory represents a significant reprieve for the Danish company, which has been hit hard by U.S. President Donald Trump's hardline stance on offshore wind projects.

Since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has clamped down on the wind power industry. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order suspending new or renewed onshore and offshore wind leases.

The U.S. president, who is championing America's oil and gas industries, told reporters in January that his administration was ""not going to do the wind thing.""

The Department of Transportation last month said it was withdrawing $679 million of funding for a dozen infrastructure projects that support offshore wind development and would instead redirect the money to upgrade existing ports and other infrastructure, where possible.

In this article

ABILENE, Texas – Sam Altman had a deadline. OpenAI's CEO was headed to Texas to unveil his company's next big infrastructure push, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wanted in on the action.

Through a series of hurried negotiations, late-night calls and last-minute contract tweaks, the two giants of artificial intelligence struck a $100 billion partnership on Monday, hours before Altman boarded his flight to Abilene, a city of about 130,000 residents roughly 180 miles west of Dallas.

It helped that Huang and Altman had been part of President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. a week earlier, allowing the president to be briefed on the agreement days in advance. 

The deal, which Huang described to CNBC as ""monumental in size,"" marks a watershed moment in the tech industry, as capital and influence are increasingly concentrated in the hands of the two companies closest to the heart of the artificial intelligence boom.

Huang now presides over the world's most valuable public company, worth nearly $4.5 trillion after gaining $170 billion following Monday's announcement, while Altman runs the most prominent startup on the planet, valued at half a trillion dollars.

OpenAI's ascent to the forefront of generative AI has relied on Nvidia's high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs). Now the companies are more intimately linked than ever, as they plan to carve a path to jointly building the next wave of AI supercomputing facilities.

""You should expect a lot from us in the coming months,"" Altman told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview at Nvidia's Silicon Valley headquarters on Monday. ""There are three things that OpenAI has to do well: we have to do great AI research, we have to make these products people want to use, and we have to figure out how to do this unprecedented infrastructure challenge.""

Altman and Huang negotiated their pact largely through a mix of virtual discussions and one-on-one meetings in London, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., with no bankers involved, according to people close to the talks who declined to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.

The arrangement calls for Nvidia to invest $10 billion at a time in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. As the buildout unfolds, Nvidia will also supply the cutting-edge processors powering a host of new data centers.

While OpenAI gets more intimate with Nvidia, it has to maneuver through a number of high-stakes relationships with other key partners.

OpenAI only informed Microsoft, its principal shareholder and primary cloud provider, a day before the deal was signed, the people familiar with the matter said. Earlier this year, Microsoft lost its status as OpenAI's exclusive provider of computing capacity.

The pact also comes less than two weeks after a disclosure from Oracle indicated that OpenAI agreed to spend $300 billion in computing power with the company over about five years, starting in 2027. At the start of the year, OpenAI joined Stargate, a multibillion-dollar project announced by President Trump and backed by Oracle and SoftBank, to build out next-generation AI infrastructure.

Going forward, all of OpenAI's infrastructure projects will fall under the Stargate umbrella.

Representatives from Microsoft, Oracle and SoftBank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Nvidia and OpenAI provided scant details about where and when the buildout will take place, other than to say that the first of the 10 gigawatt sites will go online in the back half of next year.

Executives said they've reviewed between 700 and 800 potential locations since unveiling Stargate in January. In the months that followed, they fielded a flood of proposals from developers across North America offering land, power, and facilities. That list has been narrowed as OpenAI weighs energy availability, permitting timelines, and financing terms, the company said.

In Monday's announcement, OpenAI described Nvidia as a ""preferred"" partner. But executives told CNBC that it's not an exclusive relationship, and the company is continuing to work with large cloud companies and other chipmakers to avoid being locked in to a single vendor.

For Nvidia, the investment in OpenAI is historic in size, but it's just a big piece of a rapidly expanding portfolio.

Last week, Nvidia put $5 billion into Intel as part of a joint venture to co-develop data center and PC chips with the troubled chipmaker. Nvidia also said it invested close to $700 million in U.K. data center startup Nscale, a move that resembles Nvidia's backing of U.S. AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave, which held its IPO in March.

The financing structure for the OpenAI deal is designed to avoid hefty dilution. The initial $10 billion tranche is locked in at a $500 billion valuation and expected to close within a month or so once the transaction has been finalized, people familiar with the matter said. Nine successive $10 billion rounds are planned, each to be priced at the company's then-current valuation as new capacity comes online, they said.

The relationship between Nvidia and OpenAI long predates the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.

Back when OpenAI was still a small nonprofit research lab and Nvidia was best known for building graphics chips for video games, Huang personally delivered his company's first DGX supercomputer to OpenAI's office in 2016. At the time, the startup was located in San Francisco's Mission District, in a building that's now home to Elon Musk's xAI.

Almost a decade and trillions of dollars in value later, Huang and Altman are perhaps the most significant power players in the tech industry.

In October of last year, Nvidia formalized its financial stake in OpenAI, joining a $6.6 billion funding round that valued the company at $157 billion. A month later, in Tokyo, OpenAI executives met with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son to brainstorm what to call their next phase of expansion. Out of that session came ""Stargate,"" a codename that has since become shorthand for OpenAI's most ambitious buildout plans.

Stargate now encompasses every major deal for compute capacity, including this week's partnership with Nvidia. Securing the rights to the name required some careful maneuvering, but OpenAI has embraced it as the banner for its long-term infrastructure strategy.

The $100 billion commitment from Nvidia represents only part of what's required for the planned 10-gigawatt buildout. OpenAI will lease Nvidia's chips for deployment, but financing the broader effort will require other avenues. Executives have called equity the most expensive way to fund data centers, and they say the startup is preparing to take on debt to cover the remainder of the expansion. 

As OpenAI's compute necessities increase, a big question is where the company will host its workloads, which have to date been largely housed in Microsoft Azure. Taking the work in-house would push OpenAI closer to operating as a first-party cloud provider, a market led by Amazon Web Services, followed by Azure, Google and Oracle.

Executives have openly floated the idea, suggesting it may not be far off. Some even indicated to CNBC that a commercial cloud offering could emerge within a year or two, once OpenAI has secured enough compute to cover its own needs. For now, demand for training frontier models leaves little capacity to spare, but OpenAI isn't done looking for new opportunities.

As Altman and Huang hammered out details of the arrangement that was announced this week, OpenAI's infrastructure team was in Tokyo meeting with SoftBank's Son to discuss broader financing and manufacturing support.

The parallel talks underscored the scale of Altman's ambition, and the web of global players now involved in bringing it to life.

In this article

BYD has a backup plan if it gets cut off from the Nvidia chips it currently uses in its cars, a top executive at the Chinese electric carmaker told CNBC on Tuesday.

Stella Li, executive vice president at BYD, said the company had not received any directive from the Chinese government to stop using Nvidia chips — but if it did, it has a plan B.

""Everybody has a backup. BYD has [a] backup,"" Li told CNBC's Dan Murphy.

Li declined to expand on what the plan is, but she pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic during which there was a global shortage of semiconductors which badly affected the auto sector. BYD had ""no issue"" at the time because it developed a lot of its technology in-house, he said, so it was able to source alternatives quickly.

Indeed, BYD has sought to have control over large parts of its supply chain, from manufacturing its own cars to developing its own batteries.

""We have a lot of strong ... even deeper technology in-house, so we always have backup,"" Li said.

Nvidia, whose chips underpin much of the world's artificial intelligence development, has been caught in the crossfire amid U.S.-China tensions. The company's H20 AI chip — designed specifically to comply with U.S. export restrictions to China — was first banned, then permitted to be sold in China this year after a revenue-share deal between Washington and Nvidia.

Now, China has reportedly been discouraging local tech firms from buying Nvidia's AI chips.

Nvidia designs an entirely different set of semiconductors for cars, however.

One of Nvidia's systems, Nvidia Drive AGX Orin, is designed to enable cars to carry out some driving tasks autonomously. BYD is a customer of this product.

There is no indication so far that the Chinese government is looking to ban this Nvidia system.

Li said BYD had not been told to stop using any Nvidia products, adding it was unlikely that Beijing would ban the U.S. firm's auto chips.

""I don't think any country will do that, because this automatic will kill Nvidia,"" Li said. ""So Nvidia now is the highest market value company, so if they lose the big market from China ... nobody wants to see this.""

 Neal Stephenson's Lamina1 teamed up with Consensys' Linea to launch Spaces, a platform for creator-owned IP and interactive storytelling on Ethereum. 

Lamina1, the blockchain content platform founded by sci-fi author Neal Stephenson, has partnered with Consensys' layer-2 network Linea to bring creator-owned media to Ethereum.

The collaboration aims to change digital storytelling by giving creators control over their intellectual property and a direct channel to their communities, according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph. 

The partnership includes investments from Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, as well as Systemic Ventures. “Neal Stephenson is one of the leading figures in cyberpunk,” Lubin said. “Lamina1 is now perfectly positioned to be at the forefront of the onchain revolution in content creation,” he added. 

Launched in 2022, Lamina1 aims to enable artists, writers and developers to maintain control of their intellectual property while involving fans in the creative process. The platform has seen over 150,000 active addresses since its launch.

The debut product on Linea is called Spaces, which will serve as a home for interactive story-driven worlds and creator-controlled IP. 

The first project within Spaces is Artefact, developed by Stephenson, Weta Workshop and the Lamina1 team. Described as a role-playing experience in a post-AI world, Artefact will allow players to join competing factions, collect data fragments and shape the unfolding narrative.

“Linea's zkEVM offers an ideal environment for creator-driven platforms like Lamina1's Spaces due to fast, inexpensive, and secure blockspace that leverages Ethereum's decentralization, with fully EVM-compatible development, ZK-proofs for fast finality between Ethereum and Linea, and a flourishing onchain economy as the largest ZK-rollup,” said Declan Fox, vice president and head of Linea. 

Fox added that user data, digital assets and creative IP on Linea are protected by Verax, an attestation platform that allows creators to attach verifiable credentials to their works. “This robust infrastructure has already supported millions of attestations for use cases like Proof of Humanity,” he added. 

Linea's zkEVM technology is designed to handle scalable Ethereum applications with low fees and fast performance. The expansion follows Linea's recent Token Generation Event and signals growing momentum for creative applications in the Ethereum layer-2 space.

Earlier this month, Lubin hinted that long-term holders of the new LINEA token may receive future rewards. In a post on X, he suggested that holding tokens over time could qualify users for airdrops from Consensys or other projects in the ecosystem. 

The remarks came after community concerns about the utility of the LINEA token following its token generation event. One user called on the team to enable staking or lending to give the token real use, while others criticized the project, calling LINEA a “memecoin” with no clear value beyond speculation.

Key Points

It's helpful to stay abreast of how this asset tends to perform during the tail end of the year.

When enough investors see the same price action at the same time of year, their habits can echo through prices. Ethereum (ETH 0.21%) happens to have one of those habitual echoes late in the calendar year.

Let's take a look at what investors should be expecting from this coin in the fourth quarter.

Image source: Getty Images.

Traditionally, Q4 is the best-performing quarter for Ethereum, with the median return being around 22% and the average near 24%.

That tells us two things. First, late-year momentum has often been kind to holders, and second, the dispersion of results is wide enough that the median trails the average, which implies some very big upside outliers.

With that being said, it's important to be precise about what this means. Seasonality is a tendency shown by an asset's past performance, and it's just one factor among many others affecting prices. There have been Q4 drawdowns, including a couple of extremely sharp ones in the ballpark of 40% in both 2016 and 2018, and there will be more eventually.

Ethereum is also a very different asset in 2025 than in prior years, and thus it is to be expected that it'll perform somewhat differently with regard to its seasonality.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved applications in May 2024 to list spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs), opening the door for mainstream brokerage accounts to allocate without learning new plumbing. Those same ETFs also heralded an increasing degree of the coin's integration with the traditional financial system as asset managers began to accumulate it. Now, with crypto treasury companies being formed with the sole intent of buying and holding Ethereum, there's a new crop of investors affecting the coin's float as well.

Therefore, the investors whose actions were responsible for creating the historical price behaviors in the fourth quarter may not be as relevant this time around. The new players on the scene, primarily asset managers and treasurers, have a lot more capital to throw around, and much longer investing horizons than the average buyer of the era before they arrived.

There are other trends indicating that Q4 is likely to be a good one for Ethereum, in keeping with its historical performance during the period.

The biggest structural driver of demand for the coin in the near term, and thus higher prices, is asset tokenization. You can think of tokenization as the process of recording the ownership of real-world assets -- like U.S. Treasuries, vehicles, commodities, or stock shares -- on a blockchain as tokens, so that the underlying assets can settle faster, move 24/7, and be used more flexibly as collateral for other purposes.

Many of the largest tokenized asset programs are already running on Ethereum. That's why it has more than $8.3 billion in tokenized asset value parked on its chain. This is up by an impressive 7.5% over the last 30-day period ending on Sept. 18 alone, and constituting a share of 31% of the total value of tokenized assets which currently exists. With more high-grade assets living on its chain, the case for Ethereum's role in institutional finance strengthens. That can support more demand for the asset over multi-year horizons, as well as right now.

But what should an investor do with that information? Don't try to time the market, for one. Remember, seasonality isn't something to hang your portfolio's value on.

If you wait for a perfect bargain, you may end up watching from the sidelines while history plays out. There may well be a dip to buy this coin sometime in the next four months, but don't count on it. There aren't any major competitive threats to it that will be relevant to the price in that timeframe, and the possibility of macroeconomic weakness causing a sell-off, while real, is not probable enough to bet on right now.

A more practical path is to start buying Ethereum deliberately, ideally via a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) plan, and holding it for years rather than months. If Q4 performs like its median, you will be glad you owned it. If it doesn't, the long-term tokenization story is still very much intact, and you'll just need to wait a bit longer for it to pay off.

The crypto market has experienced a notable downturn over the past week, and is trading flat on the day. However, a handful of altcoins are defying this move, with some even posting double-digit gains on the day.

The biggest winner of the day is Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, which climbed 12.1% on the day to a $5.9 billion market cap as the 37th largest cryptocurrency. The double-digit jump follows Mantle's partnership with centralized exchange Bybit, which offers higher leverage rates and better loan terms for institutional investors.

Another notable altcoin winner is Avalanche, which jumped 10.7% on the day and 12% over the past week to a $14.5 billion market cap, making it the 15th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko. It comes the day after a Bitcoin mining firm rebranded to AVAX One and bought $550 million worth of the token in a digital asset treasury pivot, causing its stock to leap 200%.

On top of this, Avalanche recorded $4.29 billion in trading volume on Monday and $4.46 billion on Friday, the highest for the token since December 2023, per CoinGlass. On Monday, AVAX experienced a spot daily inflow of $6.67 million and a futures daily inflow of $80.44 million.

No other top 100 cryptocurrency outside of Mantle and Avalanche has made a double-digit move.

Another cryptocurrency posting significant gains is Aster, a new perpetual futures decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, which has been tipped to rival the ever-popular Hyperliquid. Its ASTER token has jumped 7% in the past 24 hours, taking it to a $2.8 billion market cap and making it the 56th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko.

Aster's move appears to be tied to the exchange's total value locked spiking from $378 million last week to $1.46 billion at the time of writing, per DefiLlama. It also claims to have hit $6 billion in perp trading volume on Monday.

Users of Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, believe that Aster has a 67% chance of continuing its move upwards from $1.70 to $2 by the end of the month.

The fourth largest gainer of the day is AI project NEAR (up 4.2%), followed by Cronos' CRO (up 4.2%), and layer-1 network Stellar (up 3.3%).

Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading flat following a dramatic start to the week which saw $1.6 billion worth of liquidations across the crypto market on Monday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoin OI Crash Signals Market Stress Beyond Bitcoin","https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-oi-crash-signals-stress-beyond-bitcoin-8b/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:30:53 GMT","

Altcoins are facing a crucial test after the broader crypto market experienced a sharp selloff triggered by leveraged liquidations. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, slipped below the $4,200 level, signaling weakness across the sector. Meanwhile, Solana and several other major altcoins shed more than 10% of their value within hours, underscoring the speed and intensity of the correction.

This wave of liquidations has fueled debate among investors and analysts about whether the market is entering a deeper corrective phase or simply resetting before another leg higher. With billions of dollars wiped from altcoin valuations in a single session, the event has heightened uncertainty and left traders on edge.

Top analyst Maartunn highlighted that the Altcoin flush accelerates, pointing to the scale of liquidations as evidence that overleveraged positions are being forced out of the market. While painful in the short term, such resets are often viewed as healthy for long-term price stability, flushing out excess speculation.

According to data shared by top analyst Maartunn, altcoins faced one of their most severe flushes in months as $8.0 billion in open interest was wiped out in a matter of hours. By comparison, Bitcoin saw a much smaller reduction of around $1.5 billion, highlighting the disproportionate impact the selloff had on altcoins. This means that traders, many of whom were highly leveraged, bore the brunt of the liquidation event.

The scale of the wipeout is telling. Altcoin open interest losses were more than five times greater than Bitcoin's, suggesting that speculative positions in the sector were far riskier and more vulnerable to sharp downside moves. While Bitcoin remains the market's anchor, the gap between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market is beginning to close, reflecting a shift in positioning and risk exposure.

For investors, this raises important questions. On one hand, such a dramatic flush often clears excess leverage from the system, paving the way for healthier price action in the medium term. On the other hand, the sheer scale of the altcoin losses could signal lingering fragility and the potential for further volatility if confidence does not return quickly.

The coming days will be decisive. Analysts are watching closely to see whether altcoins can stabilize around key support levels or whether bearish pressure will drive another leg lower. With Bitcoin showing relative resilience, altcoins must now prove they can withstand the shock and rebuild momentum in a market still reeling from billions in liquidations.

The chart of the total crypto market cap excluding the top 10 coins shows that the altcoin sector is at a decisive moment. Currently valued at around $305 billion, the market has recovered significantly from the lows of 2022 and 2023 but remains far from its historical peak above $600 billion.

Price action highlights that after a prolonged consolidation, altcoins have established a steady uptrend, supported by the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, which are now sloping upward. The 200-day moving average has flattened and begun to turn positive, further signaling improving structure in the broader market. Still, the recent rejection near the $320 billion resistance shows sellers remain active at higher levels.

The market's ability to sustain above $280 billion will be critical for maintaining bullish momentum. A break below could trigger deeper retracements, but holding above this zone suggests strength and potential for expansion.

Excluding top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this index reflects rising investor appetite for smaller-cap projects. The resilience of this sector despite recent volatility signals that risk appetite is returning. If broader conditions improve, altcoins outside the top 10 could lead the next phase of market growth.

Oops, something went wrong

The crypto market has experienced a notable downturn over the past week, and is trading flat on the day. However, a handful of altcoins are defying this move, with some even posting double-digit gains on the day.

The biggest winner of the day is Ethereum layer-2 network Mantle, which climbed 12.1% on the day to a $5.9 billion market cap as the 37th largest cryptocurrency. The double-digit jump follows Mantle's partnership with centralized exchange Bybit, which offers higher leverage rates and better loan terms for institutional investors.

Another notable altcoin winner is Avalanche, which jumped 10.7% on the day and 12% over the past week to a $14.5 billion market cap, making it the 15th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko. It comes the day after a Bitcoin mining firm rebranded to AVAX One and bought $550 million worth of the token in a digital asset treasury pivot, causing its stock to leap 200%.

On top of this, Avalanche recorded $4.29 billion in trading volume on Monday and $4.46 billion on Friday, the highest for the token since December 2023, per CoinGlass. On Monday, AVAX experienced a spot daily inflow of $6.67 million and a futures daily inflow of $80.44 million.

No other top 100 cryptocurrency outside of Mantle and Avalanche has made a double-digit move.

Another cryptocurrency posting significant gains is Aster, a new perpetual futures decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, which has been tipped to rival the ever-popular Hyperliquid. Its ASTER token has jumped 7% in the past 24 hours, taking it to a $2.8 billion market cap and making it the 56th largest cryptocurrency according to CoinGecko.

Aster's move appears to be tied to the exchange's total value locked spiking from $378 million last week to $1.46 billion at the time of writing, per DefiLlama. It also claims to have hit $6 billion in perp trading volume on Monday.

Users of Myriad, a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, believe that Aster has a 67% chance of continuing its move upwards from $1.70 to $2 by the end of the month.

How Bitcoin Options Traders Are Positioning Amid the Crypto Market Rout

The fourth largest gainer of the day is AI project NEAR (up 4.2%), followed by Cronos' CRO (up 4.2%), and layer-1 network Stellar (up 3.3%).

Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum are trading flat following a dramatic start to the week which saw $1.6 billion worth of liquidations across the crypto market on Monday.

Ripple's native token XRP (XRP) outpaced top altcoins in Tuesday morning's rebound, alongside gains in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), even as Solana (SOL) and Binance's BNB token (BNB) stayed in negative territory.

The recovery comes after U.S. lawmakers called on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins to help speed up the implementation of President Donald Trump's executive order that would allow crypto investments in 401(k) retirement plans. 

Bitcoin's price hovered just below $113,000, rising 0.4% on the day while sentiment stayed in the ‘neutral' zone. Ethereum's price rose 0.7% to about $4,188, though retail sentiment trended in ‘bearish' territory.

Bitcoin's drop to $113,000 drove futures open interest down to $42.8 billion from $44.8 billion, according to Glassnode. The on-chain analysis firm called the drop in leverage a “healthy reset” that can stabilize derivatives markets and limit liquidation risk. Monday alone saw over $1.68 billion in crypto futures positions liquidated as prices sank.

In the past 24 hours, crypto futures have seen roughly $357 million in liquidations, Coinglass data showed. Long positions accounted for about $223 million, while shorts totaled approximately $134 million.

XRP's price traded around $2.86, up 2.2% over the past 24 hours, even as retail sentiment on Stocktwits slipped to ‘bearish' from ‘neutral' territory. Dogecoin's price followed with a 1.3% gain and held at ‘neutral' sentiment over the past day. 

Meanwhile, Solana's price slipped 0.8% and BNB's price fell 2%, extending their declines even as the broader cryptocurrency market gained 0.2% over the last 24 hours.

Digital asset treasury (DAT) equities also rose in tandem with the cryptocurrency market in pre-market trading. The largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, Michael Saylor-backed Strategy (MSTR), rose around 0.56% and the largest publicly traded company with Ethereum on its balance sheet, Bitmine Immersive Technologies (BMNR), was up around 2%. 

Bitcoin miners like Marathon Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) were mixed. MARA's stock traded flat, while RIOT's stock edged 0.7% higher. Crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) rose 0.5%.

 Fnality raised $136 million in a round led by Bank of America, Citi and WisdomTree to expand its blockchain settlement network. 

London-based blockchain payments company Fnality secured $136 million in a Series C funding round backed by some of the world's largest financial institutions. 

Bank of America, Citi, KBC Group, Temasek, Tradeweb and WisdomTree led the round, joined by returning investors including Goldman Sachs, Santander, Barclays and UBS, according to a Tuesday announcement by the company. 

“The closing of our Series C reflects a shared conviction that the future of money demands a new foundation,” Fnality CEO Michelle Neal said. She added that the company's blockchain-based settlement systems offer “24/7 payment rails, real-time settlement, and enhanced liquidity.”

Fnality, which launched its sterling-denominated Fnality Payment System in the United Kingdom last year, aims to modernize wholesale payments through a blockchain-based infrastructure tied to central bank reserves. The new capital will help Fnality expand into the US dollar and euro markets, pending regulatory approvals, it said.

Fnality uses distributed ledger technology to simplify institutional settlements, enabling real-time repo, tokenized securities settlement and cross-currency payments. The goal is to connect traditional finance with tokenized markets while improving liquidity and reducing settlement risks. 

WisdomTree CEO Jonathan Steinberg described Fnality's platform as a “critical foundation” for tokenized finance. “Our investment in Fnality reflects our ambition to plug directly into the rapidly growing tokenized markets,” Steinberg added. 

Citi's head of digital strategy Deepak Mehra said that Fnality aligns with the bank's strategy to build more efficient, interoperable payment systems for digital assets.

In 2023, Fnality raised $95 million in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas, with participation from Euroclear, DTCC, WisdomTree and existing backer Nomura.

Fnality's recent raise comes amid growing interest in crypto payment rails. Last week, Google launched an open-source protocol that enables AI applications to send and receive payments, including stablecoin transactions, in collaboration with Coinbase, Salesforce, American Express and over 60 other partners. 

The system is designed to work with both traditional payment rails and emerging crypto options, reflecting the growing use of dollar-pegged stablecoins in AI-powered systems.

Furthermore, SBI Shinsei Bank has partnered with Singapore's Partior and Japan's DeCurret DCP to explore multicurrency tokenized deposits for cross-border settlements. The trio signed an MOU to develop a blockchain-based framework that enables real-time clearing across various currencies.

The U.K. company's Series C round, announced Tuesday (Sept. 23), was led by WisdomTree, Bank of America, Citi, KBC Group, Temasek and Tradeweb, with participation from investors that included Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Santander.

“This latest capital raise represents a significant milestone for Fnality and its mission to build a new global settlement network, enabled by distributed ledger technology, that bridges today's wholesale markets with the emerging world of institutional tokenized assets,” the company said in a news release.

The release adds that since launching the Sterling Fnality Payment System in the U.K. in 2023, the company has focused on extending its network's footprint to other major currencies, along with liquidity management solutions, and providing settlement interoperability for innovations like stablecoins and tokenized deposits.

“The closing of our Series C reflects a shared conviction that the future of money demands a new foundation, one with Fnality at its core,” said Michelle Neal, Fnality's CEO. “Our blockchain-based settlement systems, anchored in the credit quality of central bank money, connect traditional finance with the fast adoption of tokenized and decentralized markets.”

Neal told Bloomberg News that the company will use the funding to scale its payments infrastructure, promote product development and seek regulatory approvals in crucial markets.

As PYMNTS wrote earlier this month, tokenization “has emerged from a niche concept to a strategic imperative across financial services, increasingly underpinning payment security and the trading of real-world assets.”

JPMorgan Chase announced in June its plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that would function as a digital representation of commercial bank money, available only to the bank's institutional clients.

The launch came as the Senate passed the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025) Act, which would weeks later be signed into law.

Other banks followed suit, with HSBC announcing earlier this week that it was expanding its tokenized deposit service to include cross-border transactions.

As PYMNTS has written, tokenization offers benefits, such as security and fraud prevention, as network tokenization masks sensitive data and reduces fraud while increasing transaction approval rates. However, challenges remain, including technology and adoption gaps.

“Digital identity, on-chain privacy, smart contract security and cross-border infrastructure remain evolving areas,” PYMNTS wrote.

Oops, something went wrong

New York-based venture capital firm Archetype has raised $100 million for its third fund aimed at backing early-stage blockchain startups, the firm said.

The fund, called Archetype III, is supported by a mix of existing and new institutional investors, including pensions, academic endowments, sovereign wealth funds, and funds of funds.

Archetype has a track record of early bets that paid off. Privy, a crypto wallet startup in its portfolio, was acquired by Stripe earlier this year.

Another investment, US Bitcoin Corp, completed a merger with Hut 8, a move that brought the company into a joint venture tied to Eric Trump's American Bitcoin project.

The firm currently manages around $350 million in assets, including sizable stakes in Solana and Ethereum, according to the document.

While specific investments from the new fund haven't been disclosed, Archetype said several deals have already been made. The firm plans to focus on founders building real-world use cases that could bring crypto to broader consumer markets.

CoinDesk has reached out to Archetype for comment but hasn't heard back by press time.

Forget fridge magnets, American Express AXP is letting users turn their travels into blockchain collectibles that never fade.

​

U.S. cardholders can now earn ""beautifully designed"" digital collectibles that visually represent the countries they visit when they use their cards abroad, Amex announced on Sept. 15. The so-called stamps can be customized with trip highlights and shared with friends and family via text, the company said.

​

Amex said the stamps are stored as NFTs on the Coinbase-incubated COIN Ethereum Layer 2 Base, but have no monetary value and cannot be transferred. It is Amex's second collaboration with Coinbase in recent months. In June, Coinbase announced the Coinbase One Card, an Amex-powered credit card offering users up to 4% cash back in Bitcoin.

​

Meanwhile, Institutional digital asset custody solution provider Fireblocks said that it is the wallet-as-a-service provider for Amex Passport stamps, ""enabling Amex to provide Card Members with a blockchain wallet behind the scenes.""

​​

Amex Digital Labs Vice President Colin Marlowe told Benzinga that the company chose to use NFTs for its travel stamps to ensure durability of the collectibles. He also told Benzinga that Amex is covering blockchain fees on behalf of customers without detailing how.

The Amex Passport stamp is part of Amex's effort to enhance the travel experience of its users. The company launched the Amex Travel App on Sept. 18, allowing users to plan and book their trips in one place.

​​

A survey which informed the Amex Travel App showed that 73% of respondents wanted more ways to digitally commemorate their travels and 56% miss receiving passport stamps.

​

But the Amex Passport stamps are also accessible in the standard Amex mobile application.​ The Amex Passport stamp offers yet another instance highlighting Web3's subtle integration into the mainstream.

Introducing BasejumpBasejump serves as a multifaceted platform that connects players, creators, and digital assets across various channels including Discord, browsers, with future expansions planned for Telegram, Poki, and mobile platforms. Listed below are several features that set Basejump apart:

The broader vision of Basejump includes free avatars known as Solarpunks, which all account holders receive. These avatars can be upgraded through gameplay or direct purchases. They not only represent the player's identity across the ecosystem but also contribute to securing the ACTION AI gaming substrate, thereby earning further rewards.

Legacy and InnovationOriginating from the decentralized story world called Broadside launched on Ethereum in 2022, these concepts have developed into what are now known as Hyperobjects. These are AI-enhanced assets that are designed to operate across multiple games, blockchain environments, and even real-world applications, promoting continuous integration and interaction across the ecosystem.

While the ACTION token isn't currently available for purchasing, players can accumulate it by holding advanced Solarpunks, Broadside OGs, or by staking AO through Arweave's Permaweb Index. This strategic model aims to correlate player engagement with the long-term economic health and growth of the ecosystem.

The debut of BRAINROT: Battle Mode marks a significant milestone in the rollout of Basejump. This introduction not only invites players into exhilarating battles but also into a larger, interconnected ecosystem where their avatars, items, and rewards transition smoothly between linked universes, enriching the overall gaming experience.

Coinbase Institutional has introduced a new futures contract called the Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures, marking a significant development in the world of institutional investing. This contract bundles exposure to major technology stocks, known as the “Magnificent 7,” and crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) into a single product. The new product is available on Coinbase Derivatives, the firm's regulated futures exchange.

The contract is designed to provide institutional investors with diversified exposure to both traditional equities and crypto assets, without the need to hold each asset individually. By merging these two asset classes, Coinbase aims to provide an efficient and regulated way for institutions to access a broad range of high-profile investments.

The Mag7 group refers to seven of the most prominent tech companies in the world, which collectively represent around 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500. The new futures contract tracks these companies and also includes two crypto ETFs — BlackRock's Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

This combination allows investors to gain exposure to both the tech sector and the rapidly-growing cryptocurrency space in one product.

Each component of the index, including Coinbase's stock and the crypto ETFs, is weighted equally at 10%, creating a balanced exposure to both traditional and digital assets. This new product aims to simplify the process of investing in these diverse asset classes while providing the liquidity and accessibility that institutional investors expect.

The Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures is the first U.S.-listed derivative that merges both crypto and tech equities in one contract. This product represents Coinbase's entry into the world of multi-asset derivatives, a strategy that could reshape how institutional investors engage with both traditional finance (TradFi) and Web3.

By creating a futures product that combines major technology stocks with digital assets, Coinbase is positioning itself as a bridge between traditional finance and the evolving crypto market. This move reflects a growing trend of blending traditional financial products with crypto exposure, catering to institutions that are exploring ways to invest in Web3 technologies without directly holding cryptocurrencies.

This launch marks a strategic pivot for Coinbase, as it seeks to expand beyond its core business of cryptocurrency exchanges into the realm of derivatives and institutional products. The success of this futures contract could pave the way for additional similar products in the future. However, even if the product does not see immediate success, it still signals Coinbase's commitment to offering innovative financial products that cater to institutional investors.

The broader goal is to attract institutional capital by providing easy access to the growing Web3 ecosystem. Products like the Mag7 + Crypto Equity Index Futures could help bring new investors into the crypto space, particularly those from traditional sectors who may have been hesitant to dive into direct cryptocurrency holdings.

Coinbase's new futures product is likely to draw attention from other financial exchanges, which may seek to replicate or offer similar products in the future. If successful, this product could have a broader influence on how both the tech and crypto sectors are integrated within institutional portfolios.

Wall Street tech analyst and Eightco Holdings Inc. ORBS Chair Dan Ives reiterated on Monday his belief in the World Network's (WLD) potential to become the leading authentication technology in the AI revolution.

During an interaction with stock market commentator Amit Kukreja, Ives viewed the Sam Altman-founded initiative as more of an infrastructure tech play than a cryptocurrency play, predicting it to become the “single sign-on for AI” in the future.

“To me, it's really like when I look out into the future between bots, robotic, you need human proof. This is really like an AI meets crypto intersection. And that's why I'm so excited to be a part of it,” Ives added.

The Wedbush Securities analyst said the identity verification project is “many years ahead” of any other competition and similar to how he viewed tech titans like Tesla Inc. TSLA, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR in their early days,

Ives defended World Network against privacy concerns.

“It's actually the most privacy-driven solution there is out there because when you get your eyes scanned, it's literally in the Orb for 20 seconds and then it goes to your phone in your World app,” he said. “It's actually the opposite. You have control of your data. It's decentralized.”

Ives' optimism follows his appointment as chairman of Eightco, a firm that has adopted World Network's native token, WLD, as its primary reserve asset. Tom Lee-led Bitmine Immersion Technologies Inc. BMNR also disclosed a $20 million investment into the company. 

World is an identity verification project that captures people's irises to confirm their humanness and build a digital ID, allowing them to receive free WLD tokens.

However, this approach has led to personal data privacy concerns. The project is currently outlawed in Hong Kong, Kenya and Spain.

Price Action: At the time of writing, WLD was exchanging hands at $1.36, down 4.52% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The coin has surged 37% over the last month.

Eightco shares dipped 0.08% in after-hours trading after closing 6.18% lower at $12.00 during Monday's regular trading session.

According to Benzinga's Edge Stock Rankings, the stock was in a downward trend over the short, medium and long term. Here's how it ranks in other metrics as of this writing.

SEOUL, South Korea: World Liberty Financial will roll out a debit card and retail application “very soon,” co-founder Zak Folkman said during a panel at the ongoing Korea Blockchain Week 2025.

The products are pitched as a way to plug the project's stablecoin USD1 into everyday payments, including Apple Pay integration.

The retail app is meant to merge peer-to-peer transfers with trading features. Both products are expected to form the core of World Liberty's push into consumer markets.

Separately, World Liberty said had it signed a memorandum of understanding with South Korean exchange Bithumb to explore business opportunities, though details of the tie-up remain unclear.

As bitcoin's [BTC] recent sell-off accelerates, analysts are focusing on three critical price support levels that could shape the cryptocurrency's near-term trajectory.

The first key level is $112,000, identified by Swissblock Technologies. “As long as $112,000 holds and the Risk stays stable, BTC can rebuild strength,” Swissblock noted on X.

The firm's proprietary Bitcoin Risk Index aggregates on-chain valuation and cost-basis data to gauge market volatility—rising readings indicate risk aversion and potential price swings, while low or stable levels suggest bullish sentiment.

On Monday, the risk index hovered near zero, signaling optimism despite BTC's 1.7% drop to $112,600 in the past 24 hours, with prices briefly dipping as low as $111,717, according to CoinDesk data.

Swissblock also highlighted $110,000 as a “lifeline support.” Historical charts reveal that in the December-January period, buyers struggled to hold BTC above this level, marking it as a significant zone to monitor.

The third crucial support is the on-chain metric known as the “short-term holder cost basis,” currently at $111,400.

Analytics firm Glassnode defines this as the average purchase price for wallets that have acquired bitcoin within the last 155 days. This indicator is widely regarded as a battleground between bulls and bears—prices above it generally reflect bullish conviction. In contrast, sustained trading below it could signal increased risk of sell-offs or a shift toward a bearish market structure.

“Sustained trading below this level could signal a shift toward a mid- to long-term bearish market structure,” Glassnode explained on X.

Together, these three levels – $110,000, $111,400, and $112,000 – form a delicate support zone that traders are closely watching as bitcoin navigates this volatile phase.

Shares of Semler Scientific (SMLR) closed at $32.06, well below the implied $86.30 takeout value in its announced all-stock acquisition by Strive (ASST), a discount Benchmark analyst Mark Palmers say reflects both skepticism and opportunity in the emerging bitcoin treasury M&A wave.

Palmer reiterated its buy rating on Semler while trimming his price target on the stock to $86 from $101 to reflect the terms of the Strive deal.

The fixed exchange ratio, 21.05 Strive shares per Semler share, suggests a lucrative arbitrage spread for investors, especially with both boards having approved the deal. Palmer said the market may be underestimating the long-term implications of consolidating bitcoin-heavy balance sheets under a single corporate roof.

Strive, which recently disclosed it holds 5,886 bitcoin, would add Semler's 5,021 BTC for a combined 10,907 tokens, enough to rank twelfth among public companies holding the cryptocurrency, trailing only Strategy, the report noted.

Importantly, the merger gives Strive not only scale in crypto reserves but also ownership of Semler's diagnostics business, which it intends to monetize or spin off after the deal closes, Palmer said. That cash-flowing asset base may give Strive more flexibility than pure bitcoin treasury plays.

The transaction marks the first major move in what Benchmark believes will become a broader wave of stock-for-stock bitcoin treasury mergers. By leveraging its own equity, Strive appears to be capturing BTC at favorable prices, using a ""preferred-equity-only leverage model"" that avoids typical maturity and margin risks associated with debt-based strategies.

However, risks remain. The deal depends on an effective S-4 registration and Semler shareholder approval. Any sharp decline in Strive or the bitcoin price before the vote could pressure deal terms. ""If Strive's share price weakens materially into the vote, the implied value to SMLR drops, possibly inviting renegotiation pressure or widening the arb haircut,"" the report added.

SMLR shares are higher by 2.5% premarket to $32.86. ASST is lower by 4.9% to $3.90.

 The new Solana-based Evo stablecoin pegged to Kazakhstan's national currency, the tenge, aims to bridge the crypto market with traditional finance. 

Kazakhstan's central bank launched a pilot project with a new stablecoin pegged to the local fiat currency in collaboration with Solana and Mastercard.

The National Bank of Kazakhstan announced the launch of the stablecoin project within the framework of its Digital Assets Regulatory Sandbox, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph on Tuesday.

The new Evo (KZTE) stablecoin is pegged to the Kazakhstani tenge currency and is issued by sandbox participant Intebix crypto exchange and local lender Eurasian Bank, with assistance from Solana and Mastercard.

Based on the Solana blockchain, KZTE is immediately live within the central bank's regulatory sandbox, and Mastercard is set to connect KZTE with global stablecoin issuers, Intebix founder Talgat Dossanov told Cointelegraph.

Kazakhstan's Evo stablecoin is described as a “national stablecoin” designed to connect crypto innovation with traditional finance.

Use cases for the KZTE stablecoin include expanding the crypto-fiat channel, enabling cryptocurrency exchange and supporting transactions through crypto cards.

“The project is part of the National Bank's strategy to build a national digital asset ecosystem, fostering innovative digital tools and the development of Kazakhstan's digital asset market,” the announcement noted.

While the Evo stablecoin is technically issued by Intebix and the Eurasian Bank, the National Bank of Kazakhstan is participating in the project by providing a regulatory regime to allow its issuance and testing.

“It's still the first case where the central bank is taking a proactive role in the issuance of the stablecoin,” Dossanov told Cointelegraph.

“Today, we are launching Kazakhstan's first stablecoin denominated in our national currency, the tenge, within the National Bank's regulatory sandbox,” National Bank Governor Timur Suleimenov reportedly said during the Evo opening event on Tuesday.

Suleimenov emphasized that the digital age presents both challenges and opportunities, with digital assets and blockchain technology playing a central role in delivering new services, enhancing financial inclusion and driving the country's overall advancement.

Kazakhstan's Evo stablecoin launch comes in line with the country's ambitious digital asset agenda, including exploring the concept of a state-run crypto reserve.

In early September, Kazakhstan's Astana Financial Services Authority officially authorized the use of USD-pegged stablecoins including Tether USDt (USDT) for payment of license and supervision fees.

Kazakhstan has also emerged as a global leader in Bitcoin (BTC) mining, becoming one of the biggest BTC mining countries by the mining hashrate distribution in 2022, with a share of 13%.

Kazakhstan has also been making moves with a central bank digital currency (CBDC), launching the digital tenge in November 2023. The initiative has brought significant improvements to VAT reimbursement processing, the National Bank's chief digital officer said last year.

 JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the Federal Reserve won't cut rates until inflation cools, and adds he is “not particularly worried” about stablecoins. 

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the US Federal Reserve will have a hard time cutting the interest rate unless inflation drops, and isn't worried about stablecoins posing a threat to the banking sector.

“If inflation does not go away, it's going to be hard for the Fed to cut more,” Dimon, the head of the largest bank in the US, told CNBC-TV18 on Monday.

“Inflation seems a little bit stuck at 3%. Again, I can give you some arguments why it's going to go up, not down,” he said, adding he's hopeful for “decent growth” and a rate cut instead of the Fed cutting rates due to a recession.

Dimon's expectation has thrown some cold water on the market's expectation of multiple rate cuts, with some expecting up to five cuts over the next 12 months.

Interest rate cuts have typically been a boon for crypto markets, as cheaper borrowing gives investors confidence to bet on riskier assets. The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday for the first time in 2025, which spurred Bitcoin (BTC) to over $117,500 for the first time in more than a month.

CME FedWatch data shows the market is expecting another 25 basis point cut when the Fed meets in late October, and the same again when it meets in early December.

The Feds' projections show a wide disparity, but hint at two more cuts to come before the end of the year, with another possibly taking place in 2026.

The latest US inflation data released on Sept. 11 showed inflation rose 0.4% in August, marking a 2.9% rise over the last 12 months, above the Fed's target inflation rate of 2%.

Dimon separately weighed in on stablecoins, which have become a key policy issue for banks after Congress passed laws regulating the tokens in July.

Dimon said he's “not particularly worried about” stablecoins, but his bank and others in the sector “should be on top of it and understand it.”

“There'll be people who want to own dollars through a stablecoin outside the US, from bad guys to good guys to certain countries where you're probably better off having dollars and not putting into the banking system,” he said.

He reiterated that JPMorgan is involved in stablecoins and the banking sector is “looking at whether they should have a consortium” to launch a token.

“I'm not sure central banks need to use it among themselves, so it'll develop over time,” he said.

Banking groups have urged Congress to tighten up the stablecoin laws, claiming loopholes allow stablecoin issuers and their affiliates to pay interest or yields on stablecoins, arguing that it could undercut bank accounts and destabilize the banking system.

 Hackers breached UXLink's multisignature wallet to steal about $30 million in assets and mint 10 trillion UXLINK tokens, but later got nabbed in a phishing scam. 

AI-powered Web3 social platform and infrastructure UXLink saw its crypto token collapse by over 90% after a malicious actor minted billions of unauthorized tokens. 

On Tuesday, the project announced that it had identified a breach involving its multisignature wallet. The company said a significant amount of crypto was being illicitly transferred to centralized and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

UXLink said it had reached out to exchanges to freeze suspicious deposits and reported the incident to law enforcement. In another update, the company confirmed some of the funds had been frozen with the help of exchanges. 

“A large portion of the stolen assets has already been frozen, and collaboration with exchanges remains strong,” UXlink said. 

After confirming the breach, UXLink flagged that the attacker had started the unauthorized minting of tokens. 

Blockchain security company PeckShield said the hacker initially minted 1 billion UXLINK tokens, warning traders to refrain from interacting with the crypto asset. PeckShield said the attackers minted another 1 billion tokens after the first mint. 

After these initial mints, the hacker kept minting UXLINK tokens. Onchain analysts at Hacken estimated that the hacker minted almost 10 trillion tokens.

Despite the massive mint, Hacken said the attacker swapped 9.95 trillion tokens for 16 Ether (ETH), worth about $67,000. The company estimated overall losses from the incident at more than $30 million.

In response to the unauthorized token mints, UXLink publicly reached out to centralized exchanges (CEXs) to temporarily suspend trading of its token. The company also said it will initiate a token swap plan to protect its ecosystem.

As the security incident transpired, the UXLINK token saw a steep decline, dropping 90% from $0.33 to $0.033. At the time of writing, the token had recovered to $0.11. 

Meanwhile, onchain analysis company Lookonchain flagged that while the attacker was busy minting tokens, they lost over 500 billion UXLINK tokens through a phishing attack.

In an update, the company said there were no signs of individual wallets being affected by the attack. However, UXLink urged users to stay alert and follow only the official communication channels as their information source. 

The company said it's working on the token swap plan and will announce it soon. “Further details and instructions for the token swap will be announced shortly,” UXLink wrote. 

In its latest update, UXLink said it had submitted a new smart contract for a security audit. The company said the new contract will have a fixed supply, ensuring that no new tokens will ever be created. 

The company also said it is preparing a comprehensive incident report in collaboration with its security partners.

 Nine US lawmakers asked the SEC to move forward on last month's executive order to speed up the inclusion of alternative assets like crypto in US retirement funds. 

US lawmakers have called on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Paul Atkins to help accelerate the executive order enabling crypto investments in US 401(k) retirement plans.

In the letter on Monday, nine lawmakers, including House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill and Subcommittee on Capital Markets Chairman Ann Wagner, said that Atkins was asked to “provide swift assistance” to the Secretary of Labor and to make any necessary adjustments to its current regulations and guidance.

They also noted that under President Donald Trump's August executive order on “Democratizing Access to Alternative Assets for 401(k) Investors,” the SEC was instructed to make alternative assets like crypto more accessible in participant-directed retirement plans, in consideration of accredited investor and qualified purchaser rules.

“We are hopeful that such actions will help the 90 million Americans that are currently restricted from investing in alternative assets to secure a dignified, comfortable retirement,” the nine lawmakers said.

This move follows the reversal of the Labor Department's anti-crypto guidance in May, which had cautioned fiduciaries to be extremely careful when including crypto in retirement funds.

“Every American preparing for retirement should have access to funds that include investments in alternative assets when the relevant plan fiduciary determines that such access provides an appropriate opportunity… to enhance the net risk-adjusted returns,” said the lawmakers, who also include Frank D. Lucas, Warren Davidson, Marlin Stutzman, Andrew R. Garbarino, Michael V. Lawler, Troy Downing and Mike Haridopolos.

Implementing Trump's EO would open crypto to the $9.3 trillion US 401(k) retirement market, driving larger inflows into crypto exchange-traded products while positioning crypto as a potential long-term investment strategy.

Even a 1% crypto allocation into the $9.3 trillion held in 401(k) plans could drive $93 billion in inflows, which would be considerably larger than the $60.6 billion worth of capital that has flowed into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds since launching in January 2024.

The State of Michigan Retirement System has continued expanding its crypto ETF holdings, snapping up $10.7 million worth of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF in the second quarter. 

It also held onto 460,000 shares of the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), valued at around $15.6 million.

However, not all have held. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board unloaded its shares in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the first quarter after being one of the first public pension funds to invest in the crypto ETFs.

This Blazing Exoplanet Breaks All the Rules about Alien Atmospheres, JWST Finds

Hot, small and old—exoplanet TOI-561 b is just about the worst place to look for alien air. Scientists using JWST found it there anyway

By Elise Cutts edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

New research suggests a rocky “lava planet” orbiting very close to its star likely carries an atmosphere.

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

Astronomers found an atmosphere where they least expected it—clinging to an exoplanet that's too small, too hot and too old to have air, at least in theory.

James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the blazing-hot lava planet TOI-561 b suggest not only that it has a thick atmosphere but also that it may have had one for billions of years. This is the strongest evidence yet for air around a hot rocky world that isn't just a temporary veil of hydrogen and helium left over from planetary formation. The discovery, posted on the preprint server arXiv.org, will soon appear in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.

“It's super old and ultrahot. It's the worst conditions,” says the preprint study's co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a planetary scientist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “This should not have an atmosphere. And it has one.”

Planetary scientist Joshua Krissansen-Totton of the University of Washington, who wasn't involved in the study, agrees. “It is definitely surprising and exciting to find a substantial atmosphere on this hot rocky planet,” he says.

In our solar system, atmospheres obey a simple rule: bigger, cooler worlds hold onto their air, and smaller, warmer ones don't. But TOI-561 b weighs in at just two Earth masses and is very, very hot; the planet orbits so close to its orange dwarf star that its years last less than an Earth day, and its estimated temperature is a rock-melting 2,300 kelvins. TOI-561 b is also about twice as old as our solar system, so its sunblasted atmosphere would have had plenty of time to escape. But researchers suspected the planet might be more than a bare ball of magma because of its unusually low density. And scientists previously spotted air on a bigger hot super-Earth called 55 Cancri e, though the data were “messy and weird,” Krissansen-Totton says.

To check for alien air, the research team used JWST to take TOI-561 b's temperature. The planet is tidally locked, so one side bakes in ceaseless sunshine while the other is always dark. The scientists found that TOI-561 b's sun-soaked dayside was cooler than they had expected for a naked rock—most likely because gas was there to spread the heat around.

The team is “confident” that an atmosphere is the best explanation for the data, says exoplanet astronomer and study co-author Johanna Teske of Carnegie Science. But finding an unexpected atmosphere “is the kind of result that generates more questions than it answers,” she adds.

For one, scientists don't know what TOI-516 b's air is made of or how it survived eons of hellish heat. Lichtenberg thinks the atmosphere most likely bubbled up from the planet's magma ocean. Every planet in our solar system was once molten like TOI-561 b, he points out; this unexpected atmosphere could have a lot to teach us about the origins of our own air.

Drinking too little water could increase our vulnerability to stress-related health issues, according to a new study from scientists at LJMU.

People who drink less than the recommended daily fluid intake experience a greater stress hormone response, which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.

A new study, published recently in the Journal of Applied Physiology, found that individuals who drank less than 1.5 liters of fluid – or seven cups of tea – per day had a cortisol response to stress that was over 50% higher than those who met daily water intake recommendations.

Study lead Professor Neil Walsh, a physiologist in LJMU's School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, said: ""Cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone and exaggerated cortisol reactivity to stress is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and depression.""

""If you know you have a looming deadline or a speech to make, keeping a water bottle close could be a good habit with potential benefits for your long-term health.""

Poor long-term health 

With the project funded by Danone R&I, Neil and his team divided healthy young adults into two equally sized groups, representing the lowest and highest 25% for daily fluid intake. The 'low fluid' group consisted of individuals who typically drank less than 1.5 liters of fluid per day (water, hot drinks etc.). The 'high fluid' group included individuals who regularly met the daily water intake recommendations – 2 liters for women and 2.5 liters for men. Both groups were matched for key factors known to influence stress responses such as psychological characteristics and sleep.

Participants maintained their usual drinking habits for one week, during which hydration levels were monitored in blood and urine samples. Then participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test, widely used to simulate real-world stress through a mock job interview and a mental arithmetic task.

Dr Daniel Kashi, a member of the study team, said: ""Both groups felt equally anxious and experienced similar increases in heart rate during the stress test. However, only the 'low fluid' group showed a significant increase in saliva cortisol in response to the stress test.""

He added: ""Although the low fluid group did not report being thirstier than the high fluid group, they had darker and more concentrated urine, clear signs of poor hydration. An important observation was that poor hydration was associated with greater cortisol reactivity to the stress test. Exaggerated cortisol reactivity to stress has been associated with poor long-term health.""

""If you have a stressful schedule, keeping a bottle of water close could be a good habit.""

Dr Daniel Kashi, physiologist, LJMU

Why is dehydration harmful? 

The answer lies in the body's water-regulation system, which is closely connected to the brain's stress-response center. When the body senses dehydration, whether due to inadequate fluid intake or excessive fluid loss, it triggers the release of a hormone called vasopressin. Vasopressin acts primarily on the kidneys, promoting water reabsorption to maintain blood volume and electrolyte balance. This conservation mechanism comes at a cost. Sustained vasopressin release places additional strain on the kidneys, which must work harder to concentrate urine and manage electrolyte balance.

Vasopressin also acts on the brain's stress-response center, the hypothalamus, where it can influence the release of cortisol. This dual role for vasopressin helps maintain blood volume and electrolyte balance but also increases cortisol.

The researchers say that while further long-term studies are needed, the findings reinforce current water intake recommendations – approximately 2 liters of fluid each day for women and 2.5 liters for men.

Hydration helps us manage stress 

""Being hydrated may help your body manage stress more effectively,"" added Dr Kashi. A practical way to check your hydration status is to monitor your urine colour -- light yellow typically indicates good hydration.

""If you know, for example, that you have a stressful schedule, maybe a looming deadline or a speech to make, keeping a water bottle close could be a good habit with potential benefits for your long-term health.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Can meditation apps really reduce stress, anxiety, and insomnia?","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250922075000.htm","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 04:11:58 GMT","

Do you have a meditation app on your smartphone, computer or wearable device? Well, you're not alone.

There are now thousands of meditation apps available worldwide, the top 10 of which have been collectively downloaded more than 300 million times. What's more, early work on these digital meditation platforms shows that even relatively brief usage can lead to benefits, from reduced depression, anxiety, and stress to improved insomnia symptoms.

""Meditation apps, such as Calm and Headspace, have been enormously popular in the commercial market,"" said J. David Creswell, a health psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University and lead author of a review paper on meditation apps, published today in the journal American Psychologist. ""What they're doing now is not only engaging millions of users every day, but they're also creating new scientific opportunities and challenges.""

One huge boon provided by meditation apps for users is access.

""You can imagine a farmer in rural Nebraska not having many available opportunities to go to traditional group-based meditation programs, and now they have an app in their pocket which is available 24/7,"" said Creswell, who is the William S. Dietrich II Professor in Psychology and Neuroscience.

Meditation apps also provide scientists with opportunities to scale up their research.

""Historically, I might bring 300 irritable bowel syndrome patients into my lab and study the impacts of meditation on pain management,"" said Creswell. ""But now I'm thinking, how do we harness the capacity of meditation apps and wearable health sensors to study 30,000 irritable bowel syndrome patients across the world?""

Combined with products that measure heart rate and sleep patterns, such as Fitbit and the Apple Watch, meditation apps now also have the capacity to incorporate biometrics into meditation practices like never before.

The biggest takeaway, though, is that meditation apps are fundamentally changing the way these practices are distributed to the general public. Scientific studies of use patterns show that meditation apps account for 96 percent of overall users in the mental health app marketplace.

""Meditation apps dominate the mental health app market,"" said Creswell. ""And this paper is really the first to lay out the new normal and challenge researchers and tech developers to think in new ways about the disruptive nature of these apps and their reach.""

Meditation apps challenge users to train their minds, in small initial training doses

As with in-person meditation training, meditation apps start by meeting users where they are. Introductory courses may focus on breathing or mindfulness, but they tend to do so in small doses, the merits of which are still being debated.

According to the data, just 10 to 21 minutes of meditation app exercises done three times a week is enough to see measurable results.

""Of course, that looks really different from the daily meditation practice you might get within an in-person group-based meditation program, which might be 30 to 45 minutes a day,"" said Creswell.

The a la carte nature of meditation through a smartphone app may appeal to those pressed for time or without the budget for in-person coaching sessions. Users may also find it comforting to know that they have access to guided meditation on-demand, rather than at scheduled places, days, and times.

""Maybe you're waiting in line at Starbucks, and you've got three minutes to do a brief check-in mindfulness training practice,"" said Creswell.

Finally, as meditation apps continue to evolve, Creswell believes integration of AI, such as meditation-guiding chat-bots, will only become more common, and this will offer the option of even more personalization. This could mark an important development for meditation adoption at large, as offerings go from one-size-fits all group classes to training sessions tailored to the individual.

""People use meditation for different things, and there's a big difference between someone looking to optimize their free-throw shooting performance and someone trying to alleviate chronic pain,"" said Creswell, who has trained Olympic athletes in the past.

The elephant in the room

Of course, with new technology comes new challenges, and for meditation apps, continued engagement remains a huge problem.

""The engagement problem is not specific to meditation apps,"" said Creswell. ""But the numbers are really sobering. Ninety-five percent of participants who download a meditation app aren't using it after 30 days.""

If the meditation app industry is going to succeed, it will need to find ways to keep its users engaged, as apps like Duolingo have. But overall, Creswell said the market demand is clearly there.

""People are suffering right now. There are just unbelievably high levels of stress and loneliness in the world, and these tools have tremendous potential to help,"" he said.

""I don't think there is ever going to be a complete replacement for a good, in-person meditation group or teacher,"" said Creswell. ""But I think meditation apps are a great first step for anyone who wants to dip their toes in and start training up their mindfulness skills. The initial studies show that these meditation apps help with symptom relief and even reduce stress biomarkers.""

Access to water is crucial for all aspects of life. Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD.

In late 2017 and early 2018, the city of Cape Town, South Africa, was threatened by an unprecedented water scarcity crisis, known as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), triggered by an exceptional 3-year rainfall deficit that started in 20151. This event was characterized by the lowest river flows recorded since 19042 in the Sonderend River and drained the largest reservoir3, Theewaterskloof, to critical levels. The vulnerability and scale of the population exposure made it one of the most extreme multi-year droughts on record, leading to severe water restrictions and socio-economic consequences4,5. The long duration of the drought and the high water demand made the situation dire, especially for a city relying for 96% on surface water and only 4% on groundwater6. Although Cape Town ultimately avoided reaching DZD, due to the slightly above-average rainfall in winter 2018 and subsequent wetter years, this event remains the major urban drought in recent history. Similar crises occurred in cities like Chennai in 20197, while other cities like Los Angeles8 remain highly vulnerable. These cases highlight the growing global concern over urban water security and serve as a wake-up call to the risks of water insecurity.

Traditional droughts, meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological, are typically assessed in isolation based on deficits in precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow. In contrast, water scarcity is a multidimensional event arising from insufficient quantity, compromised quality, and unmet environmental flow requirements, constraining the sustainable availability of water sources for human and ecological systems9. This study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, driven by anthropogenic supply-demand imbalances. However, DZD represents an acute water scarcity triggered by the simultaneous occurrence of multi-year precipitation deficits, river flow depletion, and high-water demand, leading to a critical depletion of reservoirs. Therefore, DZD is a multi-year compound extreme event arising from the concurrent occurrence of several interdependent events10. A compound extreme event refers to a simultaneous occurrence of multiple extreme events that can have drastic effects on a large scale, far greater than the impact of an individual event11,12. Multi-year meteorological drought, driven by insufficient precipitation and potentially exacerbated by global warming, can lead to hydrological droughts characterized by abnormally low river flows, reducing water availability. Such combined events considerably increase the risk of water scarcity when the available supply is less than the demand. Hence, the simultaneous occurrence of several climate extremes can lead to more severe impacts13 on water supply14 and subsequently on society and ecosystems15, highlighting the need for integrated drought assessment frameworks that account for compound events.

Intensive water consumption due to economic development, population growth, and modern agriculture, heightens the risk that water resources, depleted by drought, will not be able to meet sectoral water demands. On a global level, future climate projections indicate that global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the water cycle variability16, leading to more severe wet-dry fluctuation periods17, enhancing evapotranspiration18, and reducing precipitation and surface runoff16 in many regions. These changes are expected to increase the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological water stress19,20,21,22. Despite the distinct nature of drought and water scarcity, their relationship is crucial in the hydrological system23. Climate change and socioeconomic development drive global freshwater scarcity24,25,26, affecting numerous populations27. However, the risk of future global water scarcity, caused by anthropogenic climate change and rising water demand across all sectors, and its impacts28,29 remain poorly understood due to the complexity of its socio-economic and physical interactions.

Few studies have focused on understanding the DZD drivers, and then mainly for Cape Town, South Africa1,2,4,30,31,32,33. The event was caused by a wet-season rainfall deficit and long-term decline in the frequency and intensity of rainy days, making the rainy season shorter than the dry season34,35. Anthropogenic climate change contributed to DZD36,37 and is expected to increase its future likelihood33. However, global-scale assessments of the emergence and attribution of DZD-like events under global warming remain limited. Understanding where and when such compound events will emerge is crucial for local and global water security strategies.

To the best of our knowledge, few studies have assessed the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of extreme events such as unprecedented hydrological drought38 and water scarcity39, under human-induced climate change. For instance, Liu et al.39 estimated the ToFE of water scarcity and its potential disappearance based on a per-capita water availability metric. However, the understanding of ToFE of water scarcity driven by the compound effects of hydrological drought and socio-economic growth remains limited. Here, water scarcity arises when freshwater demand exceeds the available supply, including reservoir storage, under compound drought conditions. Reservoirs are essential for managing local water availability and assessing the severity of water scarcity under climate change40. However, reservoir feedback41,42 due to reservoir dependence can increase vulnerability to water shortages during prolonged drought, as increased storage capacity encourages greater water consumption. Reservoirs help mitigate hydrological extremes, but over-reliance can mask water stress and delay adaptation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for in-depth research on reservoir-related water security risks to achieve water-related sustainable development goals.

This study assesses the characteristics of global physical water scarcity caused by hydrological drought in anthropogenic climate change using a probabilistic framework based on large-ensemble model simulations. Our study specifically addresses water scarcity that arises when prolonged drought reduces water supply below demand. To investigate the emergence of extreme drought-driven water scarcity, we use 100 ensemble members of climate projections with the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) under the SSP3-7.0 scenario for probabilistic analysis. We also include the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios for the sensitivity of our results, using 10 ensemble members for each scenario to ensure consistency. The CNRM-based analysis is solely for the sensitivity of the ToFE due to its coarser spatial resolution relative to CESM2-LE. We evaluate the global ToFE of prolonged drought-driven water scarcity, such as DZD, using a method based on the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) of the joint probability of compound extremes, incorporating reservoir and lake levels. We apply the FAR to quantify the increase in the likelihood of DZD events due to human-induced climate change, attributing the risk to the anthropogenic forcing. Our study focuses on DZD as an acute water scarcity event due to a long period of unprecedented compound extreme events in water supply shortage and rising demand under a warming climate. We identify when and where anthropogenic DZD first emerges, how long these events will last, and how many people will be exposed to DZD.

We investigate drought-driven water scarcity as a compound extreme event characterized by the concurrent exceedance of thresholds of four indicators: the 48-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), and the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), as illustrated in Fig. 1, and Time for Reservoirs to Dry (TRD, Supplementary Fig. 6). Although SPEI is widely used for capturing atmospheric water demand through Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), it does not reflect actual water losses from the land surface, which actual evapotranspiration better represents. Nonetheless, PET-based indices remain suitable for detecting climate-driven drought in long-term, large-scale studies due to their broader data availability and methodology.

The first column panel shows the ensemble mean of water stress for the pre-industrial period (1850–1899), which is considered as the baseline period, the second column panel for the near future (2020–2050), and the third column panel for the far future (2070–2100). a–c Present the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), indicating long-term climatic water balance at a 48-month timescale. d–f Show the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), capturing hydrological drought conditions at a 48-month timescale. g–i Depict the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), reflecting the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption at a 48-month timescale. Each panel represents the ensemble mean, illustrating the spatial pattern and severity of compound water stress indicators over time. Negative values of SPEI48 and SRFI48 indicate increasingly dry conditions, while lower SWSI48 values (i.e., supply-to-demand ratios below normal) signal intensifying water scarcity driven by growing demand. Together, these projections reveal areas at high risk of compound, long-term water stress under future climate and socio-economic scenarios.

Our results quantify the spatial distributions of water stress and suggest that some regions will encounter unprecedented regional drought conditions due to global warming under the SSP3-7.0 scenario (Fig. 1). Regarding the SPEI48 and SRFI48 indices, most regions are expected to experience unprecedented severe multi-year hydrological droughts, especially towards the end of the twenty-first century under anthropogenic climate change. SWSI48 shows the emergence of regional water scarcity in future periods.

Towards the end of the twenty-first century, almost all regions are at high risk of severe and pronounced persistent drought (i.e., SPEI48, Fig. 1c) in the far future. Our findings align with a previous study43 indicating a persistent increase in severe multi-year drought in the future over southern Africa, northern South America, the Mediterranean Region, Australia, and Chile. Conversely, regions like Argentina, East Africa, and high-latitude Russia are projected to experience wetter climates.

Similarly, the spatial distribution of SRFI48 (Fig. 1e, f) indicates an increase and intensification of severe multi-year river flow extremes in the future44. This is projected to intensify in the far future45,46. A substantial decline in the Yangtze River water level is projected in the near future, followed by a slight increase in the far future. The increase in streamflow in the far future is driven by increased snowmelt47,48 and precipitation49, which could lead to water level rises. Notably, anthropogenic climate change is projected to also alter the world's largest river flow systems, such as the Amazon River. However, an increase of a high risk of the occurrence of extreme floods50 is projected in the far future for the biggest rivers, such as the Rio de la Plata, Nile, Congo, and Yellow Rivers.

The SWSI48 addresses the multi-year impact of increasing water demand with a decrease in water supply in a warming world. Our results show the emergence of acute water scarcity in the future (Fig. 1h, i), with total water demand exceeding total water supply. The expansion of regions impacted by water scarcity shows the intensification of SWSI48, particularly in the western United States of America, Mediterranean regions, northern Africa, southern Africa, India, northern China, and southern Australia.

Consequently, our results state that several regions will at the same time encounter severe dryness, as indicated by SPEI48 less than −1.5, persistent reduction in river discharge, by SRFI48 less than −1.5, and chronic acute water scarcity, defined by SWSI48 less than 0.6. Therefore, these simultaneous occurrences of multiple water-related stress factors driven by long-duration rainfall deficits, increased evapotranspiration, depleted river flow, and increased water consumption are projected to intensify jointly under a warming climate scenario, CESM2-LE SSP3.7-0. This compound pattern of multi-year water stress underscores an increasing prevalence of extreme water stress26,38,45,51 and scarcity52 in the future, especially in already drought-prone regions.

This study defines ToFE as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) for DZD exceeds 0.99, indicating a 99% likelihood that human activities caused the onset of these unprecedented compound drought-scarcity events. ToFE is assessed relative to pre-industrial conditions (1850–1899), which serve as the baseline for detecting anthropogenic emergence. The focal hotspot regions affected by unprecedented DZD, with their respective decade of ToFE and the distribution of the ToFE, are shown in Fig. 2. Our results indicate that anthropogenic climate change is projected to trigger the onset and occurrence of DZD, primarily due to severe and persistent compound multi-year hydrological droughts, reservoir depletion, and high-water demand.

Colored shading indicates the first decade during which DZD becomes statistically attributable to anthropogenic climate change, defined as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk is greater than 0.99 (FAR ≥ 0.99). Gray regions indicate grid cells where no DZD event attributable to anthropogenic climate change is projected to emerge before 2100. For regions with reservoirs, the ToFE is considered to be the first decade after the year of completion (Supplementary Fig. 6) of their respective reservoirs, when all DZD criteria are simultaneously met.

The color scale indicates the percentages of grid cells (land areas) experiencing their ToFE distribution in each decade from 1900 to 2100. It provides a temporal overview of how the ToFE is distributed over time and the trends in DZD emergence.

About 14% of the global reservoirs from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRand) database (Supplementary Fig. 5, see Methods for more information regarding the reservoirs) would dry out due to a high risk of DZD during their respective ToFE, as shown in Fig. 2a. The 74% of regions covered by DZD are projected to experience an unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, under the SSP3-7.0 scenario of CESM2-LE. Moreover, almost 35% of those regions are facing the emergence of water scarcity, including their reservoirs, between 2020 and 2030 (Fig. 2b). This will threaten the local freshwater availability in DZD-prone regions (Supplementary Fig. 7). Declining precipitation and river flows, combined with rising water demand, can dry up the reservoirs and cause water scarcity across sectors, heightening the risks of water, food, or socio-economic insecurity.

The ToFE of DZD is influenced by the severity of the precipitation deficit and increases in evapotranspiration (SPEI48), river drought (SRFI48), and water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa (Supplementary Fig. 10). In parts of Asia and America, increased water consumption can influence the early emergence of DZD compared to other factors. This rise in water consumption is associated with population growth and socio-economic development, encompassing expanded water use across domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining sectors. These findings emphasize the importance of jointly considering all four drivers: climate, hydrological supply, event duration, and human demand, since no single factor can fully characterize a compound hydrological extreme event like DZD. Furthermore, the lower the thresholds applied to define the DZD, reflecting more severe and rare events, the later the ToFE will emerge, underscoring the complex relationship between event severity and its anthropogenic emergence (Supplementary Fig. 10). This compound approach highlights that water scarcity can be triggered by various drivers rather than a single stressor. For instance, a precipitation deficit without strong demand pressure may not induce water scarcity, while excessive demand alone may not trigger a water crisis if demand remains below supply. However, unsustainable consumption driven by population growth and socio-economic development alone can also trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource. Therefore, the simultaneous occurrence of these factors can lead to the emergence of an unprecedented acute water scarcity.

In addition, reservoir characteristics, specifically the Time for Reservoir to Dry (TRD), play a crucial role in detecting the ToFE of DZD. TRD serves as a proxy for how long a reservoir can sustain water supply under drought conditions when river inflow is the only source of water. The longer it takes for an unprecedented drought to drain water in reservoirs, the later the ToFE will occur, particularly in Mediterranean regions. An increase in TRD, quadrupling the TRD, will affect the ToFE of the 8% of the DZD-prone regions, causing later emergence than in Fig. 2a (Supplementary Fig. 11, Methods). Therefore, the duration of drier conditions, combined with rising human water consumption, can dry the reservoirs and trigger severe DZD, including reservoir-dependent regions. However, excluding both drought duration and TRD increases the event occurrence in both historical and future periods and raises their probability. This will delay the human-induced signal (FAR ≥ 0.99), leading to later ToFE compared to Fig. 2, particularly in the Mediterranean regions (Supplementary Fig. 12). In contrast, DZD emerges earlier in other regions because the probability of future events exceeds the pre-industrial baseline earlier, enabling earlier detection of FAR ≥ 0.99. Therefore, including the multi-year drought duration and TRD makes these events unprecedented versus pre-industrial conditions, highlighting their importance for understanding the emergence and magnitude of anthropogenic water scarcity and the critical role of reservoirs in water crisis vulnerability. These insights underline the need for future work research integrating dynamic reservoir operations and adaptive water management strategies where region-specific data is available.

Furthermore, the ToFE of unprecedented water stress and scarcity can be dependent on model structure and scenario pathways38,39. To address this, we use data from the CNRM model under two scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0. Both scenarios project that 51% of DZD-affected regions will face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020-2030 (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). The influence of the scenario on DZD ToFE is region-specific (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c, f) due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Both high (SSP3-7.0) and moderate (SSP2-4.5) scenarios can advance, delay, or have no change on DZD emergence, depending on the region. Model structure also drives spatial discrepancies (Supplementary Fig. 21a, b, d, e): CESM2-LE projects broader DZD regions in northern Africa, while CNRM highlights other regions such as South America and Australia. Nonetheless, both models consistently identify the Mediterranean, parts of southern Africa, and North America as key emerging hotspots.

The recurrence and persistence of compound drought events are critical to understanding future water risk. In this context, we assess the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated as the number of months a DZD event lasts. Both factors can importantly exacerbate the societal and ecological impact of DZD because its continuity is destructive and costly, especially when the waiting time is short and the duration is long. The duration plays a crucial role in determining the event's extremeness and affects the exposure and vulnerability of society. Short waiting times between successive events limit the recovery period, thereby amplifying stress on water systems.

The spatial distribution and the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of DZD duration and waiting time across hotspot regions reveal distinct regional variations in the magnitudes and the distribution (Fig. 3). The heavy-tailed PDFs, with the 99th percentile exceeding 48 months, suggest that climate change can cause long durations of DZD events, although such extremes remain rare events due to long waiting times between events. However, short waiting times and durations of less than 48 months are more likely to occur, as illustrated by the shape of their PDFs and their spatial distribution (Fig. 3a, b). Moreover, the probability of having a waiting time above 48 months for all regions affected by DZD is above the 90th percentile. In terms of duration, the likelihood of an event lasting less than 48 months is above the 90th percentile, except for the Mediterranean Region, Southern Africa, Asia, and Australia, indicating shorter tails of waiting times and longer tails of duration. Thus, in these regions, the DZD tends to last longer with shorter waiting time periods. These prolonged DZD can dry up the reservoirs, heightening the risk of long-term acute water scarcity with a large-scale impact during the twenty-first century. This will be exacerbated by climate change in the future, cascading to “zero water” as many reservoirs will not have enough water to meet the demand of the projected population. Altered precipitation and river flow patterns can prolong the dry conditions and reduce the volume of inflows to freshwater systems, exacerbating water shortages. Increased evapotranspiration and water consumption deplete water sources (water available in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) more quickly and prolong DZD duration. The volume of water that reservoirs can retain will decrease due to prolonged periods of stress caused by both climate change and human activities. As ecosystems are weakened and less capable of retaining water, even brief periods of rainfall may be insufficient to end a drought or replenish water supplies, limiting the recovery period before the next DZD event.

The central spatial map shows the spatial distribution of the ensemble-mean waiting time (a) and duration (b) of DZD events, respectively, following the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) at each grid point of DZD-prone regions across the globe. c represents the spatial distribution of the frequency (%) of extreme DZD events, defined as those where the event duration exceeds the waiting time, indicating prolonged water scarcity impact and short recovery period. The accompanying inset circular diagram of c illustrates the distribution of these events, with the color scale indicating the proportion (percentages) of grid cells experiencing such conditions. This visualization highlights where and how frequently extreme DZD conditions with long duration and short waiting time emerge. The surrounding paired panels depict the Probability Density Function (PDF) of waiting time and duration for DZD events across seven DZD-prone regions. Colored lines represent the PDF of each ensemble of 100 CESM2-LE, while the black line is the ensemble mean of the respective PDF. The vertical dashed lines mark the ensemble mean (black), 90th percentile (blue), and 99th percentile (green) for each region. The red dashed line represents the monthly scale of the compound extreme event, which is 48 months. The period considered for each grid point started from the month after each decade of their respective ToFE and continued until 2100.

The duration distributions vary considerably in the tails compared to the waiting time, determining the likelihood of extreme DZD events with longer durations. The model agreement is high in simulating the waiting time and duration of the DZD. The 90th and 99th percentiles, the extreme upper tails, show some consistency among the ensembles, indicating that DZDs are projected to have a long-lasting duration but can also have long waiting times between events. An upper tail of the waiting time density greater than the duration denotes the possibility of rare DZD to occur in America and Northern Africa.

The localized nature of DZD characteristic is driven by the variation of climate (via SPEI48 and SRFI48), water consumption (via SWSI48), and reservoir capacity (via TRD) across regions, as the climate, the capacity of the reservoirs, agricultural irrigation, industrial development, and population-driven demand differ substantially across regions. To identify where DZD events will be most severe, Fig. 3c shows the DZD-prone regions and their frequency, defined as a case where DZD event duration exceeds its waiting time, indicating short recovery periods and prolonged impact. Almost 47% of the global high-risk regions will experience extreme DZD events with a frequency between 20% and 30%. Around 12% of the DZD-prone regions have a frequency of extreme prolonged DZD events above 50%, indicating that almost half of the events have longer durations than waiting times, suggesting frequent and severe water crisis conditions with substantial socio-economic impacts. Regions with high water demand and strained reservoirs, such as the Mediterranean, exhibit both high frequency and long durations of extreme DZD. In these areas, the compounded effects of hydro-climatic stress and human demands intensify the severity and persistence of DZD, exposing heightened vulnerability to water crises and limiting recovery capacity.

These findings underscore that the duration and waiting time of DZD are shaped by complex, location-specific socio-hydrological feedback. Moreover, the DZD characteristics are crucial for identifying vulnerable zones where adaptive water governance is urgently needed to mitigate future water crises. Understanding these localized dynamics enables more targeted drought preparedness and infrastructure resilience planning.

We quantify the number of people living in each grid cell during the decade in which DZD first emerges (ToFE). We assess the population exposure across the total, rural, and urban populations. Results reveal a disproportionate exposure of vulnerable populations across time, regions, and warming levels (Fig. 4). Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, over 753 million of the total population (Fig. 4a, almost 9% of the current global population) will be exposed to DZD, with populations in urban areas (467 million) more affected than in rural areas (286 million). The urban population is most exposed in the Mediterranean, with 196 million urban and 85 million rural residents at risk. In contrast, rural populations are disproportionately impacted in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Asia (Fig. 4d).

The color scale indicates the total population (urban and rural) exposed when DZD first emerges in each grid cell. b Global distribution of the Global Warming Level (GWL, in °C above preindustrial) corresponding to the ToFE of DZD, providing insight into the warming levels associated with the onset of DZD events. c Circular diagram illustrating the rural, urban, and total population exposure to DZD at the ToFE, spanning the period from 1900 to 2100. d Regional distribution of rural, urban, and total populations affected by DZD, computed as the sum of exposed respective rural, urban, and total population within each regional hotspot (demarcated black box in a) at their respective ToFE. e Distribution of population exposure relative to the GWL at ToFE. Radar plots c–e emphasize the relative contributions of rural and urban populations to total exposure, highlighting disparities in vulnerability and exposure across both time and regions.

In rural areas reliant on rainfed agriculture and surface water, DZD will threaten livelihoods, food security through crop failures, and economic stability. Although urban areas generally benefit from more robust infrastructure, they remain highly vulnerable to DZD over the next few decades (Fig. 4c). As cities expand, rising water demand often exceeds supply, making the area susceptible to energy shortages, restricted domestic water consumption, and socio-economic instability.

The Paris climate goals are expressed in terms of global warming levels (GWL), making it essential to assess the societal impact of DZD related to the warming level at the ToFE of DZD relative to the baseline period. By linking the ToFE of DZD-affected regions to their respective GWLs, we estimate the distribution of exposed populations. The results show that 61% of GWL related to the ToFE of DZD-affected regions are in the range of 1–2.5 °C (Fig. 4b). This indicates that over half of these regions will experience DZD in a 1–2.5 °C warmer world. Notably, more urban population would be exposed to DZD than rural population (Fig. 4e). The future impact on urban DZD-prone regions will be severe under these warming levels due to the higher population densities and escalating demand. Hitting the mark of 1.5 °C represents the maximum of the exposed population (Fig. 4e), with a total population of 488 million, which can be decomposed into 322 million of urban and 166 million of rural population, suggesting the urgent need to limit warming at most 1.5 °C. This study emphasizes how climate change, socio-economic development, and water scarcity interact to increase the DZD risks, particularly affecting vulnerable populations unequally, even before the most extreme warming scenarios are reached.

In addition, the risks of urban DZD are not just a future concern in a warming world, but also a near-term reality, with high population exposure by 2020 (Fig. 4c). These compounded challenges underscore the urgent need for proactive and targeted policy responses, particularly in regions where rapid development, insufficient water infrastructure, and climate vulnerability coexist.

The emergence of DZD highlights the urgent need for proactive, integrated water management within policy frameworks to address the compound risks of climate change and unsustainable water use. Climate policy and water security are tightly interconnected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)53,54, so mitigation and adaptation strategies must align with global targets while fitting regional and community-specific needs for long-term resilience55.

Defining DZD events as water scarcity driven by climate change underscores the challenges in sustainable water supply (SDG target 6.1) and efficient water use under stress (SDG target 6.4). Assessing the ToFE of DZD supports early warning signals (SDG target 13.1) and integration of climate adaptation strategies into water management policies (SDG target 13.2). Empowering communities to design local adaptation strategies fosters equitable and context-appropriate responses56, through water conservation, crop selection, water storage solutions, and efficient cross-sectors water use, context-specific responses in DZD-prone regions.

Building resilience requires integrating local knowledge, adaptive cooperative management57, water governance58, and diversified supply strategies, including the re-planning of water reservoirs, desalination, rainwater harvesting, and wastewater recycling. Climate-resilient infrastructure investments, which have been underfinanced59, need to balance conventional and innovative approaches to ensure sustainable water access in drought-prone regions.

A key limitation of this study is the reliance on the CESM2-LE and a limited number of CNRM simulations for the sensitivity analysis. CESM2-LE provides robust ensemble consistency, suitable for probabilistic analysis, but lacks scenario diversity and structural uncertainties across Earth System Models (ESMs). Conversely, the CNRM model includes more scenarios but has fewer ensemble members and lower spatial resolution, limiting its ability to capture localized extremes. These limitations underrepresent inter-model variability in drought drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration, whose trends may vary among ESMs60,61, limiting our uncertainty assessment.

Moreover, CESM2-LE's land model assumes static aquifer storage, excluding dynamic groundwater variability. This overlooks the critical role of groundwater as a vital buffer during drought, particularly in groundwater-dependent regions. Groundwater contributes to the global water cycle, influencing river discharge and evapotranspiration, while also being altered by both climate change and human activities62. Incorporating dynamic groundwater processes is essential to improve water stress risks assessments. Groundwater is declining globally, leading to dry wells63. Climate change stresses groundwater62 through increased use during droughts and reduced natural recharge, potentially worsening the impacts of continued drought64. Prolonged rainfall deficits can disrupt the hydrological cycle in a warmer world and can lead to groundwater drought65. Despite its important role in water scarcity, global modeled and observed groundwater datasets remain scarce. However, its long-term relationship with atmospheric drought (partially captured by SPEI48; Supplementary Fig. 13) provides insight into its response to hydroclimatic stress.

Notwithstanding anthropogenic global warming, population growth and economics remain the major drivers of the water crisis by increasing demand27,34. Our study considers the socio-physical aspects of water security and excludes factors like national water policies, governance, quality, and environmental flow requirements.

The GRanD database provides valuable reservoir data but lacks information on real-time-varying hydrological dynamic details and includes unverified entries, limiting the number of reservoirs used. Although our study assumes stationary TRD, the static TRD effectively defines the minimum drought duration required to deplete reservoirs below critical storage levels, but it limits the ability to capture the future dynamic reservoir operations during drought. In the era of ongoing dam construction, time-varying TRD is essential for understanding how reservoir strategies influence water scarcity, but such data are currently unavailable. The interaction between socio-physical drivers and reservoir management is essential for defining compound climate extreme events23,66 and assessing DZD impact. Despite data limitations, our approach provides a practical and reproducible framework for vulnerability assessment.

The reconstruction of historical total water consumption data (1850–2009) assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and overlooks historical disruptions like wars, technological innovations, or abrupt policy changes. Moreover, the reliance on a scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. These assumptions affect the accuracy of past water use estimates. Addressing these data gaps will help refine water scarcity risk analysis in the context of climate and socio-economic change.

This study reveals when and where DZD may first emerge under climate change, emphasizing the importance of the compound drought duration and reservoirs40 in driving the severity of long-term drought-driven water scarcity and the unprecedented nature of these events. Excluding these factors delays ToFE, particularly in reservoir-dependent regions (Supplementary Fig. 12). Integrating reservoir response and drought persistence dynamics into future models will improve the relevance and robustness of water scarcity for near- and long-term assessments while considering risk and mitigation benefits. Our findings align closely with Stolte et al.67, highlighting the increase in the likelihood of urban drought in the future, a potential driver of urban DZD. In addition, it is important to consider the impact of upstream land use change, as it can intensify the effects of drought and exacerbate water scarcity in downstream areas26.

Unlike broader water scarcity metrics like the Falkenmark indicator, used by Liu et al.39, which use per capita water availability and relative population demand, our approach incorporates sector-specific water use and regional imbalance between supply and sectoral consumption (via SWSI) under human-induced climate. Note that SWSI on its own can identify water scarcity driven by high water consumption, but that can occur without climate-caused drought conditions. This distinction is important in the context of our study, as we define DZD as a prolonged anthropogenic drought-driven water scarcity caused by socio-physical factors, including water supply, human-made reservoirs, lakes, and sectoral water consumption. Therefore, it is essential to consider multiple indicators for assessing extreme events68, including SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48. Although this study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, incorporating water quality and environmental flows, as highlighted by Liu et al.9, is critical for a holistic understanding of future water risks.

Using the FAR method, we found that the contribution of human-induced climate change to DZD increases throughout the twenty-first century (Supplementary Fig. 9). Identifying ToFE with a very high attribution confidence (FAR ≥ 0.99) of human-induced signal relative to the pre-industrial period (1850–1899) provides robust scientific attribution, but it offers limited practical guidance for planning and adaptation, since most water infrastructure and management systems were designed based on the late twentieth-century (Supplementary Fig. 6) climatic conditions rather than pre-industrial norms. Regions with FAR < 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. 19) may still face DZD in the future, but with weaker anthropogenic attribution.

DZD, which has threatened Cape Town, is a multifaceted crisis that disproportionately affects low-income communities and exacerbates socio-economic inequalities69. It affects the domestic water supply, particularly in urban areas, with cascading effects on public health and societal risk. The impacts of drought vary across regions and sectors, with the least developed countries most vulnerable due to disparities in physical, social, economic, and knowledge-based factors70. In agriculture, DZD can reduce crop yields, threaten food security, and impact livestock through water and feed shortages. The need for sustainable irrigation of economically water-scarce cropland is critical to alleviating food insecurity71. Water-reliant industries and hydropower regions, including mining, can risk operational disruptions, energy shortages, and economic losses. Prolonged drought can degrade freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, compromising water quality, biodiversity, and long-term ecological resilience. These cross-sectoral impacts underscore the need for integrated potential solutions29 and adaptation strategies with equitable water governance and management58 at a regional scale. To support such efforts and reduce uncertainty in water scarcity assessment, expanded hydrological simulations across diverse models and emission scenarios are urgently needed.

We use climate projection data from the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) simulation72. This is a 100-member single-model ensemble simulation using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP3-7.0 scenario covering the period 1850 through 2100. The atmospheric data have a 1-degree spatial resolution, which serves as the reference for the interpolation of all CESM2-LE variables used in this study to ensure the consistency across datasets for the spatial analysis. We use monthly mean data, derived from daily data, including average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and total precipitation from CESM2-LE. We also use river discharge (Supplementary Fig. 2) over land from the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), the CESM2-LE river model component. In addition, we use the same variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5-Land) within the period 1979–2022, as well as river discharge data from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) hydrological time series forced with ERA5 meteorological reanalysis (GloFAS-ERA5). To assess the sensitivity of our results to model structure and emission scenarios, we also include simulations from the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under both SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. For consistency, we analyze 10 ensemble members available for each scenario and consider the same hydroclimatic variables as used with CESM2-LE. Due to the coarser spatial resolution and limited ensemble size of the CNRM simulations relative to CESM2-LE, the CNRM model is used exclusively for sensitivity analysis of the event emergence time. The CESM2-LE large ensemble enables us to compute probabilistic estimates of the ToFE, duration, and waiting time of extreme events. Our 100-member CESM2 large ensemble provides enough data to robustly estimate extreme event statistics. Only CESM2-LE and CNRM provide the variables necessary for our analysis, so other large ensemble simulations cannot be used in our study.

We use the global reservoirs database, which includes information on reservoir location, capacity, and the long-term average discharge (1971–2000) available from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD)73 database. The global reservoir database includes both reservoirs constructed by humans and natural lakes, according to Lehner et al.73. The GRanD database version 1.3 was used due to its highly adaptable geodatabase that offers expanded attribute coverage and spatial precision, making it possible to implement regional or global analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution73,74,75. We assigned reservoirs to the closest grid point in CESM2-LE to facilitate integration with climate model outputs.

The monthly global gridded water consumption data for sectoral water use under SSP3 and SSP2, and the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario, RCP6.0 and RCP4.5, covering the period from 2010 to 2100, were downloaded from Khan et al.76. Both scenarios are available from the same five Global Climate Models (GCMs): GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM. We use the available SSP3-RCP6.0 data due to the unavailability of sectoral water use data for SSP3-RCP7.0. We consider the available water demand data from different sectors, such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, to capture the socio-economic development water use demand. To our knowledge, there are no global historical and observed data for sectoral water consumption, covering in particular domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, for the historical period from 1850 to 2009. This lack of historical and observational data represents a major challenge for the analysis of long-term water demand. Therefore, we reconstruct the water consumption data from 1850 to 2009 using a backward nonlinear logarithmic regression approach based on the Dose-Response Curve (DRC) model in R77. The model is trained with each specific month of future water consumption for the period 2010–2100 and then applied to predict past values. Specifically, the logarithmic curve DRC.logCurve() function is used to estimate water consumption for each month of the year for the period 1850–2009. This approach is implemented for each grid point from the global climate models provided by Khan et al.76 to obtain a monthly gridded long-time series of water demand for the study period, from 1850 to 2100, for each grid. Importantly, to preserve the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, the nonlinear model was fitted independently for each month: for example, the curve was fitted using all January values from 2010–2100 to reconstruct the backward trend for January from 2009 to 1850; this process was repeated separately for each calendar month (January to December), in each grid cell of each GCMs. This method allows us to generate plausible historical estimates that align with the socio-economic trends incorporated in the scenario data, while recognizing the associated uncertainties. We acknowledge that this method introduces uncertainties as it assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and does not explicitly account for unexpected historical disruptions in water use patterns or development pathways, such as technological innovations or abrupt policy changes. Additionally, the reliance on the scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. Despite these limitations, this reconstruction approach offers an estimate of historical water consumption trends, maintaining spatial, temporal, and sectoral variability. The spatial patterns and temporal evolution of water demand, along with inter-period differences, are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 3. These reconstructed datasets serve as structured estimates to support consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial resolution of all data is interpolated to the CESM2-LE and CNRM resolution using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the Climate Data Operator78 (CDO) for their respective analysis.

We also use global spatial population datasets from the history database of the global environment (HYDE), version HYDE3.3 from Klein Goldewijk et al.79, to assess the population exposure from 1900 to 2009 at decadal intervals. In addition to that, we use the global spatial population projections SSP3 scenario obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)80, from 2010 to 2100, at decadal intervals to assess the future population exposure. The population datasets were interpolated to a 1-degree spatial resolution for our study, the same grid as CESM2-LE, using the sum of the source points remapping (remapsum) method from the CDO to conserve the total sum of the population.

The drought index, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), is a widely used indicator for investigating drought characteristics81,82,83,84,85,86, including onset, duration, and magnitude. This study uses the SPEI to quantify and classify drought severity due to its capacity to reflect the change in water deficiency. The index does not account for actual water losses from the land surface but considers potential evapotranspiration (PET), a significant factor87 in the future risk of extreme drought83, making it more robust in categorizing drought and detecting its onset and evolution in the context of global warming88 due to its contribution to the interaction of land-atmosphere conditions and drought87. Thus, the monthly gridded SPEI was obtained through the method proposed by Vicente-Serrano et al.88 using the modified Hargreaves method89 to investigate the importance of the range of maximum and minimum temperatures in drought conditions. Moreover, the SPEI allows comparisons between regions across different climatic conditions and considers the onset and duration of drought. The SPEI can be used to investigate the impact of prolonged multi-year drought trends on hydrological and ecological variables, as well as on water storage deficits90,91. SPEI can effectively be utilized to depict the hydrological drought on a longer time scale91. However, hydrological drought is a complex phenomenon involving various factors92,93,94 such as runoff or stream flow95, water balance, human activities, and water demand. The interaction between precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, recharge, groundwater, and discharge has been known65, but its application to drought is relatively recent. Thus, the causes of hydrological drought are complicated as they involve the atmosphere and hydrological processes that supply moisture to the atmosphere, contribute to water storage, and generate runoff to streams93. In addition, the streamflow drought will be defined as a multi-year insufficient river discharge, as most of the water supply comes in the form of river flow or runoff after all surface physical processes have been completed. In snow-fed river systems, river flow can still act as a water supply independent of immediate precipitation inputs. For instance, during periods of low precipitation, melting snow can sustain river flow. This is where the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI) plays a crucial role, as it captures river drought conditions based on streamflow variations, reflecting both precipitation-driven and non-precipitation-driven water inputs. Therefore, we use a single input standardized drought index, called SRFI, the same as Vicente-Serrano et al.96, to represent and categorize the severity of the river flow resource depletion. The river discharge data was used as the input to calculate SRFI. The concept of the calculation of SPEI and SRFI is made by fitting an empirical cumulative distribution function to reference periods (1979–2014), using the spei() function in R as proposed by Begueria and Vicente-Serrano97. The fitted distribution is then applied to the monthly cumulative precipitation-evapotranspiration (SPEI) or streamflow (SRFI) to obtain cumulative probabilities, which are transformed into a standard normal distribution. This process effectively standardizes the data relative to the reference period (1979–2014), allowing for easy interpretation. Both drought indices, SPEI and SRFI, were computed at a 48-month timescale for each grid cell in every ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, covering the period from 1850 to 2100.

To investigate the degree of water scarcity, we adopt the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI), which is conceptually equivalent to the Supply and Demand Balance Index introduced by Huang and Yin98, to represent the overexploitation of the water resources when the demand exceeds the supply. This index captures the imbalance between water availability and demand by taking the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption. The SWSI with a time scale of 48 months is used. The SWSI was chosen due to its capacity to represent the dynamic processes98 between the interaction of the water supply and demand for domestic usage and production in a region. The SWSI48 is the ratio of the 48-month accumulated total water supply and 48-month accumulated total water demand. The total water supply is estimated as the sum of surface water resources, including river flow and the net water balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration), representing the available freshwater availability. The total water demand is the sum of water consumption from all sectors, such as domestic (dom), irrigation (irrig), industry (ind), electricity (elec), livestock (liv), and mining (min). Therefore, to calculate SWSI48, the total water consumption from the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) provided by Khan et al.76 (GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM) is randomly distributed across the total water supply from the CESM2-LE and CNRM (see Supplementary Fig. 1 for further details).

where TWS is the total water supply, Prec represents the precipitation, E is for evapotranspiration, flow for the river flow, and TWC represents the total water consumption.

The definition of water scarcity from Huang and Yin98 is used for the degree of SWSI48, as extreme lack of water [0,0.3], acute shortage of water [0.3,0.6], moderate water shortage [0.6,0.9], slight shortage of water [0.9,1], and no shortage of water [≥1].

To assess the interdependence among the water stress indicators used in this study, we computed spatial correlations between the ensemble means of the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 derived from CESM2-LE simulations over the period 1850–2100. All-time series were detrended to remove systematic long-term trends associated with climate change and ensure that correlations reflect interdependence among the indicators. Supplementary Fig. 4 shows strong positive correlations across most regions, indicating that the water stress tends to vary together over the multi-year time scales of 48 months. In contrast, the negative correlations between SPEI48 and SWSI48, and between SRFI48 and SWSI48, are generally weak, particularly across Africa, reflecting the influence of non-climatic drivers such as water demand on SWSI48. Overall, both weak positive and negative correlations are observed in many regions, suggesting a more complex relationship between climate-driven drought indicators (SPEI48 and SWSI48, and SRFI48 and SWSI48).

In order to minimize the model errors, this study used a bias correction method to reduce model bias. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows a more detailed structure of the steps in the methods and the processes used in this study. The monthly database from ERA5-Land (1979–2022) was used to calculate ERA5's SPEI48 and SRFI48, with 1979–2014 as the reference period, which is used as the observational drought indices reference to calibrate the drought indices for each ensemble member of CESM2-LE individually. Although observational sources are the best to achieve the ideal bias correction, we opted for reanalysis products because they consistently assimilate a variety of variables in a physically consistent manner, and it is assumed to be close to observed data. This choice ensures global coverage and temporal completeness, particularly important in data-sparse regions or for long historical records where high-quality observational data are unavailable or inconsistent. The ERA5-Land dataset was found to be a trustworthy reference to calibrate CESM2-LE indices. In order to increase our confidence in future extreme drought projections, we applied the univariate Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), as Ansari et al.99 found it to be more robust for the correction of indices. Supplementary Fig. 14 shows that direct correction (post-processing QDM) of the drought indices as a single variable reduces the bias between ERA's SPEI48 and the ensemble mean of the CESM2-LE's SPEI48 and manages to capture the distribution of SPEI48. In addition, Van de Velde et al.100 stated that the simpler univariate BC methods are better to use for climate change impact assessment, as the multivariate BC methods failed to handle non-stationary climate conditions. This approach maintains the model-projected climate change signal while simultaneously correcting the distributional biases. The QDM bias correction method, introduced by Cannon et al.101, is a cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based bias correction method designed specifically to reduce the biases between the modeled and observed distribution of drought indices, while preserving the model-projected climate change signal. The additive form of QDM is applied to bias correct the systematic biases in each quantile of the drought indices calculated from the CESM2-LE and CNRM simulations, using the ERA-derived indices as observational references while preserving the model-projected absolute changes across all quantiles of the distribution. The important concept of QDM is its ability to maintain the trend in all the quantiles within the distribution of the climate model output, which is important when future changes are not uniform across the distribution. It is used to quantile detrend the model projections and adjust distributional biases in model projections, ensuring the sensitivity of the underlying climate model without affecting the distribution101,102,103. The QDM begins by identifying the corresponding quantiles of the observed, model historical (or reference for the calibration), and the model future projection, as a corresponding quantile-based correction derived from the model-observation mapping. Instead of directly fitting the full distribution of the future model, QDM quantifies the change at each quantile between the historical and future period model values at that same quantile level. These changes are then applied to the observed value at the corresponding quantile, retrieved using the inverse CDF of the observed data. This allows distribution biases to be corrected while maintaining quantile-specific climate change signals, thus preserving the sensitivity of the climate model. The univariate bias correction was performed using the QDM method available in the Multivariate Bias Correction (MBC) package in R. For each grid cell, drought indices from each member of the CESM-LE and CNRM are corrected independently, using their quantile location relative to the observed (ERA5) drought indices. Specifically, each value of SPEI48 and SRFI48, computed from each grid cell of every ensemble member of the CESM2-LE and CNRM datasets, within the period 1850-2100, is corrected as a single variable following the direct QDM approach, respectively. To correct the bias in SWSI48, we applied the univariate QDM method to the total water supply (precipitation-evapotranspiration + river discharge) at each grid cell of each ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, treated as a single aggregated time series rather than bias-correcting each individual component (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge). This aggregated variable represents the net variable water and is more relevant for capturing water scarcity as reflected in SWSI48. We could not apply the bias correction of the total water demand (consumption) due to the unavailability of consistent observed sectoral water use data across the historical period at the global scale.

To assess the effect of different bias correction strategies, we evaluated both pre- and post-processing approaches using CESM2-LE under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 14, post-processing (i.e., direct bias correction of SPEI, Supplementary Fig. 14c) better captures the distribution of SPEI from ERA5 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), while pre-processing (i.e., bias correction of precipitation and temperatures prior to computing the index; Supplementary Fig. 14d) tends to introduce additional bias, particularly by amplifying wet conditions. These results support the effectiveness of the post-processing approach in preserving the observed statistical properties of the drought indices.

Furthermore, we evaluated the distributional properties of the corrected indices using Q-Q plots, shown in Supplementary Fig. 14e–j. These plots compared the quantiles of SPEI48 from CESM2-LE (with and without correction) and ERA5, both at the global mean scale and for a representative grid point (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°). The Q-Q plot revealed that the bias-corrected indices closely follow the normal distribution, especially compared to the raw model output. At the grid level (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°), the correction successfully adjusted for extreme droughts and ensured consistency with observed drought characteristics.

Overall, our bias correction method effectively improves the distributional agreement between CESM2-LE and ERA5, while maintaining long-term trends. This provides a more accurate basis for assessing drought characteristics and their implications for water scarcity under historical and future climate conditions. As with most bias correction methods, QDM has limitations, as it assumes that model biases are relative to the present reference dataset, which may change in the future. Although this assumption simplifies the correction process, it may not hold under evolving climate conditions.

An important aspect of drought impacts is the availability of water in reservoirs. The onset of drought conditions and continuing water demand will also affect reservoir water levels. To assess the severity of the drought events, we have to also consider the Time for the Reservoir to Dry (TRD) as the ratio of the maximum capacity and the monthly average discharge at reservoir locations, by considering only the reservoirs with verified, good and fair quality index73, which represents 93% of the GRanD' reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. 5).

For human-made reservoirs, the maximum capacity refers to the maximum value of the storage capacity, and for natural lakes, it is the given lake level by Lehner et al.73. The lack of water level time series in the reservoirs makes it hard to estimate the time scales by which they might run dry. Instead of the available capacity of the reservoir (maximum minus minimum capacity), the maximum capacity was used because it was a readily available parameter for most reservoirs and due to the lack of the points layer of minimum capacity in the GRanD database. Moreover, climate change may alter the future operation of reservoirs, so using the maximum capacity is useful for assessing the suitability of water storage strategies. The TRD is similar to the resident time (time of water spent in reservoirs) and can be considered as the duration to take for a drought event to dry the water in the reservoirs if the only source of the water supply of the reservoirs is the depleted river flow during a drought period. This reflects hydrological drought situations in which rivers continue to flow, albeit at diminished levels insufficient to meet water demand, allowing assessment of how long reservoirs can sustain supply under such stress.

We define the compound multi-year drought, based on the IPCC104 definition of a compound event, as extended periods, often spanning several years (e.g., 48 months or 4 years for this study), during which multiple hydrological indicators, such as long-term rainfall deficiency, streamflow, water demand, and reservoir storage, experience simultaneous and persistent deficits. Here, these droughts are characterized by the concurrent occurrence of below-normal water availability across various hydrological systems, exacerbated by interrelated factors such as reduced precipitation with increased evapotranspiration (SPEI48), increase in water consumption (SWSI48), and depleted river flow (SRFI48). The compound nature of these events indicates the presence of multiple interacting drivers that collectively intensify water scarcity over a prolonged period.

We define “Day zero drought” (DZD) as an acute water scarcity event driven by a compound multi-year hydrological drought, during which water demand exceeds water supply under prolonged drought conditions. DZD occurs due to a critical imbalance between supply and demand, driven both by climate-induced reduction in supply and anthropogenic pressures increasing demand.

In fact, water can be retained in the reservoir through different parts of the hydrological cycle and different resident times (time of water spent in reservoirs) considered similar to TRD. As the river flow contributes to the long-term storage of water in the reservoir, we considered the river discharge to be an appropriate parameter. DZD is the impact of the simultaneous occurrence of a long-term (48-month) critical rainfall deficiency and extreme dearth of water of low-flow river discharge during a prolonged drought in the context of global warming and long duration exceeding the time for the reservoirs to run out of water. This is formalized as follows:

where \({{dur}}_{{ce}}\) is the duration of the compound extreme. The identification of DZD was carried out at each grid cell across each of the 100 members of the CESM2-LE model, offering a comprehensive and probabilistic perspective on future water scarcity risk.

However, global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the variability of the water cycle16, leading to increasingly frequent and severe fluctuations between excessively wet and dry periods17. Warmer climates are projected to enhance the evapotranspiration, resulting in dry conditions18. Additionally, reductions in precipitation and surface runoff are expected in many regions16, further increasing the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological droughts19,20,21,22. Moreover, population growth, economic development, and expansion of modern agriculture drive the rise in water consumption, placing additional pressure on water resources. Therefore, dry conditions driven by anthropogenic climate change and socio-economic development are jointly altering the global balance between water supply and demand, thereby amplifying the risk of DZD. Our concept distinguishes between drought and water scarcity, while also capturing their interaction in driving the DZD event. Drought refers to a reduction in water availability either through decreased precipitation, increased evaporation, or reduced river flow. In contrast, water scarcity arises when water demand exceeds the available water supply. Water Scarcity is often human-driven from anthropogenic pressure, such as population, growth, agricultural expansion, industrial use, and mismanagement of water resources. Water scarcity can occur even in the absence of climate change if water use is unsustainable. In this study, we focused on water scarcity driven by drought, where the reduction of water supply is driven by dry conditions. In this context, the water stress is considered as a result of a compound event due to atmospheric conditions (precipitation and evaporative demand; SPEI48), streamflow conditions (SRFI48), and demand condition (SWSI48) of 48-months occur with important depletion of water supply and increase of water demand; and where the duration of the event is longer than the time of the closest reservoirs to dry (TRD). This study offers a global-scale assessment of DZD emergence and its characteristics, capturing the interactions between climate human-driven factors.

Therefore, DZD is considered as an extreme water scarcity event, characterized by the fact that the water resources available in a region are largely below the limited reservoir's capacity compared to the pre-industrial period. This is attributed to both anthropogenic climate change and an increase in water use. To our knowledge, this study is the first global-scale assessment of the timing of the emergence of Day Zero Drought conditions and its characteristics. DZD is characterized by the concurrent exceedance of critical threshold in four indicators: (1) The standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48) below minus 1.5 (SPEI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviations, signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts to classify the arid atmospheric condition, through prolonged deficits in precipitation and increased evapotranspiration, leading to a long-term surface water stress and can significantly influence the change in groundwater (Supplementary Fig. 13). (2) The Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) below minus 1.5 (SRFI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviation), signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts, to detect the depletion of river flow conditions, representing the state of the severe drought in river flow during dry periods. (3) The Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) below 0.6 (SWSI48 ≤0.6) is used to quantify the imbalance between total water supply and demand and to represent the long-term average insufficiency of resources relative to demand during periods of drought, leading to an acute water scarcity. (4) The duration of the compound event (\({{{{\rm{dur}}}}}_{{{{\rm{ce}}}}}\)) exceeding the estimated time for reservoir depletion (TRD), when reservoirs exist. If no reservoir is present, the DZD is defined by the first three indicators. This framework reflects the reality that water scarcity emerges from the convergence of multiple stressors. Each indicator plays a distinct but interrelated role in defining DZD; therefore, none is weighted as more important than another. Their simultaneous exceedance is necessary to identify a DZD event, filtering out less severe or isolated events. For instance, precipitation deficits alone may not result in a crisis without demand pressure. i.e., in low low-demand case, just as high demand may not lead to scarcity if the supply is still enough. Similarly, even in the absence of climate variability, unsustainable consumption alone can trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource.

To evaluate the CESM2-LE ability to reproduce observed compound drought conditions, we compared the spatial distribution of compound hydrological extremes computed from the ERA5-Land reanalysis and CESM2-LE (ensemble mean of the number of compound hydrological events) data for the period 1979–2022. Specifically, we examined the number of occurrences where both 48-month scales of Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration (SPEI48) and Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) were less than or equal to −1.5. This threshold represents severe to extreme dry conditions. Instead of comparing the ToFE of compound events, we investigate the number of events of joint occurrences with \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5 \cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\). Due to the lack of observed data on total water consumption across all sectors (domestic, irrigation, industrial, electricity generation, livestock, and mining), we were unable to include the 48-month Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) in this observation comparison. The result (Supplementary Fig. 18) indicates that CESM-LE reasonably captures the spatial patterns of compound events defined by \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5 \cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\), as observed in ERA5. Although ERA5 exhibits slightly more compound events overall, the CESM2-LE ensemble mean estimates comparably and even exceeds ERA5 over China and Russia, indicating possible regional differences in model response.

In this study, we use the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) of the joint probability to define the Time of the First Emergence (ToFE) of the DZD. FAR has been found to be effective in identifying the anthropogenic signal behind extreme events105,106,107 such as DZD. According to Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al.105, FAR can be useful for understanding climate change signals, but more useful results are achieved by refocusing attribution questions on changes in impact return value and magnitude across large samples. To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of ToFE of the DZD relative to the anthropogenic signal with a predefined threshold of joint probability by FAR has not yet been carried out. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative method to assess the ToFE of compound extreme events by considering human-induced attribution. Few studies have used different alternatives to define or identify the ToFE when the hydrological drought differs from their past counterparts38. We are aware that even with such different methods, including our method here, uncertainties may arise, for example, due to internal variability108 or the considered scenarios109. By applying the FAR method, we measure the influence of anthropogenic climate change by comparing the probability of occurrence of DZD in the baseline period (pre-industrial period: 1850–1899) with the anthropogenic forcing period. We identify DZD events using a threshold-based approach, as outlined in Eq. (3). This ensures that the events are derived from the indices (SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48) and reflect extreme drought event conditions and acute water scarcity. By applying a threshold-based approach, we transform the continuous drought indices into distinct, binary events (e.g., DZD or no DZD). Which aligns with the requirements for FAR analysis. Once the DZD events are identified, the events are treated as independent occurrences, ensuring that the FAR method is aligned with its intended purpose of analyzing distinct extreme events. The calculation of the probability of the forcing events has been conducted on decadal time scales. The FAR is based on the change in the occurrence of an independent event, which is quantified by dividing the probability of independent DZD events in the future by the preindustrial condition.

Where \({P}_{{preindustrial}}\) represents the probability of the counterfactual scenario, which is calculated as the ratio between the total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensemble members during the preindustrial period (1850–1899) and the total number of samples within the same period (\({N}_{{preindustrial}}\)). While \({P}_{{forcing}}(t)\) represents the probability under the factual scenario, which is the ratio between the decadal total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensembles during each decade from 1900 to 2100 and the total number of samples during that decade (\({N}_{{forcing}}(t)\)). The ToFE of DZD is identified as the first decade in which the FAR is greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. 6). We computed the ToFE by considering the year of construction of a reservoir. Each reservoir has a different year of construction; therefore, if a reservoir existed in the considered grid point, the DZD detection period would extend from the year of completion to 2100. But if there is no reservoir, we use 1900–2100. Hence, we aim to detect events that have not occurred during the preindustrial period, but which will occur and intensify in the future as a result of anthropogenic global warming. In that sense, we identify unprecedented hydrological extreme events.

While the ToFE is an important measure of global warming impacts, its true impact is measured by how long these events last and how soon they will re-occur once they have emerged for the first time. The length of time of a DZD event is defined as the DZD duration, while the waiting time is identified as the time elapsed between the end of the previous event and the start of the next consecutive DZD event, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 8. To quantify these characteristics, we calculate the DZD duration and waiting time at each grid cell globally across the CESM2-LE for all ensemble members. We calculate the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE under anthropogenic influence until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated by the length of a DZD event once it occurs.

In addition, we assess the frequency of extreme DZD conditions, characterized by events that are both frequent and prolonged. Specifically, for each grid point and each ensemble member of CESM2-LE, we identify all DZD events occurring between the decade of ToFE and the year 2100. We then count the number of DZD event where its duration exceeds the waiting time, i.e., cases where the DZD event persists longer than the recovery period before the next event. These counts are aggregated at each grid across all 100 members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100. The frequency of extreme DZD conditions is computed at each grid cell as the ratio of the sum of these events to the total DZD events across all members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100 period. This spatially explicit frequency is then mapped globally (Fig. 3c) to highlight regions most vulnerable to sustained and recurrent DZD conditions.

For each DZD-prone region shown in central spatial map of Fig. 3, we then average the values across all grids located within the regions. To characterize the statistical distribution of these metrics, we fit probability density functions (PDFs) to the distributions of DZD duration and waiting time.

The ToFE depends partly on the used global warming scenario. In order to provide an alternative view, we also estimated the global warming levels at each DZD event emergence. We use the method proposed by Batibeniz et al.110 to calculate the GWL, but for this study, we consider the difference between the global 30-year climatology backward on the analyzed decade (1900–2100) and the global mean temperature of the pre-industrial period (1850–1899). The GWL is the value of the GWL in the decade of ToFE.

We tested the sensitivity of ToFE to six factors. Firstly, the threshold for defining the multi-year compound drought can influence the detection of DZD. Therefore, to test the robustness of the DZD definition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using different thresholds for SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 (Supplementary Fig. 10). First, we modified the SPEI48 threshold to be below −2 and kept SRFI48 below −1.5 and SWSI48 below 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10a, i). The ToFE emerges later than in Fig. 2a, particularly in Africa, where ToFE is sensitive to SPEI48, i.e., to the decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration. Next, we slightly changed SRFI48 to be below −1.6, SPEI48 to be below −2, and kept SWSI48 below 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 10b, j). The ToFE remains almost the same, and the ToFE emerges later by increasing the severity of SRFI48 to be below −2 (Supplementary Fig. 10c, k), particularly in the northern part of Africa. Then, as we continued to modify SRFI48 so that it is less than −1 (Supplementary Fig. 10d, l), the ToFE becomes earlier than Fig. 2a, mostly in the northern part of Africa. The ToFE is sensitive to the severity of the streamflow drought in Africa. After that, we repeated the same analysis, but considering SWSI48 less than 1, SPEI48 less than −2, and SRFI48 below −1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 10e, m); while SRFI48 below 1.6 for Supplementary Fig. 10f, n. The results show that ToFE is more likely to start earlier than Fig. 2a in a few regions, meaning that ToFE is more likely to be sensitive to streamflow depletion (SRFI48) and increased water consumption (SWSI48). In the latter case, we kept SPEI48 below −1.5 and SRFI48 below −2 with SWSI48 below 1 for Supplementary Fig. 10g, o; and SWSI48 below 0.6 for Supplementary Fig. 10h, p. The results show the sensitivity of the ToFE to SRFI48 and SWSI48; thus, the ToFE emerges later than Fig. 2a in Africa but earlier in other regions. Therefore, we can conclude that the ToFE of DZD is more sensitive to the severity of decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration (SPEI48), the river flow drought (SRFI48) and increasing water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa, while increasing water consumption solely have an impact on the early emergence of ToFE in some parts of Asia and America, compared to the other factor. The SRFI48 and SWSI48 are more closely related to the actual availability of river flow and water use, respectively. When water demand rises, the available water supply (e.g., river flow, even if unaffected by precipitation) becomes insufficient to meet demand, triggering drought-like conditions (or water scarcity) in terms of availability.

Secondly, to assess whether the treatment of grid cells with and without (as defined in Eq. (3) for DZD) or solely without reservoir (DZD is defined as a compound event of \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\,\cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\cap {{{\rm{SWSI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}0.6\)), introduces inconsistencies in the spatial patterns of ToFE, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing ToFE patterns (Supplementary Fig. 12). The results reveal that spatial differences are negligible in most regions. The most noticeable delays are confined to the Mediterranean region, where major reservoirs constructions were completed mid- to late-twentieth century (Supplementary Fig. 6). As climate change influences the onset of compound events, it is critical for decision-makers to revisit the role of existing water infrastructure in future water security planning. The application of FAR greater than 0.99, combined with localized reservoir adjustment of DZD detection, ensures that the global ToFE pattern represents both high attribution confidence and hydrological realism, without introducing methodological biases between grid cells with and without reservoirs.

Thirdly, the estimation of the TRD may influence the ToFE of DZD. The TRD is considered as the duration to take for a multi-compound drought event to dry the water in the reservoirs if the only source of the water supply of the reservoirs is river flow during a drought period. Our approach seems to be reasonable, and we also checked the sensitivity of our assumption by doubling and quadrupling the TRD time scale (Supplementary Fig. 11). The results show that only a few regions have a small change of one decade with increased TRD. However, the TRD is also influenced by various socio-economic factors, such as water demand and the socio-economic sectoral usage, which we address using the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48). It is important to note that political decisions regarding management were not included in this modeling approach.

Fourthly, we have looked at the sensitivity of the time scale by considering the 36- and 60-month time scales (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16) of long-duration compound events for SPEI, SRFI, and SWSI. Only a few regions, located almost entirely in Africa, show changes in ToFE using a 36 or 60-month timescale of extreme events, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 17.

Fifthly, we look at the sensitivity of the ToFE relative to model structure across the CESM2-LE members. We repeat the analysis, looking at the model uncertainty by looking for the ToFE for each member in CESM2-LE, based on the following formulation of FAR below (Eq. (5)). This allows us to examine the spread of emerging timing of Fay Zero Droughts (DZD) and to evaluate the inter-member agreement as shown in Supplementary Fig. 20. The result exhibit, Supplementary Fig. 20a, substantial variability among ensemble members between 1900 and 1990, reflecting high uncertainty during this early period when the anthropogenic signal is still weak relative to internal variability, showing that structural uncertainty arising from the use of a single model remains an important caveat. However, a strong ensemble consensus emerged after 2000, with most members indicating emergence between 2020 and 2030, and increasing agreement toward the end of the twenty-first century. Individual ensemble members (thin green lines) show very synchronized emergence between 2030–2040. There is a sharp, narrow peak, indicating low ensemble spread and high confidence in ToFE under strong forcing. This coherence across members supports the robustness of our findings in terms of both timing and magnitude of anthropogenic influence on DZD events in CESM2-LE under SSP3-7.0.

Where \({P}_{{preindustrial},i}\) is the probability of the counterfactual for member i, which is the ratio between the summation of the event of the DZD event within the preindustrial period (1850-1899) and the number of samples within the same period (\({N}_{{preindustrial}}\)). While \({P}_{{forcing},i}(t)\) is the probability of the factual for member i, which is the ratio between the decadal summation of the frequency of the DZD event of the member i during each decade from 1900 to 2100 and the number of samples during the decade (\({N}_{{forcing}}(t)\)). The ToFE of DZD has been considered as the first decade of FAR greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs.

Sixthly, to evaluate the influence of model structural uncertainty on the ToFE of DZD events, we extended our analysis beyond CESM2-LE by using hydro-climatic data from the Centre National de Recherche Météorologiques (CNRM) models (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 with 1.4 ×1.4 degrees) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Specifically, we analyzed simulations under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, including monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, and river discharge data spanning 1850-2100. Due to the unavailability of water demand projections under SSP3-7.0, we used water consumption estimates from SSP3-RCP6.0 across the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM, which account for sectoral water use sectors such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, capturing socio-economic development water use demand. We applied the same methodology used for CESM2-LE. Computing the three key indicators, the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applying quantile delta mapping (QDM) bias correction using drought indices ERA5-based references. To ensure methodological consistency and data completeness, we selected 10 ensemble members from the CNRM model that include both atmospheric and river discharge variables across historical and both SSP2-45 and SSP3-7.0 future scenarios: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). We use the methods as structured estimates that enable consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial resolution of the datasets is interpolated to the CNRM atmospheric model resolution (1.4° x 1.4°) using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the Climate Data Operator78 (CDO).

The spatial patterns (Supplementary Fig. 21) reveal pronounced inter-model and scenario differences. Results from the CNRM model indicate that, under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, 51% of DZD-affected regions are projected to face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020–2030 (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c). Compared to CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 21a), which projects later DZD emergence and a more geographically confined hotspot, especially in the Mediterranean, the United States of America (USA), and Africa, the CNRM model (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c) shows earlier and more widespread emergence. The inter-model comparison (Supplementary Fig. 21d, e) reveals that CESM2-LE and CNRM disagree on the emergence of DZD in 76% of DZD-prone regions, indicating that emergence is detected in only one of the two models in some areas. Notably, 14% of ToFE show later emergence under CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 21d), even under the same forcing scenario (SSP3-7.0), suggesting that CESM2-LE is more conservative in detecting later emergence of compound hydrological extremes. However, CESM2-LE and CNRM agree on DZD occurrence across 24% of the DZD-prone land area, though within this overlap, CESM2-LE projects later emergence over 14% of the area and earlier emergence over 10% compared to CNRM. Moreover, ensemble spread within CNRM (Supplementary Fig. 20b, c) also illustrates the variability among the models to detect the water scarcity. The PDFs of individual members are more dispersed, with multiple peaks and flatter. The thick green line (representing ToFE derived from Eq. (4)) is broader and flatter, indicating the variability in ToFE across ensemble members, reflecting uncertainty in the timing of DZD emergence across members. This variability emphasized the challenge of detecting a robust probabilistic signal from a limited ensemble size. These findings highlight the critical role of model structural differences in shaping projections of hydrological extremes. Importantly, probabilistic attribution methods, such as the FAR, require large ensemble sizes to confidently characterize forced emergence signals. The relatively small ensemble available for CNRM under SSP3-7.0 limits the reliability of such analysis and reinforces the need for larger and more consistent multi-model ensemble frameworks to assess future water scarcity risks.

Finally, to assess the sensitivity of the ToFE of DZD relative to future socioeconomic scenarios, we applied our detection framework to hydro-climatic simulations from CMIP6 CNRM models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. We utilized the same ensemble members of the CNRM model to ensure consistency: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). The analysis incorporated available water consumption projections from five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM under SSP2-RCP4.5. The approach followed the same methodological steps as applied to CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 1). Specifically, we computed the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applied the bias correction method, QDM, using ERA5-based reference indices, and subsequently determined the ToFE. All datasets are interpolated to the CNRM atmospheric resolution (1.4° × 1.4°) using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the CDO. The results (Supplementary Fig. 20c) reveal substantial spread among ensemble members under CNRM SSP2-4.5, highlighting pronounced uncertainty in DZD emergence timing throughout the twenty-first century. Compared to the higher-emission SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 20b), the emergence is delayed and more dispersed, with broader PDFs and later peaks, suggesting that moderate forcings lead to slower distribution and less certain emergence of water scarcity extremes. When comparing the special pattern of ToFE under CNRM SSP2-4.5 with CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 21e), results show that high spatial disagreement of 76% of land areas exhibit uncertain DZD emergence, meaning that emergence is detected in only one of the models. Only 9% of regions show earlier emergence in CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0, while 14% indicate later emergence relative to CNRM SSP2-4.5. By considering the same model, CNRM, under different scenarios, SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 21f), the uncertainty still dominates but decreases to 43% of the land area, and spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios. Notably, the near-equal split between earlier and later emergence in different regions indicates that scenario choice (SSP3-7.0 vs. SSP2-4.5) may affect ToFE more symmetrically but also underscores the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to combined climate and water use stress. The results show that the influence of emission scenarios on DZD ToFE is region-specific, due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP3-7.0), DZD emergence can either advance or be delayed depending on the region. Notably, spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios, with 43% of the land area remaining uncertain between the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios within the CNRM model. However, both scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, agree on DZD emergence across 57% of the DZD-prone land area. Within this overlap, SSP3-7.0 projects later emergence over 17% of the area and earlier emergence over 18% compared to SSP2-4.5, while 22% of the area shows no change in the ToFE between the two scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 21f). These findings underscore the role of both scenario and model structures in shaping DZD emergence. Notably, even under high-forcing SSP3-7.0, CESM2-LE may still project later ToFE than CNRM under moderate forcing (SSP2-4.5), pointing to differences in model sensitivity to hydro-climatic stressors. This highlights the importance of multi-model and multi-scenario assessments when evaluating risks associated with extreme emergence and water scarcity. Furthermore, a probabilistic approach such as the FAR requires large ensembles to ensure robust estimates. The relatively small ensemble size of CNRM limits the confidence in scenario-attribution results, underscoring the need for ensemble expansion and multi-model convergence to improve attribution robustness and risk quantification. Given these model differences, CESM2-LE provides output at a higher spatial resolution (1.25° × 0.9375°) compared to the lower-resolution CNRM model (1.40625° × 1.40625°). CESM2-LE detects finer-scale features and localized extremes that may be overlooked or underrepresented in the CNRM. Therefore, we have not aggregated events across both CESM2-LE and CNRM, since increasing the CNRM resolution to the resolution of CESM2-LE could introduce spatial biases and distort the representation of extreme events.

All datasets are freely accessible to the public. The CESM2-LE data can be accessed at: https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2, retrieved in August 2022. The ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5-Land) data can be found at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu.

Pregnant people have long relied on paracetamol for pain and fever. Credit: BSIP/Universal Images Group/Getty

The painkiller acetaminophen or paracetamol is one of the most widely taken drugs during pregnancy, used by roughly half of all pregnant people worldwide.

But today the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it would slap a new warning label on the drug, citing a “possible association” between autism in children and the use of acetaminophen, also called Tyenol in the United States, during pregnancy. 

US President Donald Trump, however, was not as nuanced in his language: “Don't take Tylenol,” he said repeatedly in a widely anticipated announcement about autism. “Fight like hell not to take it,” he said.

Autistic people show differences in social communication and interaction, and reported prevalence of autism has risen in some countries in recent decades. But many researchers who study autism caution that there is insufficient data to link autism and acetaminophen and that focusing on such a link is no more than a distraction.

Autism is on the rise: what's really behind the increase?

Autism is on the rise: what's really behind the increase?

“There is no definitive evidence to suggest that paracetamol use in mothers is a cause of autism, and when you see any associations, they are very, very small,” says James Cusack, chief executive of Autistica, a UK autism research and campaigning charity in London, who is autistic. “At the heart of this is people trying to look for simple answers to complex problems.”

At today's announcement, US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, acknowledged that autism has many possible causes. FDA commissioner Martin Makary noted that, in some cases, insufficient transport of the nutrient folate into the brain has been linked with traits common in autism. The FDA today announced that it would initiate approval of a form of folate called leucovorin for people with low levels of folate in the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. 

But Kennedy, a long-time anti-vaccine advocate, and Trump focused their attention today on two other factors that they said could be linked to autism: acetaminophen and vaccines. Decades of research have repeatedly found no reproducible link between vaccines and autism. 

“The evidence does not support a causal link between acetaminophen or vaccines and autism,” says Sura Alwan, a clinical teratologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, and executive director of PEAR-Net Society, a nonprofit advocating for maternal fetal health and research. “Suggesting otherwise may fuel misinformation and undermine confidence in safe treatments and immunizations.”

Here Nature examines the evidence for a link between acetaminophen, which is used to treat fever as well as pain, and autism.

Scientists say that the most robust research does not link autism and acetaminophen use in pregnancy. “The better controlled studies are less likely to find even a small risk,” says Helen Tager-Flusberg, a psychologist who studies autism at Boston University, Massachusetts, “And even then, what we're talking about is a minor association. … We do not think that taking acetaminophen is in any way contributing to actually causing autism.”

Working out whether there is a link between the drug and autism is difficult, says Viktor Ahlqvist, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and co-author of what might be the biggest study1 on the link. The medication is available over the counter, so a lot of usage is not recorded in medical databases. This means researchers rely on self-reports, which can be unreliable.

Confounding factors are an even bigger problem. Women who take paracetamol in pregnancy are usually in poorer health than those who don't, perhaps because they had an infection or an underlying condition. Any apparent link between acetaminophen and autism might therefore be explained by these other health factors rather than the drug itself. Although scientists try to adjust for such confounders in their studies, such adjustments are “rarely sufficient,” Ahlqvist says. This is one reason why studies looking for a link have produced conflicting results.

The study led by Ahlqvist harnessed data on nearly 2.5 million children born in Sweden between 1995 and 2019 and — from the country's extensive health records — data on acetaminophen prescriptions during pregnancy and on self-reported use collected by midwives, as well as whether children later received autism diagnoses.

The study showed that around 1.42% of children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy were autistic, compared to 1.33% of children who were not exposed ─ a “very small” difference, says Ahlqvist.

The team also compared pairs of siblings (born to the same mother), one of whom had been exposed to acetaminophen and one who had not. Siblings share half of their genome, and share a similar upbringing and mother's background health, so any detected difference in autism between siblings is more likely to be due to the drug. The researchers found no association between acetaminophen and autism using this method — which supports the idea that links found in other studies were really explained by confounding factors.

Another large, high-quality study2 from Japan including over 200,000 children — also using sibling comparisons and published this year — found no link between acetaminophen use in pregnancy and autism.

A review3 of studies published in August in the journal Environmental Health concluded that there is an association. But researchers interviewed by Nature point instead to the contrasting results of a review4 of high-quality studies on the topic. That review, published in February, concluded that “in utero exposure to acetaminophen is unlikely to confer a clinically important increased risk” of autism spectrum disorder.

“There is no robust evidence or convincing studies to suggest there is any causal relationship and any conclusions being drawn to the contrary are often motivated, under-evidenced, and unsupported by the most robust methods,” Monique Botha, associate professor in social and developmental psychology at Durham University, UK, said in comments to the Science Media Centre, a UK press office.

“We believe independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,” says a spokesperson for Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue Inc. in Summit, New Jersey.

Cell clusters that resemble the uterine lining grow with support cells in a synthetic hydrogel.Credit: Juan Gnecco, Linda G. Griffith

In 2017, Ashley Moffett, a reproductive immunologist, walked to the pharmacy near her laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK, to buy a pregnancy test. But it wasn't for Moffett. Her postdoc, Margherita Turco, had created what she thought might be the first cluster of cells capable of mimicking the tissue of the placenta — a placental organoid. But she needed a way to be sure.

The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health

“We must do a pregnancy test on them,” Moffett said.

If Turco was correct, the miniature ball of cells she had created would secrete HCG, the hormone that triggers a positive pregnancy test. “I took the stick, put it in, and it was positive,” says Turco, now a reproductive biologist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. “It was the best celebration.”

Scientists make organoids such as this by coaxing stem cells to grow in a jelly-like substance and to self-assemble into clumps of tissue. The typically hollow or solid balls of cells don't look anything like real organs. But they do take on key aspects of the organ that they're meant to represent — liver, brain, lung or stomach, for instance.

The mini-organs have the advantage of being more realistic than a 2D cell culture — the conventional in vitro workhorses — because they behave more like tissue. The cells divide, differentiate, communicate, respond to their environment and, just like in a real organ, die. And, because they contain human cells, they can be more representative than many animal models. “Animals are good models in the generalities, but they start to fall down in the particulars,” says Linda Griffith, a biological engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.

Over the past decade, organoid research has exploded. Researchers have used them to study early brain development, test cancer therapies and much more. And these 3D models stand to become even more crucial as US agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, aim to move away from animal testing.

Now researchers are using organoids to study female reproduction, an area in which animal models can be especially limited. Lab mice, for example, don't menstruate. And their placentas don't develop in the same way as human placentas do. That challenge, along with a historical lack of funding for women's health research, has left basic questions unanswered.

“I really see it as a powerful model to do science,” says Mirjana Kessler, a cell biologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed an organoid that mimics the fallopian tube1 and a biobank of ovarian cancer organoids2.

Organoids of the placenta, endometrium, ovary and vagina could help to reveal how these organs function, and what happens when things go awry.

 “There's so much work to do to understand the normal biology,” Turco says.

The placenta plays a key part in maternal health during pregnancy. Humans aren't the only species that develops a placenta, but the “human placenta is quite different than most other species, even primates actually, apart from apes”, says Moffett. Mice and humans, for example, both have placentas that invade the uterine lining, but the timing of development and the depth of invasion differ. Exactly what happens during the early days of placental development is still unclear, but problems at this stage can have serious consequences later.

One of the placenta's first jobs is to create a link between the mother and the developing embryo. To do this, the placenta invades the spiral arteries that feed the uterus3. The invasive cells open up the arteries, “essentially making a channel so that mom can provide what she needs through her blood supply”, says Victoria Roberts, a developmental biologist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton. (Nature recognizes that transgender men and non-binary people might have female reproductive organs and might become pregnant. ‘Mother' is used in this article to reflect language used by the field.)

The process can be deadly if it goes wrong. If the placenta invades too deeply, a condition called placenta accreta, the expectant mother can lose too much blood during birth. And if the organ doesn't invade deeply enough, then the fetus might not get enough nutrients to sustain its growth.

Shallow invasion can also impact the mother's health. When the placenta doesn't get enough blood, research suggests it can become inflamed and secrete harmful factors into the mother's blood that trigger pre-eclampsia, a condition characterized by protein build-up in the blood and dangerously high blood pressure4. Worldwide, 2–8% of pregnant people develop the condition. “It's a very serious pregnancy complication that goes silent and undetected until very late into pregnancy,” says Quinton Smith, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Irvine. The only way to cure the condition is to deliver the baby, even if that means a preterm birth.

To better understand the condition, Smith, Turco and other researchers are using organoids made of placental cells called trophoblasts to model the molecular processes involved. Turco is focused on the basic biology of how invasion is regulated, a process that seems to be controlled by both the fetus and the mother. “It's got to be a compromise,” Moffett says. “It's an absolute dialogue.”

Organoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases

That dialogue seems to be happening between the placenta and the uterine lining. As a case in point, when an embryo implants somewhere the lining doesn't exist — on a scar left by a previous caesarean delivery or in a fallopian tube, for example — “there's no control of the invasion at all”, Turco says.

Research suggests that immune cells called uterine natural killer cells have a key role in this conversation. The cells don't kill but instead send out chemical signals that help to regulate the invasion of the uterine lining.

When Turco, Moffett and their colleagues exposed the mini-placentas to these chemical signals and analysed which genes the cells expressed, they found that many were associated with pre-eclampsia5.

“I'm sure it's not the whole story,” Moffett says. “But it does show you how you can use those organoids to ask these fundamental questions about human pregnancy.”

Turco's first attempt to create a mini-placenta in 2016 didn't go as planned. The placental tissue she was working with contained not only trophoblasts, but also a few rogue maternal cells from the endometrium, the uterine lining that builds up and then sheds each month during menstruation. Those maternal cells “kept on growing and taking over”, she says. “It was a setback at that time.”

But now Turco sees it as a wonderful discovery, because she instead grew organoids that represent the endometrium6. This, along with another endometrial model published in the same year7, really opened the door for everyone else, says Griffith.

Griffith has been studying the endometrium for more than a decade. The research is personal. When Griffith hit puberty, she developed a debilitating condition called endometriosis. The disease, which affects about 10% of people with a uterus who are of reproductive age, occurs when endometrium-like tissue grows in places it doesn't belong.

Because this tissue is trapped inside the body, it can't be shed properly. Instead, it can irritate surrounding healthy tissue, causing inflammation, pain and scar tissue. Although existing therapies address some of the symptoms, they don't provide a cure.

Organoids are typically grown in Matrigel, a jelly-like substance extracted from mouse tumour cells that allows the cells to assemble into 3D structures. Griffith wanted to put epithelial cells, which compose the uterine lining, with stromal cells that support that lining. In the body, these cells need to communicate with each other to bring about the changes that occur with the monthly cycle. But Matrigel is packed with proteins that can hamper the cell-to-cell communication. So Griffith and her colleagues developed a hydrogel that's entirely synthetic8.

Griffith's team has also been working on the next step, a model of abnormal endometrial tissue that the researchers can use to test therapies for the condition. Because blood vessels are crucial to maintaining this tissue, Griffith knew she wanted to include them. To do this, she and her colleagues placed the organoid on a microfluidic chip surrounded by cells that form blood vessels. “We put all of these cells in together at the beginning in a gel, and the blood vessels form spontaneously,” she says. “So the organoids turn into lesion-like structures,” she adds. “It's actually kind of wild.”

Griffith and her team have created these model systems from the cells of about a dozen people with endometriosis, and they're beginning to use them to test compounds that could be promising therapies for the condition.

Turco, meanwhile, has developed her endometrial organoid into a model of menstruation9. Her team treated the endometrial organoids with hormones to mimic what happens when the endometrial lining is regenerating. Then the researchers stopped the hormones to mimic the start of menstruation. In the uterus, the lining breaks up naturally. In the model, however, the researchers break the organoids up mechanically. When the cells are put back into a gel, the organoids reform. “And you can keep doing this over and over again,” she says.

Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases.

Bone marrow is a significant fat storage site across species, ranging from fish to mammals1. Adipocytes are a normal component of the bone marrow microenvironment and collectively form bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), which comprises over 70% of bone marrow volume and ~10% of total fat mass in lean, healthy adults2. BMAT further increases with age and in various pathological and iatrogenic conditions, including osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), radiotherapy, and glucocorticoid exposure2,3,4. Unlike other adipose depots, BMAT also expands in energy-deficient states such as anorexia nervosa and during controlled caloric restriction2,5,6,7,8. The molecular and functional characteristics of BMAT vary based on its skeletal location, with distinct differences between axial and appendicular bones2. Together, these observations show that BMAT is a normal feature of vertebrate anatomy that is altered in diverse pathophysiological contexts and has site-specific properties. However, compared to the study of white and brown adipose tissues, research on BMAT has been surprisingly limited2. Thus, the physiological and pathological roles of BMAT remain largely unknown.

Several methods allow non-invasive measurement of bone marrow adiposity. The gold standards are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with chemical shift-encoding for water–fat separation, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can each quantify the bone marrow fat fraction (BMFF)9,10. This has been done in numerous small-scale human cohort studies, providing some insights into how BMAT changes in specific pathophysiological contexts. A particular focus has been on ageing and related conditions, especially skeletal and metabolic diseases3,11. For instance, higher bone marrow adiposity at the lumbar spine has been linked to morphometric vertebral fractures and lower bone mineral density (BMD) in both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals3,11,12. However, these observational studies have never analyzed more than 729 participants13 and typically follow a case–control design for specific diseases, limiting the ability to detect other associations. Critically, whether BMAT directly influences the development and progression of musculoskeletal, metabolic or other diseases remains unknown.

To address these limitations, we developed a deep-learning algorithm for large-scale analysis of BMFF in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In what is the world's largest health imaging study, 100,000 UKBB participants are undergoing MRI of the brain, heart and whole body, as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure BMD14; imaging of all 100,000 participants was completed in July 2025. Our deep-learning method allows accurate and efficient measurement of BMFF within the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis13,15. These four sites cover the axial and appendicular skeleton and include major sites of fracture burden, ensuring that the BMFF measurements allow detection of site-specific and clinically relevant BMAT characteristics.

We have since applied our deep-learning models to measure BMFF of the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis in over 44,000 individuals15 and used these data for genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to identify the genetic variants associated with altered BMFF at each site15. Moreover, we established the associations between BMFF and age, body mass index (BMI), BMD, regional adiposity, and other physiological and anatomical traits15. Intriguingly, these genetic and anatomical associations often differ for BMFF across the four skeletal sites, underscoring the site-specific nature of BMAT formation and function.

Herein, we use our site-specific BMFF measurements and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from our GWAS to perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), thereby comprehensively identifying diseases associated with altered BMFF. Finally, we use Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) to establish evidence of causality between altered BMFF and human diseases. Together, these findings represent a groundbreaking advance in our understanding of the clinical relevance of BMAT.

The study design is presented in Fig. 1.

A Deep learning was used to segment the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis from MRI scans of participants in the UKBB imaging study, allowing BMFF measurements at each site. Genetic associates of BMFF were identified by genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAS), from which polygenic risk scores (PRS) were established for BMFF at each site. B, C PheCODES were used to classify disease outcomes for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). The observational PheWAS (Obs-PheWAS) (B) used BMFF as the predictor, while PRS-PheWAS (C) used PRS as the predictor. D Mendelian Randomization was done, including the Bayesian MR-HORSE method, to assess causal relationships between BMFF at each site and osteoporosis, fracture, and type 2 diabetes.

A total of 10,750 unique International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) and 3113 ICD-9 codes were summarized from hospital inpatient, cancer registry, and death registry data of the UKBB cohort. The ICD codes were mapped into PheCODE groups16, which included 1808 PheCODEs classified into 17 disease categories [e.g., genitourinary diseases = 173 (9.57%); circulatory diseases = 171 (9.46%); endocrine/metabolic diseases = 169 (9.35%); digestive diseases = 162 (8.96%); neoplasms = 140 (7.74%); musculoskeletal diseases = 132 (7.30%); injuries & poisonings = 120 (6.64%); dermatologic diseases = 95 (5.25%); neurological diseases = 84 (4.65%)].

In Obs-PheWAS, the exposure was the rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region, as measured by our deep-learning models13,15. The outcomes were PheCODEs for incident disease cases diagnosed at least six months after participants underwent the MRI scan. Obs-PheWAS sample quality control is shown in Supplementary Data 1, while the PheCODEs used for Obs-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 2. Associations were considered statistically significant after applying FDR correction. The baseline characteristics of the Obs-PheWAS sample for each bone region are summarized in Table 1 (femoral head: N = 45,288; total hip: N = 45,187; diaphysis: N = 44,099; spine: N = 48,427).

In the femoral head Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', but with decreased risk of acute renal failure and osteoarthritis (Table 2; Fig. 2).

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging.

In the total hip Obs-PheWAS, eleven PheCODEs, spanning nine disease groups, were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. 2). Among these, higher total hip BMFF was associated with increased risk of musculoskeletal diseases (osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage) but decreased risk of nine other diseases (T2D, essential hypertension, obesity, sepsis, septicemia, acute renal failure, cholelithiasis, chronic airway obstruction, and malignant neoplasm of female breast). It is helpful to note that “chronic airway obstruction” maps to ICD-10 codes J44.8/J44.9, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hereafter, we refer to ‘chronic airway obstruction' as COPD.

The diaphysis Obs-PheWAS identified two PheCODEs, increased risk of osteoporosis and decreased risk of T2D, that were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. 2).

In the spine Obs-PheWAS, 40 PheCODEs were associated with higher BMFF. These could be categorized into ten disease groups and included diseases such as osteoporosis, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', spondylosis without myelopathy, spinal stenosis, T2D, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, gout, two benign neoplasms, and several cardiovascular conditions (Table 2; Fig. 2). The strongest effects were observed for COPD and osteoporosis, as well as metabolic diseases such as T2D and hyperlipidemia. Unlike for each femoral region, spine BMFF was also associated with numerous diseases affecting the circulatory system, digestive system, and sense organs (Table 2; Fig. 2). Moreover, whereas femoral BMFF was associated with decreased risk of some diseases, spine BMFF was associated with increased risk of all the identified disease groups.

Among all of the BMFF-associated PheCODEs identified by Obs-PheWAS, six were shared between two or more bone regions (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Data 3). Osteoporosis was the one significant PheCODE with consistent direction of effect for all four bone regions, in each case showing a positive association with BMFF (Table 2; Supplementary Data 3). Another musculoskeletal PheCODE, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', was positively associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, and spine. T2D showed consistent negative associations with BMFF in the femoral head and total hip, but a positive association in the spine. Importantly, both spine BMFF and total hip BMFF remained significantly associated with T2D even after controlling for variation in visceral adipose tissue or overall peripheral adiposity, each of which is an independent risk factor for T2D17,18 (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, these associations between BMFF and T2D are independent of adiposity outside of the bone marrow.

The three remaining PheCODEs shared for two bone regions were COPD, acute renal failure, and osteoarthritis. Intriguingly, each of these diseases was associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head, total hip, and/or diaphysis (Table 2; Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 3). These findings support the concept that the functions and clinical implications of BMAT vary depending on the skeletal site.

For each bone region, we also conducted a sensitivity PheWAS analysis that included both incident and prevalent cases. This identified a total of 35, 43, 14, and 142 significant PheCODEs (FDR q < 0.05) associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine, respectively (Supplementary Data 5; Supplementary Figs. 1–5). This analysis identified additional associations with fracture and site-specific associations with osteoarthritis, several cancers, chronic kidney disease, and various circulatory, digestive, genitourinary, and respiratory conditions. Forty-two PheCODEs were identified for two or more bone regions (Supplementary Data 6), and five PheCODEs showed significant associations for all four bone regions (osteoporosis, fracture of radius and ulna, T2D, gout, and essential hypertension) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The direction of effect for all overlapping diseases was consistent between the main Obs-PheWAS and the sensitivity Obs-PheWAS.

To investigate if any BMFF-associated diseases are sex-specific, we conducted the main (incident cases) and sensitivity Obs-PheWAS (incident + prevalent cases), stratified by sex, for the four bone regions. In males, one significant PheCODE was associated with BMFF in the femoral head, two in the total hip, none in the diaphysis, and 19 in the spine. In females, four, seven, three, and 11 significant PheCODEs were associated with BMFF in these respective bone regions (Supplementary Data 7).

The majority of identified significant diseases were also found in the sex-combined Obs-PheWAS (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7). In the spine, four PheCODEs, including T2D, hypercholesterolemia, other mental disorders, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), were positively associated with BMFF in both male and female groups. ‘Essential hypertension' and ‘iron deficiency anemia' were associated with spine BMFF in males, but not in females or in the sexes combined. All other significant PheCODEs identified for spine BMFF in the sex-sensitivity analysis were also observed in the sex-combined analysis (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7-8).

In contrast to spine BMFF, the incident diseases associated with BMFF at each femoral site were sex-specific, with no overlap between males and females (Supplementary Data 7). When prevalent cases were included, there was some male-female overlap among the diseases associated with each femoral site; for these diseases, the directions of the associations with BMFF were the same in each sex (Supplementary Data 9-10).

To further explore the clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity, we generated PRSs for BMFF at each bone region and used these as the exposures for PRS-PheWAS across the larger UKBB cohort. We generated two PRSs, PRS1 and PRS2, for each bone region (Table 3). PRS1 included all SNPs that passed quality control (Supplementary Data 11). The same SNPs were used in PRS2, except that any SNPs independently associated with BMD were excluded (Supplementary Data 12). The rationale for this is that BMD-associated SNPs could confound the detection of associations between each BMFF PRS and osteoporosis, which was the disease most consistently associated with BMFF in our Obs-PheWAS. The only exception was for diaphysis, in which PRS1 contained no BMD-associated SNPs; hence, PRS2 was not required for this site. The quality control of genetic IVs (SNPs) and samples used to construct PRSs for each bone region is described in Supplementary Data 11–13, with the SNPs (rsid, chromosome, position, beta, R2, F-statistics) used to generate each PRS described in Supplementary Data 14-15. The linear regression of PRS on BMFF in each bone region, stratified by sex, is presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. Positive associations were observed, with β coefficients (log OR) ranging from 0.189 to 0.381 (P < 2 × 10−16).

PRS-PheWAS was performed using PRS1 for each of the four bone regions, and PRS2 for femoral head, total hip, and spine, giving a total of seven separate PheWASes. The PheCODEs used for PRS-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 16, while the baseline characteristics of each PRS-PheWAS sample for each bone region are summarized in Table 3. PheCODEs significantly associated with PRS1 or PRS2, after FDR correction, are presented in Table 4.

In the femoral head PRS-PheWAS, nine PheCODEs in four disease categories were associated with PRS1, including negative associations with two neoplastic diseases and positive associations with osteoporosis, fracture of humerus, and viral pneumonia (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the total hip PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs were associated with PRS1. Higher genetically predicted BMFF was associated with lower risk of myeloproliferative disease and ‘other derangement of joint', but with higher risk of three musculoskeletal diseases: osteoporosis, pyogenic arthritis, and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the femoral diaphysis PRS-PheWAS, eight PheCODEs, spanning five disease groups, were associated with PRS1. Positive associations were observed with osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; esophagitis, GERD and related diseases; late effects of cerebrovascular disease; and fracture of the radius and ulna, hand or wrist, and femoral neck. In contrast, diaphysis PRS1 was negatively associated only with spinal stenosis (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

In the spine PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs demonstrated positive associations with PRS1, including osteoporosis and four PheCODEs for fractures at different skeletal sites; no PheCODEs were negatively associated with spine PRS1 (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. 7).

We found a high degree of overlap in significant PheCODEs identified across the two PRSs (Table 4; Fig. 3). PRS2 was associated with the same PheCODEs, with the same effect directions, as PRS1 for each site in the total hip, diaphysis, and spine; there were no major discrepancies in the association effect sizes, with a median OR difference of ~0.001. The only disparities for PRS1 vs PRS2 occurred for the femoral head, for which PRS1 was positively associated with both fracture of humerus and viral pneumonia, but PRS2 was not. Therefore, the BMD-associated SNPs, which were excluded from PRS2, have minimal influence on the PRS-PheWAS outcomes for each bone region.

Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components. We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini–Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses. A–D Volcano plots show odds ratios (OR) and −log10(P) values for PheCODE diseases associated with femoral head PRS2 (A), total hip PRS2 (B), diaphysis PRS1 (C), and spine PRS2 (D). For PRS2, each PRS was first calculated based on significant SNPs from meta-GWAS after QC; SNPs independently associated with BMD were then excluded from the instrumental variants selected. PRS2 for diaphysis was not calculated due to the absence of a corresponding BMD GWAS. Each dot represents a disease, with the x axis indicating the OR and the y axis showing the—log10(p) (two-sided). Labels of disease names are shown for all significant diseases (FDR < 0.05); significant associations with OR < 1 are shown as blue dots; those with OR > 1 are red dots; and non-significant associations are shown as gray dots. For each region, the dashed horizontal line indicates the FDR threshold. Forest plots beneath each volcano plot are included to show the OR (red or blue circles) with 95% CIs. Further details are in Table 4 and Supplementary Data 16, 17. Volcano plots for PRS1-PheWAS are presented in Supplementary Fig. 7.

Among all diseases identified by PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, only three were common to two or more bone regions. Higher BMFF-PRS was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis for all four bone regions, with this relationship being stronger for each femoral site than for the spine (Supplementary Data 17). Fracture of radius and ulna was positively associated with each PRS for the diaphysis and spine, whereas ‘other derangement of joint' was inversely associated with each PRS for the femoral head and total hip (Supplementary Data 17). Together, these PRS-PheWAS analyses demonstrate that genetic markers of altered BMFF can be leveraged to further identify BMFF-associated diseases.

In the sex-sensitivity PRS-PheWAS, no significant disease outcomes were identified as male-specific after FDR-q correction, and no diseases were associated with spine PRS1 or PRS2 in females (Supplementary Data 18). However, in females, several diseases were associated with PRS1 for the femoral head, total hip and diaphysis, and these overlapped entirely with the diseases associated with PRS2 for each of these sites (Supplementary Data 18). Among these, only osteoporosis was shared for all three femoral bone regions, for which higher BMFF PRS1 and PRS2 were consistently associated with the increased osteoporosis risk (Supplementary Data 19).

Consistent positive associations with osteoporosis were found for BMFF in all four bone regions in both Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS. In addition, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' were identified with increased disease risk for total hip BMFF (Supplementary Data 20).

The performance of BMFF-PRSs in predicting the risk of osteoporosis was evaluated across the four bone regions (Supplementary Data 21). The corrected C-statistics of PRS1 and PRS2 in each bone region were around 0.771, indicating a moderate-to-good discrimination of individuals with and without osteoporosis. There was no statistical difference in the predictive accuracy between PRS1 and PRS2 (ROC test P > 0.05).

We conducted two-sample MR to test if there is evidence of causality between altered BMFF and three of the diseases identified from our PheWAS analyses (Tables 5–7). Instrumental variables (IVs) were selected under two linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping thresholds (r² < 0.001 or r² < 0.6) to evaluate robustness to variant correlation. Among all the PheCODEs identified from Obs-PheWAS, PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis was the only disease consistently associated with all four bone regions (Supplementary Data 20). Fracture-related PheCODEs were also prominent among the PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS results, while Obs-PheWAS revealed strong associations, in varying directions, between BMFF and T2D in total hip, diaphysis and spine (Table 2). Each of these diseases (osteoporosis, fractures, and T2D) has been a focus of previous BMAT research2,3,4 and each imposes a substantial burden on public health. Therefore, we focused our MR analyses on these three diseases.

In the MR analysis, the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic variants ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions, indicating that genetically predicted BMFF is a robust IV for the MR analysis (Supplementary Data 15, 22, 23 and 24).

The causal association of BMFF genetic predisposition with osteoporosis is summarized in Table 5. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), positive associations with osteoporosis were found for total hip BMFF and diaphysis BMFF based on the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and for diaphysis BMFF based on MR-Horse. Moreover, consistent positive associations were detected for all three femoral sites when the less-stringent LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied (Supplementary Data 25). However, no causal association was found in the spine, regardless of the r2 threshold used. As outlined in the Discussion, the lack of causality for spine BMFF is surprising and could have several explanations, including osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB being driven more by bone loss in the hip than in the spine. The Cochran's Q statistic of MR-Egger and IVW methods indicated heterogeneity (Table 5, Supplementary Data 25). However, MR-Egger intercept in the analysis showed no horizontal pleiotropy for each bone region. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots for these analyses are presented in Supplementary Figs. 8–23. The results were also consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 10, 14, 18, 22; Supplementary Data 22, 26). The association of osteoporosis remained the same in the MR-PRESSO analyses (Supplementary Data 27) after removal of outliers, for the femoral sites. There was no difference in MR-PRESSO outlier correction-adjusted causal estimates. The MR-PRESSO global test indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Distortion coefficients for femoral head, total hip, and diaphysis were non-significant, suggesting more robust estimates after outlier correction.

The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with fractures is summarized in Table 6. Each of the MR methods found no significant causal associations for any of the four bone regions when using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r² <0.001). However, when the more lenient LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied, IVW and MR-Horse showed positive associations with fractures for all three femoral sites (Supplementary Data 28). Horizontal pleiotropy was found only in MR for the femoral head (P = 0.015) when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots are presented in Supplementary Figs. 24–39. The results were consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 26, 30, 34, 38; Supplementary Data 23, 29). MR-PRESSO analyses (Supplementary Data 27) also supported the positive causal associations with fractures in femoral head and total hip. MR-PRESSO global test found evidence of heterogeneity only for the diaphysis when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold.

The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with T2D is summarized in Table 7. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), none of the MR methods found significant causal associations in any of the four bone regions. At the less-stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.6), the findings suggested negative associations with T2D in the total hip and diaphysis, whereas MR-Horse observed a positive association between BMFF genetic liability and T2D in the spine (Supplementary Data 30). Evidence of heterogeneity was detected across all regions, but pleiotropy (Egger intercept) was not significant in most cases (only P-diaphysis = 0.022 for MR using r2 < 0.6), supporting the validity of the causal estimates. The scatter plots, forest plots and funnel plots are presented in Supplementary Figs. 40–55. The results remained consistent in leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. 42, 46, 50, 54; Supplementary Data 24, 31). The MR-PRESSO global test (Supplementary Data 27) indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Only the diaphysis region found a significant distortion coefficient under all r2 thresholds, indicating potential influence from outliers. Overall, the association of T2D remained consistent in the MR-PRESSO analyses after removal of outliers.

Finally, to assess whether BMI adjustment introduced collider bias in the MR, we compared MR results (r2 < 0.001) based on IVs from meta-GWAS with and without BMI adjustment15. We found no distinct discrepancies in the comparisons (Supplementary Data 32–34), with the effect estimates remaining directionally consistent between BMI-adjusted and unadjusted analyses (Osteoporosis: median OR difference = 0.027; Fractures: median OR difference = 0.022; T2D: median OR difference = 0.004). Thus, BMI adjustment does not significantly alter the MR results.

Our understanding of the diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity has been based on smaller-scale studies incapable of comprehensively revealing the pathophysiological relevance of BMAT. These have typically used case-control designs addressing specific pathophysiological contexts; have lacked comprehensive healthcare records and genotype data for participants; often focused on only one or two skeletal sites; and have never exceeded more than 729 individuals13. Herein, we have overcome these limitations by using our deep-learning measurements of BMFF at the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 44,000 participants in the UKBB, as well as establishing PRSs for BMFF at each of these sites. Our Obs-PheWAS provides a systematic identification of the clinical conditions associated with altered BMFF at each site, while our PRS-PheWAS demonstrates the utility of genetic markers of altered BMFF for further elucidating clinical associations. These analyses greatly extend the scope of diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity. Finally, our MR studies reveal that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the total hip and femoral diaphysis is causally associated with osteoporosis and suggest that spine and femoral BMFF may also be causally associated with fractures and T2D. Together, these findings substantially advance understanding of the impact of BMAT on human health and disease.

The entire scope of BMFF-associated diseases is too extensive to discuss here in full; hence, below we consider those of particular interest.

Across all the BMFF-associated diseases, the relationship with osteoporosis (PheCODE 743.11) is among the strongest and most consistent. This PheCODE includes ICD-9 code 733.00 (Osteoporosis NOS) and ICD-10 codes M81, M81.0, M81.6 and M81.8, which refer to age-related, localized, or “other” osteoporosis, without current pathological fractures. From our incident Obs-PheWAS, PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis is the only disease associated with BMFF at all four sites. This extends numerous reports of the inverse relationship between bone marrow adiposity and BMD3, including our recent population-scale findings in the UKBB15. The persistence of this relationship in our PRS2-PheWAS is intriguing because PRS2 excludes BMD-associated SNPs, demonstrating that the relationship between genetically predicted BMFF and osteoporosis is independent of genetic markers of altered BMD.

Our PheWAS and MR findings confirm and greatly extend previous observations, as well as strengthen the evidence of causality between increased BMFF and osteoporosis in humans. Intriguingly, the observed causal association exists for BMFF at each femoral site, particularly when using the more lenient LD threshold, but not for spine BMFF. This is consistent with our PheWAS findings, which show weaker BMFF-osteoporosis relationships for the spine than for each femoral site; however, it is surprising given our finding that spine BMFF has a robust inverse association with spine BMD15. This discordance could result from an indirect relationship between BMFF and BMD in the spine: either increased spine BMFF is a consequence, rather than a cause, of lower BMD, or these are independent effects driven simultaneously by other factors. However, another possibility is that osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB are driven more by decreased BMD in the hip than in the spine. Indeed, BMD T-scores across the UKBB population are lower in the proximal femur than in the spine (see UKBB data fields 23300 vs 23205, respectively), echoing observations in other aged populations19. If low spine BMD plays a lesser role in UKBB osteoporosis cases, this may explain our finding that increased spine BMFF has no causal association with osteoporosis, despite its robust association with decreased spine BMD.

Among the femoral sites, the causal association with osteoporosis is strongest for diaphysis BMFF. The biological reasons for this are unclear but may result from site-specific differences in BMAT formation and function2,20,21. For example, bone marrow adipocytes secrete a range of anti-osteogenic and/or pro-resorptive factors2, and this may differ between the diaphysis and the proximal femur. Another theory is that, because BM adipocytes and osteoblasts derive from a common progenitor (the skeletal stem cell), any increase in adipogenesis will necessarily come at the expense of osteogenesis2. Indeed, site-specific differences in human skeletal stem cells have recently been identified22. Thus, another possibility is that the balance between adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis varies across skeletal sites, contributing to site-specific differences in the BMFF-osteoporosis relationship. Notably, relatively few studies measure bone marrow adiposity in the femoral diaphysis, instead focusing on the spine and proximal femur3. These site-specific differences may also help to inform the potential of using bone marrow adiposity to improve clinical management of osteoporosis.

Another key finding is that genetically predicted BMFF is associated with fractures, with MR providing evidence for causality when using the more lenient LD threshold. This is important because fractures impose a huge burden on public health23 and, although BMD is a major determinant of fracture risk, most fractures occur in people without osteoporosis24. This highlights the need for improved fracture prediction, which has motivated research into bone marrow adiposity as a fracture risk factor3. Previous studies show that increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with prevalent vertebral fracture in men, independently of BMD25, and with incident bone loss in elderly women26. However, others report that bone marrow adiposity in vertebrae and the proximal femur does not differ between subjects with and without prevalent fracture27,28,29. Moreover, the largest previous study of bone marrow adiposity and incident fracture included 298 men and women but found no association between vertebral bone marrow adiposity and incident fractures in either sex26. This is similar to our main Obs-PheWAS results, in which there are no associations between BMFF and incident fractures, regardless of BMFF site or fracture type. However, the lack of associations with incident fracture is likely explained by the low fracture rates in the UKBB. Indeed, among all incident fractures, even the most common subtype (fracture of the radius and ulna) has <200 incident cases (Supplementary Data 35), which is below the threshold for inclusion as a PheWAS outcome. This threshold is exceeded for many fracture subtypes in our sensitivity PheWASes (Supplementary Data 36), which show robust positive associations between fractures and BMFF at each site; for spine and diaphysis, this is replicated in our PRS-PheWAS. The associations with fracture in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS may also be due to reverse causality; hence, in the future, it will be important to conduct even larger studies to increase the power to detect associations between BMFF and incident fractures. Nevertheless, our findings highlight roles for diaphyseal BMFF, which previous studies have overlooked, and show that genetically predicted BMFF is positively associated with fracture, independent of genetic predictors of BMD.

As for osteoporosis, our MR results for fracture represent a major advance in knowledge because they demonstrate evidence of causality. These causal associations are stronger for each femoral site than for spine BMFF, echoing our MR findings for osteoporosis. Indeed, it is intriguing that spine BMFF may directly affect fractures but not osteoporosis. This underscores the concept that factors influencing bone quality, beyond BMD, contribute to fracture pathogenesis30,31. However, causality was not observed using the more stringent MR LD threshold (r2 < 0.001), highlighting the need for stronger IVs to test causal associations. It will also be important for future studies to establish how increased BMFF at each site impacts bone quality and thereby contributes to fracture risk, and if bone marrow adiposity, and/or its genetic surrogates, can improve fracture prediction beyond traditional risk factors.

In addition to musculoskeletal diseases, the relationship between bone marrow adiposity and T2D has attracted increasing attention4. Several previous studies report increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in T2D, including obese subjects32,33, non-obese women34, and older men35. In contrast, a recent larger study found only a trend for increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity36, while earlier research detected no differences between control and T2D subjects27,37,38. However, the largest of these studies included only 199 people36, and most have focused only on bone marrow adiposity in the spine, overlooking appendicular bones. Our present observations, therefore, substantially advance understanding of this relationship through large-scale analyses of multiple skeletal sites.

Perhaps our most intriguing finding is that, unlike osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship with T2D is positive for spine BMFF but negative for each femoral site, particularly for the total hip. This divergence between the spine and femur occurs for several other T2D-associated diseases, including obesity and gout39. It is also consistent with recent research from Badr et al., which found that, unlike for vertebrae, proximal femoral bone marrow adiposity is lower in T2D patients vs controls36. One possibility is that these BMFF-T2D associations are confounded by common associations with peripheral adiposity traits. Indeed, T2D is strongly associated with adipose distribution, with excessive visceral adiposity being a major risk factor for this disease17,18. Moreover, we previously demonstrated that spine BMFF is positively associated with total body fat % and visceral adiposity, whereas total hip and diaphysis BMFF are each negatively associated with visceral adiposity and have variable relationships with other adiposity traits15. However, we show that the BMFF-T2D associations for spine and total hip BMFF persist even after controlling for peripheral adiposity. Thus, BMFF at these sites is significantly associated with T2D incidence, independently of adiposity outside of the bone marrow.

The strength of the associations with T2D is further demonstrated by our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS, in which T2D is the most-significant association for femoral head, total hip and spine, and the second most-significant for diaphysis BMFF. Even when focusing on incident cases, T2D is among the diseases most strongly associated with spine BMFF, with an OR similar to that for osteoporosis. Our MR results further suggest that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the spine, total hip, and diaphysis has direct causal associations with T2D that mirror the site-specific PheWAS relationships. Importantly, these causal associations are significant only when using the more lenient LD threshold, again underscoring the need for future, larger-scale BMFF GWAS to allow stronger IVs to be established. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to speculate how femoral and spinal BMFF might exert divergent effects on the pathogenesis of T2D. One possibility is that femoral BMAT is a site of safer, more metabolically inert lipid storage, analogous to gluteo-femoral adipose tissue, whereas spinal BMAT is akin to more metabolically active visceral adipose tissue, releasing metabolites and endocrine factors that promote insulin resistance18. Clearly, it will be important to establish the differences between spinal and femoral BMAT, both on molecular and functional levels, to better understand the relationships between BMAT and T2D.

In addition to osteoporosis and fracture, we reveal further associations between BMFF and other musculoskeletal conditions. One of the most consistent relationships is with ‘Other disorders of bone and cartilage' (PheCODE 733), which is positively associated with BMFF in the spine, femoral head, and total hip. This association is complex to interpret because this PheCODE includes 373 different ICD-10 codes, with diseases as diverse as hypertrophy of bone, osteolysis, skeletal fluorosis, chondromalacia, and physeal arrest. It will be important to determine if the BMFF associations are spread across these conditions or are focused on a subset of diseases within this broad category.

Another common musculoskeletal association is osteoarthritis. Compared to osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship between BMAT and osteoarthritis has received relatively little attention40. Our findings are important because they reveal that osteoarthritis is positively associated with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head or total hip. The latter is consistent with one small human study of osteoarthritic patients, which found that proximal femoral BMFF decreases with increasing disease severity41. In contrast, increased bone marrow adiposity was observed in the tibial and femoral epiphyses in a mouse model of osteoarthritis42. Thus, alternative mouse models may be needed to study the site-specific BMAT-osteoarthritis relationships that exist in humans. Our PRS-PheWAS also shows that monoarthritis is inversely associated with BMFF in the femoral head, suggesting a robust relationship between femoral head BMFF and different forms of arthritis. Understanding whether BMAT directly impacts arthritis incidence and progression will be an important goal for future research.

The earliest studies of bone marrow adipocytes focused on their relationship with hematopoiesis2,43. Therefore, it is notable that our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS identifies associations with several hematological diseases, including anemias and neutropenia. The positive association between these diseases and spine BMFF is consistent with longstanding observations of an inverse relationship between hematopoiesis and BMAT expansion2,43; however, these diseases are also negatively associated with femoral head BMFF. This disparity may result from site-dependent differences in bone marrow adipocyte function, as reported for regenerative hematopoiesis in mouse models2,43. Beyond these diseases, our PheWASes also identify associations with several hematological cancers, as discussed below.

Our findings are also relevant to the links between marrow adiposity and cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that bone marrow adiposity influences tumor development and progression, including for hematological cancers and bone metastases of solid tumors2,44,45. In particular, bone marrow adipocytes secrete factors that promote the migration, viability, and/or survival of multiple myeloma cells, leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia, and metastases from breast or prostate tumors2,44,45,46,47. Bone marrow adipocytes also promote a quiescent state in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, helping them to evade chemotherapy48. For some of these cancers, altered bone marrow adiposity has been reported in smaller-scale clinical studies2,44,45,49,50; however, our study is notable because it identifies associations across such a large population, and for BMFF at multiple sites.

Our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS findings reveal positive associations between total hip BMFF and prostate cancer, and between spine BMFF and both malignant breast cancer and bone metastases. These results are consistent with the above preclinical findings and with one report of increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in breast cancer patients49. The positive association between chemotherapy and spine BMFF, and between ‘effects of radiation' and both spine and total hip BMFF, echoes longstanding reports of increased bone marrow adiposity following cancer treatment2. Thus, the positive BMFF-cancer associations observed in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS could represent confounding effects of cancer therapy and/or reverse causality, with these diseases directly increasing bone marrow adiposity. In contrast to the above cancers, we also reveal a negative association between total hip BMFF and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This extends our previous observation of extremely low femoral BMFF in some people with this disease13. Notably, unlike for the spine, total hip BMFF is negatively associated with malignant breast cancer; hence, it is important to take account of skeletal site when considering BMA-cancer relationships.

In addition to these Obs-PheWAS results, our PRS-PheWAS identifies a positive association between diaphysis BMFF and multiple myeloma. This contrasts with one small study that found a trend for lower axial bone marrow adiposity in multiple myeloma patients50 but extends observations from mouse models that show increased tibial bone marrow adiposity in early-stage myeloma47. Thus, the BMFF-myeloma relationship may vary across skeletal sites. This is important because changes in bone marrow adiposity may identify patients at risk of multiple myeloma progression51. In contrast, we find no associations with leukemias, despite reports of decreased bone marrow adiposity in chronic lymphoid, acute lymphoid, and chronic myeloid leukemia2,44,48; multiple myeloma is also absent from our Obs-PheWAS results. This may reflect insufficient statistical power caused by the low incidence and prevalence of these conditions among the UKBB population52. Despite this limitation, we extend the number of neoplastic conditions that are associated with bone marrow adiposity. Therefore, our findings should inform future efforts to determine if bone marrow adiposity directly influences cancer incidence and/or progression.

Unlike the above disease classes, few studies report associations between bone marrow adiposity and cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. By identifying such associations, our PheWAS results greatly extend the clinical relevance of bone marrow adiposity.

Among these diseases, COPD is notable because its positive association with spine BMFF is stronger than for any other incident disease. In contrast, incident COPD is inversely associated with total hip BMFF. This disparity between spine and femoral BMFF is similar to their relationships with several other diseases, including T2D. Given that T2D itself is associated with COPD53, we speculate that spine and femoral BMFF may have opposing relationships with COPD because of their divergent causal association with T2D.

Several other cardiometabolic diseases are also associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with femoral BMFF, particularly when prevalent cases are considered. Here, essential hypertension is especially striking because it is strongly associated with BMFF at all four sites. This relationship may involve the interplay between BMAT and hematopoiesis, combined with the positive causal effect of lymphocyte count on blood pressure54; if so, BMFF may be associated with hypertension via effects on lymphopoiesis. Finally, the positive relationship between spine BMFF and incidence of several other cardiovascular conditions suggests a more widespread impact of vertebral BMAT on cardiometabolic dysfunction.

Another notable finding is that there are site and sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. As discussed above, the BMFF-disease relationships frequently differ depending on skeletal site, with many diseases associating positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF at one or more femoral sites. While this is perhaps most notable for T2D, our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS reveals similar divergent site-specific associations for many other conditions across multiple disease classes. Many of these are interrelated disease clusters, including cardiometabolic diseases and other age-associated chronic diseases. Thus, BMFF distribution may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of these complex multi-morbidities.

These findings highlight the critical importance of analyzing BMFF at multiple anatomical locations and underscore the concept that the pathophysiological functions of BMAT are skeletal site dependent2,20,21. Indeed, BMAT has been proposed to exist in two broad subtypes, regulated BMAT (rBMAT) and constitutive BMAT (cBMAT), which differ in anatomical location and in their molecular and functional characteristics2,20,21. Thus, cBMAT forms earlier in development, contains densely packed adipocytes, predominates at distal skeletal sites, and is less changeable in response to environmental and pathophysiological variables. In contrast, rBMAT forms later in development, features adipocytes interspersed with hematopoietic red marrow, predominates in the axial skeleton and more-proximal regions of the limbs, and more readily increases or decreases in response to varying environmental stimuli and pathophysiological states. These characteristics are broadly consistent with our observations, with spine BMFF corresponding to rBMAT and femoral BMFF being more cBMAT-like. However, some disease associations are even stronger for femoral BMFF than for spine BMFF, suggesting that cBMAT is not always more inert than rBMAT. The three femoral sites also differ from one another, suggesting that this binary cBMAT/rBMAT classification is an oversimplification. It will be important for future studies to further dissect these site-specific differences on molecular and functional levels.

Disease risk factors, incidence and outcomes also differ between males and females55, including for the relationships between body composition and cardiometabolic health56,57. Our present findings extend understanding of these phenomena by identifying the extent of sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. Many associations occur in both sexes, especially for spine BMFF; in such cases, the direction of the BMFF-disease association is the same in each sex. In contrast, for the femoral sites, there are many more associations in females than in males. Sometimes this is because the disease itself is sex-specific, such as those affecting reproductive organs; this is particularly common when prevalent cases are included. However, most of the sexually dimorphic associations among incident cases occur for diseases that can affect males and females. For example, acute renal failure is identified only in males, while the positive association between BMFF and incident osteoporosis occurs for all four sites in females but none in males, even when prevalent cases are included. The latter is reminiscent of previous observations that vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with incident bone loss in elderly women, but not in elderly men26. Together, our findings highlight sex differences in the clinical impact of bone marrow adiposity.

We acknowledge that our study has several limitations. First, the UKBB MRI data allow fat fraction mapping but do not include spectroscopy, and therefore cannot be used to measure lipid saturation and unsaturation3. This is notable because vertebral bone marrow lipid saturation is positively associated with risk of incident fracture in older adults58 and with prevalent fracture in T2D27. The latter, small-scale study found no relationship between fracture and overall bone marrow adiposity, suggesting that bone marrow lipid saturation is an even stronger driver of fracture risk. Bone marrow lipid saturation is also higher in T2D4; however, whether this has a direct causal effect on diabetes is unknown.

Secondly, while vertebral fractures are estimated to affect up to 25-50% of people over the age of 50, many are asymptomatic, with only 30-40% coming to medical attention59,60. This likely explains why the positive association between BMFF and vertebral fracture is detected only in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS: while reverse causality may play a role, the number of fracture cases in the incident Obs-PheWAS is too few to detect these associations (Supplementary Data 35). Under-reporting of vertebral fractures may also account for our MR results, which show that the causal association of BMFF with fracture is weaker for the spine than for each femoral site.

The challenge of insufficient incident cases also applies to other diseases. The UKBB population is relatively healthy52, which can limit the ability to detect associations and causal effects of BMFF on many health outcomes. As for vertebral fracture, having insufficient cases may explain why many associations, such as multiple myeloma, are detected in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and/or PRS-PheWAS, but not the incident Obs-PheWAS. It may also explain some differences in our sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS. For example, BMFF is associated with osteoporosis in females but not in males; this may result from genuine sex differences in disease pathogenesis but could also reflect males' lower incidence of osteoporosis23, which would limit the power to detect this association. However, it is important to acknowledge that reverse causality may contribute to the additional associations identified when prevalent cases are included. We will overcome the challenge of insufficient cases by measuring BMFF in the remaining ~50,000 UKBB imaging participants and by applying our BMFF PRSs to other large-scale genomic cohorts, including meta-analyses of multiple datasets, to further explore the clinical impact of BMAT.

Thirdly, medication use may influence some of the observed BMFF-disease associations. For example, glucocorticoids are used to manage COPD, and they also increase BMFF2. However, UKBB participant medication history is mostly from self-reported data, with primary care records being available for only a subset of participants; thus, it is not possible to systematically control for use of medications that may influence the observed associations between BMFF and disease outcomes.

Fourthly, we defined PheCODES based on national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) in UKBB, which did not include diagnoses from primary care. This may result in incomplete case ascertainment for conditions predominantly diagnosed and managed in the primary care setting.

Fifthly, we generated PRSs using PRS-CT (clumping + p value thresholding: to generate weighted PRS based on SNP associated with BMFF) because it is more interpretable for causal inference. However, the inclusion of correlated SNPs reduces this advantage. The PRS-CS method, which utilizes a Bayesian regression framework by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes61, would be valuable for future work characterizing the full polygenic architecture of BMFF.

There are also some limitations to our MR analysis. MR relies on genetic instruments (SNPs) associated with BMFF, but the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic instruments ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions. This limited variance suggests potential weak instrument bias, which could lead to underpowered or biased causal estimates; this is particularly true using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), which found causal associations for total hip or diaphysis BMFF and osteoporosis, but not for any other BMFF-disease associations. The MR analysis assumes that the genetic instruments affect the outcome (osteoporosis, fractures, T2D) only through the exposure (BMFF). However, horizontal pleiotropy, where genetic variants influence the outcome through pathways other than BMFF, cannot be entirely ruled out. Our study used MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to test for pleiotropy. MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests suggested minimal pleiotropy, while the presence of heterogeneity across different bone regions suggested some genetic variants may have pleiotropic effects, potentially biasing the causal estimates. However, a major strength of our MR analysis is that we also used MR-Horse, which is protected from bias due to pleiotropy62. Relating to this, a potential limitation of our conservative exclusion of BMD- and T2D-associated variants is that, while this approach reduces the risk of horizontal pleiotropy, it may also lead to a reduction in IVs strength. However, excluding these variants in our MR analyses had minimal impact on overall IVs strength (Supplementary Data 37). Moreover, Steiger filtering63 confirmed correct causal directions for all variants, including those associated with both exposure and outcome (Supplementary Data 38-41). In addition, although the sample overlap between exposure and outcome GWAS was minimal ( < 5%), residual bias cannot be entirely ruled out. We seek to validate our MR findings in the independent dataset once these data are available. A final limitation is that the MR analysis was conducted in a predominantly white European population from the UK Biobank, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups.

Finally, the UKBB imaging study has plans to include repeat imaging of 60,000 participants, but does not yet have longitudinal MRI data. Such data would be necessary to determine whether changes in BMFF precede disease onset or are a consequence of disease progression. This will provide critical insights into the temporal dynamics of BMFF alterations and their role in disease incidence and progression.

Despite these limitations, our study is a breakthrough in understanding the fundamental biology and clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity. Our large-scale MR-PheWAS identifies the overall and sex-specific disease outcomes associated with BMFF and its genetic liability at multiple skeletal sites. To explore the short-term effects of BMFF, we conducted Obs-PheWAS, analyzing 1808 disease outcomes using deep-learning-quantified BMFF measurements obtained at the time of MRI scanning. Complementing this, PRS-PheWAS establishes the long-term effects by evaluating the cumulative genetic risk for elevated BMFF levels. Our Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS not only enhance statistical power and reduce bias but also validate the findings and strengthen causal inference.

The unexpected breadth of BMFF-associated diseases highlights the potential of BMFF as a biomarker for the improved prediction, prevention and treatment of diverse diseases. This includes leveraging our BMFF PRSs as genetic biomarkers, which could benefit clinical practice by eliminating the need for expensive and time-consuming MRI analyses. Our results provide evidence of causality for altered bone marrow adiposity on osteoporosis, fracture, and T2D, which suggests that modulating bone marrow adiposity could be a viable therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Together, our study reveals extensive insights into BMAT function that have the potential to benefit human health.

UKBB has ethics approval from the National Health Service North-West Center Research Ethics Committee (Ref11:/NW/0382). All participants provided informed consent. Data for this work were obtained under an approved UKBB project application (ID 48697).

UKBB is a large population-based prospective cohort study of 502,352 participants aged 40–60 years recruited between 2006 and 201064. In this study, we used participant data from the ongoing UKBB multi-modal imaging study, initiated in 2014, which comprises brain, cardiac, and abdominal MRI, carotid ultrasound scan, and whole-body DXA14.

We developed and validated a light-weight attention-based U-Net model for simultaneous detection and segmentation of tiny structures in large 3D MRI imaging data, to generate volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to bone marrow regions, including femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and the thoracic and lumbar spine (Python code [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13959673]. The segmented VOIs were then applied to the fat fraction (FF) maps. The deep-learning BMFF measurements of the four bone regions were conducted in two batches based on the availability of MRI data released by UKBB (N = 50,226). Method details for deep-learning training, development and validation are described in our previous publication13.

We conducted meta-GWAS analyses (combining the two batches of BMFF measurements) in the population of unrelated white UKBB participants to identify genetic variants associated with the BMFF of each bone region (method details are described in our previous publication15). We generated BMFF polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each bone region using formula 1:

where N is the number of SNPs in the score, βi is the effect size (beta coefficient) of variant i and dosageij is the number of copies of SNP i in the genotype of individual j. We followed the pipeline in UKBB developed by Collister et al.65 and used PLINK 2.066. Each SNP effect estimate derived from our BMFF meta-GWAS is referred to as the ‘βi'. To be specific, the PRS for each bone region was constructed by adding up the number of BMFF-increasing alleles for each SNP, weighted for the SNP effect size on BMFF level (beta coefficients from meta-GWAS).

The quality control of the SNPs and samples used to generate PRS for each bone region is summarized in Supplementary Data 11-13. In SNP quality control, we retained significant SNPs (linkage disequilibrium LD r2 < 0.6, P value < 5 × 10−8) found in meta-GWAS, with missingness <0.05, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test P value > 10–12, non-multiallelic, imputation quality (INFO) > 0.4, and minor allele frequency > 0.005. We further excluded ambiguous AT/CG variants, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). The PRS were first calculated based on 48 SNPs for femoral head, 115 for total hip, 99 for diaphysis, and 119 for spine (Supplementary Data 14). In addition, we conducted a sensitivity PRS analysis, which further excluded SNPs associated with BMD from the instrumental variants selected. LD proxies (r2 > 0.6) for significant SNPs passing quality control were generated using the LDproxy function in the LDlinkR package (https://github.com/CBIIT/LDlinkR (version 1.4.0) with 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 as LD reference panel). We searched the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD of each bone region (BMD GWAS details are presented in Supplementary Data 42). A GWAS for diaphysis BMD was not found. The BMD GWASes for the remaining three bone regions (femoral head, total hip, spine) reported distinct significant SNPs associations (Supplementary Data 43). We cross-compared BMFF LD proxies and BMD SNPs and excluded any overlapping SNPs from the list of instrumental variants to construct the PRS. In the PRS sensitivity analysis, the PRS were calculated based on 46 SNPs for femoral head, 114 for total hip, and 117 for spine (Supplementary Data 15). The PRS for diaphysis was not updated due to the absence of a corresponding GWAS or overlaps of instrumental variants in the remaining three bone regions. The variance explained by genetic instrumental variants (R2) for each PRS was estimated following formula 2:

Here, EAF represents the effect allele frequency and β denotes the SNP beta coefficient67.

In sample quality control, we sub-grouped participants based on their ancestry as ‘White' using the UKBB data-field 22006 (“Genetic ethnic grouping”) and excluded UKBB withdrawals, individuals who were outliers for heterozygosity or missing rates, individuals with a missing rate >0.02 on autosomes, individuals with sex discordance (between the phenotypic and genetically inferred sex), individuals who were not in a maximal set of unrelated individuals up to 3rd degree, and participants included in our meta-GWAS. The study retained 305,313 participants for femoral head, 305,453 for total hip, 306,222 for diaphysis, and 303,066 for spine (Supplementary Data 13).

In summary, we generated two PRSs for each bone region as presented in Supplementary Data 14-15.

We performed a PheWAS to identify disease outcomes associated with BMFF in four bone regions. Disease outcomes were defined based on the PheCODE schema (with 10,750 unique ICD-10 codes and 3113 ICD-9 codes) using national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) until 31 March 2023. The PheCODE schema combines correlated ICD codes into a distinct code based on the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10) and excludes patients with related diseases from the corresponding control groups68. Herein, we defined cases based on the presence of at least one ICD code mapping to each PheCODE, consistent with our previous publications69,70,71,72,73. We translated the ICD codes into PheCODE groups, which included 1808 PheCODEs classified into 17 disease categories70,74,75,76. Further details of the PheCODE schema and application are provided in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Note 1).

In Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was measured by our deep-learning models and is presented as rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region. The quality control of Obs-PheWAS sample is presented in Supplementary Data 1. We used deep-learning BMFF measurements as the exposure and included only incident cases (defined as disease diagnosed after at least six months of undergoing UKBB MRI imaging) in the PheWAS analysis. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging. We performed the analysis only for those PheCODEs with >200 incident cases, the threshold suggested by the power estimates for PheWAS analysis77. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to include both incident and prevalent cases. We corrected the P values for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) q value threshold of 0.0578.

In PRS-PheWAS, BMFF PRS were generated for each bone region. We used genetically proxied BMFF level as the exposure and included PheCODEs with >200 incident and prevalent cases. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components (PC). We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses78.

To investigate sex-specific associations in each bone region, we performed sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS analyses.

The analyses were performed using the ‘PheWAS' package [https://github.com/PheWAS/PheWAS] (R version 4.4.1).

We conducted two-sample MR analyses to investigate the potential causal associations between BMFF (exposure) and the risk of osteoporosis, fractures and T2D (outcomes). We followed the STROBE-MR (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using Mendelian randomization) guidelines (Please see Supplementary Note 2 in the Supplementary Information file).

We adhered to the three core genetic instrumental variants (IV) assumptions: (1) Relevance: the IV is associated with the exposure of interest; (2) Independence: the IV is independent of any confounders of the exposure-outcome association; and (3) Exclusion Restriction: the IV selected for MR analysis are not associated with the outcome of interest independently of the exposure79. To meet the assumptions, we obtained IVs by filtering for BMFF meta-GWAS genome-wide significant SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8), followed by linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based clumping using the ‘TwoSampleMR' R package with the following parameters: clump_kb = 10, 000, clump_r2 for two thresholds (r2 = 0.001 or r2 = 0.6), pop = ”EUR”, and excluded those SNPs associated with BMD or T2D to ensure that any observed association between IVs and outcomes is mediated through the exposure (BMFF), maintaining the validity of causal inference. The strength of genetic IVs was tested with the F-statistic (https://shiny.cnsgenomics.com/mRnd/). The F-statistic was calculated using formula 3:

Here, β represents the beta coefficient of SNP on the exposure, and SE is the standard error of the beta80. The F-statistic was estimated to assess whether there was a possibility of weak instrument bias. The genetic instruments for each outcome were derived from summary statistics of the most recent publicly available GWASes of European ancestry with the largest sample size, obtained from the MRC IEU GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). The identifier for the osteoporosis GWAS81 is ebi-a-GCST90038656, for the fractures GWAS81 is ebi-a-GCST90038703, and for the type 2 diabetes GWAS82 is ebi-a-GCST90018926. BOLT-LMM coefficients, if reported in the outcome GWASes, were transformed to log-odds scale. Summary statistics of the SNP-exposure association and the SNP-outcome association were combined to estimate the causal effect of the exposure on the outcome. SNP effect data for the exposure and outcome were harmonized to ensure consistency in effect direction and allele matching. Harmonization (‘harmonise_dat' function in ‘TwoSampleMR' package) involved aligning the effect alleles across exposure and outcome datasets, correcting for strand mismatches, and excluding palindromic SNPs with ambiguous allele frequencies.

In MR analyses, six methods were employed to examine the causal association between exposure and outcome, including IVW, MR-Horse62, MR-Egger, weighted mode, weighted median, and simple model, among which IVW and MR-Horse were the primary methods83. MR-Horse is a Bayesian model with horseshoe shrinkage that can account for valid instruments, uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy62. Horizontal pleiotropy tests were performed based on (i) MR-Egger regression (intercept close to 0, P value > 0.05: no evidence for horizontal pleiotropy), and (ii) MR-PRESSO (detected and corrected for horizontal pleiotropy by identifying outlier variants)84. The heterogeneity test was estimated based on Cochran's Q statistic. To further assess the robustness of the MR findings, we used the leave-one-out analysis to investigate the influence of outlying and/or pleiotropic genetic variants85. MR results were visualized using scatter plots (to display the consistency of causal estimates across different MR methods, and the overall direction of causality), forest plots (to present the causal effect estimates of individual SNPs), funnel plots (to detect asymmetry, which could indicate horizontal pleiotropy or publication bias), and leave-one-out plots (to test IV outliers on the causal estimates).

In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses using IVs derived from the BMI-unadjusted BMFF meta-GWAS (LD clumping threshold: r²<0.001) to assess potential collider bias in our primary MR results.

All tests were two-sided. MR applied the FDR-Q correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant). The analysis was performed using the ‘TwoSampleMR', ‘MR-PRESSO', and ‘R2jags' packages [https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR] (R version 4.4.1).

All data for BMFF and BM segmentation volumes have been uploaded to the UKBB (upload ID 5858), where they will be available under UKBB Category 105 to any individuals with an approved UKBB project. Researchers can apply for UKBB access via the UKBB Access Management System (https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/). PheCODEs were generated using data from the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10). PRSs were constructed using data from our previous BMFF meta-GWAS15 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55422-4). To exclude any SNPs independently associated with BMD or type 2 diabetes, we searched GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD or type 2 diabetes; these studies are described in the manuscript. The remaining data are reported in the Supplementary Data files.

Alongside the commercial aspects of setting up a company, such as filing patents, attracting investors and recruiting staff, science entrepreneurs face a more creative challenge: what to call their business. 

In January, Richard Kuo described how his spin-off from the University of Edinburgh, UK, became Wobble Genomics. The name is a reference to biologist Francis Crick's hypothesis that, in some RNA molecules, the third base in a nucleotide triplet pairs more flexibly than the other two — in other words, that a ‘wobble' occurs at this position. Kuo said he also reasoned that something “a little bit silly-sounding would probably stick in people's heads better”.

Series: The meaning behind our moniker

Reagan Jarvis, chief executive and co-founder of Anocca, an immunotherapy biotechnology company in Södertälje, Sweden, says Kuo's reasoning was spot on, and could spark a discussion with potential customers, investors or employees. “I think it's a great name. It's topical, it's relevant. I know what a wobble base pair is, and you can have an extended conversation about that.” 

Maneesh Jain is a co-founder and chief executive of Mirvie, a pregnancy-health biotech firm in San Francisco, California. A physicist by training, Jain recalls starting ParAllele, his first company, in 2000. Its work involved studying mutations in the human genome. “Each variant is called an allele, and we were doing thousands in parallel, so we thought ParAllele would be a pretty interesting name,” he says.

“Unfortunately, most often, people would call up and say, ‘Oh, hello, is that Paralegal?' So sometimes, names can be a bit too clever. Literal names sound exciting, but I think sometimes they come with unintended consequences.”

An outbreak of Ebola has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), with 47 confirmed cases, including 25 deaths, as of yesterday, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). There are also a probable 10 additional cases and deaths, the WHO says.

On 4 September, the DRC's Ministry of Health confirmed that the outbreak was caused by the Zaire ebolavirus, the most dangerous and common of Ebola virus strains, which was also responsible for the 2014–16 outbreak in West Africa. 

The WHO has issued a call for US$21 million to support the response of the DRC's government. The agency says that priorities are sending health workers to affected communities, identifying cases as early as possible, increasing community engagement, providing treatment and reducing transmission.

Although the precise source of the outbreak is not known, researchers say that it probably arose from a spillover event, in which the virus transfers from an infected animal, such as a bat, to humans. 

“It's not identical to previous strains that have been identified, which strongly suggests that it's a new spillover event,” says epidemiologist Peter Horby of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford, UK. 

The outbreak is currently confined to four regions of Kasai province: Bulape, Mweka, Mushenge and Kakenge. These areas are remote and isolated, making it challenging for responders to reach them, Horby says. 

“I think the big problem is that the patients — because it's an isolated area and it's very rural — are presenting very late, with quite advanced disease and have very restricted health-care systems, so the mortality rate is very high,” he adds. 

Although this makes tackling the outbreak difficult, “the remoteness may shield the outbreak [from] other settings”, says Henry Kyobe Bosa, who leads the Ebola and COVID-19 response for Uganda's Ministry of Health.

Next to the flashy redesign of the iPhone 17 Pro and the ultrathin, ultralight iPhone Air, the iPhone 17 may feel quite plain. But I'm here to tell you that I don't think there has ever been a better base model in the annual iPhone lineup.

It helps that the iPhone 17 has many of the features of its pricier siblings, from the brighter screen with ProMotion and Ceramic Shield 2 to the new square-shaped 18-MP selfie camera. No, you don't need to upgrade if you have an iPhone 16 or iPhone 15—maybe even an iPhone 13. But at $799, it remains the iPhone most people should buy, especially considering its cameras and battery life have a leg up over the pricier iPhone Air.

Bear with me for a second, because the most exciting upgrade for the iPhone 17 isn't going to sound very exciting: It's a faster refresh rate. Android phones have had 120-Hz screens for nearly a decade, and while it was exclusive to high-end devices at the start, the capability quickly trickled down. Today, you can find phones under $300 with high refresh rates. Apple limited the feature, dubbed “ProMotion,” to its Pro iPhones for the past four years, but it finally caught up with the rest of the market, adding a 120-Hz display for the iPhone 17.

What exactly does it do? Older non-Pro iPhones have 60-Hz screens—the display is showing you an image 60 times per second. The iPhone 17's screen doubles that, meaning you're seeing twice as many images per second. This will make everything on the screen appear smoother and more fluid, even if you're just scrolling through Instagram.

Even better, it supports a variable refresh rate, dropping as low as 1 Hz when the screen is static, like on the lock screen. That's what enables this iPhone to support the always-on display—by being able to ratchet the refresh rate down to 1 Hz, the display is more efficient and doesn't impact battery life as much. You now have an always-on display (if you want it), and anything you do on the phone will feel smoother. Hooray!

The screen is slightly bigger now, 6.3 inches, but more impressive is the display brightness, which can hit a peak of 3,000 nits. Even on the sunniest days here in New York City, I had no trouble seeing the contents of the screen. That's perhaps also thanks to the new anti-reflective coating to help cut glare. And Apple's new Ceramic Shield 2, supposedly three times more scratch-resistant than before, protects the screen. Glass is still glass—I already have a tiny scratch on my display. Use a case and screen protector!

I've been very impressed with battery life. After a week of use, I'm consistently hitting more than six hours of screen-on time, and some of those days involved using GPS navigation, music streaming, and hours of doomscrolling on Instagram Reels. I have yet to find myself worried that my phone is going to die. It easily bests the iPhone Air's battery life and comes close to the iPhone 17 Pro, but if you want the absolute best run time, look to the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

If you're coming from a phone older than the iPhone 15 (I hope you are!), remember that the iPhone now has a USB-C port. That means any Lightning accessories you have will require an adapter, but it's a good time to switch everything over to USB-C. The only annoying bit is that Apple limits data transfer speeds to the same 480 Mbps, whereas the iPhone 17 Pro enjoys USB 3 speeds up to 10 Gbps. You probably transfer most of your data between devices wirelessly, so this isn't something that impacts most folks. But other phones in this price bracket support faster speeds, so it's a silly limitation.

The A19 chip powering the whole phone is an excellent performer. Seriously, for the vast majority of apps and games, this processor kills. Folks who routinely download the most demanding mobile games, like Assassin's Creed Mirage, will find it a little limiting. I cranked the graphics to the max, and the game frequently stuttered and even froze a few times. Not to mention the iPhone 17 got really hot and nearly uncomfortable to hold. That's because it doesn't have the vapor chamber cooling system of the Pro models. Most games will be fine—Monster Survivor ran without a hitch—but heavy mobile gamers may want the A19 Pro chip that's in the iPhone 17 Pro.

The iPhone 17 runs iOS 26, and you can find many of the top new features here, most important of which are the call- and message-screening features to limit the number of spam and robocalls. I appreciate that Apple hasn't shoved Apple Intelligence down our throats like it did with the iPhone 16 launch. However, there are some areas I'd like to see it improve. Namely, the voice dictation service. I frequently use voice to type, and Apple's keyboard routinely gets stuff wrong, forcing me to spend more time fixing my messages before I hit Send. Google's Assistant Voice Typing on its Pixel phones is the gold standard, and this feature really needs an upgrade on the iPhone.

The biggest improvement on the camera front is the upgraded 48-MP camera sensor for the ultrawide, as well as the 24-MP selfie camera with a square sensor (binned to 18 megapixels). The latter is most exciting, and it's the same as in the Air and iPhone 17 Pro. Basically, the square sensor makes it so you don't have to manually rotate your phone to capture a landscape selfie. It's paired with Apple's Center Stage feature, which auto-rotates and zooms out to keep subjects in the frame.

Let's say you're snapping a selfie with a friend. Center Stage will automatically widen the camera's field of view to ensure both people are in the shot. Now, if you have more than two people in the frame, it'll switch to landscape orientation so no one is cut off, even as you hold the phone in portrait. (You can manually rotate the camera orientation too.) That means there's less of a chance you'll drop your iPhone as you extend your hand out. It's smart, and I suspect we'll see a similar version of this feature on Android phones in 2026.

I trotted around Brooklyn with the iPhone 17 and the Pixel 10, a direct competitor at $799. For the most part, the iPhone 17's main camera delivered slightly sharper and more natural-looking results than the Pixel 10. The results from the ultrawide were very similar to the iPhone 17 Pro models and were far less noisy than the shots from the Pixel 10. It further demolished the competition in video capture—even trouncing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge—with better stabilization and brighter, sharper footage.

However, one area where phones like the Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 have an edge over the iPhone 17 is zoom. Both of those phones have a third telephoto camera that can zoom up to 5X or 3X, respectively. That's a big deal. You'll probably want to zoom in to capture your kid accepting their diploma, or your favorite musician on stage at a concert, or that cute bird sitting in a tree. There is no reason that one of the wealthiest companies in the world can't stuff a telephoto zoom camera in this phone when nearly every other competitor has it.

Barring this, you're left with a smartphone that delivers great battery life, has an excellent screen, top-tier performance, and a reliable dual-camera system with some of the best video capabilities. Apple has also bumped internal storage to 256 GB—high time! I love the color options this year, even if they're not as bright and fun as the iPhone 16 range.

The only question is how long 8 GB of RAM will be deemed “enough,” especially as artificial intelligence features increasingly demand more. It might be that some Apple Intelligence features in two to three years are only available in the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Pro, since they have 12 GB of RAM, but Apple is no stranger to gatekeeping features. I don't think you need to worry about it too much. (How many Apple Intelligence features are you using right now?)

The main thing Apple has proved? Yet again, few people really need to buy Pro.

White nationalist livestreamer Nick Fuentes finds it very difficult to hide his contempt for his own followers, known as Groypers—even when they are sending him money.

“Can you fuck off and kill yourself and die,” Fuentes muttered during a livestream on the alternative streaming platform Rumble earlier this month. The antisemitic, anti-trans, misogynistic, and racist influencer was responding to a follower who sent him a $10 Super Chat message, offering advice on how to treat the cold Fuentes was suffering from.

Groypers are a group of extremely loyal supporters of Fuentes' white nationalist and Christian nationalist ideology, which he describes as “America First.” Their leader's undisguised disdain for them, which at times edges into outright hatred and name-calling, is part of his appeal. Younger viewers in particular view his unvarnished responses and unwavering views on immigration, Israel, and Donald Trump (he's against them all) as genuine and authentic, especially compared to what other right-wing influencers offer up.

Now, Fuentes is looking to leverage his rapidly growing audience, and a new level of influence among more mainstream figures in the GOP and MAGA movement, to build a nationwide secret society of sorts, which he believes will help bring his vision of an America dominated by white Christians to fruition.

“The country overall, I think, is closer to accepting our position than they were 10 years ago,” Fuentes said in a recent livestream. “I think we're kind of still waiting for that inflection point, and once that happens, I think it happens all very quickly.”

After a decade of livestreaming hate-filled diatribes in which he has said certain types of rape are “not a big deal,” denied the Holocaust, and compared himself to Hitler, Fuentes believes he, and the white nationalist movement generally, have very little to show for it.

But in the wake of the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, things have been happening very quickly.

For the last six years, Fuentes had relentlessly attacked the Turning Point USA cofounder, focusing especially on his support for Israel. Fuentes also repeatedly called out Kirk's unwillingness to debate him. In the aftermath of Kirk's death, Fuentes struck a more conciliatory tone, urging followers not to pick up arms, but also repeated that he believes Kirk was “complicit in the Israeli capture of the right wing for a very long time.”

Rather than damaging Fuentes' popularity, Kirk's death has accelerated it. His X following has grown by almost 175,000 since Kirk's death, and he has seen his following on Rumble increase by more than 100,000.

His livestream commemorating the death of Kirk was among his most watched by far, with over 2.5 million views. His livestream the following Monday discussing who was responsible for Kirk's death also saw a higher-than-normal viewership. In the space of less than an hour, Fuentes earned over $5,500 from the top 50 Super Chat donations made by supporters, according to a review by WIRED.

Fuentes did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

For years, Fuentes was viewed as a pariah by people within the Republican Party and the MAGA movement. “I don't think anybody should be spending any time with Nick Fuentes,” then House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said in 2022, days after Trump had dined with the antisemitic musician and fashion mogul Ye and the America First leader at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

But over the course of the last year, coinciding with Elon Musk's decision to reinstate Fuentes' X account, his influence has skyrocketed, despite—or perhaps because of—his criticism of Trump's failed campaign promises around the Epstein case and mass deportations, as well as his support for Israel.

“He is on a generational run. I don't care what anyone says, he is on fire right now,” comedian Vincent Oshana said while appearing on the podcast of right-wing influencer Patrick Bet-David, who interviewed Trump last year. Fuentes has been praised—albeit usually with heavy caveats—by, among others, manosphere star Myron Gaines, right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza, and livestreamer Adin Ross, who hosted Trump during last year's presidential campaign.

Fuentes has also been at the center of a very public fight with mainstream right-wing media figures Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. Carlson called Fuentes a “weird little gay kid in his basement” and suggested he was part of a deep-state plot to undermine real right-wing figures; most observers, especially his own supporters, concluded that Fuentes came out on top.

“Young Trump supporters listen to Nick Fuentes, and if they don't listen to him, they listen to people who have been influenced by him,” says Michael Edison Hayden, an extremism researcher and author of the forthcoming book Strange People on the Hill, which follows a small town's takeover by a white nationalist group. “He's absolutely influential on immigration, on antisemitism and optics—whether establishment Republicans want to admit that or not.”

Born in 1998, Fuentes, grew up in a well-off suburb of Chicago. By the time he was 18, a freshman in Boston University, he was already livestreaming, launching what he would call America First with Nicholas J. Fuentes on YouTube. Having gained a cult following, in February 2017 Fuentes brought his show to the Trump-aligned Right Side Broadcasting Network.

The so-called alt-right of which he was a part, and Fuentes' brand of edgy nihilism specifically, fell apart in the wake of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August 2017. At the time, Fuentes wrote on Facebook that the event, which resulted in the death of antifascist activist Heather Heyer, would unleash a “tidal wave of white identity,” something that at the time didn't happen.

Fuentes returned to YouTube before he was banned from the platform in 2020 for violating the company's hate speech policies. He continued broadcasting his show on DLive, an alternative streaming platform, but was once again suspended indefinitely in 2021 after he was in attendance outside the Capitol on January 6, 2021, where he was captured on video speaking to supporters. One of the rioters inside the Capitol on that day was captured on video waving an America First flag.

Fuentes moved his show to a custom platform called Cozy TV that he built in collaboration with Alex Jones. More recently, he has found a welcoming home on Rumble, the alternative media platform that also hosts Donald Trump Jr.'s podcast and has been backed financially by both Peter Thiel and a venture capital fund cofounded by Vice President JD Vance.

Despite being suspended from most major social media platforms, last year Fuentes was reinstated on X by Musk, who wrote that he could stay on the platform “provided he does not violate the law, and let him be crushed by the comments and Community Notes.”

Rather than being crushed, Fuentes has seen his following skyrocket from 168,000 at the time his account was restored in May 2024, to almost 925,000 today.

In a recent interview with Eric Orwoll, one of the founders of a whites-only community in Arkansas, Fuentes complained that for all that has happened since Trump came to power, there are very few groups who are operating right now in the “pro-white” sphere.

He listed Jared Taylor's white nationalist American Renaissance conference, and VDare, a white nationalist group founded in 1999 by Peter Brimelow that has been designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Fuentes also mentioned his own show, and the antisemitic Culture Wars magazine.

But Fuentes believes that he and the Groyper army can change that.

Despite his growing influence within the GOP and the Trump administration, as well as his rapidly rising support among young white men in America, Fuentes has repeatedly said that in order for his movement to make an impact, it needs to operate in the shadows.

“No rallies, no protests, we don't need to show everybody how many of us there are because the second that we do, they will identify, isolate, and destroy us,” Fuentes said on a recent livestream. “We want them to have no clue how many Groypers there are, where they are, who they are. We want them to be completely in the dark.”

Fuentes says that he travels the country constantly to meet his supporters, who have started different groups and organizations across the country—everything from campus groups to book clubs, all founded on the racist, antisemitic doctrine he preaches on his livestreams.

He described his movement as a “tech startup” and “a patchwork that eventually we're going to knit together … over time,” adding that he saw Orwoll's whites-only community in Arkansas as part of that network.

“There are certainly Groypers within the administration, and I believe [Fuentes] when he says that he has contacts within the administration, including probably pretty high up,” says Hannah Gais, an extremism researcher with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

There are signs that figures familiar with Fuentes' movement play roles in the administration. Back in May, for example, Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia—who at one point allegedly grilled career FBI agents about their loyalty to Trump, according to a recent lawsuit—to head up the Office of Special Counsel. Ingrassia attended an impromptu rally in June 2024 after Fuentes had been denied entry to a Turning Point USA conference. Ingrassia later claimed to have been unaware of who was speaking at the rally; however, he wrote an X post at the time condemning the decision by Turning Point USA to eject Fuentes. It's unclear at this point if a vote to confirm Ingrassia's appointment will happen.

Ingrassia and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

On one livestream earlier this month, a young supporter told Fuentes that he was getting some of his friends into the movement and said it was “growing at an exponential rate,” adding that “you have the youth in this country sold on this movement.”

While this may be an exaggeration, Fuentes' young supporters are sold to the point where they are willing to fund him and his ambitions.

In addition to what he raises with Super Chats, Fuentes also has a subscription service called America First Plus. For $15 a month subscribers get access to the full America First archive. Thirty dollars a month gets you the archive plus “AI powered search.” For the most dedicated Groypers, there is a $100-a-month tier that also gets you access to a group chat that Fuentes is part of.

In a recent video criticizing the people who are part of the group chat, Fuentes claims that he's got 400 subscribers to the $100-a-month tier, which would amount to $50,000 a year.

Fuentes also earns money from his range of America First merchandise, including $40 baseball caps and $25 mugs.

“I'll be honest with you, I made a lot of money this summer,” Fuentes said recently. “And I got a lot of support this month, this year, lots of views, lots of followers.”

Those followers are helping to get the word out. Fuentes livestreams five times a week on Rumble, where his videos typically rack up hundreds of thousands of views. Clips from his shows are quickly spread by supporters on many other platforms, including X, Instagram, and TikTok, where they can quickly amass millions of views.

Fuentes' disdain for many of his supporters appears to have no impact on his popularity, but the 27-year-old is clear that what he refers to as the “grug-level” supporters are not what is needed in order for his movement to take control. Instead, Fuentes speaks about attracting “elite human capital,” supporters who will then become part of an “officer class” of “super intelligent, entrepreneurial” people.

“Once we get 1,000, 5,000 of those guys, those are going to be the party officials, party apparatics as an analogy,” Fuentes said. “I'm kind of interested in inspiring those people, indoctrinating those people. They watch a show, they get the ideas, they get the inspiration, they kind of take a project into their own hands.”

Searches at the US border are at an all-time high. Between April and June of this year, US Customs and Border Protection says it searched nearly 15,000 devices, outpacing the previous quarterly record by over 2,000. Combined with visitors allegedly being turned away for content on their devices and hours-long detentions at ports of entry, it's reasonable to be a little worried about entering the US.

There's a lot you can do to protect yourself at the US border, but most people have at least some sensitive information they need to keep on a phone or laptop while traveling. That's where 1Password, the password manager, and its Travel Mode feature come into play.

Although it can't remove everything, Travel Mode can erase a lot. The way it works is simple: You organize your logins, notes, attachments, and other sensitive information into a series of vaults. From there, you can choose which vaults are safe for travel and which aren't. When you turn on Travel Mode, your selected vaults aren't only hidden; 1Password claims they're entirely removed from your device.

The legality and scope of device searches at the border are complex. Broadly speaking, CBP can't deny entry to US citizens or green card holders if they don't comply with a device search. But they can make your life really difficult, with longer detentions and device seizures. “You can state that you don't consent to such a search, but unfortunately, this likely won't prevent Customs and Border Protection from taking your phone,” according to the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.

According to CBP's own policies, “Officers may not use the device to access information that is solely stored remotely.” Unfortunately, those policies may not always play out cleanly. “This is essentially a limitless authority that they claim for themselves to search travelers without a warrant and to search the full scope of information people carry on them,” says Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

Travel Mode can't prevent a search, but it could help you store information you'd rather border agents not see. It's for a little extra peace of mind that, in the event of an invasive search, some of your data won't be accessible. It works well for two reasons. First, Travel Mode removes marked vaults from your device completely. You can sign into the 1Password app and do everything else you normally would, but your travel vaults won't be there. It's as if the vaults you marked never existed in the first place.

You'll want to restore these vaults eventually, but border agents won't be able to do that. 1Password says you can only turn Travel Mode on or off from a browser (at 1password.com) that's been authenticated with both your secret key and master password. So, even if a border agent seizes your phone, there's no way to turn off Travel Mode from the 1Password app.

“As a practical matter, a border agent can't search what isn't in your possession when crossing the border,” Bill Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to WIRED in an email. “As a feature that limits the amount of data you carry with you, Travel Mode seems like a good way to protect that data.”



1Password (Single, Yearly)

1Password (Family, Yearly)

It's easy to turn Travel Mode on and off with 1Password, but there's some important housekeeping you should do beforehand.

Mark vaults as safe for travel. When you create a new vault with 1Password, you can mark it as safe for travel. If it's marked, it won't be removed from your device when you turn Travel Mode on. For existing vaults, you can mark them as safe or not safe for travel using the cog icon on the vault at my.1password.com.

Store your emergency kit somewhere safe. 1Password has an emergency kit, which includes your secret key, login email, a setup QR code, and a space to write (or type) your master password. You can generate an emergency kit at my.1password.com with the Manage Account button. You can print this and physically store it somewhere safe, or upload it to an encrypted cloud storage service like Proton Drive; make sure the device you're traveling with isn't logged into that storage service.

In the event you can't log back into your account and turn off Travel Mode, you can get in using any browser and your emergency kit.

Organize your entries into different vaults. 1Password doesn't have a hard limit on the number of vaults you can create, so it's worth spending some time organizing different entries into their own vaults. You can store a lot of information in your 1Password vaults beyond passwords, including documents and passkeys. Separating sensitive documents from your Spotify login will make it a lot easier to toggle on Travel Mode without double-checking all of your entries.

You can remove all of your vaults, but I recommend keeping some essentials available through 1Password. Ideally, you'll turn on Travel Mode before heading to the airport and only turn it off after you're through customs. If you're using a laptop (or other device) you brought with you to turn Travel Mode on and off, that kind of defeats the purpose.

Once that's done, you can turn on Travel Mode following these steps:

Travel Mode goes into effect instantly, and I mean instantly. Even with my 1Password vault opened on my phone, I was immediately returned to an empty vault after enabling Travel Mode on my desktop.

Travel Mode is handy in the context of your phone. But what about your laptop? Technically, CBP isn't allowed to turn off Travel Mode through the browser on your laptop, but that doesn't account for any rogue actors or other, more strict border agencies.

Unfortunately, there isn't a Travel Mode for your laptop, but there are some options if you want to make sure your devices are completely secure. Most laptops come with ways to encrypt data. With Windows, it's through BitLocker, with macOS, it's through FileVault, and Chromebooks are encrypted out of the box. That layer of encryption protects against dumping your PC for later analysis, but if you're forced to enter your password, it doesn't do much.

Enter VeraCrypt. It's a free, open source encryption app that can encrypt full drives, as well as operating system partitions, similar to BitLocker or FileVault. The big feature of VeraCrypt is plausible deniability. There are specific setup steps, but you can store an encrypted partition within an encrypted partition.

When you encrypt a drive with VeraCrypt, it writes random data to any free space available on the drive. Within that free space, you can set up another encrypted volume with a different password. It'll appear as random data, just as if you didn't have anything written in the free space.

VeraCrypt is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Alternatives are available for iOS and Android, as well, but I haven't tested those myself. You shouldn't need to set up VeraCrypt on your laptop, and if you do, you might want to reconsider traveling with it in the first place. But if you need protection regardless of the hassle, it's a good option to consider.

1Password and Travel Mode are great, and VeraCrypt is a useful tool to keep in your back pocket. But there's a lot of other data on your phone that could cause issues that neither of them helps with. Photos, messages, and even apps you have installed could all cause problems, so it's a good idea to either travel with a secondary device or clean up your primary device.

“The general principle of data minimization can go a long way,” Budington says. “Try to thoughtfully consider what is important to take with you, and what can be left behind. Then, try to minimize what you take with you across the border to only the essentials. If you are taking a vacation, do you really need that work laptop with you?”

For data minimization, Budington pointed to removing data from your device. You can use Travel Mode for some of that data, along with “a backup service which is protected by a passphrase you know and can recall if you need to.”

After you're done storing what you need in the cloud, make sure to log out of your account. CBP's official policy is that it can't search data stored in the cloud, but a lot of storage services will keep a local copy when disconnected from the internet. WIRED spoke with several experts about how to protect yourself at the US border in June, and I recommend following their guidance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Confessions of a Black Looksmaxxer","https://www.wired.com/story/confessions-of-a-black-looksmaxxer/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Stephen Imeh wanted to make history. He'd never really dreamt of being an influencer, but in April he noticed an opportunity to break through.

There were virtually no looksmaxxers—people who spend enormous amounts of effort to glow up—who looked like him, and he wanted to change that. So he made a plan. Imeh posted a workout video on TikTok, with plans for more, and updated his bio to “FIRST BLACK LOOKSMAXXER.”

But as soon as the 20-year-old Houston-based college student posted the video, he was bombarded by racist comments. “I don't think even an hour went by and I was getting comments like, you're a monkey, you're an n-word hard r,” he says. Another comment suggested Imeh “just be white,” or “jbw” as it's known in incel circles. None of it made sense to him. “I was like, wait, what?”

It wasn't Imeh's first encounter with looksmaxxing, the online movement most prominent among young men that emerged from incel culture and took off on TikTok in 2023, which promotes maximizing your physical attractiveness. In 2022, Imeh was a junior at a predominantly white high school in Texas that only had “three other Black kids,” and he wasn't fitting in. He decided to search for self-improvement tips online. “I googled ‘How to look better' and the number one thing was looksmaxxing,” he says. Suggestions included a tongue exercise called mewing, working out, healthier eating habits, even plastic surgery. Imeh only lasted two weeks before he called it quits. “It was kinda cringe.” But because it happened the year before looksmaxxing blew up on TikTok, he says, “I didn't tell anyone about it.”

In the three years since that experience, looksmaxxing has become more popular than ever, and Imeh, currently studying to be a speech therapist, wanted to give it another shot. Maybe he could be the face of a Black looksmaxxers trend, he reasoned. But he felt the ecosystem had become even more toxic in his absence. “The community before, it wasn't as bad. But it spawned a new wave of people.”

The ordeal in April was a wake-up call. Today, Imeh posts anti-looksmaxxing content to his 36,000 followers. “I'm obviously not included in this community, so why would I keep trying to contribute?” His videos poke fun at the movement's flaws and silly status markers, like being able to “mog” someone, which means you are the better looking person in a side-by-side comparison. (This is his fifth TikTok account after being reported by members of SkinnyTok for also calling out pro-eating disorder content.) “It's so easy to rage-bait” looksmaxxers, he says. “I might post, ‘This is what I do to get my skin clear,' then someone will comment ‘Oh, you can never get your skin clear because you're a Black slur, slur, slur,” he says over FaceTime, repeating the word half a dozen times.

Looksmaxxing, which originated in online forums like 4chan a decade ago, suggests that a man's success in life is directly tied to how good he looks. The purpose of the movement is to increase your overall “sexual market value,” and the more Eurocentric features you have, the higher you are on the “physical sexual looks” scale. On message boards, looksmaxxers use codes to rate other men on their journey. Young men refer to the process as “ascending,” where they work to attain a chiseled jawline, glass-smooth skin, and “hunter eyes” (almond-like contour, deep-set position, low set eyebrows). Those who have earned “Chad” status are considered among the most desirable of the pack. Many of the movement's aims align with the wave of manosphere ideology that is reanimating American society under the Trump administration, where hypermasculinity has become both a performance and a weapon of oppression.

For a trend obsessed with the pursuit of beauty, looksmaxxing is also defined by how ugly it treats maxxers who are not white. Accusations of racism have followed some of its most popular influencers, like Clavicular, who, in multiple TikToks, has recited audio using the n-word and implied Black people have inferior looks. (Clavicular did not immediately respond to a request for comment.) Hate speech is also a common occurrence on popular looksmaxxing forums. In December, in a post titled “The reason why have Black genes is a nerf,” members debated why “Blacks also have worse skulls than jews.” (In gaming, “nerf” implies an attempt to weaken an opponent.) Another post suggested that “thugmaxxing”—adopting a stereotypical rapper aesthetic of someone from “the hood” with sagging pants and neck tattoos—was the only kind of “-maxxing” Black people could succeed in. Some have likened the trend to a resurgence of eugenic beauty standards, though as one TikTok user pointed out, “Racism isn't going to make you look better.”

Plastic surgeon Gary Linkov can often tell when a patient has been red-pilled by the movement. The client is typically an obsessive gym bro who asks to “improve their mid-face” or for a chin implant to help with facial symmetry. And for the most part he's happy to fulfill their requests, though he does question the racial archetype on which looksmaxxing is based. “A lot of these movements start with more of a Caucasian influence, and then more minority groups feel like they have to conform in some ways,” says Linkov, who works at Facial City Plastics in Manhattan. “But they have different features and they have their own beauty that should be enhanced and not transformed into a whole different race.”

Nonsurgical cosmetic treatments are on the rise among young men. The most popular include hair restoration, laser hair removal, and body contouring procedures like CoolSculpting, which targets fat reduction and helps tone muscles. Botox injections have also become increasingly normalized among Gen Z youth who want their chin to have a more chiseled look, relying on dermal fillers and collagen skin boosters to treat signs of aging. (These treatments are sometimes called Brotox.) According to the International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, men are undergoing cosmetic procedures at a higher rate compared to years prior to 2020.

Khai Taylor is a 21-year-old Black YouTuber who has found something of a new life thanks to the looksmaxxing movement. Not long ago, he was manning the front desk of the gym where he works when a young woman made note of his eyes. “She was like, ‘I never noticed you have really pretty eyes.' And I was just thinking, this would have never happened to me four years ago.”

Back then, he suffered from severe acne, was an introvert, and had never been on a date. “You have to understand, I had no option in the first place,” he tells me from his Dallas area home over Zoom.

Taylor got serious about looksmaxxing in 2021 and started posting his own content in 2023 because he didn't want young Black men to suffer through the same yearslong process of making the wrong mistakes. His YouTube channel is littered with tips on self-improvement and, as with most looksmaxxing creators, his content is marketed like a series of infomercials. Tutorials include “How to ACTUALLY Lose Face Fat,” “I Transformed My Ugly Subscriber Into A CHAD - And Here's How,” and my personal favorite, “How to Get an Anime Villain Body.”

In November 2023, Taylor posted “I Tried ‘Looksmaxxing' For an Entire Year”; it became his most-watched video to date, with 842,000 views. His inbox was flooded with requests from young men eager to enhance their facial aesthetics. “This was the best presentation of a looksmaxx I've ever seen, without making me feel like shit lol *,” one comment reads. At his peak, Taylor says he was coaching 10 to 15 guys a week over the phone.

It wasn't until he started posting YouTube content that he was faced with hate speech. “It's bad,” Taylor says, but notes that outside of the forums the racism is “not as outspoken and verbal as you think. It's internalized. The way they judge faces is what's the most racist to me because they base it off of white features. They're never going to use a stereotypically Black face as what's the ideal.”

Imeh also faced an intense wave of backlash for his posts. Earlier this year he was doxed and started receiving messages “every five minutes” from people suggesting he kill himself. “They love their community down,” he says.

Taylor admits some of the solutions posed by looksmaxxing are extreme. Medical professionals worry that many young men are becoming too reliant on pseudoscience—techniques like “bonesmashing,” an unproven method to remodel facial bones by breaking them—that can lead to serious complications. “That is where the movement deviates from healthy self-improvement into a territory of self-harm,” says Elaine Kung, a board-certified dermatologist at Future Bright Dermatology.

Many young men find refuge in the looksmaxxing community, Taylor says, because it explains to them why they can't attract women and equips them with the tools to do so. Given his success, I was curious how he navigates the negative associations that come with being a looksmaxxer. “I get where they're coming from because I sort of went through it,” he tells me, adding that the movement gets a bad rap because of how people view incel culture. “If you grew up until you were 22 or 23 without experiencing the touch or intimacy of a woman, being socially isolated, and people made fun of you, you would start to understand why these men are so obsessed with their facial angles and being in this space.”

And the problem is only getting worse, Imeh says. “I really do think they are so bigoted because the top looksmaxxers share their political views.” There is now a “whole world of racist rhetoric, and these young boys are eating it up,” he says, labeling the movement a “right-wing pipeline.”

“The rise of conservatism in America is feeding into their media. It's, ‘I need to have blue eyes, long hair, and bleached skin.' It's sad. There will always be an audience waiting to consume it.”

Taylor wants to counteract that sort of programming. His dream is to become a famous YouTuber. He wants to use his platform to motivate young men in all areas of their life, and he says that looksmaxxing just happened to be where he found his first audience. Most Black looksmaxxers—Austin Dunham, FitxFearless—don't call themselves that. They're lifestyle influencers who also offer advice about dating, finances, and having a “grindset” (grind mindset). It's the kind of brand Taylor wants to build.

Social media has made people hyperaware of their onscreen appearance at the same time that gendered stigmas around cosmetic procedures are disappearing. But that shift has also had harmful repercussions. “The curated, filtered reality of social media often sets an impossible standard,” says Kung, who believes the growing interest in male aesthetics is “a positive step toward self-care” but that certain aspects of looksmaxxing also champion “a very specific and often unattainable male ideal, which can fuel a dangerous obsession with one's appearance,” exacerbating issues such as body dysmorphia.

Taylor has a theory for the recent shift. “Something is happening in Western culture and media where there is an inflation of literally everything. There's a looks inflation. A physique inflation. A height inflation. It's getting to a point where you literally have to be six-foot-four, have a super giga-Chad jawline, and a jacked body just to even be looked at,” he says. “Everybody wants more. Like, nobody just wants to be normal. And it shouldn't be that way.”

Before I end the Zoom call, I tell Taylor I need to know one more thing. He's right, we do seem to be undergoing a looks inflation, but it's also one he's benefited from. He cracked the code. Returning to his earlier anecdote from the gym, I'm curious to know how else his life has improved.

Are you going on dates, having more sex?

He pauses and laughs. “To put it bluntly, yes.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Mitigating Certificate Risks To Strengthen Operational Resilience","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/mitigating-certificate-risks-to-strengthen-operational-resilience-179927.html","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:02:11 GMT","

It's Monday morning, and a global bank's customers can't log into their accounts. Trading desks are stalled, wire transfers are frozen, and call centers are overwhelmed. The culprit isn't ransomware, a DDoS attack, or even insider sabotage. It's a single expired certificate embedded in a third-party software library.

What if that same faulty certificate isn't unique to one bank, and is embedded in a widely used third-party software package adopted by dozens of other financial institutions? Within hours, outages ripple across markets. Regulators are on the phone, the press is circling, and the board is demanding answers.

This isn't just a hypothetical scenario. It's exactly what happened to Alaska Airlines last year. What looked like a minor oversight was, in fact, a breakdown in certificate lifecycle governance with widespread operational impact.

The takeaway is clear: the digital certificate supply chain is a systemic resiliency issue. Yet, too often, certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is still treated as a low-level IT task. In reality, it belongs squarely on the board's agenda.

Modern applications resemble Lego sets. Developers pull in third-party libraries, vendor-provided components, and open-source packages at scale. Each of these dependencies carries its own digital certificates. Some are issued by well-known certificate authorities, others are self-signed, and still others may be long-lived or poorly managed.

In theory, certificates guarantee authenticity and trust. In practice, too many organizations lack validation mechanisms. Vendors may provide software signed with certificates that are expired, improperly issued, or even designed to last a century. Open-source packages may rely on self-signed certificates with weak encryption.

These flaws create hidden attack surfaces — entry points adversaries can exploit to infiltrate not just one company, but entire downstream customer ecosystems.

When a certificate expires, the first people to find out are usually the IT operations team, because the outage affects them directly. Websites go down, applications stop authenticating, and customers can't transact. IT gets the emergency tickets, but the root cause often lies upstream in a lack of governance over third-party components and certificates.

That's why calling this an IT issue misses the point. The failure of certificate governance exposes an organization's inability to ensure operational continuity. In industries like financial services, health care, and critical infrastructure, such lapses aren't just inconveniences; they're existential risks. An outage or breach can damage customer trust, invite regulatory scrutiny, and cost millions in lost business.

Operational resiliency ultimately rests with leadership. Just as boards oversee financial controls or supply chain logistics, they must demand accountability for digital certificate supply chains. Without that top-down mandate, organizations remain vulnerable to preventable failures.

So why is certificate supply chain risk so challenging to manage? The answer lies in scale and fragmentation. Large enterprises may have hundreds of thousands of certificates across internal systems, cloud services, APIs, IoT devices, and third-party software. Certificates may be scattered across silos, managed differently by developers, DevOps teams, and security operations, with little coordination.

This lack of visibility creates blind spots. IT may know a certificate is expiring, but not where it sits in the dependency chain or what critical business process it secures. Developers may pull in new open-source libraries without vetting their certificate trustworthiness, leaving CISOs without a central inventory or clear picture of where risks lie.

What makes certificate failures operational problems is that no one has the whole map. Without central governance, an expiring or untrusted certificate can ripple across critical applications, triggering outages, exposing sensitive data, and magnifying risk far beyond the technical domain.

The first step to addressing this problem is visibility. Enterprises need dependency-aware inventories — not just a list of certificates, but an understanding of what each certificate secures, where it originates, and what dependencies it touches.

A dependency-aware inventory reveals:

This contextual understanding transforms CLM from reactive firefighting into proactive governance. It allows CISOs and boards to see certificates not as isolated technical artifacts but as part of the operational backbone of the business.

Visibility alone isn't enough. Once organizations know what certificates they have and what they protect, they must enforce policies consistently. That means:

Just as important, these processes must be automated. Human error is often the source of certificate-related failures, whether it's a missed renewal deadline or an overlooked validation step. Automating CLM ensures that discovery, renewal, revocation, and policy enforcement happen systematically, without relying on manual oversight.

This is where boards should focus: CLM is no longer just about renewing expiring certificates. It is about orchestrating trust across the entire software supply chain. Certificates act as the connective tissue of digital trust.

By redefining CLM as supply chain trust orchestration, organizations can elevate certificate management into a core element of operational resilience. When certificate governance fails, it's not IT that pays the price. It's the business, the customers, and the trust that binds them together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","New DOD Rule May Encourage More Whistleblowing","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/new-dod-rule-may-encourage-more-whistleblowing-179930.html","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 12:01:59 GMT","

A new rule by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) aimed at beefing up cybersecurity at contractors doing business with the agency could spawn more whistleblowers in the military-industrial complex.

The rule, set to take effect Nov. 10, governs the agency's Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program, which verifies that defense contractors are compliant with existing protections for federal contract information (FCI) and controlled unclassified information (CUI) and are protecting that information at a level commensurate with the risk from cybersecurity threats, including advanced persistent threats.

It is largely a response to a series of reports by the DOD's Inspector General from 2018 to 2023, which consistently found that the department's contract officials failed to establish processes to verify that contractors complied with selected federal cybersecurity requirements for controlled unclassified information as required by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

With the new rule, the CMMC program introduces an annual affirmation requirement, a key element for monitoring and enforcing accountability of a company's cybersecurity status.

“At a very basic level, the new CMMC Clause Rule increases the risks that a defense contractor will make a false claim to the government, which is the foundation of False Claims Act liability, by falsely certifying compliance with the rule's increased requirements,” explained Mary Inman, a partner with Whistleblower Partners, a law firm in San Francisco.

“With heightened risk of False Claims Act liability also comes increased opportunities for whistleblowers to alert the government to such transgressions and receive a financial reward,” she told TechNewsWorld.

In her Cyber Business Daily newsletter, Kate Fazzini noted that the new CMMC requirements will make cybersecurity compliance and certification explicit terms in many Department of Defense contracts.

“Misrepresentations — whether intentional or negligent — about assessments, controls, or maintaining a ‘current status' will be more easily pursued under the False Claims Act and related statutes,” she wrote. “Contractors who allow lapses in compliance, or misstate their readiness, will face heightened legal exposure — particularly if government investigators or whistleblowers bring those failures to light.”

“The changes to CMMC will make compliance failures harder to conceal and more costly to ignore,” she added. “Cyber controls will no longer be only about defense but long-term viability in a market where insiders have both the means and the motivation to speak out.”

The CMMC rule creates new incentives for cyber whistleblowing by establishing concrete compliance standards that make violations more identifiable and reportable, transforming vague security expectations into specific, measurable requirements that employees can clearly recognize when breached, observed Frank Balonis, CISO and senior vice president of operations at Kiteworks,  a provider of a secure platform for exchanging private data, based in San Mateo, Calif.

“With mandatory third-party assessments and potential False Claims Act liability for contractors who misrepresent their cybersecurity posture on federal contracts, insiders now have stronger legal protections and financial motivations to report non-compliance — particularly given that whistleblowers can receive up to 30% of recovered damages in qui tam cases,” he told TechNewsWorld.

Qui tam lawsuits, authorized under the federal False Claims Act, allow a private individual to sue on behalf of the U.S. government to expose fraud involving federal programs or contracts.

“The rule's emphasis on continuous monitoring and documentation creates extensive paper trails that make it easier for employees to substantiate claims of inadequate security practices or fraudulent certifications, while the high stakes of losing federal contracts incentivize companies to cut corners, creating more opportunities for observant employees to witness and report violations,” he said.

“This combination of clearer standards, stronger legal frameworks, and significant financial consequences transforms cybersecurity compliance from an abstract concept into a concrete area ripe for whistleblower activity,” he added.

Dale Hoak, the CISO at RegScale, a compliance automation software company in McLean, Va., argued that if an organization is doing the right thing and can prove it, whistleblowing isn't a strategic risk.

“Where it could come into play is if internal concerns are raised but ignored,” he told TechNewsWorld. “In that case, employees may feel compelled to escalate externally. The healthier path is to treat internal reporting seriously, so it rarely has to go outside the organization.”

While the new compliance requirements aim to deter adversaries from targeting defense contractors, they could make them more attractive to cybercriminals.

“Just as cybercriminals like Black Cat/ALPHV ransomware group filed SEC reports when victims failed to report cyberattacks, cybercriminal whistleblowers have one more way to threaten organizations that may have thought they met requirements but negligently and accidentally misrepresented their current status,” maintained Karen Walsh, CEO of Allegro Solutions, a cybersecurity consulting company in West Hartford, Conn.

“With the False Claims Act and related statutes being incorporated into this version of CMMC requirements, we see again a burden placed upon smaller contractors,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“CMMC has always and will always place the greatest burdens on small and mid-sized contractors,” she said.

For example, she recalled the early days of the CMMC in 2021, when the training materials noted that contracts would be held to the Christian Doctrine, established in G.L. Christian & Associates v. United States. “This unique contract law doctrine reads compliance requirements into a contract even when not expressly included, holding the contractor responsible for assuming compliance even if the DOD or upstream contractor fails to include it,” she explained.

Nevertheless, Brian Kirk, senior manager for information assurance and cybersecurity at Cherry Bekaert, an accounting and consulting firm headquartered in Raleigh, N.C., argued that the new CMMC rule is necessary to strengthen the cybersecurity posture of the Defense Industrial Base.

“Previous efforts, like requiring compliance with NIST SP 800-171, relied heavily on self-attestation, which proved insufficient,” he told TechNewsWorld. NIST SP 800-171 outlines the security requirements for protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in nonfederal systems and organizations — especially those working with the U.S. government.

“Many contractors failed to implement required controls, leaving sensitive Controlled Unclassified Information vulnerable,” Kirk explained. “CMMC introduces third-party assessments and structured accountability to ensure that contractors handling CUI are actually meeting the required cybersecurity standards.”

“With the Pentagon finalizing the CMMC rule, the program is officially moving from policy to enforceable requirements, and this has major implications for the channel,” added Andy Black, co-founder and CEO of Kovr.ai, a company focused on automating cyber compliance for cloud and hybrid environments, in Reston, Va.

“Resellers, managed service providers, and other partners supporting defense contractors now need to ensure their solutions meet CMMC standards, as contractors are increasingly required to flow these requirements through their supply chains,” he told TechNewsWorld.

John Ackerly, CEO and co-founder of Virtru, a provider of encryption and access control tools, in Washington, D.C., explained that CMMC 2.0 has been years in the making — streamlined from five levels to three, adjusted to reduce burden on small businesses, and refined through countless comment periods.

“The organizations that come out on top will be those who secured their CUI first with effective, low-time-to-value solutions, then augmented from there,” he told TechNewsWorld. “When contracts start including CMMC requirements, ‘we're working on it' won't be enough.”

Battery materials startup Sila is starting operations today at its automotive-scale manufacturing facility, located in Moses Lake, Wash.

The plant is producing a silicon-carbon anode material that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries like those used to power electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer devices. Batteries using Sila's Titan Silicon can hold 20% more energy than traditional batteries.

The new plant measures 600,000 square-feet and is situated on a 160-acre site in the arid, Eastern Washington location.

Sila's operations will start at a relatively modest capacity, producing enough anode material for 2 to 5 gigawatt hours of battery capacity. Depending on how much of the graphite is replaced by Sila's product, that initial volume is enough to power tens of thousands of EVs or millions of mobile devices. 

The plan is to scale to 250 gigawatt hours of material by the end of the decade, which would make the Sila plant the largest anode production facility in the world, the company said. Sila has shared news of partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic, and expects to start shipping material to customers as soon as next year. 

The opening of the site comes at a time when the U.S. clean energy sector is battling economic headwinds as the Trump administration has canceled funding and initiatives supporting many climate-related projects.  

The Biden administration created programs to bolster domestic battery production to compete with China, who is the global lead in manufacturing the energy cells. Sila won a $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant in 2022 as part of that effort. 

“This is not just about building a factory. It is about closing the gap between innovation and manufacturing in America,” said Gene Berdichevsky, Sila's CEO and co-founder, in a statement. 

“If we do not execute, innovation will flow to places that can,” he added. “We have to build here in the United States to create a self-sustaining innovation economy, ensuring that our advancements in next-generation battery technology, like silicon-carbon anodes, are not only conceived but also produced domestically at a global scale.”

The company broke ground in Moses Lake less than two years ago and last year raised $375 million to help fund the completion of the plant. Sila has netted more than $1.3 billion from investors. The company launched in 2011 and is based in Alameda, Calif. It has 400 employees, with 100 working at the manufacturing plant. 

“This new facility is a prime example of the domestic innovation needed to end our dependency on foreign countries for advanced battery technology and produce high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that protect our supply chains here at home,” said U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., who represents Moses Lake. 

Sila competitor Group14 Technologies is building nearby, but earlier this year laid off an undisclosed number of employees and delayed its manufacturing start date. Group14 this summer secured $463 million from investors.

California-based OneD Battery Sciences shuttered its pilot manufacturing facility in Moses Lake this past spring, and appears to have ceased all operations.  

Other Pacific Northwest battery materials startups include Ecellix and Emerald Battery Labs, which are based in Seattle, and Oregon's Skip Technologies and ZincFive.   

Sila expects to employ up to 500 people in Moses Lake when it ramps up to full capacity. It's partnering with Big Bend Community College and Columbia Basin Technical Skills Center to support workforce development.

REDMOND, Wash. — About 5 minutes before each hour, and 5 minutes after it, Microsoft Teams gets busy with people joining meetings early or late. Yes, you know who you are.

Those predictable spikes in demand are an example of a larger infrastructure challenge facing the industry: either build data centers full of chips and servers that sit idle for much of the time, waiting to handle peak loads, or risk performance issues during moments of high demand.

Microsoft has come up with a different approach. The company said Tuesday that it has successfully prototyped new advances in the field of microfluidics that let its servers run hotter and faster — a technique known as overclocking — without the risk of melting down the silicon.

“We've got these really spiky workloads — I would dearly love to be able to overclock … because then we would need way fewer servers and deliver a better experience,” said Jim Kleewein, a Microsoft technical fellow and development director for core Office 365 services, recounting the challenge he originally brought to Microsoft's silicon development teams.

Microfluidics overall is not a new concept. Instead of placing a cooling plate on top of a chip, the approach brings liquid coolant directly inside the processor itself through tiny channels. 

But Microsoft says it has developed a new approach that uses AI to customize the cooling system for the unique heat signatures of different chips running specific workloads.

The design, inspired by biology, ends up resembling the veins in a leaf, delivering coolant with greater precision to a chip's hottest spots. The company says it's up to three times more effective at removing heat than current cold plates, making overclocking more feasible.

Some of the hot spots on a chip “could have the same heat flux as the surface of the sun when you look at the very small scale,” said Husam Alissa, Microsoft's director of systems technology, referring to a technical measure of heat intensity, or density in a specific area. 

While the working prototype was demonstrated on a commercially available Intel Xeon chip, Microsoft says the innovation is part of a broader strategy to improve its entire hardware fleet. As a next step, the company is looking to incorporate the cooling technology into future versions of its own silicon, potentially including its Azure Cobalt chip and Maia AI accelerator.

Those first-party chips, unveiled in 2023, reflect Microsoft's efforts to gain control over the final piece in its cloud platform. The company is competing to efficiently train and run cutting-edge AI models against Amazon, Google, and others, which are also making their own chips.

Microsoft still uses third-party chips, including industry-standard GPUs from Nvidia and other suppliers, but it says a more integrated approach is necessary to meet the challenges of the AI era. The goal isn't to replace partners but to advance the broader ecosystem, said Rani Borkar, the corporate vice president who leads Azure hardware systems and infrastructure.

“The demands of Al are such that, frankly, hardware on its own cannot keep up,” Borkar said during a recent media briefing and tour of Microsoft's Silicon Lab in Redmond. “We really are all about co-designing, co-optimizing every layer of the stack.”

The company made two related announcements Tuesday morning:

As for the newly announced microfluidics advances, Microsoft says it will work with partners and the broader tech community to make the technology an industry standard. 

Longer term, the company sees the cooling technology as a foundational step toward a revolutionary new type of chip architecture: 3D stacking. While stacking layers of silicon dramatically reduces latency by shortening the distance data has to travel, it has been largely unfeasible because of the immense challenge of removing heat from the inner layers.

Microfluidics could eventually solve that by allowing coolant to flow between each layer of the silicon brick, a breakthrough that Microsoft's Kleewein believes could be transformative.

“That is where this could move from, ‘it's an interesting change that the rest of the industry should adopt,' to a ‘holy shit' moment in the evolution of technology,” he said.

                                What happens here matters everywhere.

Individuals who fear for their safety — perhaps from a threatening domestic partner, roommate or stalker — might also be afraid to publicly pursue a protection order that can shield them from interactions or harassment from that person.  

So a Seattle-area government program and Microsoft partnered to develop an online portal that makes it much easier for an applicant to file the required legal documents with the courts and connects them with an advocate if needed.

The Protection Order Portal is operated by the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office and has served 17 people per day on average since launching in June 2024.

The completely online process “helps save lives, and it helps people feel more safe in their home environment, in their community, and fewer children are witnesses to domestic violence,” said King County Prosecutor Leesa Manion.

Legislative changes enacted in June further strengthened these protections, including rules that inform survivors when abusers petition to restore their access to firearms or when that right is removed, and it increases the penalties when abusers are found with homemade or “ghost” guns. The law also makes it easier for minors who are guarded by a protection order to continue their coverage when turning 18.

Protection orders encompass scenarios including domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, cyber stalking and harassment. The order does not require that a crime has been committed, but applicants must provide evidence supporting their concerns.

When a judge grants an order, prohibited actions — such as contacting or coming in proximity to a protected individual — become illegal and a victim can contact police. The orders can be used to safeguard the petitioners, children and pets.

Before the COVID pandemic prompted the move to online services, “everything was pen-to-paper and parties were required to be in person for every step of the civil protection order process,” said Kelsey Greer, program manager of the Protection Order Advocacy Program.

Applications previously required multiple trips to a King County courthouse, including picking up and filing petition documents and attending three hearings. And most applicants are working without an attorney, which could make it difficult to navigate the legalese in the documents. The new portal includes an easy-to-understand questionnaire that transfers the answers to the official application.

While the process is simpler, the portal doesn't change or weaken the legal standards that must be met for protection, and a judge or commissioner has final say on the order.

Protection order renewals, modifications and terminations are still filed in person.

Requests for protection orders have risen sharply, jumping 26% from 2022 to 2023, King County officials said. The surge was due to changes in Washington law that took effect July 2022 and simplified the petition process.

Reported domestic assault declined 11% from 2019 to last year, according to a survey of 10 sample cities by the Council on Criminal Justice. But violence from intimate partners, including spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends, spiked from 2021 to 2022, reports the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. Experts point to pandemic-related isolation and financial pressure as potentially contributing to the increase.

The effort to put the protection order service online wasn't so much about saving money, said Manion, as it was about meeting the higher demand.

“We are able to serve more people,” she said. “If we had only in person, everything by paper, I don't think that we have enough hours to serve 17 petitioners a day. So there would be some parts of our community who feel afraid, know they need help, and just don't get it.”

Amazon introduced a Nova Act extension to build and test AI agents directly inside integrated development environments including Visual Studio Code, Amazon's Kiro, and Cursor.

The company says the new extension, unveiled Tuesday, addresses a common frustration for developers: the constant back-and-forth between an IDE and a browser when testing agents.

It follows the March launch of Nova Act, Amazon's AI model and toolkit for creating autonomous agents in web browsers. Nova Act was the first release from Amazon's AGI Lab in San Francisco.

Amazon says features of the new extension include natural-language script generation, a notebook-style builder for cell-by-cell execution, live debugging with a unified view of code and browser actions, and an ‘Action Viewer' to compare workflow versions side-by-side.

Nova Act is part of a broader effort by Amazon to compete with rivals including OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google in offering agentic AI tools to developers and businesses, attempting to expand beyond generative AI tools that require active user involvement.

Visual Studio Code dominates the market for code editors, with a large ecosystem of extensions and cross-platform support. Cursor is a popular AI-powered fork of VS Code with natural-language coding and smart search. Amazon's Kiro is an AI coding tool that uses agents to automatically create and update project plans and technical blueprints.

The chips powering your smart TV, voice assistant, tablet, and car all have something in common: MediaTek

MediaTek's chips power over 2 billion devices a year. From AI experiences in your smart home, vehicle, office, and beyond — processing voice commands, visual recognition, and predictive responses are faster than ever. As AI moves from the edge to the cloud, MediaTek's high-end chips make intelligent devices even smarter.

Google said Tuesday it's making a number of changes to how the Play Store looks and functions in an effort to better personalize the store to its users and increase engagement. Among the new features is a redesigned Apps tab, a new Play Games experience, a new tab focused on your interests, and other features that leverage Gemini AI.

The update builds on other recent additions that aim to make the Play Store more of a destination — like a tab that shows you where you can watch your favorite shows or Collections, which organizes your favorite apps and games into areas like shop, watch, and listen, Google Play Games VP and General Manager Aurash Mahbood explained to TechCrunch in a press briefing. 

“For over 4 billion users, Google Play is an important gateway to discovering apps, games, books, movies, TV, and timely cultural content, and our ambition is to help all users engage with the apps and content that fuel their needs and interests,” he said in a press briefing ahead of today's launch. 

Not surprisingly, the update is adding AI-powered functionality to the Play Store.

With a feature called Guided Search, users can find the app or game they want to try by typing in a goal or idea instead of the app's name. For example, a user could type in “find a home” to be pointed to real estate apps.

The Play Store's Apps tab is also being updated to include new “curated spaces” dedicated to seasonal topics and those tailored to a user's interests. These could pull in content from multiple apps, Google says. In the U.S., content related to the WNBA will be featured here, for instance.

This expansion follows the launch of curated spaces in India and Japan, which had focused on regional interests like cricket and comics, respectively. Korean users will also gain a curated space focused on video content, offering a mix of movies, TV shows, and short-form video, including drama and serialized stories. Google notes that short-form content is the most frequently consumed media format on smartphones. 

A new You tab aims to attract users to engage with the Play Store more frequently, as it will offer a centralized place for tracking subscriptions, rewards (like Play Points), recommendations, stats, and updates.

Notably, the tab will offer recommendations related to your interests, like movies or shows, podcasts, ebooks or audiobooks, and make it easier to jump back into what you were reading, listening to, or watching last. 

Gamers will also see their new gamer profile in this tab, which organizes stats and achievements across games and devices. These profiles can also now be customized with a Gen AI avatar. 

New features for gamers are also rolling out after the launch of the new Games app that shipped with Android rival Apple's iOS 26 release. 

Now, the Games tab will centralize stat and achievement tracking, rewards, and community into one place. Play Games Leagues will allow users to challenge their friends and compete for Play Points rewards. This kicks off with the first league dedicated to the popular title Subway Surfers, which will run from October 10 through October 23.

However, the more interesting update is the addition of the AI-enabled Play Games Sidekick. This is a new in-game overlay that you can access to get real-time gaming assistance from Gemini Live. 

The idea is that you can ask Gemini for help when you get stuck in a game and need guidance or tips. The feature builds on the work Google showcased with DeepMind in December, where the company showed off how it was developing AI agents across domains, including gaming.

 “Instead of having to leave the game to seek out tutorials or walkthroughs, we're leveraging the latest Gemini audio-to-audio model to help understand your gaming context, providing you quick responses and encouragement,” said Mahbood. 

The Sidekick will also curate and organize other relevant gaming info in one place, so you can stay in the game. Initially, the feature will be supported in games from EA and Netmarble, including Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, FC Mobile, and Solo Leveling: Arise.

Also new are the enhanced Game Detail Pages, which will showcase information about the title, including ongoing events, developer updates, and offers. Next month, gamers will also be able to ask questions and share answers on this page to provide or get help from other gamers. 

The Google Play Games on PC offering, which brings more than 200,000 titles to Windows desktops, is exiting beta today, too, Google said.

Robotics companies often have to deal with a simple but confounding problem: Robots produce a lot of data. Even a simple robot can easily produce up to a terabyte of data per day, since they continuously capture data from cameras and sensors.

Sydney, Australia-based Alloy thinks it can help with that issue: The startup is building data infrastructure for robotics companies to help them process and organize all the data their robots collect from various sources, including sensors and cameras.  

At its core, Alloy encodes and labels the data it collects, and allows users to search through their data using natural language to find bugs and errors. Users can also set up rules to catch and flag issues in the future, similar to how observability tools flag errors in software code.  

“The current pattern is, you look for some kind of anomaly, and then you'll replay the data,” Joe Harris, the founder and CEO of Alloy, told TechCrunch. “They then are spending hours scrubbing through this data, looking for these issues that have been flagged to them, trying to diagnose from that [while] not really having a good view as to whether this has happened before, if it's a high-severity issue or this one-off, edge case.” 

Considering how much data a single robot produces, as robotics companies look to scale, this data problem will continue to compound, Harris added.  

Harris has been fascinated by robotics since he was a kid. But when he graduated from college in 2018, there weren't many opportunities to work in the field, so he instead worked multiple roles across Australian tech companies including Atlassian and telehealth startup Eucalyptus.  

In 2024, he decided the time was right to launch a robotics company of his own. He originally thought he'd focus on building robots for the agriculture industry due to an interest in vertical farming, but when he started talking to other founders, the issue of managing the data robots produce kept coming up. He figured he might as well solve that problem first.  

“If I need to solve this problem for myself and my robotics company, I will have a great horizontal solution,” Harris said. “Perhaps that would be a more important near-term mission — to help enable other robotics companies to spend less time on data plumbing and more time on getting to that high reliability.” 

Since its launch in February 2025, Alloy has signed four Australian robotics companies as design partners and looks to push into the U.S. market this year.  

“The customers that we found have been most excited about this because they've gone through the pain of building and maintaining it themselves,” Harris said. “They'd much rather have a fantastic tool, like a Databricks just specifically built for robotics.” 

Alloy has also raised a little more than AUD $4.5 million (about $3 million USD) in a pre-seed round that was led by Blackbird Ventures, with participation from Airtree Ventures, Xtal Ventures, and Skip Capital, in addition to angel investors from robotics companies.  

The company doesn't have too many direct competitors yet. Many robotics companies are either retrofitting existing data management tools that aren't designed for the multimodal data robots produce, or are attempting to build their own internal data management tools.  

As commercial use cases for robotics continue to increase, Alloy hopes it will be able to capture a good share of the growing market.  

“It's never been a better time to build a robotics company,” Harris said. “I really want to make it possible for the next 10,000, 100,000 robotics companies that don't yet exist, that inevitably will not have to necessarily reinvent the wheel, like every company has.”

Meta has raised the stakes in Big Tech's fight against AI regulation. The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports Axios.

Meta's pro-AI PAC, called the American Technology Excellence Project, is the company's latest effort to combat policies it sees as harmful to the development of AI. Last month, Meta launched a California-focused PAC to back tech-friendly candidates in state races.

Axios reports that Meta's new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year's midterm elections. Rachel Holland, a Meta spokesperson, told the outlet that the super PAC will focus on promoting and defending U.S. tech companies and leadership, advocating for AI progress, and putting parents in charge of how their children experience online apps and AI technologies.  

The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools. Meta has come under particular scrutiny after leaked internal documents showed the company's chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” chats with kids and whistleblower reports alleged that the company may have suppressed research on child safety. 

Meta has not shared which states its super PAC would focus on, nor how many people the PAC would employ. 

The PAC comes at a time when many states are proposing AI regulations, spurred by a perceived failure of the federal government to address the issue. More than 1,000 bills were introduced in all 50 states related to AI during the 2025 legislative session. In California specifically, two bills passed and are awaiting signature or veto by Governor Gavin Newsom: SB 243, a bill that would regulate AI companion chatbots to protect minors and vulnerable users, and SB 53, a bill that would set new transparency requirements on large AI companies.  

Reached for comment, Meta VP of public policy Brian Rice said the new group would “support the election of state candidates across the country who embrace AI development, champion the U.S. technology industry, and defend American tech leadership at home and abroad.”

Silicon Valley has picked up the pace this year to try to curb states' abilities to pass AI legislation, arguing that such a “patchwork” would be difficult for powerful AI companies to navigate and slow down innovation at a time when the U.S. is racing to beat China in AI development. 

Last month, Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman launched a Silicon Valley super PAC with $100 million dedicated to advocating against AI regulation. Earlier this year, a proposal that would bar states from regulating AI at all for 10 years almost made it into the federal budget, but was ultimately struck down.

For Julien Emery, the problem has always been personal. 

He's the CEO and co-founder of Superpanel, a platform that helps law firms seamlessly onboard new clients. 

He listed emotional encounters with the law: As a Canadian, he found access to legal help hard and expensive; he also recalls his mother in a car accident, and how the legal payout helped keep his family afloat for years. He found the legal intake — the process of a firm evaluating a new client or request — tedious. 

“For consumers, it's a maze of forms, phone calls, and dropped leads that cause most people to give up before getting help,” he told TechCrunch. “For firms, it's a costly, error-prone bottleneck.” 

Before the recent advancements in artificial intelligence, he said that the intake process was regarded as too complex for automation. But that's changed. Emery worked at Hootsuite, then founded the health insurance underwriting platform Allay (which exited to Novo Benefits), before teaming up with his friend Dingyu Zhang, who had a background in AI, to launch Superpanel in 2024. 

Superpanel automates half the work of legal intake, Emery said, managing collection and feedback. It provides plaintiff law firms with a “digital teammate” that helps with escalation and compliance. “It engages clients across phone, texting, email, and forums, guiding them through their story and sharing documents,” he continued. For firms, it helps sort case type, jurisdiction, and documentation.

“When there's risk of ambiguity, the system escalates to a human team member,” he said. “The result is a unified, multi-channel workflow that delivers measurable results and gives firms a system they can trust like a real employee.” 

The company announced Tuesday a seed $5.3 million raise in a round co-led by Outlander VC and Field Ventures. Emery said he met some investors in this round through his last startup, and those early investors introduced him to the ones who led the round for this new one. Others in this round include LOI Venture (co-founded by the founder of Hootsuite), Zenda Capital, 8-Bit Capital, and Behind Genius Ventures. 

“We'll use the funding to accelerate hiring and expand Superpanel's capabilities for plaintiff law firms,” he said. 

Legal is one of the top industries seeing transformation as artificial intelligence continues to innovate. So Superpanel certainly isn't alone in this space, and its competitors include Clio Grow, LegalClerk.ai, MyCase, and Whippy.ai. 

But Emery is hoping Superpanel will stand out from the pack. “Consumers now expect answers and solutions to be instant and self-serve, shaped by AI tools and the online experiences they use every day,” Emery said. “Superpanel guides them continuously across that journey.”

Sila, the battery materials startup, started operations Tuesday at its facility in Moses Lake, Washington, a milestone that could pave the way for longer range, faster charging EVs. The factory, which will initially be capable of making enough battery materials for 20,000 to 50,000 EVs, is the first large-scale silicon anode factory in the West, and future expansion could fulfill demand for as many as 2.5 million vehicles.

Silicon anodes promise to improve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries by as much as 50%. The technology, which Sila has been working on for the past 14 years, could be the best chance for the U.S. to gain the upper hand in a global race for battery supremacy, Sila co-founder and CEO Gene Berdichevsky argues.

“When you invent something new, it's a lot easier to then produce it where you invent it,” he told TechCrunch.

Sila currently has agreements to supply anode material to Panasonic and Mercedes. Though automakers and their suppliers will be the factory's main focus, Berdichevsky said his company has also been selling to drone manufacturers, satellite companies, and consumer electronics companies.

The startup isn't the only company working on silicon anode materials. Group14, which also has operations in Moses Lake, currently produces its proprietary mix at a factory it developed with SK Innovation in South Korea. Amprius, a company based in Fremont, California, is currently producing megawatt-hours worth of its material in the U.S. and gigawatt-hours worth with partners in China.

But Sila's Moses Lake factory, which has been under construction for nearly two years, “is really the first auto scale silicon anode plant in the U.S.,” Berdichevsky said. The company raised $375 million last year to help finance the project.

In Washington State, Sila found a near perfect confluence of factors that allowed it to build the facility, including cheap hydropower, abundant land, and a nearby supplier of an important raw ingredient.

“The cost structure of this technology is predicated on low cost energy — one of the big inputs — and then some key precursors, and we have that in Washington,” he said.

The first runs of material at the Moses Lake factory will be used to show customers the material is consistent with the stuff they've been sampling for the past few years, which was made at an R&D line in Alameda, California. 

“We have a lot of confidence in that, but obviously the proof's in the pudding,” Berdichevsky said.

In a few years, he said batteries made using Sila's material should be cheaper than those made with graphite anode material sourced from Western suppliers. (Chinese companies make graphite anodes for less, but they also receive generous state subsidies and have fewer environmental regulations, Berdichevsky said.)

Silicon anodes could also allow automakers to reduce the amount of other pricey materials used in their batteries, including nickel, while maintaining the same level of performance. “Now you have that same performance, plus you get fast charge, plus you get domestic supply, and you get at a lower cost,” he said.

If demand proves strong, Sila has plans to expand beyond Moses Lake. 

“There's not a CEO of a Western automaker that doesn't believe that within a decade, or maybe 15 years at the limit, they're going to be selling almost all electric vehicles.” Berdichevsky said.“If you play it out 10 years from now, you probably have 10 million EVs in the U.S., so we're going to need multiple sites.”

Eventually, the company will look to expand into Europe and Asia, too, but Berdichevsky, who was born in Ukraine, is adamant in his commitment to the United States.

“As a country, if you don't make stuff, where's your pride going to come from?” he said. “I think it's just so important for us as a country to continue to learn to do this and create the ecosystem so that we can never fall behind again.”

Gluster was OK. We never pushed it very hard but it mostly just worked. Performance wasn't great but we encouraged users to use scratch space that was local to the node where their job was running anyway.

TernFS – An exabyte scale, multi-region distributed filesystem, 247 points, 4 days ago, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45290245

reply

Some notable constraints: files are immutable, write-once update never. Designed for files at least 2MB in size. Slow at directory creation/deletion. No permissions/access control.

reply

These limits aren't quite as strict as they first seem.Our median file size is 2MB, which means 50% of our files are <2MB. Realistically if you've got an exabyte of data with an average file size of a few kilobytes then this is the wrong tool for the job (you need something more like a database), but otherwise it should be just fine. We actually have a nice little optimisation where very small files are stored inline in the metadata.It works out of the box with ""normal"" tools like rsync, python, etc despite the immutability. The reality is that most things don't actually modify files, even text editors tend to save a new version and rename over the top. We had to update relatively little of our massive code base when switching over to this. For us that was a big win, moving to an S3-like interface would have required updating a lot of code.Directory creation/deletion is ""slow"", currenly limited to about 10,000 operations per second. We don't current need to create more than 10,000 directories per second so we just haven't prioritised improving that. There is an issue open, #28, which would get this up to 100,000 per second. This is the sort of thing that, like access control, I would love to have had in an initial open source release, but we prioritised open sourcing what we have over getting it perfect.

it is essentially copy-on-write exposed to the user level. the only issue is that this breaks hard links, so tools that rely on that are going to break. but yes, custom code should be easy to adapt.

It did its job at the very beginning, but you don't build up hundreds of petabytes of data on an NFS server.We did try various solutions in between NFS and developing TernFS, both open source and properietary. However we didn't name these specifically in the blog post because there's little point in bad mouthing what didn't work out for us.

Historically NFS has had many flaws on different O/S-es. Many of these issues appear to have been resolved over time and I have not seen it being referred to as ""Nightmare File System"" for decades.However, depending on many factors NFS may still be a bad choice. In our setup, for example, using a large SQLite database through NFS turns out to be up to 10 times as slow as using a ""real"" disk.The SQLite FAQs warn about bigger problems than slowness:

For local filesystems, the average PC user shouldn't really care though. Just use whatever your installer defaults. But this story is about a distributed filesystem.I don't have great hopes for one capable of such massive scale being good and usable (low overhead, low complexity, low adminst cost) in very small configurations, but we can always hope.

Just ""seems""!? Name me a recent US president or candidate that wasn't very pro-Israel. JFK is the only one I know and he  got a bullet in his head.Then you have the fact that about 80% of congress are AIPAC members. That alone tells you everything.Then at the debates for NY mayor elections, all candidates were asked insistently if they support Israel and if they'll visit the Holy City as if it were a requirement, which is a very weird purity test for a job that has nothing to do with that.So I don't  know how Americans can look at these facts and still deny that Israel is not running their country or at least having controlling influence over their political system.

Some companies are working to remedy the issue.

Some AI chatbots rely on flawed research from retracted scientific papers to answer questions, according to recent studies. The findings, confirmed by MIT Technology Review, raise questions about how reliable AI tools are at evaluating scientific research and could complicate efforts by countries and industries seeking to invest in AI tools for scientists.

AI search tools and chatbots are already known to fabricate links and references. But answers based on the material from actual papers can mislead as well if those papers have been retracted.  The chatbot is “using a real paper, real material, to tell you something,” says Weikuan Gu, a medical researcher at the University of Tennessee in Memphis and an author of one of the recent studies. But, he says, if people only look at the content of the answer and do not click through to the paper and see that it's been retracted, that's really a problem. 

Gu and his team asked OpenAI's ChatGPT, running on the GPT-4o model, questions based on information from 21 retracted papers on medical imaging. The chatbot's answers referenced retracted papers in five cases but advised caution in only three. While it cited non-retracted papers for other questions, the authors note it may not have recognized the retraction status of the articles. In a study from August, a different group of researchers used ChatGPT-4o mini to evaluate the quality of 217 retracted and low-quality papers from different scientific fields; they found that none of the chatbot's responses mentioned retractions or other concerns. (No similar studies have been released on GPT-5, which came out this August.)

The public uses AI chatbots to ask for medical advice and diagnose health conditions. Students and scientists increasingly use science-focused AI tools to review existing scientific literature and summarize papers. That kind of usage is likely to increase. The US National Science Foundation, for instance, invested $75 million in building AI models for science research this August.

The risks posed when kids form bonds with chatbots have turned AI safety from an abstract worry into a political flashpoint. What happens now?

“If [a tool is] facing the general public, then using retraction as a kind of quality indicator is very important,” says Yuanxi Fu, an information science researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. There's “kind of an agreement that retracted papers have been struck off the record of science,” she says, “and the people who are outside of science—they should be warned that these are retracted papers.” OpenAI did not provide a response to a request for comment about the paper results.

The problem is not limited to ChatGPT. In June, MIT Technology Review tested AI tools specifically advertised for research work, such as Elicit, Ai2 ScholarQA (now part of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence's Asta tool), Perplexity, and Consensus, using questions based on the 21 retracted papers in Gu's study. Elicit referenced five of the retracted papers in its answers, while Ai2 ScholarQA referenced 17, Perplexity 11, and Consensus 18—all without noting the retractions.

Some companies have since made moves to correct the issue. “Until recently, we didn't have great retraction data in our search engine,” says Christian Salem, cofounder of Consensus. His company has now started using retraction data from a combination of sources, including publishers and data aggregators, independent web crawling, and Retraction Watch, which manually curates and maintains a database of retractions. In a test of the same papers in August, Consensus cited only five retracted papers. 

Elicit told MIT Technology Review that it removes retracted papers flagged by the scholarly research catalogue OpenAlex from its database and is “still working on aggregating sources of retractions.” Ai2 told us that its tool does not automatically detect or remove retracted papers currently. Perplexity said that it “[does] not ever claim to be 100% accurate.” 

However, relying on retraction databases may not be enough. Ivan Oransky, the cofounder of Retraction Watch, is careful not to describe it as a comprehensive database, saying that creating one would require more resources than anyone has: “The reason it's resource intensive is because someone has to do it all by hand if you want it to be accurate.”

Further complicating the matter is that publishers don't share a uniform approach to retraction notices. “Where things are retracted, they can be marked as such in very different ways,” says Caitlin Bakker from University of Regina, Canada, an expert in research and discovery tools. “Correction,” “expression of concern,” “erratum,” and “retracted” are among some labels publishers may add to research papers—and these labels can be added for many reasons, including concerns about the content, methodology, and data or the presence of conflicts of interest. 

Some researchers distribute their papers on preprint servers, paper repositories, and other websites, causing copies to be scattered around the web. Moreover, the data used to train AI models may not be up to date. If a paper is retracted after the model's training cutoff date, its responses might not instantaneously reflect what's going on, says Fu. Most academic search engines don't do a real-time check against retraction data, so you are at the mercy of how accurate their corpus is, says Aaron Tay, a librarian at Singapore Management University.

Oransky and other experts advocate making more context available for models to use when creating a response. This could mean publishing information that already exists, like peer reviews commissioned by journals and critiques from the review site PubPeer, alongside the published paper.  

Many publishers, such as Nature and the BMJ, publish retraction notices as separate articles linked to the paper, outside paywalls. Fu says companies need to effectively make use of such information, as well as any news articles in a model's training data that mention a paper's retraction. 

The users and creators of AI tools need to do their due diligence. “We are at the very, very early stages, and essentially you have to be skeptical,” says Tay.

During a recent interview with Fangoria, Zach Cregger confirmed the rumors of a Weapons spinoff starring Aunt Gladys are “not bullshit.”

I was ready. I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out. It's real and I've been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There's a story and I'm pretty excited about it. It's not bullshit.

In other news, Tyler Posey confirmed Paramount shortly “abandoned ship” after the release of the first Teen Wolf movie in a new interview with People, but still has hopes that more will be made.

We did a film for Paramount a few years ago now, and originally it was a three-picture deal, and then it sort of abandoned ship after the first movie. But everybody wants more.

So I wrote the second film. I'm trying to get that one made, and then I have an idea for the third. Or we're just going to do a TV series, but there will be more, and I'm going to spearhead it. I want it really bad.

Tim Heidecker also revealed he and Eric Wareheim are writing a horror movie in a recent interview with Variety.

We're actually writing a horror movie that is going to be much sicker than most people are going to want to watch.

IGN has a new poster for Return to Silent Hill.

Elsewhere, a Babylonian archeologist accidentally opens a gateway to hell (it's okay, he has tenure) in the trailer for Foe.

 

In further DCU news, James Gunn stated the season finale of Peacemaker “is as important to Man of Tomorrow as anything” during his recent appearance on House of R.

I wanna make sure that people can pick up and watch something without having to see something before it… So, that said, episode 8 is as important to Man of Tomorrow as anything.

Lastly, Mike Colter would neither confirm nor deny whether Disney+ has plans for a third season of Luke Cage during his recent appearance at the Edmonton Expo (via CBR). 

I don't know why people keep asking me this. There's no signs. It's not like they've just recently revived one of the Marvel Netflix shows.

Earth's climate and its water are inextricably linked—one cannot exist without the other. As the climate undergoes unprecedented, human-driven change, the global water system is changing too.

While this link is well-established, it's difficult to predict exactly when and where extreme water shortages will occur as a result of climate change. This uncertainty inhibits decision makers' ability to prepare for these catastrophic scenarios. A new study published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications aims to fill that knowledge gap by estimating the timing and likelihood of extreme water scarcity events—also known as “day zero drought” events—around the world.

“Day zero basically would be the time when the region or the city runs out of water,” co-author Christian Franzke, a professor at the IBS Center for Climate Physics in Busan, South Korea, told Gizmodo.

Day Zero Drought events result from compounded stressors on a local or regional water system, such as prolonged rainfall shortages, reduced river flow, and rising water demand. Franzke and his co-author Vecchia P. Ravinandrasana, a PhD student at the IBS Center, projected global water scarcity outcomes by applying a probabilistic framework to a large set of climate model simulations that take all these stressors into account.

Their findings suggest that by the end of the century, 74% of the world's drought-prone regions—including those with major reservoirs—will face a high risk of severe and persistent droughts under a high emissions scenario. Nearly 35% of these regions may experience severe water scarcity by 2030.

That means 753 million people, 467 million of whom live in urban areas, could be vulnerable to extreme water scarcity under 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) of warming above pre-industrial levels. What's more, the amount of time between individual day zero drought events may be shorter than the events themselves, limiting recovery time and exacerbating water scarcity risks.

The findings indicate that water stress could become particularly severe in the western U.S., the Mediterranean, northern Africa, southern Africa, India, northern China, and southern Australia as demand rapidly outpaces supply.

Franzke emphasizes that these are projections, not predictions. Modeling can only tell us so much about future climatic changes and their consequences. Still, “We were surprised by how soon this may actually start to occur,” he said.

The study provides a timely, comprehensive estimate of future water scarcity risk, Auroop Ganguly, a distinguished professor of civil and environmental engineering at Northeastern University who was not involved in the research, told Gizmodo.

“The challenge of water [scarcity] is globally felt, but what needs to be done is often local, or at least regional,” he said. The timing of day zero drought events and the available recovery time between them vary widely by region. By capturing these differences, the researchers provide theoretical timescales that can help guide both short-term emergency responses and long-term policy planning.

There is more work to be done, however. In future analyses, Franzke would like to incorporate data from more climate models to further reduce uncertainty, he said, highlighting the fact that his dataset did not directly account for the role of groundwater as a buffer against drought.

Ganguly also emphasized the need for a more robust dataset. As such, he cautioned against seeing this paper as “the final word” on water scarcity risk in a changing climate but rather as a guidepost for understanding the urgency of preparing for that risk.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Chicago's Once-Disgusting River Just Hosted a Swimming Party","https://gizmodo.com/chicagos-once-disgusting-river-just-hosted-a-swimming-party-2000662425","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 13:45:51 GMT","

On Sunday, over 250 swimmers dove into the Chicago River for its first open water swim in almost a century.

The Chicago River Swim's triumphant return this past weekend celebrated the city's environmental progress and raised $150,000 for ALS research at Northwestern's Ozdinler Lab and swim-safety education programs at the Salvation Army Kroc Center, according to a recent Chicago River Swim statement.

“Swimming in the Chicago River may sound like a wild idea, but the river has come a long way from its industrial past,” claimed the Chicago River Swim website.

Yeah, right, you're probably thinking. That's what they said about Paris' Seine River during the 2024 Olympics, and yet a number of athletes got sick after swimming in it.

In the last decades, however, Chicago has made significant strides in cleaning up its once fetid river, including stricter environmental regulations to reduce industrial pollution, improved sewage and wastewater treatment, and real-time water quality monitoring, according to an earlier Chicago River Swim statement. These actions have facilitated the return of a number of wildlife species—and now, human swimmers.

“The Chicago River Swim is a symbol of Chicago's resilience and progress. Once too polluted for recreation, the river has been restored as one of our city's greatest assets. Today shows how far we've come in reclaiming our environment for future generations,” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in his opening remarks.

The event was a long time coming. The Chicago River Swim was originally planned for 2024, but the city denied the organization's permit request, citing safety concerns for the proposed route, and the swim ultimately took place in Lake Michigan. This year, 263 swimmers raced on either a one- or two-mile course (1.6 or 3.2 kilometers) to the sound of spectators' cheers from the city's Riverwalk.

The University of Illinois Chicago led the water testing efforts along the swim route. According to the Chicago River Swim website, the river is the cleanest in its recorded history.

“Yes, the river has a reputation of being a literal cesspool, from years of industrial waste and sewage dumped into it,” Khoa Dao, a volunteer on the river swim's safety team, wrote in a social media post. “But much like the reputation of the city itself to outsiders, the dangers of the river are a bit exaggerated. Much effort has been made in recent decades to clean the river through various means, so much so that today's swim race was finally possible.”

In that spirit, a viewer brandished a poster on Sunday that read, “DON'T WORRY. DAVE MATTHEWS ISN'T HERE,” according to Inside Climate News. The poster references an infamous incident from over two decades ago, when a Dave Matthews Band tour bus dumped hundreds of pounds of human waste into the Chicago River—and onto a tour boat. Luckily, no such incident took place this weekend.

Step aside, Poor Things, and take Joker: Folie à Deux with you when you go: the first teaser trailer for Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Bride! is here. Anyone who was wondering whether the world has enough bandwidth for two Frankenstein movies in the span of a few months can breathe easy; The Bride! looks like it has an entirely different, far more chaotic energy than what Guillermo del Toro‘s got cooking.

The Bride! has been touted as a musical, but there's just a small hint of that in this teaser. Instead, it leans heavily into what looks to be a wild romance between Frankenstein's monster (Christian Bale) and his newly revived bride (Jessie Buckley):

It's billed as a “bold, iconoclastic take on one of the world's most compelling stories,” and here's the official description:

“A lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travels to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman and the Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!”

The rest of the cast includes Peter Sarsgaard, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Penélope Cruz; Maggie Gyllenhaal directs and also wrote the screenplay. The Bride! arrives March 6, 2026.

Springer Nature's Journal of Ethology has just published a study on a threesome. Yes, that kind of threesome—and it's being hailed as a win for marine conservation efforts.

That's because the lovers in this particular trio are leopard sharks. Hugo Lassauce, a marine biologist from the University of the Sunshine Coast, filmed two males and one female of the endangered species mating in the wild in a first-of-its-kind video, shedding light on their natural reproductive behaviors.

“The Indo-Pacific Leopard shark (Stegostoma tigrinum), listed as endangered by the IUCN, has primarily been studied in captivity, with little information on its natural mating behaviors,” the researchers wrote in the study. “Here, we present the first documented observations of group copulation in free-living S. tigrinum, recorded at Abore Reef, New Caledonia.”

Leopard sharks, sometimes referred to as zebra sharks, live in coastal waters throughout the Indo-West Pacific region. As soon as Lassauce captured the video and swam back to his team's boat, they all cheered. It's difficult to witness sharks copulating in the wild in the first place, so you can only imagine how rare it is to spot endangered shark species mating and get the chance to film it.

“While I was surveying this particular aggregation of leopard sharks, I spotted a female with two males grasping her pectoral fins on the sand below me,” Lassauce said in a university statement. “I told my colleague to take the boat away to avoid disturbance and I started waiting on the surface, looking down at the sharks almost motionless on the sea floor. I waited an hour, freezing in the water, but finally they started swimming up.”

The male sharks then each mated with the female, one taking 63 seconds, the other 47. Talk about a quickie. The female then “swam away actively,” and the males, now lethargic, lay still on the seafloor. Besides the excitement of catching something rare on camera, the video carries significant implications for our understanding of the endangered species.

“These findings provide novel insights into the species' reproductive strategies and highlight the importance of identifying and protecting key mating habitats,” Lassauce and his colleagues wrote in the study. “Given the conservation concerns surrounding S. tigrinum, understanding these mating mechanisms and recognizing reproductive sites are crucial for effective species management.”

Christine Dudgeon, a co-author of the study and a marine ecologist also from the University of the Sunshine Coast, explained in the statement that the video could also support artificial insemination research working to rewild leopard sharks.

“It's surprising and fascinating that two males were involved sequentially on this occasion,” she added.

It would seem like leopard shark males are more willing to share their lovers than other species.

Thanks to the performance we see with the Sandisk WD Blue SN5100, the market now has not just one great QLC SSD, but two great QLC SSDs. This turn of events was unfathomable a generation of drives ago, but the components are now mature enough to offer great value for everyday users and storage enthusiasts alike. We were first impressed by Crucial's P310, but the Blue SN5100 has quietly come along to redefine what a QLC drive can do.

Sandisk has followed up on the excellent Black SN7100 and SN8100 with another compelling mid-range Blue drive, bumping performance up from the SN5000. The Blue drives have always been a popular and inexpensive option, but in some cases, the different models felt overlapping, even with some of the lower-end Black drives, such as the SN770. It's almost too much of a good thing. Now, with the SN5100 coming in hot with QLC flash, which the previous SN5000 only used at 4TB, we have a drive designed for everyone.

All of WD's and Sandisk's many Blue NVMe SSDs have been good budget performers to the point that it sometimes gets confusing to discern one from another; the controllers and flash used are scalable in that way. The Blue SN5100 carries on with this tradition, but it's also marking the full transition from TLC to QLC flash. This might horrify some people, but the fact is, this drive performs well for 99% of typical users. You'd have difficulty in a blind taste test between this and the TLC-equipped Black SN7100, and if Sandisk can get the price down to an appropriate level, that's a very attractive reality.

We still prefer the Blue SN5100 as a secondary or game-focused drive, or perhaps as a budget laptop upgrade drive, but we think it's to the point that this drive could work anywhere. It feels like it could replace low-end TLC options without issue. There's something about this drive that puts it ahead of the pack in comparison to some of the older QLC drives, mostly due to the flash. It's power-efficient and has excellent latency, which makes it feel like a high-end drive a lot of the time. It's a shame that QLC flash isn't holding its discount due to enterprise demand because this drive at an optimal price level would be nearly unbeatable. It's still a drive worth keeping an eye on.

The Sandisk WD Blue SN5100 is available in 500GB, 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB capacities. QLC flash can be tricky at lower capacities like 500GB, as there are fewer dies with which to interleave. Performance on this drive is best at 1TB and 2TB, but there will be much interest in the 4TB. The drive can hit up to 7,100 / 6,700 MB/s for sequential reads and writes and up to 1,000K / 1,300K random read and write IOPS.

Pricing at the time of the review was a problem, though, at $54.99, $79.98, and $142.99 for the smaller SKUs. The Sandisk WD Black SN7100 is, in fact, less expensive and, with TLC flash, is the better drive. In fact, that model is an excellent value all around. We suspect the Blue SN5100 will be adjusted below that pricing – that's the only way the Blue and Black monikers make sense relative to one another — which would make it potentially a fantastic budget SSD.

Sandisk backs the drive with a standard five-year warranty, but the write endurance (TBW) is half the normal, at 300TB of write data per TB os drive capacity. This is not unexpected, as base QLC flash tends to be rated for about half the program/erase cycles as the comparable TLC. This does not reflect actual NAND flash endurance, but rather the TBW is chosen for warranty purposes. This drive isn't supposed to be beaten up with tons of writes, and enterprise-like workloads can and will wear the flash worse than normal consumer usage. We don't think this write limit holds back the drive for its intended purpose in any way.

Sandisk has two downloads for its SSDs: the SanDisk Dashboard and Acronis True Image. The former is an SSD Toolbox application previously known as the WD Dashboard – if you see that in our past reviews, know that the new dashboard covers both WD and Sandisk SSDs. This dashboard is roughly on par with Samsung's Magician and is useful for a range of things. Aside from letting you update the drive's firmware, it also allows you to check and monitor drive health and engage features such as TRIM and secure erase. This application is only for Windows, but True Image also works on macOS. True Image is designed for backups and imaging to protect your data when switching drives, which is always a useful feature.

The Blue SN5100 is single-sided with a single NAND flash chip, power management circuitry, and a DRAM-less controller. This drive would work in a shorter form factor. The drive does have a QR code PSID, but it is otherwise uninteresting.

A 4TB SKU is on the way and is also single-sided. With current technology, such a drive would have two NAND flash packages with the standard 1Tb dies, but could theoretically get away with just one with 2Tb dies. There is a performance dip for the 4TB models, according to the datasheet, which would be either from extra memory addressing overhead with the latter solution or an abundance of dies in the former. WD could also choose to use 2Tb dies with two NAND flash packages to take advantage of better yields. One reason to stick with a single package is if there is intent for shorter form factors in an OEM counterpart, particularly as such drives tend to be single-sided.

The Sandisk WD Black SN7100 and Sandisk WD Black SN8100 use the TLC version of this flash and show no performance loss at their maximum capacities at the time of our reviews, but we know the controllers are able to handle that many 1Tb dies without an issue. The Black SN7100 has been updated with a 4TB SKU post-review, which does exhibit a similar performance drop as the SN5100, and in that case, it's due to the use of so many 1Tb dies. To condense this into something understandable: you are going to see some level of performance loss at the highest capacity of these drives. That may impact the upcoming 8TB Black SN8100 as well, unless Sandisk has a trick up its sleeve. This was avoided with the 8TB WD Black SN850X, which utilized newer, denser flash, a strategy later adopted by Samsung with the 4TB 990 Pro.

The A101-000103-A1 is a proprietary controller from Sandisk that is also used on the WD Blue SN5000. This is a simple four-channel DRAM-less controller made to optimally run with 16 dies at 2400 MT/s, which translates to 2TB at 7+ GB/s. BiCS8 is rated for up to 3,600 MT/s, but this is not needed for PCIe 4.0. For PCIe 5.0, this flash with a similar controller, like the Phison E31T, can hit up to at least 10 GB/s. There are advantages other than bandwidth for running at a higher I/O speed, such as slightly better latency. However, running at a lower clock is more power-efficient. The Black SN7100 demonstrates this well by having the best power efficiency we've seen to date.

The Blue SN5100 differs from the Black SN7100 by its use of QLC rather than TLC flash. In practice, this isn't as big a deal as it sounds. In pSLC mode, the flash will perform similarly, and QLC often has optimizations for reads, which might come from native flash. You might never notice a difference between the two. QLC flash does have lower endurance with approximately half the rated amount, depending on the flash and quality, but this is still an immense amount of writes that 99% of users won't ever hit. Nevertheless, performance concerns do remain for the worst-case, which cannot be denied. We cover this in our write saturation test.

QLC flash should be more affordable as a trade-off, but this often has not been the case. One reason is that enterprise demand for QLC flash is higher than ever to handle large data with far better response times than a mechanical HDD provides. This has gotten worse with the AI and LLM booms, especially considering that the YMTC flash, which could alleviate this shortfall to some degree, has been politically problematic for the U.S.

Most inexpensive 4TB drives with QLC use YMTC flash, in fact, while Micron is holding back its QLC for enterprise and its own drives. That would include the Crucial P310 and the OEM Micron 2600. Historically, BiCS has not made a big splash with QLC flash and has been mostly only available in TLC. This completely changes with the Blue SN5100 as a follow-up to the Blue SN5000.

Seemingly unshackled from Microsoft, OpenAI's major drive towards a high-value IPO begins.

Following its joint announcements of major UK investments last week, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has kicked off this one with a slew of new deals to enhance its own capabilities and increase its valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The company struck a deal for Nvidia hardware worth upwards of $100 billion, a deal with Chinese firm Luxsure to begin building consumer AI devices, and there are several negotiations said to be ongoing with other Chinese Apple suppliers, according to CNBC.

The story of OpenAI in 2025 has been one of aggressive expansion and incredibly optimistic projections about where the industry is headed and the significant role OpenAI is expected to play in it. Despite the company being structured as a non-profit and its yearly revenue projections topping out at just under $13 billion (following a $5 billion loss in 2024), it has announced investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure. These include the US-based Stargate scheme and the Stargate UK project, amongst other international investments.

For these kinds of investments to be possible, OpenAI needs to restructure as a for-profit company, which it can now do after the recent progress in its Microsoft negotiations. It also needs the cash generated from a potential IPO, with some estimates already valuing the company at over $500 billion, despite its lack of any kind of actual profitability.

In reality, the bulk of that valuation comes from the confidence of other major tech companies. Microsoft is already one of the largest OpenAI investors, but now Nvidia is investing up to $100 billion in OpenAI too. Though that may well be a form of circuitous, parasitic relationship where Nvidia invests money in OpenAI, so it can, in turn, purchase Nvidia hardware for its various data center projects.

Crucially, however, this deal also marks OpenAI as one of the first customers for Nvidia's next-generation hardware. This deal will see Nvidia invest an initial $10 billion once the deal is agreed upon, with the first Nvidia hardware set to be delivered in late 2026. These chips will be Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, likely offering significant performance and efficiency advantages over existing Blackwell GPUs.

More Nvidia investment will be forthcoming as further gigawatts of computing power are set up, with the final project said to equate to around 10 gigawatts of AI compute power. The electricity use alone would be enough to power over 8 million homes.

 




This deal further raises the spectre of the AI industry somewhat funding itself while driving up the valuations of each of the involved companies. No matter how you look at it, it hints at a bubble, which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman accepts is very real.

""On the one hand [this deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, via Reuters. ""On the other hand, the 'circular' concerns have been raised in the past, and this will fuel them further.""

Nvidia, Microsoft, Intel, OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and a range of other multi-billion and trillion-dollar companies have all announced major investments in each other's companies and services over the coming years. Although there are very real services these companies can offer each other, the kind of AI projects they all want to launch will require incredible infrastructure development, which will require Herculean levels of investment. This raises concerns about whether the funds will be available when the time comes to actually pay up.

There is the very real potential of the AI industry becoming an unsustainable bubble. When those have burst in the past, they tend to take entire companies with them. If anything like that happens before OpenAI (and others) can realize their goals, they could be left with enormous promises and balance sheets that are deep in the red.

Alongside its drive towards IPO cash generation, OpenAI is also looking to diversify as it searches for a viable profit model for its soon-to-be for-profit company. One of those could be hardware development. It hired the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses project in November last year to head its consumer devices and robotics divisions. It's also alleged to be in talks with Goertek, a Chinese company that builds Apple's AirPods and other smart devices.

In a more tangible endeavour, it's now struck a deal with fellow Chinese Apple supplier, Luxshare, to build a smart-speaker-like device to use with ChatGPT. Similar to the smart speakers made by Apple, Amazon, and Google for their Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant smart assistants, OpenAI sees ChatGPT as a direct competitor for these kinds of tools and seems set to build out smart devices that can leverage the technology in a more physical sense.

According to The Information, Luxshare is already working on prototypes with a plan to launch a viable gadget in late 2026 or early 2027.

OpenAI previously partnered with Apple product-design icon, Jony Ive, lending further credence to the idea of OpenAI pivoting towards hardware as a potential avenue towards increasing both its profitability and physical presence in people's everyday lives.

Many gamers were disappointed by this move.

Several gamers have had their Lenovo Legion Go 2 pre-orders canceled by the company after it said that it could not ship its latest handheld console on time. Many had been asking about the delay on the handheld, and the company answered the issue on its AMA Reddit post, saying, “The truth is pre-orders for the Legion Go Gen 2 has substantially exceeded our projections, leading to unforeseen delivery range extensions.” It also added, “That said, we will need to cancel some pre-orders placed directly on Lenovo.com. We don't believe in holding onto customer payments for products we can't ship in a timely manner.”

This disappointing news has hit several gamers, who won't be getting their handheld at all, at least for the foreseeable future. Despite that, a few users will still receive their consoles, but at a much later date. According to TechPowerUp, there are reports that device shipments have been moved from the original early-October shipping date, as promised on the pre-order form, to early to mid-November. The company did offer a 10% discount coupon to affected users, but they can only use it for their “next Lenovo purchase.”

The Lenovo Legion Go 2 is the company's follow-up to its original gaming handheld and is powered by a Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip replete with an OLED screen. It's a direct competitor to the upcoming Asus ROG Ally 2, which doesn't have a release date yet, although Asus is expected to deliver the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X on October 16. MSI also has its own AMD Z2 Extreme-powered handheld in the Claw 8, which has outperformed the Intel chip in the previous iteration of its handheld and is scheduled to arrive in the coming weeks.

All this pre-order brouhaha is bringing back memories of electronics shortages, particularly with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and the various problems consumers faced when buying the latest GPUs. Thankfully, Nintendo seemed to have solved the problem with the launch of the Switch 2, which beat the Switch 1's opening month by a million units in just four days. Lenovo said that it's working to deliver consoles to retailers and customers, so availability should improve in the coming weeks. Hopefully, this will materialize so that we can avoid scalpers taking advantage of the situation and selling the gaming handheld at ridiculous markups.

According to the International Diabetes Federation, about 11% of the world's population lives with diabetes, with 90% having type 2 diabetes. 

Researchers estimate that as much as 40% of all people with diabetes also have diabetic retinopathy — a potentially blinding eye condition caused by blood vessel damage in the eye's retina. 

There is currently no cure for diabetic retinopathy. The condition is often managed through injections of anti-VEGF medications into the eye, surgery, and blood sugar monitoring and control. 

Past studies also show that anti-VEGF injections may help prevent diabetic retinopathy and its complications, as well as healthy lifestyle factors like managing blood pressure, lowering cholesterol levels, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and not smoking. 

Now, a new study recently published in the journal Pharmaceutics has found that semaglutide — the active ingredient found in GLP-1 medications like Ozempic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss — may help protect the eyes from diabetic retinopathy. 

For this lab-based study, researchers used samples of human retinal endothelial cells that were treated with different concentrations of semaglutide. The cells were then placed in a solution with both a high glucose level and high level of oxidative stress — where there is an imbalance of antioxidants and free radicals — for 24 hours. 

Past studies show that oxidative stress plays a role in the formation of diabetic retinopathy. 

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that the retinal cells treated with semaglutide were twice as likely to survive than cells that were untreated. Additionally, the treated cells were found to have larger stores of energy. 

Scientists also found that three markers of diabetic retinopathy were decreased in the semaglutide-treated retinal cells. First, the levels of apoptosis — a form of cell death — decreased from about 50% in untreated cells to about 10% in semaglutide-treated cells. The production of the free radical mitochondrial superoxide decreased from about 90% to about 10% in the treated retinal cells. 

Researchers also found the amount of advanced glycation end-products — harmful compounds that can collect in people with diabetes and are known to cause oxidative stress — also decreased substantially. 

Lastly, scientists reported that the genes involved in the production of antioxidants were more active in the semaglutide-treated cells when compared to untreated cells. Researchers believe this is a sign that semaglutide may help repair damage to the retinal cells.

“Our study did not find that these drugs harmed the retinal cells in any way — instead, it suggests that GLP1-receptor agonists protect against diabetic retinopathy, particularly in the early stages,” Ioanna Anastasiou, PhD, molecular biologist and postdoctoral researcher at the National and Kapodistrian University in Greece, and lead author of this study, said in a press release.

“Excitingly, these drugs may be able to repair damage that has already been done and so improve sight. Clinical trials are now needed to confirm these protective effects in patients and explore whether GLP-1 receptor agonists can slow, or even halt, the progression of this vision-robbing condition.”— Ioanna Anastasiou, PhD

Medical News Today spoke with Benjamin Bert, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist at MemorialCare Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, about this study. 

“We've known with any of these medications that are able to reduce the blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, have been shown to be beneficial long-term for the health of the microvasculature that exists in the eye,” Bert said. 

“What was unique about this study is that it was showing that maybe with the semaglutide-type medications that it may help to protect from oxidative stress. And so this could potentially be a different mechanism that it's able to protect the eye with, so that's a fascinating hypothesis and finding of this particular study.” — Benjamin Bert, MD

If semaglutide can help protect against oxidative stress, Bert said it may even be able to help with other eye conditions. 

“A lot of the damage that happens to our bodies is from the oxidative stress and free oxygen radicals,” he explained. “We've been hearing for many years about antioxidants and how important antioxidants are to the continued health of our bodies, and all the different molecules, minerals and vitamins, and things that you can take that help as antioxidants.” 

“So if the GLP-1 medications also have this type of impact on our cellular function, then that would be another great way to be able to reduce this particular potentially damaging process,” Bert added. 

MNT also spoke with Jonathan Gloth, MD, a board certified ophthalmologist and retina specialist, Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center and Ocean University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. 

“I have seen reduced diabetic retinopathy in patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists; therefore, the study results were consistent with what we've been seeing clinically in our diabetic patients,” Gloth commented. “It is imperative that GLP-1 medications are rigorously studied as they are so commonly prescribed and their usage has increased exponentially over the past few years.”

“I would like to see retina-specific studies that compare the response to our current retinal therapies — eye injections, laser procedures, and surgery — in those patients on GLP-1 receptor agonists vs those who are not,” he added.

The FDA approved a subcutaneous (SC) induction regimen of guselkumab (Tremfya, Johnson & Johnson) for adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).

Guselkumab is the first and only interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor available as both SC and intravenous (IV) induction options for the treatment of UC and Crohn's disease (CD), the company noted in a news release. 

The approval of SC guselkumab induction in UC was based on results from the phase 3 ASTRO trial, which randomly allocated 418 patients with moderately to severely active UC to receive either induction with 400 mg SC guselkumab at weeks 0, 4, and 8 or placebo.

Following induction, the treatment group either received a maintenance dose of 200 mg SC guselkumab at week 12 and then every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 8 weeks (starting at 16 weeks).

All patients had had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional therapy.

All primary and secondary endpoints demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements with SC guselkumab compared to placebo across all clinical and endoscopic measures, the company said. 

At 12 weeks, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with 400 mg SC guselkumab every 4 weeks achieved clinical remission (26% vs 7% with placebo; P < .001) and endoscopic improvement (36% vs 12%; P < .001). 

The results were consistent with the FDA-approved 200 mg IV induction regimen, which previously achieved clinical remission (23% vs 8% with placebo; P < .001) and endoscopic improvement (27% vs 11%; P < .001). 

The efficacy of SC and IV induction was comparable across subgroups with severe or refractory disease and both routes demonstrated a similar time to onset of efficacy. 

SC guselkumab induction followed by SC guselkumab maintenance therapy also demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in clinical remission and endoscopic improvement compared to placebo. 

“Historically, IL-23 inhibitors have required IV infusions at the start of therapy, which can create barriers to starting treatment or be burdensome for some patients and clinicians,” study investigator David T. Rubin, MD, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at University of Chicago Medicine, said in the news release. 

“UC patients and providers now have the choice of starting Tremfya with a self-administered subcutaneous injection, with the same efficacy and safety that were established with IV induction in the prior clinical trials and subsequently seen in our real-world practice,” Rubin said. 

Full prescribing information and medication guide are available online.

The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recently released its 2025 guidelines for the management of myocarditis, which also includes extensive discussion of pericarditis and the wide range of overlap between these types of cardiac inflammation. The guidelines were presented at the ESC Congress 2025 in Madrid and simultaneously published in the European Heart Journal.

Myocarditis is most likely underreported and underdiagnosed because of its nonspecific symptoms, including chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and fever and its potential for spontaneous recovery, said Leslie T. Cooper, Jr, MD, a US-based expert on the condition and past chair of cardiology at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Acute myocarditis is typically seen in younger people, with a median onset between ages 30 years and 45 years and is more common in men than in women. While most cases resolve without complication, the condition carries a risk for sudden cardiac death that can strike even healthy, athletic individuals, Cooper told Medscape Medical News. According to data cited by the Myocarditis Foundation, up to 20% of sudden cardiac death cases in young adults are linked to myocarditis. Among young athletes, myocarditis has been called a “silent killer.”

Recommendations in the new ESC guidelines are largely consistent with those of the 2024 American College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on managing myocarditis, and a 2025 joint ACC/American Heart Association scientific statement on return to participation for athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities.

“New in the current guidelines is the ability to make a definitive diagnosis without a biopsy, using cardiac magnetic resonance,” said Cooper, vice-chair of the writing committee for the ACC's expert consensus statement on myocarditis. Cardiac imaging is superior for distinguishing between myocardial and pericardial inflammation and fibrotic tissue, the guidelines state. Data show late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance is one of the strongest independent predictors of sudden cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and cardiac mortality.

“We recommend endomyocardial biopsy mainly for high-risk or treatment-refractory cases,” said Gianfranco Sinagra, MD, head of cardiothoracovascular medicine at the University of Trieste in Trieste, Italy, and a task force member for the ESC guidelines.

“Our guidelines also introduce a new diagnostic paradigm for classifying myocarditis as definite, possible, or unlikely/rejected. This shift may facilitate earlier diagnosis and risk stratification for routine clinical practice,” Sinagra told Medscape Medical News.

The ESC guidelines coined “inflammatory myopericardial syndrome” (IMPS) as an umbrella term covering the overlap between myocarditis and pericarditis that can serve as a “temporary, initial diagnosis” and address mixed forms such as myopericarditis. “Managing IMPS necessitates a dual approach,” Sinagra said. “We need to address the pericardial inflammatory component while surveilling for complications suggesting myocardial injury, such as ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias.”

Treatment of myocarditis/pericarditis is aimed at the underlying etiology — viral, toxic, parasitic, or autoimmune — and types of infiltrating cells. For a first episode of acute myopericarditis, European and US guidelines affirm the use of colchicine in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In acute myocarditis, data show that omitting colchicine and failing to taper high-dose steroids are risk factors for recurrence or a chronic course of disease.

How soon a person with cardiac inflammation can resume physical activity has been a source of ongoing debate. Exercise and elevated heart rate can aggravate myocardial and pericardial inflammation and increase the risk for arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in the acute phase.

However, prolonged inactivity also has implications for mental health and quality of life. “In my practice I often see young athletes who are paralyzed with fear when faced with a potentially life-threatening cardiac diagnosis,” Cooper said. “Our data have shown that nearly 44% of people with myocarditis have clinically significant symptoms of depression.”

While the decision should be individualized, current evidence supports a minimum rest period of 4 weeks, according to both US and European guidelines, after which patients with a mild course and low risk for complications can gradually return to activity. Monitoring should include assessment of symptoms, laboratory analysis for prognostic biomarkers, and imaging.

A key difference between US and European guidelines is in how they classify myocarditis. European guideline staging is time-based:

• Acute: first 4 weeks

• Subacute: 1-3 months

• Chronic: lasting more than 3 months

Complicated cases are characterized by reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 50%), unstable arrhythmias, heart block, heart failure, or shock.

The ACC consensus statement offers similar definitions for acute and chronic myocarditis but adds a letter system to characterize severity:

Stage A: At risk based on exposure or genetic predisposition

Stage B: Subclinical: the presence of inflammation or injury without symptoms

Stage C: Active symptomatic myocarditis

Stage D: Advanced: fulminant or end-stage disease

Recognizing at-risk patient groups is important. This population includes an expanding number of patients receiving cardiotoxic drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics like clozapine. Monitoring troponin levels in the second and third week of clozapine therapy is indicated to prevent this highly fatal form of myocarditis, Cooper said.

Many cases of myocarditis probably slip through the cracks, due to socioeconomic gaps in access to care and availability of advanced diagnostic technology, Cooper added. However, clear, updated guidelines for diagnosis and management can ideally help to prevent sudden cardiac death and long-term complications like heart failure.

Cooper reported receiving consulting fees from Moderna, Bristol Myers Squibb, Cardiol Therapeutics, and Foresee Pharmaceuticals and equity ownership in Stromal Therapeutics.

Sinagra reported no relevant financial conflicts of interest.

Both intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) administration of the monoclonal antibody tixagevimab/cilgavimab rapidly eliminated culturable SARS-CoV-2, with both routes yielding minimal emergence of resistance-associated mutations.

“The comparable virologic effects of IM and IV administration are particularly relevant for clinical and public health planning,” the authors wrote. 

“IM delivery offers a practical alternative that can be more easily implemented in outpatient or mass vaccination-style setting,” they added.

The study was led by Rinki Deo, PhD, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston. It was published online on September 8, 2025, in Open Forum Infectious Diseases. 

The study was limited by the small sample size in the viral culture subset and its focus on pre-Omicron variants.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health. Some authors served as consultants and received research support from various sources. Additionally, some authors were employees of Vaccines and Immune Therapies at AstraZeneca in the US and UK.

Researchers at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute have developed a groundbreaking diagnostic tool that could transform the way acute leukemia is identified and treated. The tool, called MARLIN (Methylation- and AI-guided Rapid Leukemia Subtype Inference), uses DNA methylation patterns and machine learning to classify acute leukemia with speed and accuracy. This tool has the potential to significantly improve patient care by allowing faster and more precise treatment decisions.

Acute leukemia is an aggressive blood cancer that requires accurate diagnosis to guide treatment. Current diagnostic methods, which rely on a combination of molecular and cytogenetic tests, often take days or even weeks to complete. MARLIN, however, can provide results in as little as two hours from the time of biopsy. By providing rapid and detailed insights into leukemia subtypes, MARLIN could enable clinicians to make treatment decisions sooner and with more complete information.

Ultimately, we envision that methylation-based acute leukemia classifications will complement standard-of-care diagnostic tests to provide more comprehensive and timely information to pathologists, clinicians, and patients.""

Dr. Volker Hovestadt, computational biologist at Dana-Farber, associate institute member at Broad Institute and co-senior author of the study

The findings were published in Nature Genetics.

To develop MARLIN, the research team first created a large reference database of DNA methylation patterns from over 2,500 patient samples, representing a wide range of leukemia subtypes. This revealed 38 distinct methylation classes across disease subtypes in adults and children. ""Our analysis confirms many established molecular categories in acute leukemia but also reveals new classes that are best seen through the lens of epigenetics,"" said Mr. Til Steinicke, co-first author of the study.

Using this reference dataset, the team trained a neural network (MARLIN) to identify methylation classes in bone marrow and blood samples from patients with acute leukemia. When paired with long-read nanopore sequencing technology, which permits DNA methylation profiling from clinical samples, MARLIN demonstrated high accuracy for disease classification in both retrospective and prospective samples. ""We adapted our machine learning approach to use very small amounts of data as input, which allowed us to quickly generate classifications after just a few minutes of sequencing,"" said Dr. Salvatore Benfatto, co-first author of the study.

In real-time tests, MARLIN correctly classified leukemia samples in under two hours from the time of biopsy receipt, a dramatic improvement over the timelines of current diagnostic workflows. ""As our work continues, we hope MARLIN will greatly accelerate treatment planning, reduce medical complications, and ease patient worries in the future,"" said Dr. Evan Chen, a collaborator on the study and Dana-Farber medical oncologist in the Division of leukemia.

The researchers also found that MARLIN could resolve diagnostic ""blind spots"" missed by conventional methods. For example, it successfully identified cryptic genetic events such as rearrangements involving the DUX4 gene that are associated with favorable clinical outcomes. Additionally, MARLIN revealed novel predictive signatures, such as HOX-activated subgroups, which could inform future treatment strategies.

""We believe that our framework paves the way for future developments in epigenetic classification of acute leukemia, machine learning-assisted diagnostics, and methylation-based predictive biomarkers of drug response,"" said Dr. Gabriel Griffin, a cancer researcher, Dana-Farber pathologist, associate institute member at Broad Institute and co-senior author of the study.

The researchers now aim to develop MARLIN into a tool that can be provided to patients in the clinic to accelerate disease classification, inform treatment selection in real-time, and generate a resource for the cancer research community to study the role of DNA methylation in leukemia.

Background and goal: A recurrent barrier to Medicare annual wellness visits, which provide preventative medicine guidance for older and disabled patients, occurs when patients introduce medical concerns to physicians during these preventative visits. In this study, researchers scheduled combined visits in a single, longer slot with patients' regularly seen clinicians and used allowed billing rules so both visits could count to see if they could increase the percentage of annual wellness visits completed and the quality measures captured. 

Study approach: A family medicine department with five clinics ran a nine-month quality improvement effort for patients aged 65 and older on Medicare. The department team started booking longer 40-minute ""combined"" appointments so patients could complete the Medicare annual wellness visit and, if needed, have regular medical issues handled in the same visit with their regularly seen physician. The team then tracked, month by month, how many eligible patients got a wellness visit, how often people missed appointments, and how many screenings, tests, and vaccines were ordered, comparing results with the nine months before the change to see what improved.

Main results:

Medicare wellness visits increased from 8.4% to 50.8% over nine months.

No-show rates were lower for combined visits than annual wellness-only visits (11.9% vs 19.6%).

Patients had lower no-show rates for annual wellness visits with their regular physician than a different clinician.

Orders and screenings increased across many measures, including depression, falls, pain, breast/cervical/colorectal/lung cancer, DEXA, A1c, urine microalbumin, Hep C, HIV and pneumococcal.

Why it matters: The findings suggest scheduling longer, combined visits with patients' usual physicians may help increase the completion of annual wellness visits, reduce no shows, and close screening gaps, while still fitting within existing Medicare billing rules.

Science has confirmed what sports lovers have always known from experience: exercise is good for the brain. It increases blood flow, inhibits stress hormones, and stimulates the release of 'feel good' endorphins. One way by which exercise is thought to yield these benefits on the brain is through a chain of processes that ultimately results in the release of the hormone BDNF. Produced by the liver, brain, skeletal muscle, and fat tissue, BDNF is known to promote the growth, survival, and maintenance of nerve cells.

Previous studies have suggested that the starting signal for this physiological chain is a high level in the blood of lactate, a by-product of the conversion inside muscle, the liver, and the blood of carbohydrates into energy when oxygen is limited – for example during high-intensity exercise. Now, a study in Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience has found that the physiological benefits of exercise may be partly mimicked by a simple IV infusion of lactate.

Here we show for the first time that such an infusion leads to levels of lactate in the blood which are characteristic of medium to intense exercise. Ultimately, this boosts levels of the precursor molecule of BDNF, likely released by the skeletal muscle.""

Dr. Marcus Moberg, lead author, senior lecturer at the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, Stockholm

The authors did a so-called 'randomized crossover study' on 12 healthy volunteers aged between 20 and 40 years old. After fasting overnight, these were invited to lie down while either receiving a one-hour long IV infusion of sodium lactate and then, seven to 30 days later, a one-hour long infusion of saline solution; or receiving these treatments in the reverse order. Blood was taken from each volunteer every 10 minutes during both treatments, as well as 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes afterwards. A leg muscle biopsy was taken before and immediately after each infusion with lactate, as well as 60 and 120 minutes later.

A control group of six additional volunteers exclusively underwent a treatment with saline solution, and likewise donated blood samples and four muscle biopsies.

The researchers measured the lactate concentration in each blood or muscle tissue sample. They further quantified the levels of pro-BDNF, a biologically active precursor molecule of BDNF, in addition to its mature molecular form mBDNF, in blood plasma, serum, and platelet-poor plasma – that is, plasma from which most platelets have been removed.

As expected, the concentration of lactate in blood increased during infusion, peaking at values similar to those normally obtained after high-intensity exercise. Importantly, the concentration of the prohormone pro-BDNF increased 15 min after the end of lactate infusion and stayed high for two hours afterwards. In contrast, neither the level of pro-BDNF in muscle nor that of mBDNF in plasma or serum changed during or after lactate infusion.

The authors concluded that IV infusion with lactate is sufficient to boost the levels of pro-BDNF in the bloodstream, but without affecting those of mBDNF. In other words, lactate infusion alone is enough to mimic some, but not all, of the physiological effects of high-intensity exercise. It is expected that such an increase of pro-BDNF will have similar beneficial effects on brain health, irrespective of the mechanism behind it.

Is this good news for those among us who loathe exercise? Possibly one day, but for now the authors strongly caution against skipping the exercise step and relying on lactate infusion alone.

""We speculate rather that the intensity of exercise is important if brain health is the desired goal. High-intensity exercise a couple of times per week, thus exposing the brain to high levels of lactate, should be recommended for healthy neurological aging,"" said Moberg.

""In the future, these findings can aid in the targeted, individualized prescription of exercise in clinical settings, especially for populations with compromised brain health.""

""Also, since lactate is known to exert hormonal-like effects, there is a potential for pharmacological interventions. This would require additional research to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which lactate controls BDNF metabolism in humans.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Dried fish provide essential nutrients for women and children in Africa","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250922/Dried-fish-provide-essential-nutrients-for-women-and-children-in-Africa.aspx","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 02:58:00 GMT","

Hidden in plain sight, dried fish are an overlooked yet vital nutrient-packed superfood helping to feed millions of people across Africa, a new study reveals.

And new evidence quantifies for the first time the essential nutrients in sun-dried and smoked fish in Africa, suggesting they could play an important role in tackling malnutrition across the tropics – provided the right policies are in place, researchers argue.

Dried fish are an affordable and readily available food across the tropics. Yet despite this prevalence, because they are often produced by small-scale fisheries, and are usually traded informally, little was known about how widespread this food is produced, consumed or even how nutritious it is. Until now.

In the first large-scale investigation of dried fish consumption, an international team of researchers led by academics at Lancaster University, provides evidence that dried fish contributes significantly to the recommended nutrient intakes for young children and women - underlining their importance for global food security and nutrition.

Using modeling based on data from the multinational Living Standards Measurements Study conducted in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, the scientists behind the findings estimate that dried fish are eaten weekly by a third of households in these countries, and are even consumed by 54% more people than fresh fish.

Dried fish are particularly important to the diets of those in poor households and near to marine coastlines or urban centres. This, researchers say, reinforces the importance of protecting fish catches for local consumption, rather than for international markets.

But the question remained - just how nutritious are dried fish?

The researchers examined the nutrient content of some of the most readily available dried fish in East and West Africa, as well as the Indian Ocean, to determine their importance in providing nourishment.

They analyzed 19 species of fish, including freshwater fish from the Great Lakes (such as the Lake Victoria sardine) and marine species from West Africa (including the Madeiran sardinella) and the Indian Ocean (such as rabbitfish).

Analysis of sun-dried and smoked fish revealed that dried fish are packed with nutrients: even small amounts of dried fish contribute significantly to recommended nutrient intakes for young children and women.

Processing of fish by sun-drying and smoking concentrates essential nutrients into smaller, shelf-stable portions, such that all dried fish forms were found to have a higher nutrient density than fresh fish, for equivalent portion sizes, especially for key minerals for public health such as iron and zinc.

The study reveals that small portions of dried fish contribute more than 15% of recommended intakes for multiple essential dietary nutrients including calcium, iodine, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamins B12 and D.

Nutrients are not equal for all fish. Powdered and smoked marine species, for example, have high iron and omega-3 fatty acid concentrations, whereas freshwater species from Lake Victoria have relatively higher calcium and zinc concentrations.

Dr. James Robinson, Leverhulme Research Fellow at Lancaster University's Lancaster Environment Centre, said: ""Until now, the role and scale of dried fish in supporting food security and nutrition has often been undervalued and hidden, limiting our understanding of how dried fish contribute to healthy diets.

""Fish caught in oceans, lakes and rivers across Africa and Asia are dried, smoked or fried, providing large supplies of affordable and nutritious foods that can be stored for long periods of time and easily transported.

""The widespread prevalence of highly-nutritious dried fish show these foods play critical roles in food security and nutrition, particularly for vulnerable populations like women and children, households close to fisheries, and even in places distant from fisheries.""

Following these new insights, the researchers say their findings suggest dried fish could be used to prevent micronutrient deficiencies in women and young children in Africa.

Dried fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids, iodine and selenium could be powdered and mixed with other food products to produce highly nutritious meals for infants that can be used to treat and prevent malnutrition, the researchers add.

Dr. Rucha Karkarey, of Lancaster University and co-author, said: ""Dried fish can fill nutrient gaps in seasonal seas, such as reef fish in Lakshadweep Islands that are caught and dried before the southwest monsoon. But here and across the tropics, policies are needed to protect supply for coastal communities against competing international markets.""

High-quality analytical data on small processed fish is presently lacking in most African food composition tables, which limits our ability to fully understand and utilize their nutritional potential. This paper is an important step towards filling that gap, generating robust data that is essential for developing knowledge-based dietary guidelines and ensuring these nutrient-rich foods are used to improve public health.""

Marian Kjellevold, research professor, Institute of Marine Research, Bergen

Dr. Shakuntala Thilsted, Senior Nutrition Expert, CGIAR said ""Many countries look towards biofortification of staple crops as a means of boosting micronutrient intakes. The results presented in this paper show that these nutrients are concentrated in dried small fish. Therefore, we must ensure that dried fish are included in food-based dietary guidelines. We must also use dried fish products in complementary feeding of young children, treatment of malnourished children, school feeding and food assistance programmes.""

The findings of the study, which was supported by the Royal Society and the European Research Council, are outlined in the paper 'Dried fish provide widespread access to critical nutrients across Africa', published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Science of the United States of America (PNAS).

Researchers on the study include: James Robinson, Antonio Allegretti, Rucha Karkarey, Tim Lamont, Sarah Martin, Sophie Standen, Nicholas Graham and Christina Hicks of Lancaster University; Eva Maire of Lancaster University and the University of Montpellier; Johnstone Omukoto, Christopher Aura, and Naftaly Mwirigi of Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute; Richard Ansong of the University of Ghana, Kendra Byrd of the University of Greenwich; Kathryn Fiorella and Lydia O'Meara of Cornell University; Marian Kjellevold of the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen; Jessica Gephart of the University of Washington, and Shakuntala Thilsted of CGIAR.

For undergraduates, a trip to the dentist can reflect more than oral health. Those who kept up with dental exams were also more likely to schedule eye and physical exams, carry health insurance, and rate their overall health more positively, according to new study. 

We can think of primary care as a kind of gateway to other preventive care and specialized services. When students maintain the habit of seeing one type of provider regularly, it seems to spill over into how they approach their health more broadly."" 

Vanessa Alvarez, study's lead author and second-year MPH Epidemiology student at George Mason University's College of Public Health

Alvarez conducted the study with renowned obesity researcher Lawrence Cheskin, professor of nutrition at George Mason. Cheskin is co-principal investigator of Mason: Health Starts Here, the university's landmark cohort study following students across their four undergraduate years. 

The dental care study analyzed data from 349 first-year students enrolled in the cohort. The research found that: 

Students who had a dental exam before college were much more likely to keep up the habit two years later. 

Health insurance predicted dental visits at baseline, and students who got one type of preventive exam (dental, eye, or physical) were more likely to get the others. 

Students who had dental exams, more parental financial support, and higher levels of hope also rated their overall health more positively. 

Dental exam rates held steady from before to after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Researchers also noted a complex relationship with anxiety. Students reporting mild anxiety were sometimes more likely to seek dental care, but higher anxiety correlated with avoiding preventive exams. ""It's not a straight-line relationship,"" explained Cheskin. ""If you're a little bit anxious, it may motivate you to see a doctor. If you're very anxious, you may avoid it."" 

The dental study is just one slice of Mason: Health Starts Here, the university's first-of-its-kind longitudinal study tracking the health and habits of undergraduates. Since 2019, more than a thousand George Mason students have enrolled and completed detailed surveys, with some taking physical exams. Researchers monitor everything from diet and exercise to sleep, mental health, and substance use, returning health feedback to participants along the way. 

Findings from the cohort data so far have shed light on links between discrimination and disordered eating, how loneliness affects diet and physical activity, and the intersection of firearm access and substance use, among other topics. 

Several new studies are now underway. As a companion to the dental research, Alvarez is now leading a study on eye exams, while other researchers are looking into gynecological care among female students. Cheskin says future work will also focus on how diet and exercise habits changed from pre- to post-pandemic, and on mental health trends such as depression and hopefulness.

Routine blood samples, such as those taken daily at any hospital and tracked over time, could help predict the severity of an injury and even provide insights into mortality after spinal cord damage, according to a recent University of Waterloo study. 

The research team utilized advanced analytics and machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to assess whether routine blood tests could serve as early warning signs for spinal cord injury patient outcomes. 

More than 20 million people worldwide were affected by spinal cord injury in 2019, with 930,000 new cases each year, according to the World Health Organization. Traumatic spinal cord injury often requires intensive care and is characterized by variable clinical presentations and recovery trajectories, complicating diagnosis and prognosis, especially in emergency departments and intensive care units. 

 Routine blood tests could offer doctors important and affordable information to help predict risk of death, the presence of an injury and how severe it might be.""

Dr. Abel Torres Espín, Professor, School of Public Health Sciences, University of Waterloo

The researchers sampled hospital data from more than 2,600 patients in the U.S. They used machine learning to analyze millions of data points and discover hidden patterns in common blood measurements, such as electrolytes and immune cells, taken during the first three weeks after a spinal cord injury. 

They found that these patterns could help forecast recovery and injury severity, even without early neurological exams, which are not always reliable as they depend on a patient's responsiveness. 

""While a single biomarker measured at a single time point can have predictive power, the broader story lies in multiple biomarkers and the changes they show over time,"" said Dr. Marzieh Mussavi Rizi, a postdoctoral scholar in Torres Espín's lab at Waterloo. 

The models, which do not rely on early neurological assessment, were accurate in predicting mortality and the severity of injury as early as one to three days after admission to the hospital, compared to standard non-specific severity measures that are often performed during the first day of arrival to intensive care. 

The research also found that accuracy increased over time as more blood tests became available. Although other measures, such as MRI and fluid omics-based biomarkers, can also provide objective data, they are not always readily accessible across medical settings. Routine blood tests, on the other hand, are economical, easy to obtain, and available in every hospital. 

""Prediction of injury severity in the first days is clinically relevant for decision-making, yet it is a challenging task through neurological assessment alone,"" Torres Espín said. ""We show the potential to predict whether an injury is motor complete or incomplete with routine blood data early after injury, and an increase in prediction performance as time progresses. 

""This foundational work can open new possibilities in clinical practice, allowing for better-informed decisions about treatment priorities and resource allocation in critical care settings for many physical injuries.""

Background and goal: Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), uninsured and low-income adults were less likely to have a usual source of care due to cost, coverage, and access barriers. This study evaluated changes in the prevalence of usual sources of care and the reasons for lacking one before and after ACA implementation. 

Study approach: Researchers analyzed 2010 to 2017 data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Component (MEPS-HC), a nationally representative survey of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The study sample included 36,738 adults ages 18 to 64 and was divided into pre-ACA (2010-2013) and post-ACA (2014-2017) implementation. The primary outcome was self-reported usual source of care status and, if none existed, the main reason why. 

Main results:

The national usual source of care rose from 67% to 68% after the ACA, with the largest gains among low-income adults in both rural (+4.96 percentage points) and urban (+2.45 percentage points) areas. Reports by urban high-income adults declined slightly (-1.98 percentage points) while rural high-income adults showed no significant change.

After the ACA, reasons for lacking a usual source of care shifted in urban areas: affordability and insurance-related barriers decreased across income groups, accessibility increased across all income groups, and individual-preference reasons increased for low- and middle-income adults.

Why it matters: The findings suggest that while low-income adults reported gains in usual sources of care, insurance expansion alone may not ensure consistent access to care, especially given persistent non-financial access challenges.

Ovarian cancer (OC), one of the three most common gynecological malignancies, is characterized by low early detection rates and poor prognosis. Patients with OC face a high risk of developing transcoelomic metastasis—the spread of cancer cells within the abdominal cavity—during the early stages of the disease, a process strongly linked to poor survival outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms of how OC cells spread from the primary tumor to distant sites have remained elusive.

In a recent study published in Genes & Diseases, researchers from Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics, and Nankai University, employed CRISPR-based large-scale genetic screening alongside an orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse model with gene knockout cells to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying OC.

Using a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach combined with patient-derived transcriptomic datasets, researchers identified neuroblastoma suppressor of tumorigenicity 1 (NBL1) as one of the most critical genes promoting transcoelomic metastasis. NBL1 was found to be significantly overexpressed in metastatic ovarian tumors, with expression levels strongly correlating with advanced clinical stage and poor survival outcomes.

Further experiments by the team revealed that NBL1 promotes OC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis through dual mechanisms: i) direct activation of Jak/Stat3 signaling via physical interaction and ii) suppression of anti-tumor immunity by limiting T cell infiltration. Notably, the Stat3 inhibitor Wp1066 was shown to block NBL1-driven metastasis, reversing its effects on cell proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), both in in vitro and in vivo models.

In conclusion, this study reveals a previously unrecognized oncogenic role of NBL1 in OC metastasis through Jak/Stat3 pathway activation. Its strong association with poor prognosis, combined with reversibility by Stat3 inhibitors, positions NBL1 as both a prognostic biomarker and a promising therapeutic target.

Background and goal: This study examined whether adding pharmacy technicians to primary care teams relieved clinicians and nurses of medication-access tasks and improved perceptions of burden, quality of care and patient access.

Study approach: Researchers conducted a retrospective, mixed-methods study one year after deploying five primary care pharmacy technicians across 11 clinics in a large urban safety-net network. They analyzed electronic health records (EHR) from June 2023 to May 2024 to track the number and type of medication tasks the technicians handled. Clinic staff were surveyed. The survey included a 0 to 10 ""pain point"" rating of medication access work before and after technician deployment; estimated hours saved per month; perceived impact on work experience, quality of care and patient access, and open-ended responses.

Main results:

In 12 months, five pharmacy technicians handled 43,782 medication items (65% refills, 18% medication problems, 17% prior authorizations).

Average ratings of ""medication access work as a pain point"" (0 to 10 scale) decreased from 8.3 before to 3.6 after pharmacy technician deployment.

Themes from open-ended questions described pharmacy technicians dealing with prior authorizations, communicating with pharmacies, timely medication access for patients, expertise of pharmacy technicians, and reduced task burden/ greater efficiency.

Why it matters: The findings from this study suggest pharmacy technicians can be an asset for team- based primary care, bringing expertise in efficiently managing medication access processes that benefits clinician and nurse work experience and patient access to medications.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a dangerous malformation of the lungs and diaphragm that causes almost a third of affected babies to die from underdeveloped lungs. So far, there have been no concrete options for treating this malformation with medication. Now, in an international study, pediatric scientists at the University of Leipzig Medical Center have shown that inflammatory cells play a previously underestimated role in the underdeveloped lungs of children with diaphragmatic hernia – both before and after birth. The findings lay the foundation for potential new treatment approaches and have been published in the renowned American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. 

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is one of the deadliest malformations in newborns. The main problem is the underdevelopment of the lungs. The condition also involves a hole in the diaphragm, which pediatric surgeons repair during the first week of life. However, even after a successful operation, many children with diaphragmatic hernia still die as a result of their underdeveloped lungs. So far, so-called pulmonary hypoplasia has scarcely been amenable to therapeutic intervention. Researchers in pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center therefore set out to discover which molecular mechanisms cause this malformation – and whether they might be specifically targeted for treatment.

In our current study we were able to show in human lungs that certain inflammatory cells – particularly macrophages – appear in increased numbers both before and after birth. This may influence the development of lung structure as we see it in congenital diaphragmatic hernia.""

PD Dr. Richard Wagner, lead investigator of the study in Leipzig

""We also confirmed several parallels in the inflammatory processes of diaphragmatic hernia between animal models and human samples – a crucial step towards potentially translating future therapies to humans,"" says the senior physician and research group leader for pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center.

The latest scientific analyses of congenital diaphragmatic hernia, carried out in collaboration with researchers in Mannheim, Paris, Winnipeg and Boston, show that the inflammatory signalling pathways of the immune system are overactivated. One striking finding was the so-called macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which is associated with disruptions in lung development.

For the study, state-of-the-art research methods were used, including proteomics technology to analyse a wide range of proteins in foetal lungs. Specialised microscopic staining and cell-measurement techniques were also applied. The results were then examined using bioinformatic tools and compared with findings from a stem cell model and animal models. In an earlier study, PD Dr Jan-Hendrik Gosemann, executive senior physician and research group leader in pediatric surgery at the University of Leipzig Medical Center, had already demonstrated in animal experiments that increased numbers of macrophages are found in the lungs of unborn rats with diaphragmatic hernia.

""The current results of our study have the potential one day to be translated into new treatment approaches. If we succeed in specifically reducing the heightened inflammation during pregnancy, we may be able to promote lung development and thereby improve both the survival prospects and the quality of life of affected children. The hope is to develop an additional drug therapy that could be administered before birth,"" says PD Dr. Wagner.

To pursue this approach further, the Leipzig team is currently establishing a major research programme funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Planned steps include testing various anti-inflammatory substances in animal models as well as in patient-derived stem cells, with the long-term aim of preparing clinical trials for prenatal treatment. ""So far, our studies are still at the level of molecular and cellular observations. But our ongoing research and the findings published in earlier and current studies provide strong indications that increased inflammation is a central driver of this severe malformation,"" says pediatric surgeon PD Dr. Wagner. ""I am especially delighted that Ms Katinka Sturm, a doctoral researcher in our department, is joint first author of this study – a wonderful recognition for such a young researcher.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","SNAP benefit reductions increase food and financial hardship for families","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250922/SNAP-benefit-reductions-increase-food-and-financial-hardship-for-families.aspx","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 03:00:00 GMT","

A new study found that families experienced greater difficulty affording adequate food and household expenses after states began to lift emergency SNAP benefits that were provided to families at the start of the pandemic.

The US Congressional Budget Office estimates that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will cut $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next decade, sparking concerns among health experts about how this reduction in funding will affect food and economic security among the 47 million families who rely on this critical assistance.

As these changes begin to unfold, a new study builds upon a growing body of data that capture the detrimental consequences of reducing SNAP assistance. 

Published in the journal Preventive Medicine, the study explores food insufficiency and financial challenges among families after multiple states stopped providing emergency allotments of SNAP benefits provided during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. SNAP benefit reductions were associated with increased difficulty affording both food and household expenses among SNAP-participant families, particularly among those with children.

The risk of food insufficiency-a narrow measure that indicates that a household has not had enough food to eat within the past seven days-increased by five percentage points after several states ended their emergency allotments in 2021, compared to states that ended this assistance later. Similarly, the risk of difficulty affording household expenses increased by eight percentage points after the emergency allotments ended.

These findings demonstrate the vital role of SNAP, which is the largest food and nutrition assistance program in the country, and the research team hopes that these data can inform future policies and discussions around the adequacy of the SNAP benefit amount to support the health and well-being of families.

Our study found that states choosing to end the SNAP emergency allotments early created more pressure on family budgets, not just for affording food but also spillovers to difficulty affording other expenses. Households with children faced a greater increase in food insufficiency than those without, foreshadowing what we may expect with SNAP cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.""

Dr. Paul Shafer, study senior author, associate professor of health law, policy & management

For the study, Dr. Shafer and colleagues utilized data from the nationally representative Household Pulse Survey to measure and compare changes in the risk of food insufficiency and difficulty affording household expenses among 5,685 people living in four states that ended SNAP emergency allotments in 2021 (Florida, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota) and 10,773 people living in eight states that ended these allotments in 2022 (Iowa, Arizona, Kentucky, Wyoming, Indiana, Georgia, Alaska, South Carolina, and South Carolina). The expanded SNAP assistance ended nationwide when the federal government lifted the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023. 

Food insufficiency was assessed with questions about the type of food households consumed within the last seven days, as well as how often families had enough to eat. Difficulty affording expenses was determined based on whether households were able to pay for standard expenses such as rent or mortgage, car payments, and medical expenses. 

Beyond physical health and development, even brief disruptions in access to food can affect mental and emotional health, particularly among children, the researchers emphasize. 

""Participating in SNAP helps in ways that go beyond just food on the table,"" Dr. Shafer says. ""Being food insecure is associated with higher rates of stress and depression. SNAP assistance supports the health of families and their housing, and helps avoid developmental risks in children.""

In addition to funding cuts, the OBBB implements several changes to SNAP eligibility, including expanded work reporting requirements for older adults, parents of children over age 14, parents, veterans, and the unhoused, as well as significant shifting of benefit and administrative costs from the federal government to the states. 

How states choose to respond will be key, says Dr. Shafer.

""States could cut eligibility or opt out altogether, or have to cut other state programs to offset the cost,"" he says. More people being subject to work reporting requirements, including 55-64 year olds, veterans, and unhoused people, will yield an estimated 2.4 million Americans falling through the cracks. Furthermore, food pantries-which are already overburdened-won't be able to absorb the additional need, which means even more people will face food insecurity and hunger.""

Tracking how these major changes to SNAP benefits and to the structure of the program affect families' health and their ability to make ends meet will be essential going forward, says study coauthor Dr. Stephanie Ettinger de Cuba, research associate professor of health law, policy & management. 

""Tariffs, inflation, and growing unemployment are additional stressors on the purchasing power of SNAP that will be important to evaluate in real time,"" Dr. Ettinger de Cuba says. ""Given what we already know from past changes to the program, I am concerned that SNAP will not be able to respond as it was designed-to grow during hard times and shrink in good times-ultimately increasing hardship for everyday people.""

While many families found comfort and companionship in their lockdown puppies, new research shows that the joy often came with safety risks, added stress, and uneven benefits across children and caregivers.

Study: More than just one man and his dog: The many impacts of puppy acquisition on the mental health of families including children in the UK. Image credit: Nina Buday/Shutterstock.com

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, multiple families got puppies, mainly to help them with their mental health. A recent study in PLOS ONE examines how children and dogs interact in these families, using a three-phase online survey.

About 1.6 million UK homes have one or more dogs. Dogs are part of the family in these homes, and multiple family members consider themselves the dog's owner. This contrasts with the common misconception that one person, usually an adult, owns the dog.

A prior study showed that 38% of people in the UK who currently own a dog acquired it during the pandemic, resulting in “pandemic puppies.” The pandemic years were marked by lockdowns, periods of severely restricted physical social interactions, and widespread fear of severe illness and death. Rising rates of mental ill-health, coupled with the belief that having a dog in the household would help counter emotional negativity, led to the pandemic puppy trend.

Very little is known about the benefits of pet ownership for children or adults, which has prompted this current study. The researchers conducted an online survey in three parts. They compared households that got a dog in 2019 with those that got a dog during 2020-21. Since few people responded in the 2019 group, statistical comparisons were underpowered, and the qualitative analysis pooled both groups rather than treating them separately.

The responses came from 382 caregivers and 216 children. In most cases, dog care appeared to be women's work, with half the women being 45-54 years old. For just under half, this was their first dog. Two-thirds said they researched their decision before acquiring a puppy.

More than half the families got a dog to boost their spirits and bring joy back into the house. Over half the children in the study were female, with a median age of 13. Slightly less than a quarter of caregivers had children with a mental health diagnosis, with 82% of these blaming the pandemic, in part.

A third of caregivers found living with a puppy more challenging than expected, especially when it was their first dog. The greatest challenge was ensuring everyone remained safe around the dog, especially the children.

Other challenges included always looking after the dog, especially when other family members were less involved. Some mothers felt their children were less involved in dog walking and feeding,  though others noted more involvement than anticipated. First-time dog owners were more likely to find their children less involved in care than expected.

Many caregivers reported stress involved in ensuring safe dog-child interactions. Concerningly, over half of the children were permitted to engage in multiple activities known to increase bite risk (17/25 listed interactions). About half the children had eight risky interactions with the family pet. For instance, children not only patted their dogs but hugged and kissed them in 90% or more families. Over a third of families allowed children to play with the dog during its mealtimes, a known risk for biting behavior. Obvious misbehavior, like pulling the dog's ears or tail, was allowed in <7% of families.

Both children and adults found that having a dog had multiple positive aspects, especially the close physical interactions between children and the dog. The impact of having a dog was different for different people in the same family. Its presence could change the operation and mood of the whole family.

In almost all families, at least one member has benefited from the dog's positive effects as a playmate, confidant, friend, comforter, and safeguard. Children particularly “owned” the dog.

The lockdown was associated with very bad memories, which many caregivers and children recalled being eased by the presence of a dog. Not only did the children enjoy cuddling, hugging, or sharing a bed with their dogs as an expression of their affection, but this also provided an emotional boost when they were sad, lonely, or anxious.

The family was often bonded by caring for a dog, keeping it physically engaged, and by the companionship and humor the dog brought into their lives. Dog walking also separated the children from virtual interactions and brought them out of their bedrooms to engage with the family.

Conversely, children sometimes resent taking care of the family pet, are jealous when the dog appears to prefer others or receives more attention, and dislike the dog's asking for attention when they are otherwise engaged. The caregivers are often unaware that their children do not like these behaviors or do not appreciate having to give up much of their free time to look after the dog.

Recognizing signs of aversion, distress, fear, or aggression in a dog is vital for dog owners. It should be taught wherever possible, even via literature or other media, if not physically.  

“These findings underscore the importance of involving all household members in human-dog research and highlight the unpredictability of whether acquisition motivations will align with outcomes.” “Pandemic puppies” did not always improve the mental health of the children in the families that owned them, and this should not be the reason for getting a puppy.

Children often love having a dog as a companion and playmate, but they should be trained to avoid behaviors that increase dog bite risk. Families need access to resources to help them safely settle in the new puppy, especially considering the additional caregiver mental burden placed on the woman who typically undertakes dog care and maintains safe dog-child boundaries, in addition to her other responsibilities in the home.

More than 1500 persons in Norway have had a liver transplantation. But how can doctors know which patients need extra follow-up or additional treatment so that as many as possible can live a long life afterwards?

In some people, liver failure is caused by cancer, in others it is due to diseases where the immune system attacks the body's own tissue, while others have a liver seriously damaged by alcohol consumption.

Amongst those who have a liver transplantation, around 95 per cent are still alive one year later. After five years, 85 per cent are still alive. How can doctors receive signals at an early stage indicating which patients may need more treatment or following up more closely?

Researchers at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at the University of Oslo have looked at a large number of previously completed studies to find out how so-called biomarkers can help to foresee survival rates and complications.

Biomarkers are substances, molecules or even images that can be measured or detected in a body or cell and that can reveal information about an underlying condition. Typically, doctors can find these biomarkers in blood tests, urine samples or by using ultrasound.

In the article published in the scientific journal Liver Transplantation, the researchers analyzed studies covering many different biomarkers and combinations of these.

We investigated whether these gave signs as to how the patient would fare, both shortly after the operation and later on. The biomarkers were evaluated both in terms of whether they gave good explanations about the patient's health and as regards how the transplanted organ was functioning. Our findings can help doctors make treatments more effective in the future and to know which patients will need closer follow-up.""

Andrea Camera, Section of Physiology, University of Oslo



Examples of biomarkers which can reveal something about patient survival after transplantation are the coagulation factors V and ALAT. But perhaps more importantly, the study compiled new combinations of biomarkers that have not previously been tested, explain the researchers.

In the various studies the researchers looked at, different methods and medical scoring systems were used to measure how well the biomarkers worked. It was therefore not always easy for the researchers to compare the results.

""For this reason, we have drawn up recommendations as to how future studies could standardize this so that everyone uses the same scoring system. It is important to achieve a wide overview of which biomarkers function best in order to be able to foresee possible complications and get a picture of how the patient will fare"", says Gustavo Jose Justo da Silva, postdoctoral fellow and one of the leaders of the study.

The researchers are now also checking the biomarkers against other conditions, such as heart diseases, diabetes and heart transplantations. The project leader for the studies is professor Kåre-Olav Stensløkken at the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences. The aim of the research is to increase the accessibility and function of donor organs for transplantation.

Access to respite services for family caregivers increases a palliative care patient's probability of dying at home almost threefold, according to a McGill University-led study.

Previous surveys suggest most Canadians with a serious illness would prefer to spend the end of their lives at home. In Quebec, fewer than one-in-10 palliative care patients die at home, a rate that has remained largely unchanged for two decades and lags behind the Canadian average of 15 per cent.

Funded by Quebec's health ministry as part of its action plan for equitable access to quality palliative and end-of-life care, the study set out to find which factors matter most in helping patients avoid a transfer to a hospital or palliative care centre in their final days.

Respite care – professional help that allows family caregivers to take short breaks –emerged as the strongest predictor, with patients 2.7 times more likely to die at home when it was available.

Timely access to nursing care, support with hygiene such as bathing, and pain-relief services also were significant factors.

An at-home palliative and end-of-life care approach that addresses the physical, psychological, spiritual and social needs of patients and their caregivers enables patients to remain at home longer and to die at home when that is their wish.""

Kelley Kilpatrick, lead author, Assistant Professor and Susan E. French Chair in Nursing Research and Innovative Practice at McGill's Ingram School of Nursing

The researchers conclude that Quebec can achieve its equity goals by:

The findings are based on nearly 6,000 patient records from a Montreal at-home palliative care organization between 2015 and 2024, along with 73 interviews with patients, caregivers, service providers and decision-makers. On average, patients were 78 years old, nearly all had cancer and more than one-in-four lived alone.

United States men's national team and Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Giovanni Reyna has joined the ownership group of Fort Lauderdale United FC.

Fort Lauderdale United currently has a women's team in the USL Super League, with the organization set to add a men's team that will compete next season in USL League One. The latest round of investment in the club also includes other individuals besides Reyna, and according to majority owner Tommy Smith, brings the club's valuation to $55 million.

""We are incredibly proud to welcome Gio Reyna to the Fort Lauderdale United family,"" Smith said in a prepared statement. ""This investment not only reflects our club's immense potential but also solidifies our position in the American soccer landscape. With our strong youth program and state-of-the-art facilities, we are proud of our ability to create signature professional pathway on both the men's and women's sides.""

Fort Lauderdale United currently has youth teams from U-11 on up -- with plans to have younger teams next year -- and is using the old Miami Dolphins training facility on the campus of Nova Southeastern University as hub for the organization, featuring a 7,000-seat stadium.

In addition to soccer, the club also fields teams in youth volleyball, and has plans to field a women's professional volleyball team in 2027. Smith said that all told, there are 1,400 youth players affiliated with the organization.

""Just bringing in outside money, it's the smart thing to do. I pretty much invested all my own capital to build the stadium, the clubs, the teams, the fields, the partnership with NSU,"" Smith said in an exclusive interview with ESPN.

""Especially someone like [Gio Reyna] that has been involved in soccer, not necessarily really the money aspect of it, but ultimately kind of a proof in concept that like, 'Hey, we're doing this revenue, we have these teams, we have these clubs, building it up.'""

Another one of the club's owners, Hassan Pinto, knew Gio's father, Claudio, from his days playing youth soccer in New Jersey, and the two were teammates in their youth with the Olympic Development Program (ODP) Region I team. Pinto also was classmates with Claudio Reyna's wife, Danielle, at UNC-Chapel Hill. That connection helped pave the way for getting Gio Reyna to invest in the club.

The expectation for Reyna, 22, is that it will give him an initial foray into sports business, the better to accumulate knowledge for a possible career after his playing days end.

""What truly sold me on Fort Lauderdale United was the ownership group's comprehensive vision. They're not just creating two professional teams; they're building a complete ecosystem for player development, from the youth level all the way to the pros,"" Reyna said in a statement.

""Combining that with the fantastic South Florida location and state-of-the-art facilities, it became clear this was a perfect opportunity to not only invest in the club's success but also to help develop the future of American soccer.""

Reyna follows in the footsteps of international teammate Tyler Adams in terms of investing in professional clubs, with Adams joining the investment group of IUSL League One side Westchester SC earlier this year.

But for Fort Lauderdale United president of soccer Tyrone Mears, having Gio Reyna on board goes beyond the professional setup.

""I know there's been quite a few of the American players investing into clubs over here, so it's fantastic,"" he told ESPN. ""Gio, he's got a fantastic name. He's obviously playing in Europe, but to get that connection, I think especially with the younger demographic, Gio's really going to help with that.""

Fort Lauderdale United lost in the USL Super League playoff final in the league's inaugural season last year, and is currently in second place this season after four games played.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

TOPICS:

As the United States Men's National Team moves closer to next summer's World Cup, individual performances will receive more and more attention as players jockey for a place in Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino's final squad.

Last Friday, midfielder Tanner Tessmann scored what turned out to be the winning goal for his club team, Lyon, in their Ligue 1 match against Angers.  While the goal can only help Tessmann's prospects of catching Pochettino's eye, it's equally as possible that the 23-year-old midfielder's chances of landing a spot on the World Cup squad may have already come and gone.



“Pochettino was so high on [Tessmann] at first and then over the summer, he didn't get called in [to the Gold Cup] and it feels like other guys are just moving ahead of him” said former U.S. Men's National Team star Landon Donovan on the latest edition of Unfiltered Soccer.

Despite captaining the American Olympic team at the 2024 games in Paris, Tessmann failed to make this summer's Gold Cup squad.  He was then also passed over for the USMNT's recent September camp including two friendlies against South Korea and Japan.  Donovan cited that September absence as the one that could spell doom for Tessmann's chances of securing a spot at the World Cup.

“From what I heard internally and a little bit externally, that September camp, the Japan-South Korea games, were the last time Pochettino was ‘looking and evaluating players.'

“It feels like the ship has sailed a little with [Tessmann].'”

Meanwhile, in Italy, U.S. star attacker Christian Pulisic appears to be starting the season on the right foot as the 26-year-old scored twice and assisted on another over the weekend in AC Milan's 3-0 win against Udinese.  For Pulisic, the brace moved him ahead of Clint Dempsey for the most goals scored by an American in Europe's top 5 leagues (English Premier League, La Liga in Spain, the German Bundesliga, Ligue 1 in France and Serie A in Italy).

“He'll continue to smash that record,” said former U.S. Goalkeeper and Unfiltered Soccer co-host, Tim Howard.  “I mean, he'll probably get to, I would think, at least one hundred.”

In Season 2, Episode 3 of Portfolio Players presented by E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, former U.S. men's national team star Jozy Altidore discusses life after soccer and how he's building a business legacy off the field.

Altidore shares why he invested in the Buffalo Bills, his belief in the growth of women's sports, and how he and his wife, Sloane Stephens, filter and prioritize business opportunities together. He reflects on the mindset shift from player to investor, why athlete ownership is becoming more common, and how mentorship from icons like Magic Johnson and Alex Rodriguez has shaped his approach.

With candid insights on preparing for a second act and leveraging his platform for long-term impact, Altidore shows how today's athletes can channel their competitive drive into lasting success beyond the pitch.","{'href': 'https://frontofficesports.com', 'title': 'Front Office Sports'}","soccer"

FIFA received 145 reports relating to “human rights concerns” at the Club World Cup in the U.S., “many of which were complaints submitted by supporters through the governing body's own grievance mechanism portal,” according to Adam Crafton of THE ATHLETIC. 

The highest number related to fans “expressing concerns about U.S. government policies or their enforcement,” with the second-most coming from fans who “suffered from extreme heat during the tournament.” Crafton notes the grievance mechanism is in place for supporters who wish to express concerns about the organization or the experience at FIFA-led events. Some reports were “received via the portal, some fans used FIFA's human rights email address, and others were made on-site by venue teams reporting into FIFA.” These included 37 complaints categorized as being “related to federal policies or enforcement.” 

Among the other complaints submitted by supporters were “concerns about extreme heat -- a repeated controversy during the tournament.” FIFA opened 25 investigations following reports about “conditions deemed unsafe by fans due to the heat.” Other investigations included “20 or more complaints about accessibility issues and discrimination.” FIFA also opened a dozen complaints “relating to workers' rights, as well as just under 10 safeguarding issues.” There were five investigations into “harassment,” as well as four in the “freedom of speech category and alleged excessive use of force.” Three complaints were made about an “alleged failure to provide for freedom of religion” (THE ATHLETIC, 9/23).

Hello! Ousmane Dembele is the best men's player in the world. This time last year, we'd never have said that.

On the way:

🏆 Dembele's Ballon d'Or glory

✍️ 145 FIFA complaints

Advertisement

🇫🇷 An actual French title race?

🚪 Monchi exits in fresh Villa unrest

Ousmane Dembele spent almost a decade carrying the reputation of a busted flush. He was an overpriced error when Barcelona paid £88million ($118.8m) to buy him from Borussia Dortmund in 2017. He was equally dubious value when PSG gave him a route out of Barca by signing him for £42m six years later.

Dembele differed from Aitana Bonmati, the recipient of the women's Ballon d'Or last night for the third year running. Bonmati has been the best player in the world consistently. Dembele landing the men's trophy yesterday wrong-footed most of us. It's a deserved award, no question — just not an award in any way foretold.

Take this stat, for instance: last season, when Dembele scored 35 goals during PSG's surge to the Ligue 1 title, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, it was the first time in nine years that he'd hit double figures in a league campaign. You had to go back to Rennes in 2016 to find the previous instance. Dembele, as Tom Williams recalls, aspired to Lionel Messi standards of dribbling rather than Messi standards of finishing. And truth be told, he didn't light fires on either front.

Even in 2024-25, when with blinkered hindsight it feels like PSG could do no wrong, he was an awkward fit for parts of it. Luis Enrique dropped him for a Champions League tie at Arsenal after Dembele pitched up late for training. He got it in the ear again after a red card against Bayern Munich. Luis Enrique called that dismissal a “serious mistake” — a phrase which defined the money spent on Dembele all over.

But then it clicked: the 28-year-old surging towards and beyond the 30-goal mark, with 27 of them materialising in 22 games. Football won't remember him as its top men's player per se — Lamine Yamal, who came second last night, should ultimately make greater waves — but in one mesmerising purple patch, Dembele definitely was.

Luis Enrique impact, change in position



For all Luis Enrique's sporadic criticism of the forward, he's a long-time Dembele enthusiast. Their periods at Barca didn't overlap — the former stepped down as head coach in the summer when the latter joined — but the Spaniard had been following him at Rennes, convinced the hype around Dembele was worth taking seriously.

At PSG, in 2023, Luis Enrique went out and bought him — for a modest return initially. Dembele churned out three whole league goals in 2023-24, but the revelation last season — the first campaign for PSG with no out-and-out superstar such as Messi, Kylian Mbappe or Neymar — was his insertion as a false nine, the deep-lying centre forward role made fashionable by Messi in his pomp.

As Dembele got on a spectacular roll, his club did, too. It was almost a clean sweep for PSG in Paris yesterday. Beyond the main prize, Luis Enrique was named coach of the year, PSG took the team of the year prize, and Gianluigi Donnarumma (since departed for Manchester City) picked up the Yashin Trophy as best goalkeeper. There was no arguing with any of it.

But Dembele it was who took centre stage and crowned a glorious renaissance. All it took was him finding the sweet spot of a coach who believed in him, a position that suited him, and the departure of superstars who were otherwise suffocating him. Nobody saw those stars aligning, and perhaps Dembele least of all.

🏆 We've got the full list of winners from the 2025 awards for you. It's a rare year when the men's top 30 looks just about right. And in Full Time, our women's soccer newsletter, Tamerra Griffin asks if Bonmati was actually Ballon d'Or-worthy.

While PSG killed it on stage in Paris, they could have done with Dembele and others elsewhere. A postponed trip to Marseille in Ligue 1 ended in a 1-0 loss, courtesy of Nayef Aguerd's scrappy header (above), tempting the division to think — and whisper this extremely quietly — that it might have a title race on its hands.

Luis Enrique's line-up fell well short of full strength, and it showed. Dembele is injured and several weeks short of a comeback (he streamed footage from Marseille at the Ballon d'Or ceremony). Desire Doue has fitness problems, too, and with Bradley Barcola also out, Achraf Hakimi pushed up into PSG's front three, embarking on a fruitless shift. Hakimi might be “more than a full-back”, as we once wrote, but he has some natural limits.

Ligue 1, therefore, looks like this: Monaco top by virtue of goals scored, level on 12 points with PSG, Lyon and Strasbourg. I'm not deluded; the cavalry will return for PSG soon enough, and they'll still win the league most likely. But what harm in clubs around them being made to feel like it's worth turning up?

When FIFA set up a portal for the submission of human rights complaints, it must have hoped the influx would not be huge. In actual fact, Adam Crafton discovered that no fewer than 145 compelled the world governing body to launch investigations in the aftermath of the Club World Cup.

The complaints related to a range of issues, from U.S. government enforcement and policies — many concerning controversial immigration laws — to the extreme weather that hampered the competition. Others concerned discrimination following an event in which FIFA abandoned plans for widespread anti-discrimination messaging.

FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, saw no evil over the summer, saying the Club World Cup passed without “one single incident”. If nothing else, at least the organisation now knows the invitation to the public to hold it to account will be accepted by more than a token few.

We're getting used to random celebrities appearing at random football games, so wrestler Bret ‘The Hitman' Hart sitting through Kaiserslautern versus Preussen Munster in Germany's second division last week was perfectly on trend.

I did laugh, though, at this question from a perplexed TV interviewer who collared the WWE hall of famer and, with no formalities, cut to the chase by asking: “Bret… what the hell are you doing here?”

An estimated 2.7 billion fans across the globe watched the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup, preliminary data shows.

Post-tournament analysis by Nielsen Sports shows the huge audience across all forms of media supplemented the 2.5 million supporters who attended the 63-match event held in the United States from June 14 till July 13, 2025.

English club Chelsea were crowned the world club champions after a 3–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final.

The audience analysis included those who watched games through DAZN – the competition's exclusive global broadcaster — sublicensees, other media, and at watch parties held around the world.

New Zealand fans were able to watch games streamed live and free through DAZN, including Auckland City's matches against Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.

Research showed 80% of football fans worldwide were aware the competition was taking place.

During the tournament, ‘FIFA Club World Cup' became the most searched-for term among sports competitions on search engine Google.

The tournament's official social media accounts gained nine million followers, and DAZN's social channels delivered more than 10 billion impressions.

DAZN streamed all 63 matches live and for free and achieved record reach and engagement throughout the tournament.

The global sports entertainment platform gave fans a transformative viewing experience that extended beyond live match broadcasts. Its digital-first coverage delivered premium and on-demand features, DAZN's unique interactive FanZone, and bespoke shoulder content.

As a result, 80% of viewers on DAZN also engaged with non-live content during the tournament, underscoring the growing appetite for immersive, multi-format football storytelling and DAZN's status as the premier destination for football content.

“These preliminary figures confirm that the FIFA Club World Cup has been a global success and a game-changer,” said FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström.

“From the incredible atmosphere in the stadiums in the United States to 2.7 billion people engaging around the world, the tournament has exceeded expectations. FIFA promised to take this tournament to the world, and there's no doubt that the world took to the tournament. We thank our global broadcast partner DAZN for their support in delivering this success.”

DAZN Group chief executive Shay Segev said: “The numbers demonstrate the extraordinary global appetite for accessible, high-quality football content. Our partnership with FIFA for the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 has set a new global benchmark for experiencing football and the tournament has shown just how powerful the sport can be when presented through a digital-first, fan-centric lens.

“Together with FIFA, we are proud to have set new standards for global reach and engagement and to have connected fans around the world to one of football's most exciting tournaments”.

As the exclusive global broadcaster, DAZN also sublicensed broadcast rights to a network of more than 100 partners worldwide. The linear figures from numerous individual markets show impressive results.

In Brazil, where all four teams progressed out of the groups and captured hearts on and off the field, reports show that more than 131 million people across the country watched the tournament on television — the equivalent of 62% of the population.

Brazilian network TV Globo recorded its three highest audiences of 2025 during the tournament. CR Flamengo's game against FC Bayern München was watched by 37.3 million people, while Palmeiras' games against Inter Miami CF and Botafogo recorded their second- and third-highest viewing figures of the year, respectively.

In Spain, 49% of the population (around 24 million people) watched the competition, while in Italy, 48% of the population (around 28 million people) tuned in.

In Portugal, it was reported that more than 60% of the population tuned in to watch the competition across DAZN and sublicensee TVI. The most popular match (between Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain) and the match between Inter Miami CF and FC Porto gave TVI its highest and second-highest ratings of 2025 at the time of broadcast, respectively.

In Saudi Arabia, fans flocked to their screens and devices to catch the action. The closely-fought match between Manchester City and Al Hilal achieved significant market share across the Kingdom, with 77.9% of people watching television at the time of broadcast tuning in.

In Argentina, the match between Boca Juniors and Benfica was watched by more than 9.1 million people, representing an audience share of 84.2% — the highest in the country since the 2023 CONMEBOL Libertadores final.

Meanwhile, their cross-city rivals River Plate recorded an 87% share of the entire television audience during their game against Monterrey.

Chelsea have made a shaky start to the season, winning 2 of their 6 games and with injury and fitness issues bubbling up already.

On the London is Blue podcast they discussed the issue, with presenter Dan Dormer pointing out that this was all very predictable – and perhaps even justified, given our performance at the Club World Cup.

“I'm not surprised that we're struggling at this moment,” he said.

“We didn't have a real preseason. We played later into the summer than any other team did. We did not necessarily buy a bunch of starters to come in and replace several of the players who had been playing a ton of football. Chelsea are behind in their conditioning and fitness relative to several other teams in the league. And you're seeing that in slower starts in games, and in starters needing to come in potentially at the end of a game to go and get a result.

“It's not necessarily a bad thing, considering what we did this summer, which was to go and win the Club World Cup. Not a lot of other teams in the world – none, in fact – are able to say that.”

While it's clear we didn't have a good preparation for the season and it could affect the rest of the campaign, at this stage we've played enough games that the players are all fit – in fact, some have played too much. We disagree that at this point we're significantly “behind” in conditioning – the problem will be later in the year when we're overplayed.

What's much more of a concern is what he says about our transfers – it's true that a lot of the players we bought are not “starter” quality.

That's fine in games like tonight's, where we face Lincoln, but becomes a problem in the Premier League when changing out team makes it weaker.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The English Football League Cup, known as the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons, is considered one of the major trophies in the English season.

Although lacking the prestige of the FA Cup and Premier League, the Carabao Cup is nonetheless a valued piece of silverware and a potential route into European football for the winners.

If not already qualified via other means, the Carabao Cup title winner earns a berth into the UEFA Conference League.

While the competition has been considered of secondary importance to some of the biggest sides over the years, it has taken on more prominence over the past two decades. Indeed, Birmingham City, Swansea City and Newcastle United — who triumphed in 2025 — are the only teams outside the Premier League's so-called ""big six"" to have won the EFL Cup since 2004.

Below, The Sporting News looks over the key dates for the 2025/26 tournament and lists the results and complete schedule.

MORE: Who has won the most EFL Cup trophies? | Date &amp; ball numbers for the upcoming draw

The EFL Cup (Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) features all 92 participating clubs from the top four tiers of English football: Premier League (20 clubs), Championship (24 clubs), League One (24), and League Two (24).

The Premier League clubs not involved in European cup competitions joined in the second round, and the remaining sides compete from the third round.

Every round is single-elimination except for the semifinals, which are played over two legs. There is no extra time up to and including the quarterfinals, with matches going straight to penalties if the score is level after 90 minutes.

However, extra time will be in effect for the semifinal second legs (no away goals tiebreaker) and the final, if necessary.

Below is the complete draw and results for third-round matches, which take place in the weeks beginning September 15 and September 22.

The Premier League clubs not competing in European competition this season entered the Carabao Cup at the second round. Below is the complete draw and results from those games.

Hello! Ousmane Dembele is the best men's player in the world. This time last year, we'd never have said that.

On the way:

🏆 Dembele's Ballon d'Or glory

✍️ 145 FIFA complaints

Advertisement

🇫🇷 An actual French title race?

🚪 Monchi exits in fresh Villa unrest

Ousmane Dembele spent almost a decade carrying the reputation of a busted flush. He was an overpriced error when Barcelona paid £88million ($118.8m) to buy him from Borussia Dortmund in 2017. He was equally dubious value when PSG gave him a route out of Barca by signing him for £42m six years later.

Dembele differed from Aitana Bonmati, the recipient of the women's Ballon d'Or last night for the third year running. Bonmati has been the best player in the world consistently. Dembele landing the men's trophy yesterday wrong-footed most of us. It's a deserved award, no question — just not an award in any way foretold.

Take this stat, for instance: last season, when Dembele scored 35 goals during PSG's surge to the Ligue 1 title, the Coupe de France and the Champions League, it was the first time in nine years that he'd hit double figures in a league campaign. You had to go back to Rennes in 2016 to find the previous instance. Dembele, as Tom Williams recalls, aspired to Lionel Messi standards of dribbling rather than Messi standards of finishing. And truth be told, he didn't light fires on either front.

Even in 2024-25, when with blinkered hindsight it feels like PSG could do no wrong, he was an awkward fit for parts of it. Luis Enrique dropped him for a Champions League tie at Arsenal after Dembele pitched up late for training. He got it in the ear again after a red card against Bayern Munich. Luis Enrique called that dismissal a “serious mistake” — a phrase which defined the money spent on Dembele all over.

But then it clicked: the 28-year-old surging towards and beyond the 30-goal mark, with 27 of them materialising in 22 games. Football won't remember him as its top men's player per se — Lamine Yamal, who came second last night, should ultimately make greater waves — but in one mesmerising purple patch, Dembele definitely was.

Luis Enrique impact, change in position



For all Luis Enrique's sporadic criticism of the forward, he's a long-time Dembele enthusiast. Their periods at Barca didn't overlap — the former stepped down as head coach in the summer when the latter joined — but the Spaniard had been following him at Rennes, convinced the hype around Dembele was worth taking seriously.

At PSG, in 2023, Luis Enrique went out and bought him — for a modest return initially. Dembele churned out three whole league goals in 2023-24, but the revelation last season — the first campaign for PSG with no out-and-out superstar such as Messi, Kylian Mbappe or Neymar — was his insertion as a false nine, the deep-lying centre forward role made fashionable by Messi in his pomp.

As Dembele got on a spectacular roll, his club did, too. It was almost a clean sweep for PSG in Paris yesterday. Beyond the main prize, Luis Enrique was named coach of the year, PSG took the team of the year prize, and Gianluigi Donnarumma (since departed for Manchester City) picked up the Yashin Trophy as best goalkeeper. There was no arguing with any of it.

But Dembele it was who took centre stage and crowned a glorious renaissance. All it took was him finding the sweet spot of a coach who believed in him, a position that suited him, and the departure of superstars who were otherwise suffocating him. Nobody saw those stars aligning, and perhaps Dembele least of all.

🏆 We've got the full list of winners from the 2025 awards for you. It's a rare year when the men's top 30 looks just about right. And in Full Time, our women's soccer newsletter, Tamerra Griffin asks if Bonmati was actually Ballon d'Or-worthy.

While PSG killed it on stage in Paris, they could have done with Dembele and others elsewhere. A postponed trip to Marseille in Ligue 1 ended in a 1-0 loss, courtesy of Nayef Aguerd's scrappy header (above), tempting the division to think — and whisper this extremely quietly — that it might have a title race on its hands.

Luis Enrique's line-up fell well short of full strength, and it showed. Dembele is injured and several weeks short of a comeback (he streamed footage from Marseille at the Ballon d'Or ceremony). Desire Doue has fitness problems, too, and with Bradley Barcola also out, Achraf Hakimi pushed up into PSG's front three, embarking on a fruitless shift. Hakimi might be “more than a full-back”, as we once wrote, but he has some natural limits.

Advertisement

Ligue 1, therefore, looks like this: Monaco top by virtue of goals scored, level on 12 points with PSG, Lyon and Strasbourg. I'm not deluded; the cavalry will return for PSG soon enough, and they'll still win the league most likely. But what harm in clubs around them being made to feel like it's worth turning up?

When FIFA set up a portal for the submission of human rights complaints, it must have hoped the influx would not be huge. In actual fact, Adam Crafton discovered that no fewer than 145 compelled the world governing body to launch investigations in the aftermath of the Club World Cup.

The complaints related to a range of issues, from U.S. government enforcement and policies — many concerning controversial immigration laws — to the extreme weather that hampered the competition. Others concerned discrimination following an event in which FIFA abandoned plans for widespread anti-discrimination messaging.

FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, saw no evil over the summer, saying the Club World Cup passed without “one single incident”. If nothing else, at least the organisation now knows the invitation to the public to hold it to account will be accepted by more than a token few.

We're getting used to random celebrities appearing at random football games, so wrestler Bret ‘The Hitman' Hart sitting through Kaiserslautern versus Preussen Munster in Germany's second division last week was perfectly on trend.

I did laugh, though, at this question from a perplexed TV interviewer who collared the WWE hall of famer and, with no formalities, cut to the chase by asking: “Bret… what the hell are you doing here?”

Home » Libertarian Think Tank Backs Dynamic Pricing in FIFA World Cup Ticket Debate

The CATO Institute is defending FIFA's decision to use dynamic pricing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, calling the move “fair play” in a new commentary.

The libertarian think tank argued that allowing ticket prices to rise and fall with demand is an efficient way to allocate scarce seats for one of the world's most in-demand sporting events. The 2026 tournament — the first to expand to 48 teams — is expected to draw record crowds across 16 host cities in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.

| READ: From $60 to More Than $6K: FIFA's Dynamic Pricing Plan for 2026 World Cup Tickets |

FIFA confirmed that while some tickets will remain at set prices, most will vary based on demand, similar to pricing systems used in concerts and major U.S. sports leagues. Critics, including New York City mayor-in-waiting Zohran Mamdani, have denounced the policy as “greed,” launching petitions to impose caps.

In its piece, CATO countered that fixed pricing would lead to shortages and misallocation, while dynamic pricing allows fans who value the experience most to secure seats — and noted that prices can decrease for less popular matchups.

While consumer groups have long warned that dynamic pricing can push events out of reach for average fans, CATO maintained that market-based pricing combined with FIFA's official resale platform offers a “sensible” solution to distribute tickets fairly.

The Cato Institute, grounded in free-market philosophy, frames FIFA's dynamic pricing strategy for the 2026 World Cup as a legitimate, even laudable move — one that reflects economic realities and promises to shift more surplus value back toward organizers rather than resellers. But whether fans and local regulators will see it as “fair play” depends largely on how openly FIFA communicates its pricing methodology, how steep the demand-based price increases are, and whether protections (for lower-income or local fans) are baked in.

Marcus Rashford risks blowing unique chance to supercharge his career at Barcelona if he keeps repeating Man Utd mistakes","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/marcus-rashford-risks-blowing-barcelona-chance-repeating-man-utd-mistakes/blt78fbf25dce11e8b5","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 11:23:27 GMT","

When Marcus Rashford was unveiled as a new Barcelona signing in August, he kept coming back to one word: discipline. For a player who had missed training after going on a drunken night out in Belfast a year ago and been forced out of Manchester United by Ruben Amorim for his lack of application, it was an intriguing theme for him to draw upon.

He appeared to be saying that he was ready for this new challenge and had put all his past misdemeanours behind him. ""It's one thing to say you're motivated and determined, but these are things that you know can change day to day, depending on how you're feeling,"" he said. 

""But really, the thing that I bring back to my life, not just the sport, is the discipline. And, you know, discipline is something that stays regardless of whether you wake up and you don't feel like it on a given day. Discipline is the thing that keeps you going.""

However, little more than a month into his loan spell at Barca, Rashford has already shown a lack of discipline after arriving late for a team meeting. 

He was only two minutes late and he is not the first Barca player to have been punished for tardiness by Hansi Flick but the infraction cost him a place in the starting line-up for Barca's game against Getafe, ruining the chance for him to kick on after his tremendous performance against Newcastle.

If Rashford is not careful, then, he risks blowing the incredible chance he has been given to revitalise his career at one of the greatest clubs in the world.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Alejandro Tabilo saved two championship points on Tuesday at the Chengdu Open, where he overcame top seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 2-6, 7-6(5) to capture his third ATP Tour title and first of the season.

The Chilean qualifier saved two championship points on serve at 5-6 in the third set and then rallied from 1/4 in the deciding-set tie-break to become the second-lowest-ranked ATP Tour champion this season.

“I just had to stay there mentally and physically,” Tabilo said. “I was so happy to make those first serves on match points. It was an incredible effort from the team also. It has been a long two weeks and I am just so happy.”

Tabilo lost his opening six matches of the year and missed two months of the European clay swing due to a wrist injury. Arriving in Chengdu with a 5-13 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Tabilo found his best level to triumph at the ATP 250 event.



In a tight final against Musetti, Tabilo struck eight fewer winners (29-37) and committed 21 more unforced errors (44-23) than the Italian, but found the bigger shots down the home straight to record victory after two hours and 37 minutes in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

Musetti was aiming to capture his first tour-level title since Naples in 2022, but failed to convert his opportunities in the third set. Tabilo saved the first match point with a forehand winner and the second when Musetti hit long off a rally ball. Tabilo sealed victory on his first match point, with his girlfriend and team rushing onto court after he sealed his third Top 10 win.

Tabilo is now a three-time tour-level titlist, having won in Auckland and Mallorca last year. He is up 40 spots to No. 72 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and is set to return to the Top 100 for the first time since June.

Musetti leaves Chengdu up one spot in seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. The Italian is aiming to make his debut on home soil at the Nitto ATP Finals in November and join countryman Jannik Sinner, who has already qualified for the prestigious year-end event.

Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler captured their second title of the season on Tuesday at the Lynk & Co Hangzhou Open.

The top seeds moved past Nicolas Barrientos and David Pel 6-4, 6-4 in the championship match, during which they saved the only break point they faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. With their victory, Cabral and Miedler improved to 22-11 as a team after making their debut in Marrakech in April this year.

“Thanks for another great week. We've been doing great things,” Cabral said to his team. “I'm very, very happy about our second title, and there are still a few tournaments to go until the end of the year, so we're just happy to get the chance to play again in Tokyo next week.”

By claiming his fourth tour-level title, Cabral tied Joao Sousa (4 in singles) for most ATP Tour trophies by a Portuguese man in the Open Era. Cabral and Miedler are up three spots to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings.



Frantzen/Haase triumph in Chengdu
Constantin Frantzen and Robin Haase won their first title as a team on Tuesday at the Chengdu Open, where they rallied past Vasil Kirkov and Bart Stevens 4-6, 6-3, 10-7.

After making their team debut in Gstaad in July, the German-Dutch duo is now 8-3 at tour-level. They saved two match points in their first-round clash against Rohan Bopanna and Takeru Yuzuki before sealing their championship-match victory in 78 minutes.

“Thank you Robin for playing with me, for picking up the phone two weeks ago,” Frantzen, who captured his first tour-level title, said to Haase. “I'm very happy that I called you. It's my first title and I'm very happy to do it here in Chengdu.”

The 38-year-old Haase, now a 10-time ATP Tour doubles champion, is the second-oldest Chengdu champion after 40-year-old Jonathan Erlich in 2017.

 There has been no shortage of iconic winners throughout the history of the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships. 

 Of the 29 No. 1s in PIF ATP Rankings history, 12 have lifted the trophy at the Tokyo hard-court event since it was first held in 1972. Five members of the ATP No. 1 Club — Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — triumphed at least once in the Japanese capital while competing as World No. 1. 

 Recently returned to top spot following his US Open triumph, Carlos Alcaraz will this year aim to join that stacked list when he makes his Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships debut. Ahead of the 2025 edition of the ATP 500, ATPTour.com reflects on the No. 1s that have gone all the way in Tokyo.

 Record Holder Edberg 
No man has had more success on the hard courts of Tokyo than Stefan Edberg. The Swede racked up a record four titles and 27 match wins across six appearances at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships. After his victories in 1987, 1989 and 1990, Edberg competed as World No. 1 in Japan for the first time in 1991, and he lived up to his newfound status with another commanding run to the trophy. 

 The then-25-year-old Edberg defeated two fellow members of the ATP No. 1 Club in three sets — Jimmy Connors (in the third round) and Ivan Lendl (in the final) — to clinch his fourth and final Tokyo crown. He also overcame Michael Stich and Michael Chang in straight sets en route to becoming the first reigning No. 1 to win the title in tournament history. 

 Sampras Takes Over 
Tokyo holds a special place in Pete Sampras' career. In 1993, the American's maiden title run in Japan sealed his rise to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time. Sampras made just two other appearances at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, in 1994 and 1996, both as World No. 1. He lifted the trophy each time and remains the only man to have won the Tokyo event twice while atop the PIF ATP Rankings. 

 Sampras defeated a fellow American in each of his three Tokyo finals. In 1993 he downed Brad Gilbert to ensure he would become World No. 1 the next day, 12 April. A year later, Sampras defended his title by sinking then-No. 9 Michael Chang, while in 1996 he saw off Richey Reneberg in the championship match to close his Tokyo career with a perfect 15-0 record.

 Federer's Tokyo Moment 
Federer may have only made one appearance in Tokyo, but the Swiss icon certainly made the most of his time in the Japanese capital in 2006. He dropped just one set — to Japanese wild card Takao Suzuki in the quarter-finals — en route to his ninth title of a standout year. 

 Competing in the heart of his still-record 237 consecutive weeks as No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Federer eased past Tim Henman in the championship match to seal the trophy. It was the last of 13 Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings between the two players, and Federer's Tokyo triumph ensured he held a 7-6 lead when Henman retired in late 2007.

Rafa Reigns 
Like his great rival Federer, Nadal made quite an impact upon arriving for his maiden Tokyo campaign as World No. 1. The Spaniard lit up the 2010 edition of the ATP 500 with a series of commanding performances and he began by downing Go Soeda, Milos Raonic and Santiago Giraldo in straight sets. 

 His semi-final against Viktor Troicki was a different story. Nadal was forced to save two match points in the third-set tie-break before escaping with a 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(7) triumph. That proved to be the lefty's biggest hurdle that week in Tokyo, where he subsequently eased past Gael Monfils 6-1, 7-5 to claim the trophy. A year later, the then-No. 2-ranked Nadal again reached the championship match, where he fell to Andy Murray, in what would prove to be his final Tokyo appearance.

 Djokovic Shines 
Djokovic ensured that each member of the ‘Big Three' triumphed on Tokyo debut with an imperious run in 2019. The Serbian World No. 1 only dropped more than four games in a set once across five matches in Japan to bounce back impressively from the shoulder injury that had forced him to withdraw during his fourth-round match at the US Open a month earlier. 

 Quickly acclimatising to conditions at the Ariake Coliseum, Djokovic motored past Alexei Popyrin, Soeda, Lucas Pouille, David Goffin and John Millman to claim his Tokyo title.

 Can Carlos Join The Club? 
Could Alcaraz be the sixth reigning World No. 1 to triumph in Tokyo? The Spaniard will certainly arrive in good shape. He is 23-4 for the season on outdoor hard courts, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, although he will be wary of a strong cast of rivals in Japan that includes former champion Taylor Fritz as well as Holger Rune, Casper Ruud and Frances Tiafoe.

Jannik Sinner will face Marin Cilic at the China Open in his first appearance since his US Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz. The top-seeded Italian leads the field in Beijing and learned his fate following Tuesday's draw.

Sinner has fond memories at the ATP 500 hard-court event, having lifted the trophy in 2023. The 24-year-old, 37-5 on the season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, will meet 2011 finalist Cilic in his opener and could play home wild card Zhang Zhizhen in the second round.

World No. 10 Karen Khachanov is Sinner's seeded quarter-final opponent and he might face third seed Alex de Minaur or seventh seed Jakub Mensik in the semi-finals. De Minaur, chasing his second ATP 500 title of the season (Washington), begins against China's Buyunchaokete, while Miami titlist Mensik plays Miomir Kecmanovic in the first round.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are among the sport's biggest stars who are in action this week. 

The Spaniard leads the field at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open Tennis Championships, where Taylor Fritz is seeded second in Tokyo. Sinner returns to the China Open in Beijing, where five Top-10 players are set to compete, including Alexander Zverev.

The two ATP 500 events also serve as a pivotal period for Nitto ATP Finals hopefuls seeking to amass as many PIF ATP Ranking points as possible, with aspirations of qualifying for the season finale in Turin.

ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event:

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN TOKYO:
1) Alcaraz makes event debut: Tokyo, the longest-running ATP Tour tournament in Asia, will welcome the World No. 1 Alcaraz for the first time. The winner of seven titles this year, Alcaraz boasts a season-leading 61-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He will look to strengthen his claim as World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, a position he reclaimed following his US Open triumph.

2) Former champ Fritz: The American holds fond memories in Tokyo, where in 2022 he secured his Top 10 debut following a title run in Japan's capital city. Now World No. 5, Fritz is bidding for his third title of 2025 (Stuttgart, Eastbourne), which would match his career-best title haul in a year, tying his 2022 season.




3) Turin outsiders: With less than two months until the Nitto ATP Finals, every week is extraordinarily crucial for those outside the top eight in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin vying for a spot at the prestigious tournament. For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event.
4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively. Each of those players, besides Tiafoe, have won at least one title this season and seek to add to their trophy cabinet in Tokyo. Shapovalov, who won the ATP 500 in Dallas and Acapulco, is competing for the first time since marrying longtime partner Mirjam Bjorklund.
5) Top seeds Harrison/King seek third ATP 500 crown this year: At eighth in the PIF Live Doubles Race To Turin, Christian Harrison and Evan King are seeking a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, a prize that would reward their dream season. At the ATP 500s in Dallas and Acapulco, the Americans advanced through qualifying en route to lifting the trophy. But gone is the role of underdog, Harrison and King are the Tokyo top seeds.

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BEIJING:
1) Sinner returns, seeking third title of 2025: In action for the first time since his runner-up finish at the US Open, Sinner is back in Beijing for the third consecutive year, amassing a 9-1 record in his previous two outings. Last year, the Italian narrowly fell to rival Alcaraz in one of the most memorable matches of the 2024 season. Sinner will aim to go one step further and return to the winner's circle, which he reached in 2023.
2) Three-time semi-finalist Zverev: The German is making his sixth appearance in Beijing and just his second since 2020. Zverev has routinely gone deep in those outings, including three semi-final runs. The second seed leads Sinner 4-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and could have another showdown with the Italian in the championship match.

3) Top 10 stars: The Beijing field is stacked with five Top-10 players, including Sinner, Zverev, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov. De Minaur was a quarter-finalist at the season's final major. Musetti arrives after a strong start to the Asian hard-court swing in Chengdu. Khachanov, No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is closing in on tying his career-high No. 8, which he reached in July 2019.
4) Fan favourites Rublev, Medvedev and Bublik: Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev are among the seeded players at the ATP 500. Rublev, a two-time quarter-finalist in Beijing, won an ATP 500 hard-court title earlier this year in Doha. Medvedev reached the Beijing final in 2023 and semi-finals last year. Ahead of Hangzhou, Medvedev shared that he is working with a new team, consisting of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. Alexander Bublik is also in Beijing. The Kazakh has been one of the most in-form players the past three months, arriving in Beijing following his Hangzhou run.
5) Turin-bound doubles teams: The doubles draw in Beijing features a handful of must-watch pairings. Wimbledon champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who have won six titles together this year and have qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, lead the field. Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic have also qualified for Turin and will be in action in Beijing. Several singles stars are in the field, including Rublev partnering Khachanov, De Minaur teaming Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Musetti, Bublik and more.

Rublev, a two-time quarter-finalist in Beijing, won an ATP 500 hard-court title earlier this year in Doha. Medvedev reached the Beijing final in 2023 and semi-finals last year. Ahead of Hangzhou, Medvedev shared that he is working with a new team, consisting of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. Alexander Bublik is also in Beijing. The Kazakh has been one of the most in-form players the past three months, arriving in Beijing following his Hangzhou run.
5) Turin-bound doubles teams: The doubles draw in Beijing features a handful of must-watch pairings. Wimbledon champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who have won six titles together this year and have qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, lead the field. Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic have also qualified for Turin and will be in action in Beijing. Several singles stars are in the field, including Rublev partnering Khachanov, De Minaur teaming Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Musetti, Bublik and more.

3) Turin outsiders: With less than two months until the Nitto ATP Finals, every week is extraordinarily crucial for those outside the top eight in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin vying for a spot at the prestigious tournament. For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event.

4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively. Each of those players, besides Tiafoe, have won at least one title this season and seek to add to their trophy cabinet in Tokyo. Shapovalov, who won the ATP 500 in Dallas and Acapulco, is competing for the first time since marrying longtime partner Mirjam Bjorklund.

5) Top seeds Harrison/King seek third ATP 500 crown this year: At eighth in the PIF Live Doubles Race To Turin, Christian Harrison and Evan King are seeking a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, a prize that would reward their dream season. At the ATP 500s in Dallas and Acapulco, the Americans advanced through qualifying en route to lifting the trophy. But gone is the role of underdog, Harrison and King are the Tokyo top seeds.




FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN BEIJING:
1) Sinner returns, seeking third title of 2025: In action for the first time since his runner-up finish at the US Open, Sinner is back in Beijing for the third consecutive year, amassing a 9-1 record in his previous two outings. Last year, the Italian narrowly fell to rival Alcaraz in one of the most memorable matches of the 2024 season. Sinner will aim to go one step further and return to the winner's circle, which he reached in 2023.

2) Three-time semi-finalist Zverev: The German is making his sixth appearance in Beijing and just his second since 2020. Zverev has routinely gone deep in those outings, including three semi-final runs. The second seed leads Sinner 4-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and could have another showdown with the Italian in the championship match.

3) Top 10 stars: The Beijing field is stacked with five Top-10 players, including Sinner, Zverev, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov. De Minaur was a quarter-finalist at the season's final major. Musetti arrives after a strong start to the Asian hard-court swing in Chengdu. Khachanov, No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is closing in on tying his career-high No. 8, which he reached in July 2019.

4) Fan favourites Rublev, Medvedev and Bublik: Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev are among the seeded players at the ATP 500.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Beijing draw: Zheng returns from injury; in same section as Mboko, Tauson","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4367229/beijing-draw-zheng-returns-from-injury-in-same-section-as-mboko-tauson","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 08:37:30 GMT","

Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.

Note: No. 11 seed Elina Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into Svitolina's position as the No. 33 seed. Bianca Andreescu, Linette's original first-round opponent, will now face qualifier Anna Bondar.

The draw for the China Open, the ninth WTA 1000 event of 2025, is out. Iga Swiatek, fresh off her third title of the year in Seoul, is the No. 1 seed, while defending champion Coco Gauff is No. 2. Another key storyline will be the return to action of hometown hero Zheng Qinwen, playing her first tournament since undergoing right elbow surgery in July.

Beijing: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Zheng, the No. 7 seed, has not competed since her first-round exit at Wimbledon to Katerina Siniakova. She will open against either Suzan Lamens, a quarterfinalist last week in Seoul, or compatriot Wang Yafan. Her section of the draw doesn't get any easier from there: the 22-year-old is projected to face No. 26 seed Linda Noskova in the third round. Potential fourth-round opponents include No. 10 seed Clara Tauson, Montreal champion and No. 21 seed Victoria Mboko and Siniakova.

The 32 seeded players all have first-round byes. Swiatek will start against either Yulia Putintseva or wild card Yuan Yue, while Gauff will face either Kamilla Rakhimova or Lucia Bronzetti.

Two former major champions are unseeded threats in the draw as they also make their way back from injury layoffs. Barbora Krejcikova takes on Anna Blinkova in her opener, with the winner to play Seoul finalist and No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova. Meanwhile, Bianca Andreescu returns to action for the first time since injuring her ankle in Montreal a month ago. The Canadian faces a qualifier or lucky loser, with No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermetova awaiting the winner.

Australian Open champion Madison Keys joined US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on the sidelines, withdrawing from the tournament on Monday due to injury.

Projected fourth-round matchups

[1] Iga Swiatek vs. [16] Emma Navarro[12] Naomi Osaka vs. [5] Jessica Pegula[4] Mirra Andreeva vs. [14] Daria Kasatkina[10] Clara Tauson vs. [7] Zheng Qinwen[6] Jasmine Paolini vs. [24] Veronika Kudermetova[13] Karolina Muchova vs. [3] Amanda Anisimova[8] Elena Rybakina vs. [9] Ekaterina Alexandrova[15] Belinda Bencic vs. [2] Coco Gauff

Here's how the draw breaks down by quarter:

First quarter

Swiatek is projected to face No. 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round, No. 16 seed Emma Navarro in the fourth round and No. 5 seed Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals. The Pole is one of three former champions in the draw, and is bidding to reclaim the title she previously won in 2023. The player she defeated in that year's final, No. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova, is another potential last-16 opponent.

Pegula's section is one of the most intriguing in the draw. She is projected to meet No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu, who will be making her tournament debut, in the third round; she currently owns a 2-1 head-to-head lead over the Briton, including 2-0 on hard courts. Whoever emerges from that tussle could face either 2019 champion Naomi Osaka, the No. 12 seed, or No. 23 seed Marta Kostyuk in the last 16. Osaka has been resurgent over the past two months, reaching the Montreal final and US Open semifinals to rocket back into the Top 20.

First-round matches to watch: Ann Li vs. Camila Osorio, Rebecca Sramkova vs. Elena-Gabriela Ruse, [Q] Aliaksandra Sasnovich vs. [Q] Janice Tjen, Magdalena Frech vs. [Q] Ella Seidel

Second quarter

After winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva solidified her Top 5 status by compiling a 31-8 record this year through Roland Garros. Since then, the 18-year-old's results have been quieter: she's 7-5 since Roland Garros, and just 2-2 since Wimbledon. The No. 4 seed in Beijing, where she was a quarterfinalist last year, Andreeva will open against either qualifier Moyuka Uchijima or wild card Zhu Lin. She'll have to navigate a section that includes big-hitting No. 29 seed Dayana Yastremska in a potential third round.

In the last 16, Andreeva could face either No. 14 seed Daria Kasatkina or her regular doubles partner, No. 17 seed Diana Shnaider -- two more players in need of a deep run at the close of the season, given their respective season records of 19-21 and 24-21. Shnaider could face a tricky opener against fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint, who made her first career WTA 500 semifinal last week in Seoul. The Australian teenager opens against qualifier Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva in a rematch from the US Open first round, which Joint won in two tight sets.

Zheng has a mixed record against the young talents in her section. She's 2-0 against Noskova, but has yet to defeat Tauson in two meetings -- once in juniors and once in pros. Meanwhile, Mboko joins Raducanu as a player who is making her debut in Beijing as a seed. This time last year, the 19-year-old Canadian was ranked No. 356; now, she's a WTA 1000 champion on the verge of the Top 20. Mboko will bid to notch her first win since lifting the Montreal trophy against either Siniakova or Anastasia Potapova.

First-round matches to watch: Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. Jaqueline Cristian, [Q] Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva vs. Maya Joint, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [WC] Wei Sijia, Katerina Siniakova vs. Anastasia Potapova, Suzan Lamens vs. [SR] Wang Yafan

Third quarter

Fresh off leading Italy to a successful defense of their Billie Jean King Cup title last week, No. 6 seed Jasmine Paolini enters Beijing on a high. She could face a tricky opponent off the bat, though -- 2018 runner-up Anastasija Sevastova, whom she barely escaped in three sets at Wimbledon. Sevastova's ranking is still down at No. 221, but since returning from an ACL injury in April the Latvian has already scored wins over Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko. She'll need to defeat Kimberly Birrell in the first round to set up a rematch against Paolini.

Paolini's route doesn't get any easier after that. She's projected to face No. 27 seed Sofia Kenin -- against whom she has yet to win a set in three meetings -- in the third round. Kenin is searching for some form -- the 2020 Australian Open champion hasn't won back-to-back main-draw matches since Roland Garros -- but throughout her career has a track record of hitting her hot streaks with little warning.

In the last 16, Paolini could resume her rivalry with No. 11 Elina Svitolina -- a matchup that has provided some thrilling contests this year. Svitolina got the better of Paolini twice on the Grand Slam stage in three-setters at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, but Paolini managed to notch her first win in the series last week at the Billie Jean King Cup. To get there, Svitolina will have to navigate a section that contains Andreescu, Veronika Kudermetova and Tatjana Maria.

(Note: Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into her position as the No. 33 seed. No. 24 seed Kudermetova is now projected to meet Paolini in the fourth round.)

The third quarter is led by No. 3 seed Amanda Anisimova, competing for the first time since reaching her second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open. The American will play her first match as a Top 5 player against either Hailey Baptiste or Katie Boulter, and is projected to face home favorite and No. 31 seed Wang Xinyu in the third round.

A potential fourth-round meeting between Anisimova and No. 13 seed Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up, could make for a fascinating stylistic clash. The pair have only played once previously, with Anisimova advancing via retirement at Roland Garros 2022.

First-round matches to watch: [Q] Anna Bondar vs. Bianca Andreescu, Tatjana Maria vs. Marie Bouzkova, [Q] Anastasia Zakharova vs. [WC] Zhang Shuai, Katie Boulter vs. Hailey Baptiste

Fourth quarter

Gauff's up-and-down form in 2025 has seen the American at her gritty best during the clay swing, which culminated in her second major title at Roland Garros -- but also fail to reach a final on any other surface, with her service yips returning to afflict her during the North American hard court swing. She's projected to face No. 25 seed Leylah Fernandez, whom she has a 2-0 head-to-head lead over, in the third round. In the last 16, Gauff could then meet either No. 15 seed Belinda Bencic or No. 22 seed Jelena Ostapenko, both of whom have also struggled for form in recent months after standout results earlier in 2025. Since reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, Bencic's record is just 2-3, while Ostapenko has won just three out of nine matches since Roland Garros.

No. 8 seed Elena Rybakina has landed in a section full of dangerous opponents. The big-serving Kazakhstani will have to be prepared to take on a barrage of variety in her opener against either Wimbledon quarterfinalist Laura Siegemund or Caty McNally, two players with net-rushing instincts and every shot in the book. Rybakina is 6-1 overall against Siegemund, but was forced to retire in her only previous meeting with McNally.

In the third round, Rybakina is projected to face Iva Jovic, the 17-year-old who was ranked outside the Top 100 in June but who has surged into the No. 32 seed spot here after capturing her first WTA title in Guadalajara two weeks ago. Despite Jovic's inexperience -- Beijing will be just her 11th tour-level event -- this is already a familiar matchup for her; Rybakina defeated her in straight sets at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year.

Two-time major champion Krejcikova's return from a back injury this year has been riveting to watch -- not least due to the number of unlikely comebacks the Czech has pulled off. Since June, she's won from match points down on four separate occasions, the latest of those being an escape from 6-4, 5-2 down against Raducanu last week in Seoul. If Krejcikova's second-round clash against Alexandrova happens, it could be one to circle; with a 41-20 record so far, Alexandrova is quietly putting together a career-best season, and the 30-year-old could be eyeing a Top 10 debut in the closing two months. Alexandrova has a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Krejcikova, though they have not played since 2021.

Whoever emerges from that match could have to face either No. 20 seed Elise Mertens or McCartney Kessler -- both two-time titlists this year -- in order to reach a potential last-16 meeting with Rybakina.

First-round matches to watch: Laura Siegemund vs. Caty McNally, Barbora Krejcikova vs. Anna Blinkova, Ashlyn Krueger vs. Maria Sakkari

Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar reflect on scoring points for Racing Bulls in Baku, a result that saw them rise up to sixth in the Teams' Standings.

Liam Lawson was left with mixed feelings in the wake of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after failing to convert a P3 grid slot into a maiden podium for Racing Bulls, despite still scoring his career best F1 result with an impressive fifth.

With team mate Isack Hadjar also finishing in the top 10, it proved to be a strong weekend for Racing Bulls who were able to jump above Aston Martin into P6 in the Teams' Championship.

However, for Lawson, fifth was realistically the best he could have hoped for despite securing a superb third-place start on the grid in Saturday's chaotic Qualifying session in Baku. Starting ahead of both Mercedes cars for the Sunday's race, with both proving to be very quick in the cooler conditions, Lawson was forced on the defence from word go, with Kimi Antonelli in DRS range of his car for the first stint.

When the teenager boxed, Lawson then had to contend with George Russell hunting him down behind.

Pitting to get rid of his mediums, Lawson came out just ahead of Antonelli – but he soon lost out to the Mercedes man, whose tyres were already up to temperature.

He was also jumped by Russell who ran a very long first stint to enact the overcut on his way to an eventual second place, but did well in the closing stages without DRS to keep a gaggle of cars including the Red Bull of Yuki Tsunoda behind.

“I think rewarding after the last 10 or 15 laps, it was pretty intense,” Lawson explained. “Obviously, it is a little bit disappointing from where we are starting and realistically we didn't have the speed to fight with the guys in front today.

“But you're always hopeful. And we tried everything today, but there just wasn't quite enough, but still to have a P5 is big for us, especially in the Championship right now. Yeah, massive thanks to the team, we have had a good car all weekend and happy to come home with some points.”

Lawson's drive was particularly impressive considering how much pressure he was under throughout the race, with Antonelli the only driver able to overtake him on the track. The Kiwi star does not have a confirmed seat on the grid for next year either – so bagging his best F1 finish was a timely result.

“Honestly I think it is the best we had today,” he concluded.

As for Hadjar, his race almost ground to a halt before it had even begun when a hydraulics issue was detected on his way to the grid. The team did a great job to fix the problem so he could start the race, but the rookie ran into problems at a very early stage.

“I had a really good start, went by Lando [Norris] into Turn 2, and I made a mistake on the Safety Car restart and lost two places,"" he said. ""And from there the momentum was just not very good, the pace on the medium was not great.

“But then moving onto the hard, the pace was amazing and we were catching the group ahead quite fast but not enough to go and have a go.”

Hadjar eventually wound up 10th behind Charles Leclerc, which was all the more impressive considering he had struggled compared to his team mate across every session in Baku.

“I had a really bad feeling this weekend with the car, I wasn't comfortable and still somehow, we went to Q3, double score finish,"" he continued. ""So yeah, gives me a lot of positives that when I'm going to feel good inside that car, we are going to deliver way better.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's mistakes in Baku

2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Another slow pit stop costs Norris crucial time

Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson found the perfect gap in the Qualifying chaos to earn a top three start.

Liam Lawson achieved the best Qualifying result of his Formula 1 career ahead of the Azerbaijan Grand Prix as he capitalised on the chaos of the session to take third position.

The Racing Bulls driver will join Carlos Sainz in the top three on the grid tomorrow after clocking early fast laps in Q3, with Max Verstappen the only driver who could beat the midfield teams to pole position.

After four red flags across Q1 and Q2, Lawson was one of the first out on track in Q3 and managed to set a lap before Ferrari's Charles Leclerc slammed into the wall just a few minutes in.

While his car was recovered, light rain made the track surface more slippery, and everyone struggled to find grip once they returned to the circuit. This culminated in Oscar Piastri crashing into the barrier with 3m 41s remaining, leaving just one opportunity for the drivers to improve their times.

“Honestly I can't even remember what happened, it was so busy,” Lawson summarised. “I didn't expect it to be like that, honestly. The car has been good all weekend and when it needed to be in Quali, it was good so a massive thanks to the guys and girls. The team's been amazing this weekend so far, but obviously tomorrow is the important day.

“It's always sketchy because you see the rain coming on your visor and you can feel it, and you can kind of see the gloss on the track, but because the tyres are still warm you have grip. You're trying to fight your brain and not back off and keep pushing. It's definitely tricky.

“It's going to be a very hard race. We have a great starting position but obviously we're aware of who we're fighting around us, and that's what we're focused on.”

Verstappen was not the only driver to jump up the timesheets as both Mercedes, Yuki Tsunoda, and Lando Norris cut down their times marginally, demoting Hadjar to eighth place by the end of the disrupted session.

Having made his mark as a rookie with consistently impressive Qualifying results, he was underwhelmed by his performance, especially with his team mate shining in the top three.

He said: “It was tricky. We handled it perfectly until the final corner of the final lap. That's it. The car is fast, but we are not supposed to be starting eighth.”

An ACLU open letter supporting free speech and condemning Kimmel's suspension draws the support of a long list of Hollywood luminaries. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	Hundreds of Hollywood celebrities have signed an open letter by the American Civil Liberties Union supporting free speech and condemning Disney's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel Live!


	The letter states that efforts to pressure artists, journalists and others with retaliation for their speech “strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.” The message closes by calling on all Americans to fight to defend our right to speak freely.




	Some of the signatories (full list of names below) include Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short and Kerry Washington.

					Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers React to Jimmy Kimmel Returning After ABC Lifts Suspension: ""Late Nightmare Is Over""		
			









	One of the names listed is Pedro Pascal, whose trailer for The Mandalorian and Grogu Star Wars movie was released this morning by Disney. 


	“We now find ourselves in a modern McCarthy era, facing exactly the type of heavy-handed government censorship our Constitution rightfully forbids,” said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU, which organized the letter. “The silencing of Jimmy Kimmel and jawboning of media outlets through lawsuits and threats to their licenses evoke dark memories of the 1950s. We must remember, however, that Senator McCarthy was ultimately disgraced and neutralized once Americans mobilized and stood up to him. We must do the same today because together, our voices are louder and together, we will fight to be heard.”

	











	Kimmel was suspended following a comment in his monologue about MAGA's reaction to the murder of Charlie Kirk that went viral and FCC chairman Brendan Carr threatened affiliate broadcast licenses if they did not “take action” against the talk show host. Carr's threat was followed by affiliate owners Nexstar and Sinclair says they would preempt the show, which spurred ABC to suspend Kimmel “indefinitely.”


	The move by the FCC and ABC has been followed by widespread condemnation — even among some Republican leaders such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — and pledges to boycott Disney and its subsidiaries.


	Here is the letter and the full list of names: 


	“We the people must never accept government threats to our freedom of speech. Efforts by leaders to pressure artists, journalists, and companies with retaliation for their speech strike at the heart of what it means to live in a free country.


	Last week, Jimmy Kimmel was taken off the air after the government threatened a private company with retaliation, marking a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation. In an attempt to silence its critics, our government has resorted to threatening the livelihoods of journalists, talk show hosts, artists, creatives, and entertainers across the board. This runs counter to the values our nation was built upon, and our Constitution guarantees.


	We know this moment is bigger than us and our industry. Teachers, government employees, law firms, researchers, universities, students and so many more are also facing direct attacks on their freedom of expression.

	











	Regardless of our political affiliation, or whether we engage in politics or not, we all love our country. We also share the belief that our voices should never be silenced by those in power — because if it happens to one of us, it happens to all of us.


	This is the moment to defend free speech across our nation. We encourage all Americans to join us, along with the ACLU, in the fight to defend and preserve our constitutionally protected rights.”

The preemption means that 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will remain unavailable for some of the U.S. despite its return after a nearly weeklong suspension.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Jimmy Kimmel may be returning to ABC Tuesday night, but his show will remain dark in a large swath of the U.S., with Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar saying that they will preempt the show.


	“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming,” the company said in a statement Monday. “Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return.”




	“We made a decision last week to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse,” Nexstar added Tuesday morning. “We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve. In the meantime, we note that Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”

					'The View' Addresses Jimmy Kimmel Suspension -- and Why the Show Didn't Discuss It Sooner		
			









	The Walt Disney Co. said Monday that Kimmel would return to the air after his nearly weeklong suspension.


	“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” the Bob Iger-run company said Monday. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

	











	However, most ABC stations in the U.S. are owned by independent station groups, and Sinclair is the largest owner of ABC stations, with 38 across the country, including WJLA, the ABC affiliate that serves the Washington D.C. metro area. Nexstar operates 28 ABC affiliates.


	It was pushback from Sinclair and Nexstar that sparked Disney's decision to pull the show in the first place, with both station groups telling Disney that they would preempt the show in response to his comments last Monday night about Charlie Kirk's killer. Sources say that other ABC affiliates had also expressed concerns.


	Nexstar, it should be noted, has a $6 billion-plus deal pending before the FCC to acquire Tegna, an agreement that would make it by far the largest owner of local TV stations in the country. Sinclair has also expressed a desire to pursue M&A, which would also require FCC approval.


7:53 a.m. Sept. 23: This story has been updated with a statement from Nexstar.

Francesco Costabile's dark melodrama premiered at the Venice Film Festival. 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


Italy has picked Francesco Costabile's dark melodrama Familia as its Oscar contender for the 2026 Academy Awards in the best international feature film category. 


Familia is based on Luigi Celeste's biographical memoir about his youth as a far-right militant and about the legacy of his toxic, violent upbringing at the hands of his criminal father. The film premiered in the Horizons sidebar of the Venice Film Festival last year, winning the best actor prize for star Francesco Gheghi, who plays Luigi. 




	Barbara Ronchi and Francesco Di Leva co-star. Di Leva won Italy's David di Donatello award, the local version of the Oscar, for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Attilio de Razza and Nicola Picone produced Familia for Rome-based Tramp Limited, with coproducers Nicola Giuliano at Indigo Film and Pierpaolo Verga at O'Groove, and in association with Medusa Film. True Colours is handling international sales.

Familia was picked from among 24 shortlisted candidates as the Italian Oscar entry. Among its competitors were Gianfranco Rosi's documentary Below the Clouds, Pietro Marcello's period biopic Duse, and Leonardo Di Costanzo's crime drama Elisa.


Paolo Sorrentino's La Grazia, which opened the Venice Film Festival this year, did not qualify for the Oscar race as it won't release in Italy until early January. For Italy, only films released between October 1, 2024 and September 30, 2025 are considered eligible for submission for next year's Oscar race.


	Sorrentino is the last Italian director to win the best international feature Oscar, taking home the trophy in 2014 for The Great Beauty. Italy's last Oscar nomination was in 2024 for Matteo Garrone's refugee drama Io Capitano. Last year's submission, Maura Delpero's World War 2 drama Vermiglio, was shortlisted but not nominated. 

	











	The U.S. Academy will announce the first shortlist of 15 films in contention for the 2026 best international feature Oscar on Dec. 16. The final nominations will be announced on Jan. 22. The 98th Academy Awards Ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on March 15, 2026.

Inside the quick rise and recent news surrounding the 20-year-old pop singer.


													By
												

	Mackenzie Cummings-Grady



	After breaking through as a Gen Z pop singer, D4vd has been making headlines in relation to a tragedy over the past few weeks. The artist, whose real name is David Anthony Burke, rose to fame as a genre-blending musician after pivoting away from YouTube content creation; up until last week, he was in the throes of a massive world tour. Now, those tour dates have been cancelled, following the early September discovery of a deceased teenage girl in a car registered to the singer.


	On Sept. 8, a decomposed body was found in the singer's impounded Tesla. Authorities identified the decomposed remains — which were discovered in the Tesla's trunk while the car was in a Los Angeles tow lot — using forensics, and determined that the body belonged to 15-year-old Celeste Rivas. According to NBC News, the teen had been reported as missing and was last seen in April 2024, and her death is being investigated as a homicide. Following the identification of the body, the Internet exploded with speculative detective work, drawing connections between Rivas and D4vd, and linking the singer to the case.


	The singer's rep previously said in a statement that D4vd is “fully cooperating with the authorities,” and no charges have been brought against the 20-year-old. He canceled the remaining dates of his world tour last week.


	As the heartbreaking story develops, here's everything you need to know about D4vd's career, and how the pop singer enjoyed a meteoric rise prior to the tragic events of recent weeks.


	D4vd got his start in the early 2020s while live streaming video games, and in interviews credited Fortnite with exposing him to The Neighbourhood, Arctic Monkeys and other alternative artists. Prior to that, D4vd said he strictly listening to gospel music growing up. After some time on Fortnite, he made his first songs under the D4vd moniker titled “Run Away” and “You and I.” He used the latter song for gameplay montage videos, and noticed that people started taking it and using it in their own montages.


	“…I was like, ‘Okay, this could be something,' so I kept making songs,” D4vd told VMAN in 2022.


	D4vd released two singles in 2022 to get fans ready for his debut EP, Petals to Thorns. The first single was “Romantic Homicide,” which dropped in July 2022 and went viral on TikTok, eventually peaking at No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single was “Here With Me,” which also went viral online and hit No. 60 on the chart.


	The song's success led to D4vd being contacted by Darkroom and Interscope Records, leading to him signing with the label in September 2022.


	D4vd then officially made his recording debut with the release of his EP Petals to Thorns in May 2023. The EP became D4vd's first entry on the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 105. After the success of Petals to Thorns, D4vd closed out the year with The Lost Petals EP that September, adding to the buzz surrounding the young artist.


	D4vd was announced as one of the openers on SZA's blockbuster SOS tour, which kicked off in February 2023. D4vd was one of three openers, joining Omar Apollo and Raye.


	“I'm SZA's biggest fan. I'm super grateful to her,” D4vd told Rolling Stone at the time. “When I got the news I was locked in for the tour, I was in a recording session and I jumped up, threw my headphones and was just going crazy.”


	D4vd issued a variety of singles throughout 2024: he dropped “Leave Her” and “2016” in February, and “Feel It,” which appeared on the soundtrack for the Amazon Prime Video TV series Invincible, the following month. In July, D4vd returned again with “There Goes My Baby,” and in November he released “Remember Me,” which was featured on the Arcane soundtrack. Before the year was out, D4vd returned once more with the single, “Where'd It Go Wrong?”


	After dropping another smattering of singles in early 2025, D4vd officially released his debut album Withered in April. D4vd also went viral that month after attempting a backflip during his Coachella performance, and face-planting onstage. The singer laughed off the tumble, and then announced the Withered World Tour days later. The tour kicked off on Aug. 5 in Del Mar, California.


	On Sept. 8, Los Angeles police discovered a body inside an impounded Tesla in Hollywood. The vehicle was reportedly registered to D4vd. A spokesperson for the LAPD told Billboard that officers responded to a call of a “foul odor” coming from the car in a tow yard before finding the “possible human remains.” The case was described as “currently a death investigation.”


	Days later, the body found in the Tesla registered to D4vd was identified as a missing 15-year-old girl named Celeste Rivas Hernandez. She had been last seen in April 2024, and had been reported missing. Officials announced that her remains weren't intact and she had been dead for an “extended period of time.”


	The next day, a home in Los Angeles where D4vd had previously stayed was searched by police.


	On Sept. 20, D4vd canceled the last two dates on his U.S. tour and multiple dates on his European tour. Ticketmaster communicated to fans the dates had been canceled, but some tickets for dates in Sweden, France, Poland and Australia scheduled for the end of the year remained available for purchase as of Sept. 22.


	Celeste Rivas' Inland Empire community of Lake Elsinore, where she lived with her family, held a vigil on Sept. 21, 2025. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Rivas' community members paid their respects to the teen, and said, among other things, that “She deserves justice.”

Man-child, why you always come a-running to her?


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Sabrina Carpenter may have made an album called Man's Best Friend, but that doesn't mean she has men all figured out.


	In a new Vogue Italia cover story published Tuesday (Sept. 23), the pop star opened up about her somewhat conflicting feelings toward the opposite sex. “I think they're a really fun species to watch,” Carpenter began. “In both a good and bad way.”


	The Grammy winner went on to differentiate between the positive and negative experiences she's had with men (some of whom she might classify as man-children). “I feel really adored, inspired and loved by some of them,” she told the publication of men. “And really confused, attacked and ridiculed by others.”

	











	“When one of my friends announces she's having a son, I rejoice for that child,” Carpenter added. “Because I know he'll be raised right.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	For more of the singer's thoughts on men, fans need only listen to Man's Best Friend, which dropped in August and debuted atop the Billboard 200. On Billboard Hot 100-topping lead single “Manchild,” she laments the incompetencies of the male partners she attracts, while on “Tears,” she caustically raves about how hot it is when a love interest does the bare minimum.


	Carpenter has also previously opened up about the heartbreak that inspired Man's Best Friend. “I think I came out of a sad situation a lot less bitter than I intended or expected to, with a little bit more of the, like, ‘You know what? There's two people involved, and this is part of growing up,'” she told Zane Lowe earlier in September. “I don't want to be enemies with people that I loved … I feel like it is one of those situations where, even the album starting with, ‘Oh, boy' was sort of an eye roll to yourself being like, ‘Here we go again.'”


	The conversation with Vogue Italia comes as Carpenter has a number of exciting ventures coming up, with the Girl Meets World alum recently announcing that she'll soon be making her Grand Ole Opry debut in addition to hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time. She will also headline Coachella in 2026.

	











	Elsewhere in the new interview, Carpenter spoke about how meaningful it's been to her to have her fans by her side for every step of the way on her rise to superstardom. “The most important thing in the last 10 years of my life has been the people who have brought me to where I am now, the fans who have stuck by me through every moment, the good ones and the bad ones, with the songs they loved and didn't love,” she reflected. “We're really growing together.”

With sentencing set for next month, the music mogul's attorneys say prosecutors are seeking punishment ""wildly out of proportion"" with his actual convictions.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Attorneys for Sean “Diddy” Combs are asking a federal judge to sentence him to just 14 months in prison on his prostitution convictions, saying “it is time for Mr. Combs to go home.”


	In court filings late Monday, Diddy's attorneys urged Judge Arun Subramanian to reject “draconian” requests from prosecutors and instead impose a “far lower sentence in this unique case,” where Combs was acquitted of more serious sex trafficking charges.

	The star is set for sentencing on October 3. Because of 13 months the star has already served in jail since he was arrested, a 14-month sentence would see him released almost immediately.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Mr. Combs's career and reputation have been destroyed,” his attorneys write. “He has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America — yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life.”


	Sentencing recommendations from prosecutors are not yet public, but Diddy's lawyers say they're seeking a sentence of more than 20 years in prison – a request that his attorneys say would be “a perversion of justice” and suggests the government has “lost all perspective.”


	“This is wildly out of proportion to the conduct at issue—threesomes where fully competent adult men and women voluntarily crossed state lines and had consensual sex with each other, and the defendant made no money from the conduct,” Combs' attorneys write. “This draconian approach makes Alice in Wonderland's Queen of Hearts seem benevolent.”


	Combs was arrested and charged in September 2024 with racketeering (RICO) and sex trafficking violations over accusations that he ran a sprawling criminal operation aimed at facilitating the freak-offs — elaborate events which he allegedly forced his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and other women to have sex with male escorts while he watched and masturbated.


	Following a blockbuster trial this spring, jurors cleared Combs on the RICO and sex trafficking charges that could have seen him sentenced to prison for life. But he was still convicted on two other counts for transporting Ventura and others across state lines for the purposes of prostitution.


	In Monday's sentencing submission, Diddy's lawyers say the judge must take into account that outcome – that he was cleared of the more serious charges he faced.


	“The government accused Sean Combs of heinous crimes. It branded him an evil trafficker and racketeer who coerced and defrauded his girlfriends into having sex against their will. But none of that was true,” his lawyers write. “Put simply, the jury has spoken.”

It's a four-chair turn after the Birmingham, Alabama, singer's rendition of Tina Turner's ""What's Love Got to Do With It.""


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	We don't know yet who Jazz McKenzie will choose to be her coach on Monday night's (Sept. 19) The Voice season 28 premiere, but we know who she can't choose, thanks to Reba McEntire‘s diabolical block.


	The Birmingham, Alabama, singer got everyone on her side with a joyful rendition of Tina Turner‘s “What's Love Got to Do With It,” a three-week No. 1 smash on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984. In fact, all four coaches turned their chairs for the blind audition — with McEntire the first to turn.

	











	But while Snoop Dogg cluelessly sang along with McKenzie, what he didn't realize was that McEntire had used her block to keep Snoop from landing the in-demand contestant.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“You are so sought-after, Jazz, that I believe Reba McEntire used her one and only block to stop Snoop Dogg from getting you,” fellow coach Michael Bublé informed the singer — and Snoop himself.


	“He just realized that,” McEntire said of Snoop. “I kind of want a bigger response over me blocking you!”


	“I'm sitting over here thinking that mine's just red,” Snoop said of the words in front of his chair being lit in red, as the audience laughed. “I did not read it.”


Niall Horan helped his fellow coach decipher the message in front of him: “No, it says ‘B-L-O-C-K-E-D.'”


	There were no hard feelings for Snoop, who said to McKenzie: “I'm just gonna give you a hug 'cause I can't coach you. You deserve to be here.”

	











	In addition to McEntire's block, Bublé also pulled out all the stops by channeling “the luck of the Irish” with a troupe of Irish step dancers, who came out to dance to Bublé's Adult Contemporary-charting 2003 cover of “Sway.”


	But who will McKenzie choose in the end? You'll have to tune in to the season 28 premiere of The Voice — airing at 8 p.m. ET Monday night on NBC and streaming on Peacock — to find out, but you can watch her audition below now.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Nexstar said that it will continue to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live!, meaning that the late-night host's return on Tuesday night won't have carriage in nearly a quarter of ABC‘s affiliate reach.


	In a statement, Nexstar said, “We made a decision last week to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve. In the meantime, we note that Jimmy Kimmel Live! will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”

	











	A Nexstar spokesperson said that most of the stations will be airing expanded local newscasts.




			Watch on Deadline		







Sinclair Broadcast Group, which holds the largest number of ABC affiliates, announced on Monday that it would not broadcast Kimmel's show. The Walt Disney Co. announced earlier in the day that Kimmel would return to the air on Tuesday, after pulling the show indefinitely last week. That came amid a furor on the right over a remark Kimmel made about MAGA's characterization of the suspect in the assassination of Charlie Kirk.


RELATED: Watch Jimmy Kimmel's Comments About Charlie Kirk That Got His ABC Show Yanked


	The chairman of the FCC, Brendan Carr, appeared on a podcast on Wednesday and warned ABC and its stations of repercussions. Hours later, Nexstar announced that it was pulling Kimmel, and the network soon after said that the late-night talk show was being take off the air indefinitely.


	But the decision to pull Kimmel triggered a backlash, with Barack Obama and former Walt Disney Co. CEO Michael Eisner among those calling out what they saw as corporate capitulation to a threat coming from a Trump administration figure. Even Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who chairs the Senate committee that oversees the FCC, said that Carr's comments were like those of a mafia boss.












	Nexstar also has faced criticism that it was attempting to get in the good graces with Carr at a time when it is seeking to merger with another large station group, Tegna. That transaction needs FCC approval. Nexstar also has been championing a rule change at the FCC that would pave the way for the transaction, as well as the consolidation of other broadcast station companies. They want the FCC to repeal a rule that limits any one company from owning stations that reach more than 39% of U.S. households.


	Later last week, Nexstar issued a statement saying, “The decision to preempt Jimmy Kimmel Live! was made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.”


	But in his comments on Benny Johnson's podcast, Carr essentially provided a roadmap for what stations could do to handle the fallout from Kimmel's remark, suggesting that they otherwise were facing fines or even broadcast license revocation. Carr said that “it's time that a lot of these licensed broadcasters themselves push back on Comcast and Disney and say, ‘Listen, we're going to preempt, we're not going to run Kimmel anymore, and so you straighten this out because we, licensed broadcasters are running into the possibility of fines or license revocation from the FCC if we continue to run content that ends up being a pattern of news distortion.'”


	Nexstar is the largest station group in the country, with 32 ABC affiliates. Sinclair owns or controls more than three dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar and Sinclair together represent almost one-quarter of ABC's reach to U.S. households.


	Nexstar's ABC affiliates are in major markets including Nashville, Salt Lake City and New Orleans, and mid-sized cities such as Sioux City, IA; Lubbock, TX and Knoxville, TN.

Free speech is gone. We are in the hands of the dictators! So sad!

Somehow I think you'll survive.

Jimmy Kimmel Live has 20 million YouTube subscribers. Most of us don't even watch his show on broadcast tv. Everyone focused on tv ratings is stuck in a majorly antiquated mindframe.

Broadcast is still where the majority of the revenue is brought in, at least for now.

Ummm no

only 1.6m daily views.

Doesn't matter.  The point has been made to the Administration.

Freedom of speech is one thing. Paying a man to make that speech is quite another. He can do that on a street corner.

And their will be people waiting on that street corner to hear him.

Not according to last year's ratings, they won't. He's behind Fallon now in viewership and has lost millions for ABC this year

Why wouldn't they block any shows they don't like?

EXCLUSIVE: Simon West's (Con Air) World War II espionage action-adventure Fortitude began principal photography on September 8 in London and has assembled an eye-catching cast.

Warner Bros. Pictures has dropped a teaser for The Bride!, filmmaker Maggie Gyllenhaal‘s take on the Frankenstein story, marking her follow up to the Academy Award-nominated Netflix pic The Lost Daughter.


	Starring Oscar nominee Jessie Buckley and Oscar winner Christian Bale, the film sees a lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travel to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman and The Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!

Weekend Editor


The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart addressed ABC's reinstatement of Jimmy Kimmel‘s late-night show, set to return tomorrow, and issued a stern warning to those who would continue to back president Donald Trump throughout his continued “authoritarian power grabs.”


	First tackling Kimmel's forthcoming reprisal following his abrupt and indefinite preemption by the Disney broadcasting network, which received strong audience applause and cheers, Stewart said, “I'll tell you, Jimmy Kimmel's flying high like Advil today,” referencing Trump's press conference earlier today on the causes of autism, which he linked to acetaminophen usage.

	The political comic continued, “That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building, that really worked, congratulations.”

	He added of parent corporation Disney's dominance in the media: “Wasn't it interesting, to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life? It's one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers? Nahhh. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can't watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football? Or listen to early Hilary Duff?”


	Later in the segment — after discussing Trump's recent Truth Social post, in which he urged U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to enable the Department of Justice to prosecute his political rivals — Stewart issued a call to Trump's supporters.


	“You don't have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump's authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law. He does not give a f— anymore. He's saying it straight-up,” the host said. “Trump is saying: ‘The people like dictators.' Trump is saying: ‘I hate my opponents, and I want them punished.' And Trump is saying: ‘I'll use all the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal.' So you can get on board with that and say, ‘I'm with that,' or you can join the rest of us and fight like hell for this constitutional republic.”

For the most part, though, Stewart focused on how flagrant the president has become and how bad Ted Cruz's Princess Bride impressions are.



Stewart spent a lot of time tonight mocking Cruz, but the Texas senator was not the object of his ire. Stewart spent the opening 20 minutes showing Trump's brazenness and the shamelessness with which he treats his power. This isn't exactly news, but Trump 2.0 is a mask-off presidency—unless you're a federal agent looking to snatch people off the street, then it's mask on. Between his belief that “bad” stories about him should be “illegal” and his message to Pam Bondi on Truth Social ordering her to prosecute his political enemies, the pretense is gone. It's become so bad that even Cruz called FCC Chair Brendan Carr's now-infamous “we can do this easy way or we can do this hard way” comment “dangerous.” Not that anyone can count on a sitting member of Congress to do anything about it. Still, it's important to acknowledge where we're at.

“You don't have to bend over backwards trying to make Trump's authoritarian power grabs seem like the rule of law,” Stewart said. “He does not give a shit anymore. He's saying it straight up. Trump is saying, ‘The people like dictators.' Trump is saying, ‘I hate my opponents and I want them punished.' Trump is saying, ‘I'll use the levers of government at my disposal to accomplish that goal.'”

That's where we're at. So, without further ado, here's that video of Ted Cruz's Simpsons impression from, Jesus, a decade ago.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sinclair will continue preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live!","https://www.avclub.com/sinclair-preempt-jimmy-kimmel-live","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 02:35:00 GMT","

Following Disney's decision to return Jimmy Kimmel Live! to the airwaves, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced today that it would continue to protect viewers from Kimmel's comedy by preempting the show. Sinclair shared a statement (per Deadline), stating that talks with Disney are still ongoing.

“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting Jimmy Kimmel Live! across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,” the statement reads.

Earlier today, after pushback from consumers, employees, artists, unions, and those concerned about the future of free speech in a country that censors its most mainstream comedians, Disney announced that it will “return the show on Tuesday.” Disney also said that its initial decision was “made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.” After days of “thoughtful conversations with Jimmy,” the company reversed course. Those comments were: “The MAGA Gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

Kimmel's comments set off a firestorm. Shortly after Kimmel's show last week, FCC chair Brendan Carr said on a podcast that affiliates could “do this the easy way or the hard way” regarding broadcast licenses for affiliates that air Kimmel. Carr has since walked back those comments, which many interpreted as a threat. Though he spent the evening sending celebratory GIFs to reporters, Carr denies that his words were meant as a threat. Threat or not, his words got results because Nexstar, which is awaiting FCC approval of a $6 billion purchase of its competition, and Sinclair sprang into action to pull the comedian.

The second-largest television operator in the country, Sinclair holds 39 ABC affiliates across the country, the largest number of ABC affiliates in America. Though Disney will continue airing the show on ABC, Sinclair's preemption means that the show won't actually broadcast in large swaths of the country.

Now that everyone has seen Weapons, everyone would like to know what the deal with Aunt Gladys is. Answers are the scariest part of any horror movie, but, heck, not even Gladys bothers justifying her behavior anymore. Since Weapons didn't offer much in the way of backstory the first time around, director Zach Cregger is rectifying that by giving the film's strangest element a prequel to explain herself. Speaking to Fangoria, Cregger said that he's talking to Warner Bros. about a prequel starring everyone's favorite aunt. “It is real and I've been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There's a story and I'm pretty excited about it. It's not bullshit.” Cregger said. “I was ready. I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out.”

Gladys, Cregger says, is based on his lifelong fear of Lil (Kimberly Ann Cole), the walking cipher from Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me that Gordon Cole (David Lynch) introduces to Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanely (Kiefer Sutherland) as they investigate the Theresa Banks murder in Deer Meadow. “She's wearing this crazy, outlandish, brightly colored outfit,” Cregger said. “She's making this weird face and doing this weird peacock dance. It just scared the shit out of me as a kid. I knew one day I was going to explore something like that, and this was my chance.” With Weapons ruling the late-summer blockbuster, it sounds like he's going to get his chance again.

Charlie Kirk was assassinated on September 10. On Sunday, September 21, his public memorial service was held at the NFL stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Hundreds of thousands of mourners attended to pay their respects and show support for Kirk and his family. 

Kirk leaves behind a wife, Erika Kirk, whom he married in 2021. The couple also has two children: a three-year-old daughter and a one-year-old son. His widow attended the memorial and addressed the crowd with a passionate speech. 

When Erika took to the stage, she was greeted by almost two minutes of applause, CNN reports.  When the crowd settled, she began to speak. In Erika's speech, she reflected on her husband's mission, her feelings surrounding his passing, and she sent a message of forgiveness. 

“I arrived at a Utah hospital to do the unthinkable,” she reflected on seeing her husband for the first time after his passing. She commented on how she saw the wound on his neck and the emotions she felt in that moment. “I felt shock, I felt horror, and a level of heartache that I didn't even know existed,” she said. 

There was a moment where she noticed a gray hair on his head, which she shared she had “never told him about,” she said with a laugh, CNN reports. 

Erika's message was also one of forgiveness as she addressed the person allegedly responsible for her husband's passing. “I forgive him,” she told the crowd.

“That young man. That young man. On the cross our savior said, ‘Father, forgive them for they know not what they do' — that man, that young man, I forgive him,” she said, the New York Post reports. At this moment, the crowd rose in ovation, showing support for Erika's comments.

Erika continued, “I forgive him because it was what Christ did. And what Charlie would do. The answer to hate is not hate. The answer we know from the Gospel is love and always love. Love for our enemies and love for those who persecute us.”

There were 200,000 people who attended the memorial, and the stadium could only fit 73,000 people, the New York Post reports. Many of these mourners were moved by Erika's powerful speech, with the publication reporting that people had tears in their eyes when she delivered her message of forgiveness.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Miley Cyrus Opens Up About the Potential End of Her Music Career","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/miley-cyrus-potential-end-music-career/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 03:28:07 GMT","

Miley Cyrus started working on “Hannah Montana” when she was still young. Nowadays, she has a successful music career that has earned her multiple awards and countless fans. However, during a chat with fellow star Pamela Anderson for CR Fashion Book published on Monday, September 22, Cyrus revealed that she might want to walk away from her career at some point.

“I actually had this moment the other night where I was lying in bed thinking, ‘Wow, I really jumped on a train when I was 11 years old, and I've never gotten off,'” Cyrus told Anderson. “I made a decision at 11, and I've never stopped.”

She added, “I made this deep commitment, and I never questioned it or reexamined it.”

Cyrus may have spent the bulk of her career not questioning whether or not it was what she wanted at the time, however, that eventually changed.

“It wasn't until my late 20s and early 30s that I started reevaluating: ‘Is this still what I want?' So far, the answer has been yes, but I'm not afraid of the day it's no,” she said while talking to Anderson for CR Fashion Book. 

Granted, she admitted, “I don't know if that day will come — when this no longer has my heart the way it does now.”

However, she knows that she might not always feel the same way. “Like you said, there could be a season where all of this no longer interests me, and that's okay,” she added.

Anderson responded by telling Cyrus: “You'll always be creative — even if it's in a garden, you'll never get rid of that. It's just a matter of if you get off the crazy train.”

Cyrus may still be interested in making music and performing on stage, however, she longer wants to do one major part of her career: tour.

“I do have the physical ability,” she noted during an interview on Good Morning America that took place on July 15. “I have the opportunities to tour, I wish I had the desire, but I don't.”

“I also don't think that there's an infrastructure that supports artists,” she added. “It's really hard to maintain sobriety when you're on the road, which is kind of a pillar of stability in my life. It's really hard to keep mental wellness.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Hallmark's Ashley Williams Posts Personal Message on World Alzheimer's Day","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/hallmarks-ashley-williams-posts-heartwarming-message/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 14:17:12 GMT","

Whether she's playing bookish teacher, Avery, in “Jingle Bell Run,” or Natalie, a neighbor just wanting everyone to get along in “Falling Together,” Ashley Williams often brings a bubbly quality to her characters. Even when dealing with the traumatic aftermath of the LA wildfires, she managed to find some joy, dancing in the rain when she saw a rainbow.

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

But the Hallmark star has been honest about the not-so-cheerful moments in her life, as well, such as her mother's battle with Alzheimer's disease. On September 21, Williams posted a tribute to caregivers, like her father, in honor of World Alzheimer's Day. Fans and costars shared their own caregiver stories, while making sure that the “To Barcelona, With Love” star felt the love.

Williams posted a photo of her father and mother in an embrace. Her mother, Linda, died in 2016 after a long struggle with Alzheimer's.

“This #worldalzheimersday I want to call out to the 11 million caregivers of #alzheimers and other dementia in this country, like my dad in this picture,” Williams captioned her Instagram post. “He was devoted to my mother for all of their almost 50 years together, but especially in the years that she lived with the disease. It was almost more of a dangerous time for him than her.”

If you know of someone caring for a loved one with Alzheimer's, reach out to them today,” she continued. “Let them know you know they are tired. Maybe drop off dinner this week or offer to come hang out with their loved one so they can shower or take a walk. Their job is endless, heroic, beautiful and heartbreaking. Thank you, caregivers, for all you do. I'm standing with you today and I hope you can feel my arms around you.”

“If you have the means to donate to the Alzheimer's association today, please check out the link in my bio,” Williams added. “Love you. Xx”

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

Many fans posted about their own or a family member's experience as a caregiver for a loved one with dementia. Her sister, Kimberly Williams-Paisley, posted four purple heart emojis. Several of her former Hallmark costars, including Sharon Lawrence, Kevin Nealon, and Miguel Brocca, also commented with heart emojis.

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

Over the years, Williams has undertaken steps to honor her mother and raise funds for Alzheimer's disease research. The most recent instance was Williams' film, “Falling Together.” In the movie, her character meets Linda Payne (Linda Cash), a neighbor who is in charge of the local Alzheimer's Association. 

“Linda Cash whose character is Linda Payne which is my mother's maiden name,” she explained to Southern Living. “My mom was Linda Payne.”

A post shared by Ashley Williams (@ashleywilliamsandcompany)

That was one of those moments where it was so personal it was absolutely undeniable and in some weird way it felt like this little moment where I felt a lot closer to my mom than I had in years,” she said. “It really ended up really meaning something to me. It was really special.”

Sharon Osbourne took part in the docuseries, “Into the Void: Life, Death & Heavy Metal,” which is streaming on Hulu. In the first episode, she reflected on the death of guitarist Randy Rhoads. 

Rhoads was touring with Ozzy Osbourne and band members Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge (Osbourne had left Black Sabbath in 1979 to focus on a solo career and deal with his substance abuse issues). They were on a tour bus when they made a stop to fix a broken air conditioner, People reports. 

At some point, while Ozzy and Sharon were sleeping, Rhoades and a woman who worked with them, Rachel Youngblood, went up in a private plane with the bus driver. What happened next was unthinkable because the plane crashed into the tour bus. Sharon reflected on the moment. “It was like a horror movie, body parts — and I was screaming at the tour manager, and I can remember taking my shoe off and whacking him across the head,” she said. 

At the time of Rhoads' death, he was just 25.

Aldridge also appeared in the docuseries, and he reflected on Sharon's reaction to the crash. “When Sharon realized that Randy and Rachel had been killed, she came unglued. She just went off on our tour manager, screaming, ‘How could you let that baby get on that plane,” he said. 

The crash deeply affected Ozzy, and Sarzo described hearing “wailing, moaning, agony” coming from him while he mourned the loss of Rhoads in a church. Sharon was determined to keep the tour going, knowing that if they returned home, Ozzy would start drinking heavily again. 

“We were all in shock for so long, for so long, and then you have to go back and try and make sense of a story to Randy's mom,” she said. She then broke down into tears. “Now you know why I didn't want to talk about Randy.”

The eight-part series  “Into the Void: Life, Death & Heavy Metal” is executive-produced by Jason Eisener and Evan Husney. The interview with Sharon was done in June 2025, before the death of Ozzy, People reports.

Discussing what happened to Rhoads was difficult for Sharon, but she also shared her gratitude that he was remembered. “I think about Randy all the time and love that he's not forgotten,” she said in the docuseries. “Music lovers want to know about him. He's become this mystical little guy that not many people knew well, and he will live on forever. Music is something that doesn't die. After we've gone, it will live on.”

Jessie Buckley and Christian Bale make a “monstrous” couple in the first teaser for “The Bride!,” director Maggie Gyllenhaal‘s punk rock take on “Bride of Frankenstein.”

The stylish, colorful, and bonkers first look at “The Bride” shows Buckley being revived and brought back to life as Frankenstein's bride, with him at one point killing some men in her defense and saying “Till Death Do Us Part.” 

While we got a completely different look at the film at CinemaCon back in April, both that first impression and this new one underscore how bold and bizarre Gyllenhaal's take on the monster movie source material is. 

 










The official synopsis reads: “A lonely Frankenstein (Bale) travels to 1930s Chicago to ask groundbreaking scientist Dr. Euphronious (five-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening) to create a companion for him. The two revive a murdered young woman, and The Bride (Buckley) is born. What ensues is beyond what either of them imagined: Murder! Possession! A wild and radical cultural movement! And outlaw lovers in a wild and combustible romance!”

The film stars Buckley, Bale, Peter Sarsgaard, with Bening, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Penélope Cruz. For Maggie Gyllenhaal, this is just her second feature film after first directing the very different “The Lost Daughter,” and she's directing from her own screenplay as well.  

The film was produced by Emma Tillinger Koskoff, Talia Kleinhendler, and Osnat Handelsman Keren. The executive producers are Carla Raij, David Webb, and Courtney Kivowitz.

Here's hoping that “The Bride!” is the latest in Warner Bros.‘ current hot streak of ambitious bets on filmmakers, capped by a year that has included “Sinners,” “Weapons,” and “One Battle After Another.” “The Bride!” will be presented in IMAX and hits North American theaters March 6, 2026. 

Check out both a censored and an uncensored teaser, which, by our estimation, is just the subtitle “FUCKING” ahead of the word “BRIDE,” below.

One of the year's best documentaries is composed entirely from you-are-there, true found footage that tells of a devastating American story by way of police bodycam video. 

“The Perfect Neighbor,” directed by Geeta Gandbhir, centers on how in June 2023, in Marion County, Florida, a Black family was torn apart by their white neighbor, Susan Lorincz, when she killed her neighbor Ajike Owens, a mother of four. Lorincz had deployed stand-your-ground laws in Florida that enable civilians to use deadly force when they feel under threat of imminent harm.

 










Winner of the Directing Award for Documentary at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, “The Perfect Neighbor” has gone on to play festivals globally throughout the year — including finally this October at the New York Film Festival. Watch the trailer below ahead of the upcoming October release date. Expect “The Perfect Neighbor,” out from Netflix later in October, to land on the documentary Oscar shortlist.

More on the film from David Ehrlich's IndieWire review: “Shot almost entirely by police body cams and interrogation room CCTVs, Geeta Gandbhir's unforgettable documentary crystallizes the horrors of stand-your-ground laws by examining their effects through the lens of a single case — one that harrowingly illustrates the defects of castle doctrines (among other policy failures) by painting a microcosmic portrait of white America's inability to parse between fear and anger. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Stand-your-ground laws aren't even mentioned by name until ‘The Perfect Neighbor' is more than half over, as Gandbhir elects to work the issue from the inside out, with the you-are-there reality of the footage she uses bringing viewers right into the heart of what's ultimately a human matter. Indeed, a subjective camera has seldom been more damning than it is here — here, in an American horror story that doesn't hinge on whether or not white Florida woman Susan Lorincz was actually in danger when she fired on the unarmed neighbor knocking at her front door, but rather on whether or not Susan Lorincz believed she was in danger when the young Black mother from across the street, Ajike Owens, came to retrieve her son's confiscated tablet.”

“The Perfect Neighbor” opens in select theaters on Friday, October 10 before streaming on Netflix Friday, October 17.

UPDATED, September 23, 2025, 11:00AM ET: Nexstar Media, which operates 32 ABC-affiliated stations, has announced it will continue to preempt the show. In a statement provided to Variety, the TV station group owner shared, “We made a decision last week to preempt ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' following what ABC referred to as Mr. Kimmel's ‘ill-timed and insensitive' comments at a critical time in our national discourse. We stand by that decision pending assurance that all parties are committed to fostering an environment of respectful, constructive dialogue in the markets we serve. In the meantime, we note that ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' will be available nationwide on multiple Disney-owned streaming products, while our stations will focus on continuing to produce local news and other programming relevant to their respective markets.”
 








Related Stories ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to Return Tuesday Night as Suspension Ends 400 Hollywood Celebs Sign ACLU Letter Supporting Jimmy Kimmel — Without Suggesting Any Specific Action or Disney Boycott 

Our original story, first published on September 23, 2025 at 10:13AM ET, follows.


			Popular on IndieWire		






Jimmy Kimmel is back! (With an asterisk.) After yesterday's announcement that the late night host and his “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” would return to the airwaves this evening after Kimmel's “indefinite” suspension in the wake of comments made about Charlie Kirk last week (all told: only three episodes were cancelled), we've got a caveat. 

 










While “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will return Tuesday night, September 23, as The Walt Disney Company announced on Monday, NBC News reports that “Sinclair, a company that operates more than 35 ABC affiliates across the U.S., said that it would replace Kimmel with news programming.” 

“Beginning Tuesday night, Sinclair will be preempting ‘Jimmy Kimmel Live!' across our ABC affiliate stations and replacing it with news programming. Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,” Sinclair said in a statement.

Last week, local affiliate companies Nexstar and Sinclair kicked off a firestorm when they stated that they would no longer air “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” As of the publication of this article, Nexstar has not announced its plans for this evening.

While Sinclair initially announced its affiliates would air a tribute show to Kirk in lieu of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!,” that did not happen. Sinclair affiliates instead aired episodes of “Celebrity Family Feud,” like most ABC affiliates, in the timeslot instead.

On Wednesday, September 17, ABC announced that they were suspending Kimmel's show “indefinitely” following a joke that Kimmel made on air that many felt was insensitive and inflammatory in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. 

 










On the Monday, September 14 episode of the show, Kimmel said during his monologue, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.” Many felt that this remark implied that Kirk's alleged killer was MAGA, which evidence does not currently suggest is the case.

IndieWire noted in the aftermath that Disney harmed its own business interests by capitulating to Trump. Kimmel was a serious investment of years and tens (if not hundreds) of millions of dollars. 

The suspension prompted days of discussion about the status of free speech in America and with serious criticism lodged from even conservative Republican senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul against the Trump administration for its coercive tactics in pressuring Kimmel off the air. Kimmel's suspension resulted in protests by free speech advocates in front of his Hollywood studio and an ACLU letter decrying his removal signed by 400 celebrities.

The winning films for the 2025 Fantastic Fest awards have been announced. The Austin-based genre festival is now celebrating its 20th anniversary, and it assembled juries with some remarkable talent including Patton Oswalt, “Eileen” author Ottessa Moshfegh, and Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst — all of whom have certainly established their own genre bona fides.

The jurors chose Charlie Polinger's “The Plague” as the winner of the main competition, Avalon Fast's “CAMP” as winner of the Next Wave competition, and Majid Al Ansari's “The Vile” as Best Horror Feature.

 










In addition to the announcement of the main winners, the winner of the inaugural Fantastic Pitches competition, presented by Chroma, was revealed. That's a contest where a treatments for genre films are submitted, with the winning submission being given $100,000 to produce the film and a guaranteed slot to premiere at Fantastic Fest 2026.

Grab your favorite raccoons, best head scarves, and oh, God, get ready for another winter, because it's time to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Albert and David Maysles' landmark 1975 documentary, “Grey Gardens.”

To celebrate the film in style (the only way it could possibly be done), New York City's Paris Theater is hosting a special screening of the documentary on Sunday, October 5. The one-time-only event will kick off at 2:00PM and be introduced by actress, model, and author Julia Fox (“Uncut Gems,” “Night Always Comes”), who will also chat with jewelry designer Alexis Bittar about the film's continuing importance.

 










The film, which was co-directed by Ellen Hovde and Muffie Meyer, first premiered at the 1975 New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall, before opening at the Paris in February of 1976. (While the film earned mixed reviews upon its initial release, it long ago gained cult status, and remains a singular favorite.) The 581-seat single-screen theater temporarily closed in 2019, before being saved by Netflix just weeks later. In the years since, the streamer has used the theater to host all sorts of thrilling series, retrospectives, and special events like this upcoming “Grey Gardens” bonanza.

Expect a delightful collision of NYC's film freaks and fashionistas to descend on the movie house next week. The impossibly intimate “Grey Gardens” introduced the world to Big and Little Edie Beale: mother and daughter, high-society dropouts, and reclusive cousins of Jackie Onassis. The two manage to thrive together amid the decay and disorder of their East Hampton, New York mansion, making for an eerily ramshackle echo of the American Camelot. 

Since its debut five decades ago, obsession, interest, and affection for the film has not waned. It's been both meticulously restored and lovingly parodied, it's inspired documentary prequels and narrative recreations, and been the basis of endless Halloween costumes. Yet nothing quite compares to the real thing, a truly original documentary about truly original women.

Tickets are on sale now at the Paris Theater's website, right here. You can even make a full day of it, as the Paris is also showing classics “How Green Was My Valley” and “Lawrence of Arabia” before and after the “Grey Gardens” screening.

You can't keep a strong woman down. As the hands-down stand-out queen of Zach Cregger's massive horror hit “Weapons,” star Amy Madigan has been the subject of some serious chatter in recent weeks. Not only does she deliver, ahem, eye-catching thrills and skin-crawling chills as the witchy villain in the genre smash, her performance has also inspired some early awards chatter.

And while film fans and cinephiles alike love to tout genre performances for Oscar love, it tends to be a tough row to hoe with the Academy folks. Still, Madigan is absolutely deserving of awards attention, but all that talk about just how damn (and damned, depending on how you feel about her deeds) good she is in the film might engender something else: a whole prequel, just for her.

While prequel talked kicked up within days of the film's theatrical release in August, with The Hollywood Reporter noting on August 12 that “Warner Bros. and New Line … are already talking with Cregger about making a prequel exploring the origin story of the strange aunt who suddenly arrives in town.”

 










That THR report also pointed to the film's “chapter structure centering on particular characters” and that “sources say that Cregger actually had a chapter focused on Gladys and some of her backstory. He ultimately pulled that section from the script for length purposes. Now with the movie's wild success, that lost chapter would be expanded into a full-length story.”

At the time, a source told IndieWire that any plans at the moment are merely speculation. But, speculation aside, Cregger himself has now confirmed in a new interview with Fangoria that he is working on an Aunt Gladys-centric prequel idea.

“It is real and I've been talking to Warner Bros. about it. There's a story and I'm pretty excited about it. It's not bullshit,” he told the outlet. He also added that the prequel idea was kicking around before the film opened to huge success. “I was ready,” he said. “I had it kind of in my pocket before the movie came out.” 

In August, as prequel chatter heated up, The New York Times asked Madigan about the rumors. “You know what? I think it's really nice to be in a conversation,” she told the outlet. “I'm definitely not poo-pooing it, but because I have been doing this for a long time, things aren't real till they're real. Listen, I love Gladys, I love being in Zach's imagination and being on Zach's page, but what are people going to talk about in a couple of weeks or in November? It's great and exciting when people talk about it, but I'm one of those people that kind of takes it with a grain of salt.”

 










Much will depend on Cregger's increasingly busy schedule. The filmmaker is currently in prep on his next feature, a new “Resident Evil” film based on the video game franchise for Sony. Like “Weapons,” Cregger's take on that IP was also the subject of an aggressive bidding war, one that Warner Bros. pursued before it landed at Sony. That film is set to open in theaters September 2026.

And while an Oscar nom for her work in the genre hit would (still, despite some recent recognitions) be a bit of an outlier in the whole awards world, it would not be new to Madigan: she was nominated in 1986 for Best Supporting Actress for her work in “Twice in a Lifetime” (she lost out to Anjelica Huston for “Prizzi's Honor”).

A Warner Bros. release, “Weapons” is currently available to stream on video-on-demand platforms, including Prime Video, Apple TV+, and Fandango at Home.

The title character of Angela Carter's short story “The Loves of Lady Purple” is a ferocious, man-eating marionette, a mute doll who is more vivid and fearsome than her wires and wigs suggest. As she becomes increasingly more lifelike, the puppet not only upstages but usurps her master until, in a blaze of glory, she rips out her strings, burns down the theater, and sets off to pursue adventure in the wider world. Contemporary pop music is full of would-be Lady Purples: mascots for a creative industry wholly indifferent to their creativity, who (once set free) pursue their own artistry with something like a vengeance. By now the stories are all too familiar: Many of the top musicians working today have at some point found themselves gagged by NDAs, stonewalled by their labels, and saddled with the kind of bottom-of-the-barrel schlock that even AI bots know to turn down for their reputation's sake. If you can't be the perfect product, they reason, it's better to become the industry's worst nightmare.

On the face of things, that's exactly the path Jade Thirlwall took. The Little Mix member's debut single, “Angel of My Dreams” is a glittering rampage of a song, a miniature epic of pop disillusionment that assumes all the distorted roles thrust onto a singer with a perverse, desperate eagerness to please. Thirlwall wrenches herself off her girl-group pedestal by playing up the part of diva: strutting, preening, and wailing over the beat as it veers from overblown banger to overblown ballad and back again. But the song's real heart lies in the raggedness of the transitions, when her voice buckles as it's sped up, pitched down, and progressively bent out of shape. Rounding into the song's final, monumental bridge, her poise shatters as her voice soars. The dream lies in pieces all around her, but in weathering her music's extremes she's finally managed to sound like herself.

Even for those who hadn't kept tabs during her girl-group tenure, “Angel” immediately contextualized a past, present, and future for the singer's music. It was an unexpected and undeniable showcase for years of bottled frustration and originality, and a thrilling glimpse of her own vision as a pop auteur. The track is scattered with Easter eggs alluding to her feelings of powerlessness under major label management. (She developed her understanding of power the hard way: The singer told the New York Times that she was so exhausted in Little Mix that makeup artists would steal into her room and doll her up while she was unconscious.) With full creative control and a loyal fan base, JADE has spent the past year performing show-stopping turns at Glastonbury and the BRIT awards, unveiling fabulously bonkers collaborations, and speaking boldly and with conviction about industry politics and the genocide in Gaza. THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY! was billed as a victory lap even before its release, and the album mostly lives up to the hype. It is the singer's most definitive statement yet, and the most complete manifestation of the artist she's always wanted to become.

Despite its title, the record largely ditches the behind-the-scenes bummer of the entertainment business in favor of putting on a show. Even the most emotionally challenging songs on Showbiz feel lit up with the glee of self-invention, phrasing various flavors of heartbreak in the boldest, most colorful production possible. The brilliantly busy disco of “Unconditional”—which feels like the moody cousin of Annie's “Me Plus One”—was written after her mother was diagnosed with lupus and underlines its urgent plea for a loved one to take care of themself with sudden intrusion of thrashing guitars. Fan favorite “Before You Break My Heart” flips the Supremes' “Stop in the Name of Love” into an echoey, ecstatic banger that Justice would approve of. A rejoinder for a partner to take her feelings seriously, it's just as striking as a labor of love: The price of using such an expensive sample is that JADE's forsworn any royalties from the track. On “Headache,” Thirlwall's chaotic, self-assured teasing is upended in the third act by a chasm of distortion, as she's left gasping, “You still love me,” in a tone that's somewhere between shell-shocked panic and disbelieving joy.

Part of what made “Angel of My Dreams” feel like such a revelation was that Thirlwall tapped into a strain of flamboyance that hadn't already been exaggerated by hyperpop: the overblown melisma of girl-group singing. Thirlwall's pipes have always been an incredibly powerful instrument, but her pyrotechnic vocals on Little Mix songs were often deployed to such basic and self-consciously showy ends that they seemed far less remarkable than they actually were. Her most meaningful course correction on Showbiz is to honor her music's sense of occasion by inhabiting emotion with the full force of her voice—belting, crooning, and faux-rapping. The throbbing synth anthem “Plastic Box” would be a completely unremarkable Robyn rip in any other singer's hands, but Thirlwall colors in gradients of feeling with overdubbed aches, sighs, and roars that make you understand her possessiveness is rooted in deep pain. “Fantasy” strikes the right balance between winking camp and unabashed sexiness. Thirlwall commands the polymorphously perverse siren song with pillowy singing that veers from Donna Summer seduction to Kylie Minogue cheesecake without ever puncturing its rosy, disco-ball mood.

JADE is at her best when she's selling honest emotion in the most exaggerated way possible. Her capacity for slaying, however, is more unwieldy. Even though she never once lacks for commitment, her overblown stunting can trend perilously toward Drag Race spoof. The improbably capitalized “IT Girl” sells the same showbiz drama as “Angel of My Dreams” but with sneering, theatrical irony that doesn't earn a speck of the latter's conflicted, prismatic emotion. “Natural at Disaster” is a melodramatic break-up track addressed to a toxic friend. The song is steeped in the language of mental health, which makes her take-downs sound like they were run by her therapist first: “It's like I'm a moth to the toxicity/You reeled me in, I'm addicted to narcissistic qualities.” Part Coyote Ugly bar dance, part cunty Ratso Rizzo, on paper “Midnight Cowboy” should be a complete disaster, but it's somehow just the right amount of insane. Over a pounding, black-lit dance beat, JADE delivers some of the weirdest boasts in recent memory with an equally absurd degree of commitment. “I'm the ride of your life not a rental/I'm the editor, call me Mr. Enninful,” she vamps with convincing swag, if a questionable grasp of the sexiness inherent in running a magazine.

Even if she doesn't always sell the camp, JADE comes by the extremity of her style in her own singular way. THAT'S SHOWBIZ BABY! is a romp of a record, even if it feels front-loaded with bangers—like Addison Rae earlier this year, the album is slightly overshadowed by its hot streak of singles. After years of playing nice, she's finally torn off her strings; but more than the unrestrained havoc, it's the finer touches that make JADE's debut so dazzlingly her own.

In Joanne Robertson's oil paintings, thick knots of red and brown often appear in the lower left-hand corner. They push back against the sloshes of pale color as a visual analogue for how her music works. Those reds and browns are like the rhythmic unrest at the heart of her serene songs, where melodies twist and buckle and collapse. And like her frequent collaborator Dean Blunt, Robertson's visual practice bleeds into her music, shaping its tension and motion. She wanders with supple precision across both canvas and song in an improvisatory state, but it's in music that she comes closest to the divine.

Blurrr, Robertson's sixth solo album and her undisputed masterpiece, is at points so beautiful—53 seconds into “Always Were,” to be exact, or four minutes, 31 seconds into “Peaceful”—that it feels difficult to breathe alongside it. Here, Robertson sounds as though she has reached a stratosphere where the soul can stretch its legs and roam more freely. It is scarcely conceivable that Robertson recorded the album within the confines of a room, constructed from earthly material, somewhere inside a city. For its nearly 45-minute duration, there is only this.

The sound of Blurrr might best be likened to the Cocteau Twins calling from inside the house: a lo-fi rendering of the band's beautiful slurry. Like Elizabeth Fraser, Robertson makes a voice feel much larger than the words it carries, though she isn't singing with an alien tongue so much as blurring words into tonal brushstrokes. If Fraser's gift was a kind of ecstatic, non-linguistic invention, Robertson's errs closer to meaning. Her lyrics hover just beyond grasp, vaguely intelligible but never fully yielded. Grouper is another obvious point of comparison: both artists summon an immense solitude, with melodies and lyrics that seem dredged from half-buried incidents and associations, as if carried across remote distances and centuries before reaching us. Robertson, though, gathers those fragments into her voice, which doesn't just bear them forward but distills them; purified in the very act of singing.

On tracks like “Gown,” where she fully opens her melodic range, her voice is all yearning and suffering. Even in moments when her phrasing feels more provisional and hesitant, as on “Ghost,” it sounds as if she is attempting to stake a claim on the infinite. Her voice and guitar zigzag around one another, rarely colliding into melodic symmetry. Her voice the blur, her guitar the furious red and brown tangles; never just a scaffold but a tactile object that thuds with wood and wire, each string caught mid-rattle, harmonics clanging.

Robertson's music is always in conversation with itself. She responds to her own sounds—and to the energies they draw out of her—in real time, lingering on particularly beautiful lines of open-tuned guitar for several beats beyond the measure, or indulging in vocal curlicues that seem as pleasurable to sing as they are to hear. She is, as her friend Derek Bailey once suggested of the ‘freest' improvisers, still in dialogue with some prior tradition. For Robertson, that tradition is free jazz, a practice that has inspired both her painting and music. Not its atonality, but its insistence on dialogue. Like Cecil Taylor's loose figurations, which cohered through rhythm and energy rather than fixed harmony, her songs are less compositions than nerve-first zones of encounter. They have always been journeys in that sense, but where her earliest recordings could sprawl into unwieldiness, Blurrr feels propelled, as if moving toward a destination that never quite arrives but always draws you forward.

Blurrr is, above all, a lonely record. Even more than on previous albums, Robertson sounds as though she has been left in a room long enough to forget anyone else's presence, her voice and guitar carrying that sense of solitude in every phrase. She captures the unfiltered hum of consciousness, as though she were setting the colors of a brain scan to melody. Across the album, solitude and disinhibition are the same gesture: the absence of an audience becomes the condition for the most audacious wandering.

On the back half of the album, cellist Oliver Coates follows Robertson down into her solitude and draws out the immensity that the earlier songs had only shyly hinted at. The retentive tones Coates and Robertson form together are, in the strictest sense, heaven. Coates gives Robertson's songs a larger wingspan, tracing fine lines around Robertson's watercolor suggestions and flying them to their full, magisterial potential. His lovely melodies seize and carry. It is a gift to hear Coates so sentimental, as though he truly understands the inner grandeur of Robertson's work. This requires no primness, no cool detachment, nothing remotely aslant; only a very direct channel of feeling.

By each track's end, we don't so much see Robertson any clearer than we do the latent ideas and feelings that animate her: tragedy, ecstasy, doom. “Mystery gone into-wait take it with you,” she sings on ‘Gown'. On the page, it barely registers; sung, it strikes hard. And then the silence that follows it feels far heavier than the one before. Blurrr is an epic drawn in miniature. You take it with you.

Phoenix and Braxe + Falcon are UFOs. The new project from the French indie-rock band and house duo launches today with a nearly self-titled debut single, “UFO,” which you can check out below. Warren Fu directed the photo-montage video.

UFOs said in a press release, “I don't believe in Miracles but I do believe in UFO: Six friends, one song, infinite memories.” “UFO” is also out now as a 12"" vinyl, via Domino imprint Smugglers Way. No news yet on whether more music will follow.

Braxe + Falcon, already a supergroup of sorts, formally united in 2022 with the Step by Step EP. The following year, they remixed “Winter Solstice,” a Phoenix song from the band's latest album, 2022's Alpha Zulu.

Sometimes, a producer's best strategy is to get out of the way and let other people radiate. That's the lesson that Kieran Hebden, a.k.a. cerebral electronic stalwart Four Tet, seems to have taken to heart on 41 Longfield Street Late '80s, his sonically discreet but emotionally robust album with Nashville guitarist William Tyler.

Hebden's recent trajectory has seen him climb ever further up electronic music's greased pole, to a level where he's headlining Coachella alongside Skrillex and Fred again... Hebden hasn't succumbed to the EDM bug, but his recent solo records have suffered from a certain torpor, sounding almost formulaically Four Tet. The contrast with the restless innovator of Hebden's youth, moving from the elegant post-rock of Fridge to the dazzling, folk-influenced Rounds in just a few years, is conspicuous. That his work with Tyler should sound so unlike any other Four Tet records in recent memory is a welcome surprise.

41 Longfield Street Late '80s, named after the house in South-West London where Hedben once absorbed his father's collection of American country and folk music, is the polar opposite of stadium-filling dance music. Both Tyler and Hebden are serial collaborators: Hebden has worked with everyone from Burial to Ellie Goulding, while Tyler counts pedal-steel guitarist Luke Schneider and post-ambient experimentalist claire rousay among recent colleagues. Yet there is something genuinely special about this partnership, which Tyler has described in terms of enduring friendship, parallel teenage experiences, and the influence of their fathers' record collections.

Hebden apparently had the final say on the album's sound; Tyler has said that he was “kind of surprised when I ended up hearing the finished thing.” But Tyler's guitars dominate throughout, as if Hebden is reveling in the intricate melodic brilliance of his collaborator. The opening track, an exquisitely elongated cover of Lyle Lovett's “If I Had a Boat,” could pretty much be a solo Tyler song for its opening minutes, with the guitarist's finely picked riffing pushed to the fore and the electronics limited to eerie ambient noises in the background.

It's a bold move—but it is also the right one, showcasing Tyler's beautifully clean fingerpicking style. When Hebden does eventually make his presence known, via a series of electronic oscillations whose stately elegance slowly comes apart at the seams, the electroacoustic handover is perfectly balanced, a serene transition between worlds.

At times like these—or on the Pink Floyd–Americana cosmic guitar duel of “When It Rains”—Tyler's collaboration with one of the foremost electronic music producers of his generation sounds considerably less produced than the guitarist's own recent solo album, Time Indefinite, which made heavy use of field recordings and collage.

Instead, 41 Longfield Street Late '80s feels like a work of careful reduction, the product of thousands of smart decisions. Hebden spent two years doing what he modestly refers to as “the computer bit” of the album, with the duo sending songs back and forth for additional edits and overdubs. It is fitting, then, that the record has a time-weathered feel, suggesting music that has been chipped out of the mountain and smoothed off by sand.

“When It Rains” teases out acoustic chords and wending trails of electric guitar over five minutes of otherworldly contemplation, a real Zen retreat of a song; “Timber”'s beautifully bucolic reverie is broken up by a strike of dramatic melody, like a dead bird falling out the desert sky; and “Spider Ballad,” the most overtly electronic of all the songs, employs an unfussy 4/4 drum beat and dabs of vacillating synth, which elevate Tyler's creepy-crawly guitar line without ever threatening to smother it. These songs are hugely evocative, their cinematic open spaces painting pictures of sun-struck landscapes and echoing canyons.

Best of all is closer “Secret City,” which is somehow spartan and dense, simple and overwhelming, a heart-trembling guitar melody held aloft on billowing clouds of effects. It is one of the most nakedly euphoric songs of the year, an alchemical wonder to tingle the nerves and tremble the tear ducts. It's also the perfect example of the musical sorcery that runs through 41 Longfield Street Late '80s: The duo's mutual respect, selfless skills, and tender chemistry have delivered an album that is among both artists' best.

	Late-night hosts celebrated the comeback of Jimmy Kimmel after ABC temporarily suspended Jimmy Kimmel Live last week. 


	Speaking on The Daily Show, Jon Stewart recounted how ABC announced that Kimmel would return to TV on Tuesday night, noting that the audience response helped to convince Disney to do the right thing. 


	“That campaign that you all launched, pretending that you were going to cancel Hulu while secretly racing through four seasons of Only Murders in the Building, that really worked, congratulations,” Stewart said. He added, “Wasn't it interesting, to try and figure out all the tentacles Disney has in your daily life? It's one thing to swear off cruises, but the Avengers? Nah. How is it possible that by getting rid of one company, I can't watch Winnie the Pooh or Monday Night Football? Or listen to early Hilary Duff?”


	Stewart went on to discuss why Jimmy Kimmel Live was pulled, joking that it “had nothing to do with the Trump administration and their explicit FCC threat that they could remove the show the easy way or the hard way.”

	











	The host added that Donald Trump may need to look inward rather than continue cancelling everyone who criticizes him after playing a clip of a Fox news correspondent saying, “If Donald Trump wanted to take everyone off the air who had criticisms for him, there would basically only be a handful of individuals left on television.”


	“That is funny, but it's also maybe a cause for self-reflection?” Stewart replied. “‘Hey, if everybody on TV is criticizing me, except for like four people, and one of them is my daughter-in-law, am I the drama?'”

	











	On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert explained that “our long late-night national nightmare is over.” “This is wonderful news for my dear friend Jimmy and his amazing staff,” Colbert told his audience to loud applause and cheers. “I'm so happy for them.” He added, picking up his new Emmy, “Plus, now that Jimmy's not being cancelled I get to enjoy this again. One more I am the only martyr in late night! Wait, unless CBS, you wanna announce anything?”

	He acknowledged that Disney folded because so many viewers cancelled their Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions. “Which explains why the other trending search was ‘how to entertain feral child without Bluey?'” Colbert joked. He added, more seriously, “So Disney put Kimmel back on because you, the American people, were upset.” 


	On Late Night, Seth Meyers noted that there has been backlash from conservatives as well as liberals about how the Trump administration is censoring comedians, including from Ted Cruz. “I want to say I agree with Ted Cruz and I want to say it because I feel pretty sure there won't be another occasion to say it,” Meyers said. 


	Speaking specifically about Kimmel, Meyers also spoke about the “massive national backlash” to the FCC attempting to silence the host. “I haven't seen a poll yet, but I think if you asked Americans if the president should be dictating what TV hosts can and can't say, you'd get about 3 percent positive and…” Meyers said before cutting to a clip of Trump saying, “97 percent negative.”


	On Monday, Disney has reached a formal decision to bring Kimmel back to the ABC airwaves just one week after his indefinite suspension following statements he made on Jimmy Kimmel Live about Charlie Kirks' assassin and after a threat from President Trump's FCC chair.


	“Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,” the Walt Disney Company said in a statement. “It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”

	Days after Kirk's murder, Kimmel questioned the political affiliation of the killer. “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them,” he said, “and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”

	











	Yesterday, the ACLU released an open letter signed by over 400 celebrities speaking out in support of Kimmel. Signees included Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Robert De Niro, Jane Fonda, Selena Gomez, Tom Hanks, Olivia Rodrigo, Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Michael Keaton, Regina King, Diego Luna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Natalie Portman, Maya Rudolph, Martin Short, and Kerry Washington.

Kamala Harris praised Disney‘s decision to return Jimmy Kimmel to the air during an interview with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC last night. 


	“Talk about the power being with the people and the people making that clear with their checkbooks as it relates to the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel,” Harris told Maddow. “We saw the power of the people over the last few days, and it spoke volumes and it moved a decision in the right direction.”


	During the interview, Harris referred to Donald Trump as a “tyrant” and said he is “abusing the power the people vested him with.” She reflected on the president's efforts to control the actions of corporations like Disney, who caved to pressure from the FCC when they pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live off the air last week. Harris noted that corporate leaders seem to want to “please” Trump. 


	“I always believed that is push came to shove, these titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions,” Harris said. “And one by one by one, they have been silent. They have been — I use the word feckless. It's not like they're going to lose their yacht or their house in the Hamptons.”

	She continued, “I am a lifelong public servant. I've worked closely with the private sector over many years. And I always believed that if push came to shove, those titans of industry would be guardrails for our democracy, for the importance of sustaining democratic institutions. And one by one by one, they have been silent. Perhaps it is because they want to please him and nominate him for a Nobel Prize. Perhaps it's because they want a merger approved, or they want to avoid an investigation, but at some point they've got to stand up for the sake of the people who rely on all of these institutions to have integrity, and to at some point be the guardrails against a tyrant who is using the federal government to execute his whim and fancy because of a fragile ego.”

	Harris explained the the issue is “bigger than Donald Trump.” “So when we talk about where the fight must go, there is the aspect of it that is about the immediate moment, such as the weight of the federal government being used to silence critics, citizens, and it must be about understanding that this did not just happen overnight, and we have to pay attention to an agenda that is not going to necessarily go away when this guy is finally turned out of office,” she said. 


	Elsewhere in the conversation, Maddow asked Harris about her relationship with Joe Biden. In her book, Harris wrote that Biden's decision to run for re-election was driven by “recklessness.” Harris told Maddow she takes responsibility for contributing to that. 


	“So when I write this, it's because I realize that I have and had a certain responsibility that I should have followed through on,” she said. “And so when I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself.”


	Maddow asked Harris if she would consider running again in 2028. “That's not my focus right now,” Harris responded. “That's not my focus at all. It really isn't.”

	Last week, Harris blasted ABC and Disney's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live. “What we are witnessing is an outright abuse of power,” Harris wrote on X, without mentioning Kimmel directly. “This administration is attacking critics and using fear as a weapon to silence anyone who would speak out. Media corporations — from television networks to newspapers — are capitulating to these threats.”

Elon Musk's estranged father, Errol Musk, is facing several allegations of child sex abuse involving five of his children and stepchildren, according to a new New York Times investigation.


	The allegations against Errol, 79, were detailed in police reports, court records, personal letters, and interviews with family members and social workers. The alleged incidents occurred in South Africa, where Errol lives, and California. 


	Errol — who has not been charged with, or convicted of, any crimes — denied the allegations against him. He told the Times that “the reports are false and nonsense to the extreme.” He suggested the family members were “putting the children up to say false things” to get money from Elon. 


	Several allegations in the story center around a former stepdaughter from Errol's marriage to Heidi-Mari Bezuidenhout, his third wife. The earliest alleged incident occurred in 1993 when the stepdaughter (from Bezuidenhout's first marriage) was four years old. Errol allegedly placed her on a row of trash cans at the family's home in Pretoria, South Africa, and touched her. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The stepdaughter told her aunt about the alleged incident, and the aunt and other relatives reported it to the authorities. An investigation was opened, but the charges were withdrawn as part of a divorce settlement with Errol. (Bezuidenhout and Errol would marry and divorce twice.) 


	Errol claimed that following this divorce, a judge granted him custody of his daughter with Bezuidenhout, and two judges rejected the stepdaughter's abuse allegations. But the Times could not find court records or judges capable of verifying Errol's claim. 

	











	Around 1999, Errol and Bezuidenhout remarried. In 2002, they traveled to California to visit Elon (Errol's oldest child from his first marriage, to Maye Haldeman), who bought them a $2 million house in Malibu. During their stay, according to family members and personal notes, the stepdaughter, by then 14, walked in on Errol in her room allegedly sniffing her dirty underwear.

	The police were called and a complaint was filed with child protective services in Los Angeles. (A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment to the Times, and the LAPD denied a records request.) A restraining order was issued against Erroll, according to three people.


	Errol denied the allegation, saying he had been cleaning up his stepdaughter's room after returning from a trip and finding the house “in a terrible state.” 


	Afterward, Elon reportedly moved his father from the Malibu house to a boat in Los Angeles, and then back to South Africa. But Errol claimed he left the United States on his own, though he was soon reliant on Elon and his brother, Kimbal, for financial support. 


	While Elon reportedly explored keeping Errol's children and stepchildren with Bezuidenhout in California, and even becoming their legal guardian, the family chose to return to South Africa in 2003. Bezuidenhout and Errol divorced again in 2005, though in 2009 they reconnected. Around that time, the stepdaughter, now 21, claimed that Errol kissed her and stuck his tongue into her mouth. 


	She detailed the incident in an application for an interim protection order in South Africa, in which she wrote of Errol, “I don't want him to be allowed to come close to me.” The application was granted.


	Errol denied the allegation and claimed that his stepdaughter “inappropriately kissed” him while he was sleeping.

	As an adult, the stepdaughter struggled with drug abuse and homelessness. She told the Times that she tied her drug use to the trauma she experienced growing up. While Elon provided some support to the stepdaughter from afar, when she was 29, the stepdaughter reached out to Errol for help as well. The two became intimate and had at least one child together. (The stepdaughter has said they had one child, while Errol has suggested in other interviews that they may have had more. He told the Times it was “none of your business” how many they'd had.) 


	In 2022, Errol allegedly groped their five-year-old son, according to family members. Bezuidenhout texted a relative the following year, “He said, ‘dad gropes his behind.' He screamed, ‘no dad.'” A police investigation was opened, but prosecutors ultimately dropped the case due to insufficient evidence.

	











	Errol said of the allegation, “There was no evidence because this is nonsense.” 


	The other allegations of abuse against Errol were mentioned in the application for the interim protection order filed by the stepdaughter. She claimed that Errol also abused one of his stepsons, who later died in a car accident, as well as his two daughters with Bezuidenhout.


	While the stepdaughter did not provide details, Bezuidenhout did reference abuse allegations from one of her two daughters with Errol in a letter she sent Elon around 2007. Another relative mentioned the same allegations contained in the protective order in a note sent to Elon in 2010. 


	Errol called the accusation that he abused his stepson “nonsense,” and the claims involving his daughters “absurd.” 


	Elon declined to comment for the Times story, and a representative did not immediately return additional requests for comment.

	Over the years, Elon has been frank — if not exactly full of details — when discussing his problems with his estranged father. In a 2017 Rolling Stone story, he called Errol “such a terrible human being,” but did not provide specifics. “My dad will have a carefully thought-out plan of evil,” he said. “He will plan evil … You have no idea about how bad. Almost every crime you can possibly think of, he has done. Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done.”


	In Walter Isaacson's 2023 authorized biography, Elon said his father had been “uncomfortably attentive” to his stepsister. He added that he was angry with Errol for his “inappropriate behavior.”

Jimmy Kimmel will return to his namesake show starting tonight. This follows Disney's decision to pull him “indefinitely” last week following comments the late-night host made about the conservative response to Charlie Kirk's killing.


	 The widely publicized decision by ABC's parent company raised concerns about the health of free speech in America, and followed FCC Chair Brendan Carr's threats against Kimmel's show. The decision to pull the show led to a flurry of criticism from politicians ranging from Barack Obama to Gavin Newsom. Even some Republicans, including Ted Cruz, criticized Carr's actions. 




	Kimmel's show airs at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC. That said, not every ABC affiliate will carry the show. Sinclair, the conservative media group that owns 39 ABC affiliates across the country, including in Washington, D.C., will not air Kimmel's return to his late-night slot.




	Undoubtedly, many people will want to hear what Kimmel has to say when he returns to the air on Tuesday. If you're looking to stream Kimmel's first show back, but don't have cable, here's what you need to know.











		DirecTV is one option to stream ABC live, and it includes the local channel across its packages. Plans include a five-day free trial. 	











		Fubo is one option for streaming ABC live, and includes other local channels plus premium cable channels in its lineup. 	











		Hulu + Live TV includes ABC in its package and comes with a free three-day trial. Hulu is also the streaming home for ABC shows, if you want to watch the show the next day after it airs. 	


	In a statement announcing the decision to reinstate Kimmel, Disney said, “Last Wednesday, we made the decision to suspend production on the show to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country. It is a decision we made because we felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive. We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday.”




	How insensitive Disney execs actually found Kimmel's comments is up for debate. According to reporting by Rolling Stone on the night of Kimmel's suspension, “Multiple execs felt that Kimmel had not actually said anything over the line, the two sources say, but the threat of Trump administration retaliation loomed.”

	It's a great time to be into fanfiction. 


	The space is currently in the throes of a digital gold rush for content seekers and creators. There's something for everyone, about practically anything. But fanfiction, long a force in the corners of the internet that managed to escape the commercial monotony of tech consolidation, has broken its containment. People have noticed what's happening on places like Wattpad, Archive of Our Own, and FanFiction.net. As online communities like BookTok erode the barriers of entry to the spaces associated with fan work, things are changing. 


	One not-so-secret secret of the publishing and entertainment industry is that for years now fanfiction forums have been a fertile ground for harvesting content aimed at mass market appeal. E. L. James' Fifty Shades of Gray, Cassandra Clare's The Mortal Instruments, and Ali Hazelwood's The Love Hypothesis all began their published lives as fanwork — about Twilight, Harry Potter, and Star Wars, respectively. Fanfiction is by law free for public consumption, because to sell it would be to violate the intellectual property rights of the original work's author or creator. Where publishers would once take pains to try and bury the origins of works adapted from fanfiction for traditional publication, these days, amid the explosion in public interest, they're leaning in. 

	











	Enter Alchemised, the debut novel of the Portland based writer who goes by SenLinYu. But Sen already has legions of fans who adore their storytelling, have for years clung to her every post and update, and have read the digital equivalent of thousands of pages of her writing. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Set to be published on Sept. 23, Alchemised is an adaptation of Sen's wildly popular Harry Potter fanfiction Manacled, written on the fanfiction hosting website Archive of Our Own between 2018 and 2019. The “dystopian horror story” and “tragedy,” as Sen has described it, explored an alternative universe that loosely melded together the worlds of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. Centered around a morally fraught romance between Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy (a “Dramione,” for those uninitiated to fandom lingo) the plot is decidedly dark. The Order of the Phoenix had lost the second wizarding war, and all manner of war crimes are being committed in the aftermath of Voldemort's triumph. Death, rape, medical abuse, and torture abound, happy endings don't exist.

Manacled gained a devoted following. On BookTok, reading the fic — and chronicling the devastation of the reading experience — became a right of passage within the Harry Potter fanfic community. In February 2024, Sen announced that they had reached a deal with Penguin Random House to rewrite Manacled and publish it as an independent novel. That December, when it was removed from Archive of Our Own in preparation for Alchemised' publication, Manacled was the second most read work ever posted on the platform. 


Alchemised is the most anticipated release in a series of Harry Potter fanfiction adaptations released over the course of 2025, nearly all of them centered around  “Dramione” romances. The book has now been stripped of any intellectual property belonging to the original works — in this case Rowling or Atwood's books. To Sen, that process was almost liberating. “I really enjoyed that because it gave me a lot more room to move around and let the story evolve into itself. It also let me really craft the story in a way that was much more intentional,” they tell Rolling Stone.


	There is no hiding Alchemised's origins, and the built-in following of a popular piece of fanfiction is the type of marketing agencies have wet dreams about. Sen is selling out release events virtually overnight, and the movie rights to Alchemised have already been purchased by Legendary Entertainment — the production company behind titles like Dune, Inception, and The Dark Knight Rises — for over $3 million.

	Fanfiction benefits from the existence of an established universe, characters, plot, and story dynamics that writers can use to create all manner of storyline and imagined scenarios without having to build new worlds from scratch. To rewrite a piece of fanfiction for consumption outside of its contained fandom is to remove and replace the support structures within the work, and hope it stands on its own. 

	











	Sen describes the process as a cathartic exercise they “can't imagine“ repeating with any of their other fan works. In Alchemised, magic is replaced with alchemy, the esoteric science of metal transformation and element-based immortality. Draco and Hermione become Kaine and Helena, England becomes Paladia, the dark arts become necromancy, and Harry Potter becomes Luc Holdfast. When it debuts to the public on Sept. 23, Sen's legions of already devoted readers will likely spend hours picking apart what was changed between the two works. Sen is undaunted. 


	While many of their readers may already know the outlines of Alchemised's plot, and are incredibly attached to the fic, it's Sen's hope that the two works will exist independently of each other for readers. “It was really a process for me to accept that [the readers] have Manacled,” they tell Rolling Stone. “That knowledge gave me the confidence to just be like ‘I cannot write this story to the same people that already have that one.'  I have to let them have that and I need to let this story stand on its own.” 


On Monday night, about 900 fans gathered at a sold-out release event at a Barnes and Noble in New York City, and gushed over the prospect of finally having a copy of the already beloved book in their hands. None of those who spoke to Rolling Stone had anything but confidence in Sen. “It has been such a journey getting here, and I'm so appreciative of all your support and excitement every step of the way,” they told the crowd, as the clock struck midnight. 


	The applause rattled every shelf in the building. 


This interview contains spoilers for Alchemised.


What was the adaptation process like?  How did you deal with knowing there were things in Manacled you were going to have to let go of to make it work as an independent novel? That was definitely hard. Especially because I was in the community with the people that were reading it, and was aware of the things that they really loved. During the first draft, when I was doing the rewrite, and even into the second one, I was really struggling with the idea of, “If I change this, people will be upset and over-weighting that concern in a lot of my decisions. Trying to make the story work around what I thought people would be upset about if I changed, rather than focusing on the story itself and trying to make the story into the best version that it could be. I gave a very big warning so people can download Manacled. The people that want that version — who are deeply invested in that version — I tried to give them a lot of time to make sure that they had that version saved [before it was removed from Archive of our Own.]

	











	I didn't want it to be chained to an external context. I want what was in Alchemised to really speak to the story that Alchemised was. And then in that process, it let me really drill down, like into the various characters and thematic elements — the things that I specifically wanted to more deeply explore in Alchemised. 


Was there any particular storyline, character dynamic, or character arc you struggled to translate to Alchemised from Manacled? I had the two core characters, Kaine and Helena. I knew that there were certain things about them, their character psychology, their background, that I really needed to maintain and make sure that I nailed with them. But for the rest of the cast, I felt pretty capable of developing the characters, figuring out what I needed. I have the character that I need for this story. I need a different archetype. I need a different figure. 


	Like Helena and Lila, I developed them as foils to each other. I very directly tried to craft them as inverted mirrors of one another, and then the experiences and the things that they go through are reflective of those different characteristics. 


	Trying to develop Luke (Harry Potter in Manacled) was definitely one of the characters that I spent a lot of time contemplating, just because he is not present for the first part of the story. You witness Helena's grief over his death, and yet you don't really know him. Actually, the reference that I drew for him when I was trying to develop him, trying to show to readers why he was so important to Helena, was the [Japanese manga] show Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. That story also starts with a group of characters, and by the end of the first episode, one of them is dead, and you just barely see him. And then you start getting to know him through the flashbacks and you only learn about him through the context of these memories. 


	So that was something that I referenced when I was developing Luke, trying to show why this loss was so meaningful to Helena, why she had fought in this horrific war. Because I did want that relationship to make sense, even though it wasn't something that people were going to come in understanding the context. 


That is one of the great advantages — and disadvantages —- of fanfiction: the canon is there, the lore is there. Did it feel like you were taking off the restraints of the existing Harry Potter universe? Obviously, I've written a lot of other fan works, and I did not imagine ever redoing Manacled into something original. But having now gone through this process one time, I even more so can't imagine doing it with any of the other [fics.] With Manacled, it was a story concept that started with a question and then a theme that I wanted to explore. Fan fiction was just the space in which I was writing at the time. It wasn't that I had the idea as a fan work, it was that I had this idea, and I was doing fan work, and so that's where I put it. 

	











	So when I decided to turn Manacled into Alchemised, I knew that I had this relationship dynamic that is very intrinsic to the story, then these are the themes. These are the questions that I was wrestling with when I was writing Manacled. And then there were a lot of the other things — the things that were not intrinsic to either those themes or questions or that specific relationship dynamic — where I could do whatever I wanted. It gave me a lot more room to maneuver and rebuild in a new world around the story. So I'm trying to change things, but not too much, because the whole thing breaks if I change too much. 


Sexual assault, in the style of The Handmaids Tale, is a central part of Manacled's plot, but you've changed some things in Alchemised. How did you go about adapting that part of the story in a way that was both sensitive to the subject matter, but still made sense for the plot?  The initial concept for Manacled came from watching The Handmaid's Tale TV show, and it wasn't about the surrogacy thing. The question that initially inspired it was, “What if [Fred Waterford] was a spy?” What should they do in this situation? Do they blow their cover because they consider this to be an unforgivable act, and then whatever they're doing to try to bring this regime to an end that's just lost now? Or do they commit this horrific act for the sake of this larger picture? It's kind of a trolley problem. 


	When I was starting to write it as a fan work, I knew that I had this mystery that I wanted to set up, and I was very nervous that people would key into it, because it was the second story that I'd ever written.  So I leaned very, very hard into the visual and aesthetic of Handmaid's Tale. I was really new to writing, and so was very much like, “I want you to feel this way, so I'm going to just plop down this thing that I know is familiar to people, so that you will feel that.”


	So when I was working on Alchemised, I initially considered not having that element whatsoever in the story. Because that's obviously a very controversial, dark element to have in the story — and the story already has a lot of other very dark elements. The reason that I ended up deciding, ultimately, to include it in a different iteration, was that I was encountering a lot of talk about eugenics in mainstream conversation among people that were oddly not conscious that they were talking about eugenics. Where it was all about economic losses if the population doesn't stay at this level, or you should not have children unless you are this kind of person with this kind of money, who has gone to therapy, who has no trauma. So I felt it was a timely element to include in the story both positive and negative eugenics, having a story that dealt with both of those things felt relevant to all of the rest of the dynamics going on, it felt relevant to the war history.

	











	The other thing was that in the relationship dynamic of Kaine and Helena, I didn't want her to forgive him of a general crime against other people. So the the dark, deep end that he goes off of is in response to losing her, in response to trying to save her, is it had to be this really personal thing that happened between them. They're hers to decide to forgive him for and whether you agree with that choice on her part or not, the idea was hopefully that you would at least understand why she would make that choice. If they stayed together, escaped, and everything at the end, and they're together, it's because she's forgiven him of this thing that he didn't do to her, but he did to all these other people. It felt disingenuous not actually dealing with the consequences of the actions and the choices that they made and the extremes that they went to in order to try to save one another.


You did a lot of research for the adaptation. Talk to me about that process, what you were looking into? I've always had a passing interest in alchemy, so when I was trying to figure out what would be an interesting world-building concept that I could have a lot of fun with, and that felt different from most of what I was seeing in a lot of the sci-fi and fantasy that I was reading, alchemy just came to me.


	Specifically, a little bit like Avatar: The Last Airbender, and the whole idea of being able to move and manipulate metal. Because that could be really cool for fighting in combat — because I knew I was writing a war story — so I knew I needed some sort of magic system that made for really interesting combat. And then alchemy, obviously, is very tied to metallurgy, but then it also has this whole element of being very obsessed with immortality and wealth and purification. And so all of these different very interesting elements that play into power struggles.


	Humans have been obsessed with the idea of immortality, so if you were using alchemy to somehow be able to do things to the human body, where does that end? So that was where I started. I went and I got a bunch of books about the history of alchemy, and I was actually one of the first things I did was actually go and read a bunch of interviews with the author of Full Metal Alchemist. I knew I loved the world building, the transmutation circles and everything, that are in Full Metal Alchemist. So I was reading up about her work, and it was actually really funny, because she said that she tried to research it and be really accurate with it, and alchemy research was just so contradictory and didn't make any sense. So she was able to be like, “I'm just going to do what I want to do with it then.”

	











	I was like, okay, I guess that I'll do that too. I'll research enough to have an idea of what the consistent elements are, and then I can just do whatever I want. But then I ended up coming across this YouTube lecture by this on this channel, Esoterica, and the host did this interview with a Johns Hopkins scientist who has been researching alchemy and actually translating all of these old alchemical recipes and testing them and trying to be as accurate as possible, and then trying to test them and see what happens. And it has caused this sort of wild reckoning in the alchemy research world, where all of a sudden they're having to do all this reevaluation. 


	The other big piece that I ended up discovering through that was that the metallurgists and alchemists from that period were very, very influenced by Aristotle and his work, which was very informed by Plato, and the whole idea of the heavenly forms. The idea that if the Earth is able to produce all of these things, and if we could just recreate those recipes, we can make those things too, and that there's this heavenly ideal somewhere that we're aspiring to on Earth. So it gave me a ton of not only world building for the practicalities of alchemy, but a philosophical background for building the whole world up from scratch. That's part of why Paladia is super vertical, because, again, they're trying to go up. And there's this whole idea of the higher up you live, the closer to the heavens, the closer to the sun, the more you can associate yourself with the pure element. The closer to the divine, the more divine you must be — and so then you're able to create.


	Then from that you have the society that's birthed this whole class system and this whole social hierarchy and everything. 


Did you explore any other magic systems?Or did you settle on alchemy pretty quickly?I settled on alchemy pretty quickly, for two main reasons. One was that the whole ethical conundrum of necromancy seemed like such a great sticking point. Part of the reason that idea came to me was because I was having a conversation with a friend about organ donation, and she had this super, super visceral reaction to the idea of organ donation — that anything — happening to her body after she was dead. 


	And I was like, “You are not there anymore. It's just a corpse, why would you care what they do with it?” But she was like, “Absolutely not. I would never want anyone to do anything to my body.” So that sparked in me this idea that this would be such a sticking point ethically, of people who would see a corpse as a resource. Do you want your son to go fight in a war? Or would you rather just use this dead body that doesn't feel anything? Versus the other side that would be like, “That is the worst violation of anything messing with the dead, disrespecting the dead is like, the decline of all of civilization would begin right there.” 

	











	Then I thought, “If I have one side using necromancy, what does the other side have?” And so alchemy, and the philosophical ideas surrounding alchemy, all kind of interplayed into those same themes of immortality and metalwork. 


	Going in, I knew that I wanted the character of Kaine to be associated with Ares, and Ares is associated with iron, and iron is the metal of war in literary motifs and mythology. So knowing that I wanted that familial [metallurgical] association to be built into the story, alchemy played really well into that. I was these little tiny things that just ended up all feeding really well into each other,


Having read a lot of your fanfiction — and your blogs — you've always approached your stories with a lot of intent. Fanfiction gets a bad rep sometimes of not being a serious artistic endeavor. Having existed in the space for so long, I'm curious how your feelings on fanfiction have evolved. Do you still plan to do fic work? So I love writing fanfic, it's definitely not something that I think I would ever leave behind.


	It's such a contained space, especially for if you're trying to develop some new technique or write a style, or scene, or type of action, or sex, or whatever that you haven't done before and you don't have to invent the whole context.


	You can just be like, “Alright, I know these two characters, I know the situation. I can just go from there.” It's great. I wrote so many one shots, because I love being like “I want to write about this specific thing, and that is all that I'm writing.” 


	But the thing with fanfiction is that it is like drawing with a pencil, the range of what people are doing because they have a pencil and a piece of paper in hand is humongous. Somebody can be incredibly serious about their art, and so they are going to draw these absolute masterpieces with graphite, versus a kid who is doodling in the edges of their school notebook. 


	People tend to look at fan fiction and they just see the one thing that some people do with a pencil. There's so many other things that people can do with fan fiction. To me, part of the appeal of fandom is that it can be this common ground for putting out new ideas, it's art in a very artistic space, where you're not doing this because you're trying to make money, you're not trying to sell anything. You are very much writing this thing because it is interesting to you, and you're doing it in your free time.

	When I came into fanfiction, I wanted to write something, and I knew that whenever I tried to write something original, I would hit two or three chapters in, and I would just be consumed with self doubt. I would be certain that it was terrible, and I wouldn't have anybody to show it to, and then I would just give up. And I would say, “Well, maybe someday I'll write, but not today.” So when I decided to write fan fiction it was specifically because I thought if there are people reading this because I'm posting this online, I'll feel obliged to keep doing it, and I won't abandon it. I would feel too guilty to abandon it, so I have to finish it.


	People come in for a million different reasons. My hesitation now is that fan fiction has really exploded into the mainstream, and there is a lot more of this weird pressure of people that it needs to be polished to a certain degree. That it needs to have effort and nuance to it. That makes me sad, because I just do feel like it is such a fun, creative space that is so communal. I'm very concerned but hopeful that fandoms will weather it, because it is so much a space that's born from shared passion.

Spider-Man: Brand New Day is pausing production for a week after Tom Holland was injured on the set last Friday.


	As Rolling Stone previously confirmed, the actor suffered a mild concussion and took a break from filming out of an abundance of caution. Details regarding Holland's accident remain unknown, and no one else on set was injured during the incident.


	Directly following the incident, production was set to continue. However, on Monday, a source told Variety that production will pause for a week and that shooting is set to continue on Sept. 29, while the film's July 31, 2026, release date will not be impacted.


	A rep for Holland did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Spider-Man: Brand New Day will be the fourth edition in the franchise, and while Jon Watts directed Holland in the previous three Spider-Man films, the upcoming movie is being helmed by Destin Daniel Cretton.


	“It's day one, my fourth ever day one on Spider-Man. It's funny, putting the suit on, it feels different this time, somehow. It's also the first time we ever had fans on set day one, so it's really exciting to share this with them,” Holland said on set in a the video released by Sony last month. “We've got some familiar faces on set. I'm just going to do my best, hopefully get it right, no pressure.”

Album Of The Week



The 5 Best Songs Of The Week


French titans Phoenix have long been tight with the dance music world, and their new project depends on that connection. The band's most recent album was Alpha Zulu, which came out in 2022. Since then, they've collaborated with people like Beck, Pusha T, and Kavinsky, and they gave a triumphant performance at the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics. Now, Phoenix have joined forces with Alan Braxe and DJ Falcon, the veteran French dance producers known collectively as Braxe + Falcon, to launch a new project called UFOs. It has nothing to do with the '70s metal band UFO, but it does have something to do with actual unidentified flying objects.

Braxe + Falcon, two cousins who have deep roots in the world of French Touch dance music, officially joined forces to release the Step By Step EP in 2022. They also remixed Phoenix's Alpha Zulu single “Winter Solstice.” For all we know, UFOs might exist only to release one single: the new song “UFO,” which they describe as “six friends, one song, infinite memories.” If that is the case — if the group is fated to only release one song ever, like Stardust with “Music Sounds Better With You” — then they've made sure that one song is a good one.

On “UFO,” Thomas Mars sings about love and flying saucers — “I don't believe in miracles, but I do believe in UFOs” — over a percolating haze of keyboards. It's lovely. Warren Fu directed the video, which adds alien spaceships to a bunch of comfy-looking vintage photos, including images of the six musicians involved. Check it out below.



“UFO” is out now on Domino/Smugglers Way, with a limited edition 12″ version only available at some independent record stores. Read our We've Got A File On You interview with Phoenix here.

EERIE footage shows the moment a mysterious V-shaped UFO ""bigger than the stars"" hovered over a Los Angeles neighbourhood.

The clip shows an illuminated object lighting up the night sky as it flew over the city for 30 minutes before disappearing. 

Two residents spotted the UFO from their balcony and immediately pulled their phones out to film it. 

The V-shaped UFO appeared to be black, with extremely bright lights fitted along what appeared to be the hull. 

The footage was submitted to the National UFO Reporting Centre (NUFORC), a volunteer-operated nonprofit group that's been collecting UFO reports since 1974.

One of the bewildered witnesses said the puzzling UFO appeared to linger in the air, only slightly moving before disappearing. 

They added: ""While sitting on my balcony, I saw a light in the sky bigger than stars usually appear.

""It moved around a little bit but didn't go too far. At the end, it just flew off in the south direction until I couldn't see it anymore."" 

While some conspiracy theorists believe it could be an alien craft, others say the object could have been a secret aircraft, a drone, or an ultralight plane.

The boomerang-shaped object also appeared to have a small body at its centre, making it look similar to an F-117 Nighthawk Stealth Fighter. 

However, that plane, built by the US Air Force, is a stealth jet meant to be almost invisible to escape flight radars. 

There have been several reports this year which specifically mention seeing a V-shaped wedge or triangle with multiple lights along its surface flying over the US, according to NUFORC. 

It comes after the first-ever bombshell footage of the infamous ""Mosul orb"" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq was released.

The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul.

Interestingly, the four-second footage shows the UFO flying at a constant speed without dropping altitude.

The object appeared suddenly and moved erratically in and out of the camera's view.

The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell.

It comes two years after the first still image from the video was declassified by the Pentagon.

Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled.

The videos released in the declassified cases are said to have been observed by US military drones.

The footage showed a mystery ""metal orb"" as it hovered and flew across open airspace.

The incidents were believed to have been recorded in the Middle East and South Asia.

Americans are curious and fascinated about aliens more than ever.

US intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard vowed to ""share the truth"" on UFOs after saying she believes in aliens and that extraterrestrials are real.

The Director of National Intelligence in Donald Trump's administration hinted that she has a lot of classified information on aliens, but is forced to remain tight-lipped due to her job.

Speaking with Pod Force One podcast host Miranda Devine, Gabbard was asked if ""there could be aliens"".

The US intel chief replied: ""I have my own views and opinions. In this role, I have to be careful with what I share.""

Devine then asked Gabbard if she believes aliens and UFOs are real, to which she replied: ""Yes.""

She said that right now she has ""nothing to share with the public about aliens and UFOs today"".

But she vowed to reveal the truth when the time comes.

""We're continuing to look for the truth and share that truth with the American people,"" Gabbard told the New York Post podcast host.

Lancashire based tech business Universal Atmosphere Processing (UAP), which has developed a pioneering carbon reduction and gas recovery system, has closed a significant funding round.

As part of the raise — which involved institutional, public, and private investors — UAP utilised the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), a government-backed initiative offering tax relief to early-stage startup investors.

By leveraging SEIS, UAP successfully secured a six-figure sum in funding from angel syndicates, including Lancashire County Council's Fhunded Angels network.

With the new investment, UAP will accelerate production of its Mk1 Atmospheric Processor — a proprietary unit capable of capturing high-value noble gases and CO₂ directly from ambient air.

To oversee development of the Mk1 system, UAP has appointed Dr James Myers, former head of aerospace R&D at Victrex, as its new head of engineering.

Founded by Brendan Cornthwaite in 2022 and headquartered at LCC's Fraser House innovation hub, UAP has attracted attention from global scientific institutions.

Its patented technology recently secured a research grant through CERN's Venture Connect programme, supporting the co-development of sensor components which are integral to UAP's system.

In further recognition of its breakthrough technology, UAP was recently selected as one of the top 100 startups in the world by SLUSH, the prestigious global tech summit held annually in Helsinki.

The company will present at the event in November, joining an exclusive cohort of startups considered to have significant global impact potential.

Brendan is also a recipient of the UK Space Agency's Visionary Award, which led to UAP's inclusion in the UKSA's C-LEO programme.

Brendan Cornthwaite, UAP founder and chief executive said: “I'm incredibly grateful for the backing we've had — including the investment secured from the Fhunded Angels community — which will allow us to take this technology to the next stage.

“But for me, this round isn't about celebration. It's about execution. It's about finally building the hardware that's been in my head for over two years — and proving that atmospheric separation can be done differently.

 “Support from CERN, the recognition from SLUSH, and having colleagues like James joining the team gives me the confidence that we're on the right track. And I want to thank Fraser House for being the foundation — it's where UAP started, and where I found the belief to keep going.”

Rory Southworth, LCC's early-stage equity finance lead who manages the Fhunded Angel network, said: “Brendan has been fully engaged with the Fhunded programme since its inception, and we were confident from the outset that we could help him raise the investment needed to turn UAP's vision into reality.

 “It's a great story of local entrepreneurship gaining international traction — and being selected for SLUSH 100 this year underlines just how much global interest there is in what Brendan is building.”

Coun Brian Moore, cabinet member for economic development and growth at Lancashire County Council, said: “Brendan embodies everything that Fraser House and the Fhunded programme were set up to support - an ambitious, resilient entrepreneur building high-value technology with global relevance. He is a fantastic ambassador for Lancashire innovation.”

In addition to its funding success, UAP will join the UK government's upcoming trade mission to South Korea and Japan, followed by attendance at COP30 in Brazil.

As part of the raise – which involved institutional, public, and private investors – UAP utilised the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS), a government-backed initiative offering tax relief to early stage startup investors.

By leveraging SEIS, UAP successfully secured a six-figure sum in funding from angel syndicates, including Lancashire County Council's (LCC) Fhunded Angels network.

With the new investment, UAP will accelerate production of its Mk1 Atmospheric Processor – a proprietary unit capable of capturing high-value noble gases and CO₂ directly from ambient air.

To oversee development of the Mk1 system, UAP has appointed Dr James Myers, former head of aerospace R&D at Victrex, as its new head of engineering.

Founded by Brendan Cornthwaite in 2022 and based at LCC's Fraser House innovation hub, UAP has attracted attention from global scientific institutions.

Its patented technology recently secured a research grant through CERN's Venture Connect programme, supporting the co-development of sensor components which are integral to UAP's system.

In further recognition of its breakthrough technology, UAP was recently selected as one of the top 100 start-ups in the world by SLUSH, the prestigious global tech summit held annually in Helsinki.

The company will present at the event in November, joining an exclusive cohort of start-ups considered to have significant global impact potential.

Brendan is also a recipient of the UK Space Agency's Visionary Award, which led to UAP's inclusion in the UKSA's C-LEO programme.

He said: “I'm incredibly grateful for the backing we've had – including the investment secured from the Fhunded Angels community – which will allow us to take this technology to the next stage.

“But for me, this round isn't about celebration. It's about execution. It's about finally building the hardware that's been in my head for over two years – and proving that atmospheric separation can be done differently.”

He added: “Support from CERN, the recognition from SLUSH, and having colleagues like James joining the team gives me the confidence that we're on the right track. And I want to thank Fraser House for being the foundation – it's where UAP started, and where I found the belief to keep going.”

Rory Southworth, LCC's early stage equity finance lead who manages the Fhunded Angel network, said: “Brendan has been fully engaged with the Fhunded programme since its inception, and we were confident from the outset that we could help him raise the investment needed to turn UAP's vision into reality.

“It's a great story of local entrepreneurship gaining international traction – and being selected for SLUSH 100 this year underlines just how much global interest there is in what Brendan is building.”

Cllr Brian Moore, cabinet member for economic development and growth at Lancashire County Council, said: “Brendan embodies everything that Fraser House and the Fhunded programme were set up to support – an ambitious, resilient entrepreneur building high value technology with global relevance. He is a fantastic ambassador for Lancashire innovation.”

In addition to its funding success, UAP will join the Government's upcoming trade mission to South Korea and Japan, followed by attendance at COP30 in Brazil.","{'href': 'https://www.thebusinessdesk.com', 'title': 'TheBusinessDesk.com'}","other"

Is life possible—or has it ever been possible—on other planets? The (Origin of) Life Marker Chip (LMCOOL) seeks the answer. This innovative chip is being developed by a Dutch consortium led by TU Delft. UT researcher Jurriaan Huskens and his team are going to make the optical sensor selective for the required biomarkers.

A Dutch-built instrument capable of detecting traces of life on Saturn's moon Enceladus—that is the ultimate dream of TU Delft researcher Niels Ligterink. Over the coming years, he will work with around thirty colleagues from various Dutch companies and knowledge institutes on the (Origin of) Life Marker Chip (LMCOOL).

The invention is best described as a tiny yet complete laboratory in the form of a computer chip. It is ""pre-programmed"" to identify specific molecules in liquids; molecules that could point to life, such as amino acids.

""You can best compare our chip to a keyhole, with the molecule we are searching for as the key,"" explains Ligterink, ""Because only one key fits in the keyhole, we can be almost 100% certain that we have captured the molecule we are looking for when we detect something with our chip. This makes our lab-on-a-chip revolutionary.""

UT researcher Huskens adds, ""An important step forward is that we are going to selectively recognize a mirror image of an amino acid. After all, living organisms make only one of the mirror images, and so this recognition is essential to determine whether the amino acid comes from a life process or not.""

The idea for the Life Marker Chip (LMC) was first proposed more than twenty years ago for ESA's ExoMars mission. Although ESA eventually selected other instruments for that mission, the consortium partners remained enthusiastic about the concept. With financial support from the NSO Instruments Program, the instrument is now being further developed so that it can be used on a range of future planetary missions.

One of the greatest advantages of the new LMCOOL is its compact size and low weight. Current life-detection instruments on Mars are the size of a microwave oven and weigh between ten and twenty kilos. By contrast, LMCOOL will be about the size of a soft drink can and weighs only 700 grams. In space exploration, where every kilogram of launch mass matters, the Dutch chip offers a lightweight yet high-performance alternative.

At the heart of LMCOOL lies integrated photonic chip technology. The Netherlands already has extensive experience with this technology in medical applications, but it has never before flown in space. A key challenge is to test and prepare the chip for use in the extreme conditions of space.

In Delft, researchers are investigating under what circumstances—such as extreme temperatures, radiation and vacuum—the chip can function reliably, and what measures are needed to keep the system operational during a mission to Enceladus. Here, the expertise of Space Systems Engineer Vidhya Pallichadath MSc, who has worked on several space missions, is of great value: ""Through prototyping, test campaigns and refining the design, we are increasing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of the instrument."" At UT, the optical sensor is being made selective for the required biomarkers.

""This is where the support of the NSO is crucial for us,"" says Ligterink. ""Thanks to the Instruments Program, we can continue developing LMCOOL, enabling us to qualify as a supplier for both small and large European space missions, for example, a future mission to Saturn's moon Enceladus.""

Around thirty engineers and scientists from TU Delft, Lionix, TNO, and the universities of Twente, Utrecht, Cranfield (UK), Leicester (UK), Colorado Boulder (U.S.) and the Open University (UK) are contributing to LMCOOL over the coming years. They are turning promising ideas into concrete blueprints for building a fully functioning prototype. Meanwhile, the chip is being tested extensively to develop the most stable receptors (keyholes) and to validate them under a wide variety of extreme conditions.

The global search for extraterrestrial life continues to capture the imagination, Ligterink notes. In his view, the Netherlands must claim a prominent position in this field. Partly because of the country's strong expertise in planetary research and astrobiology, and partly because investing in technology drives innovation, start-ups and economic opportunities within and beyond the space sector.

""And of course, the biological and medical breakthroughs that may follow once extraterrestrial life has been discovered and can be studied further,"" Ligterink adds. If LMCOOL does make its way to Saturn, it will not be for at least another 25 years. Analyzing the scientific results will then take a further decade.

""By that time, my colleagues and I will be approaching retirement age,"" says Ligterink, ""But that does not stop us from devoting ourselves fully to this instrument. If you want to compete at the top level of planetary research, you have to be willing to invest for the long term.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","“I've seen UFOs up there”: that's how the UFO viewing meetings are in Montserrat","https://barcelonasecreta.com/en/ufo-montserrat/","Tue, 23 Sep 2025 15:55:25 GMT","

Every 11th, the magical mountain of Catalonia becomes the meeting point for dozens of people looking for answers in heaven.

Montserrat, the mountain of unmistakable silhouette, is not only a spiritual and cultural reference of Catalonia. At nightfall every 11th, its rocky contours become the scene of a peculiar modern liturgy: the search for unidentified flying objects. Dozens of ufology enthusiasts, convinced believers and the curious congregate in the hope of witnessing something extraordinary.

The starting point of this unique pilgrimage is the Hotel Bruc, an establishment that is already part of the mythology of the place, and has been featured in series such as The Messiah.

 A post shared by barcelonasecreta (@barcelonasecreta) 

In its cafeteria, conversations revolve around past sightings and theories about extraterrestrial life. “I've seen UFOs up there, that's why I always come on the 11th,” says with conviction one of the veteran attendees, who claims to have been contacted years ago by beings who warned her of “very fat things like COVID.”

The atmosphere in Montserrat is, as one of the participants describes, that of “a mountain with a lot of energy”. This feeling, shared by many, creates an atmosphere very conducive to believing that you may have seen something. It is a mixture of suggestion and faith that feeds the expectations of the night.

Among the attendees, opinions are diverse. There are those, like one young man among those interviewed, who firmly believe that “there are a few extraterrestrial races living here on Earth.” Others imagine these beings as a person, “like you and me”.

There is no lack of skeptical counterpoints. Like the one who comes moved by a “healthy curiosity” and argues from a more rational perspective: “I don't think anyone has come from another planet yet”.

For him, the idea of humanoid extraterrestrials responds to  “a very anthropocentric vision”. Despite his skepticism, he values the experience positively: “It's fun to see the conversations, what people who have been coming for a thousand years explain”.

As the night progresses, the groups ascend to a lookout point, a “U.F.O. ZONE” improvised according to a graffiti on a rock. Equipped with folding chairs, drinks and their eyes fixed on the firmament, they wait for the signal.

 One man recounts a paranormal experience: “We saw a light come out of a peak. It silently plummeted down. And that was in milliseconds. My partner saw it and we were both amazed.”

Far from the stereotype, the atmosphere is one of normality and good vibes. It is an outdoor social gathering, a “big picnic,” as one of the interviewees describes it, where stories are shared and the evening is enjoyed.

In the end, the question of what they would do if “those in green” finally showed up gets mixed responses. “Let them take me to see what's out there,” replies one woman with a chuckle, quickly adding that she wants a “return trip, of course.”

Believer or skeptic, fan of the UFO phenomenon or simply someone looking for a different plan, the night of the 11th in Montserrat becomes a canvas for the imagination and the hope of not being alone in the universe.

Mark Sheppard was the devious demon Crowley (who was born a Scottish lad named Fergus MacLeod) who eventually ascended to the crown of Hell, while sometime allying with Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles). He recurred in Seasons 5 through 9 and had a main role in Seasons 10 through 12. Though the British actor left the show under less-than-happy circumstances, Crowley went out in the 12th season's finale with a final satisfying grand gesture: sacrificing himself to seal Lucifer in Hell. Many fans, as we were, were sorry to say goodbye to the wry demon.

Nevertheless, the veteran actor happily appears at numerous SPN conventions in the States and abroad with his longtime colleagues. TV Insider spent time with the generously talkative Sheppard at Creation Entertainment's New Jersey event in May.

Why did you get involved in the Supernatural convention world?

Mark Sheppard: What's fascinating is that sci-f and genre shows tend to get canceled or they atrophy on their own. What is interesting about Supernatural is it has grown bigger through what we lovingly call the Supernatural Family that shows up at conventions. I learned one year at San Diego Comic-Con that these fans raised $2.5 million dollars for a children's charity! What sets Supernatural apart is that the theme of the show is good versus evil, the idea that you do the right thing and the outcome, ultimately, may be difficult, dangerous, and deadly, but will still be something that is worthy of the endeavor. These themes in a time like this are rather special. I've been on shows that have a lot of meaning, like Battlestar Galactica and Firefly and Trek series, that had meaning. But Supernatural has this extra ingredient, the connection between the actors, the characters, and the audience.

For example?

I make fun of Misha [Collins] on a regular basis because it's easy to do. But the man builds hospitals and schools and rescues people from foreign countries. That side of him is unbelievably worthy. And the boys [Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki] have a lot of causes. So, we put forward those causes which we invest our time and our effort into, and the Supernatural Family makes it a million times bigger. My son is a type 1 diabetic, who went to Camp Conrad Chinnock that was for diabetic kids, and a person who used to come to Creation's Supernatural events had discretionary budget for charitable donations from a trust that she had. She literally bought the entire camp's wish list for the year my son attended, and not just bought it, but shipped it! So, all these actions that I've seen over the years are way, way bigger than a little show first on the WB and then The CW.

How did you first come to fan conventions?

 I showed up at a few conventions starting with The X Files‘s first season. I saw the power of how it brought people together. My dad [the late actor William Morgan Sheppard] was in several Star Treks and there was a massive amount of attention for those cons, so I saw the positivity there. I saw people that maybe didn't have a lot of friends or were a stranger in a new city or people with serious disabilities that precluded them from some social agenda. But then conventions became places where everyone was totally accepted.

Beyond conventions, the Supernatural set always had a reputation for kindness. I observed the warmth and fun myself when I visited the show in Vancouver several times. Did you feel that way?

I think what's really fascinating, not many people talk about this, is that Jensen and Jared made a decision very, very early on, when [the late] Kim Manners was running the show, what their behavior was going to be when they worked. They knew that this series was a phenomenon and could be something that had longevity and meant something. And they made a decision to behave. I mean, that's who they are, but they made a decision to outwardly behave in a manner that was so appealing for people to come and work. Actors were treated in a manner that was absolutely superb. That was the tone of the set. And that's why when I got married — I married “a fan” — 160 odd people from actors to electricians to painters to whatever came from Vancouver to my wedding in California on their off week in black tie to celebrate. We truly operated as a very large, wonderfully dysfunctional family. But that tone they created also affects the way we behave here. We take care of each other in order that we can take care of our audience. We try to give them best time we can.

For example?

We're always looking at ways that we can make the cons more fulfilling. We have the concert on Saturday night, which is something I thought was vital to do because we've got so many great musicians — not amateur musicians, professionals. It's always been a high spot in that way. Yes, this is commercial. There's money involved, and that's why we want to give them a wonderful experience. There's a statement we use if someone is new to the fan community: “You are going to make friends.” And they do, often traveling all over the world together to visit the cons. It's such an honor to be able to be present at these events. As a friend of mine said, “You've got such a tough job, then you go somewhere and 3000 people tell you they love you and explain to you why.” It's fantastic.

What's at the heart of this special status Supernatural has?

Supernatural never deviated from themes that tend to unite people in an altruistic form of life. It's not brain surgery, but it is good for the heart and good for the head. I've had people tell me, “The show saved my life.” My response? “No, you did that, but we were happy to help.” I can't go anywhere in the world without somebody going, “Crowley!” Even when I was entering the hospital [when he was suffering heart attacks]. The entire TSA is a demographic that seems to watch Supernatural. I'm going through international customs like the King of Hell.

Not bad considering you weren't one of the heroes of the show and….

I am one of the heroes. How dare you? He absolutely killed less people than the Winchesters!

[Laughs] I will have to check that.

You do. [Note: We may have seen Sam and Dean kill more, but Crowley was, after all, a murderous demon for 300 years.] Crowley ran Hell, and he hated it! All he wanted was to be buddies [with Sam and Dean] and have fun.

Well, considering his mother, the Scottish witch Rowena turned Queen of Hell (Ruth Connell), he didn't have much of a chance.

That's not Crowley's mother, it's Fergus's mother. Fergus MacLeod was a 4'6” Scottish crofter [who sold his soul] who had no bearing on this meat suit. Ruth, however, was fantastic in the role. It might have been even more fun had she been his ex-wife.

What has Supernatural done for you?

I'm so happy to be part of it; my life would not be the same without Supernatural. I refused to be a series regular for about four years. I was busy doing other wonderful things, and it would limit me to be in there. I was offered another series by then CW president Mark Pedowitz, and I went, “I don't think I'm done on Supernatural.” Which was a great choice. I went back for one episode and ended up staying there eight years. The writers didn't particularly write for me; I'm not in any of the flagship episodes. I'm not in “French Mistake,” I'm not in “Baby,” I'm not in “Scoobynatural.” There's no “Weekend at Crowley's.” So, my job was very interesting. There were about 20-30 writers who loved the character but basically would say, “Let's throw this to Mark” — like spaghetti against the wall — “and see what the hell he does with it.” So I'd be, “How do I get to navigate this?” It really was a fantastic endeavor for about six or seven of those eight years. And then, the end served a purpose, and it never really resonated for me.

Was there a favorite episode where everything worked?

We never had enough money or enough time, but we all wanted the show to be the best thing we could make. And we loved the excitement we felt when we knew something had worked. I'd say “Sacrifice,” the episode ending Season 8, is my favorite. It's when I was having the human blood injected into me and we were in a church. It's ridiculous how good it was. It started with [ancient demon] Abaddon [Alaina Huffman] and me tied to a chair, and it ends up with Sam injecting me with human blood. And then the angels start falling through the sky.

That was a great episode; so much happened, including to Crowley, then the King of Hell.

Yes. So through that process, we're outside in the worst weather possible to shoot the outside of a church where the crew nearly died. The winds were insane. I mean, it's as bad as BC [British Columbia] weather can possibly be. We then moved inside to the stage, and we shot all of that in sequence, which is quite rare to do. The working crew who were allowed to talk between set-ups didn't make a sound for two days. None of us made a sound, we were so into what we were doing. I sat chained to that chair for two days. I wouldn't even get up most of the time. Because it was right. Everybody had everybody's back. And Jared will say the same thing. We all put a lot of love into it.

And it seems into the entire show.

Yeah. I've been lucky to do some wonderful shows in my career, but somehow this sort of encompasses all the silliness, the sadness, the darkness, and the lightness of life. And that's what's most important to me.

ATHENS, Ohio (WOUB) – In this episode of Conversations from Studio B, WOUB's Emily Votaw talks with Cleveland-based author Neil Sater about his most recent novel, Atrocity: The Haunting of Moravian Village.

The book tells the story of Sean Davidson, a teenager whose life takes a sudden, nightmarish turn after a mysterious stranger emerges from the night and intrudes on a deliberately strange campfire gathering with his best friend.

The supernatural forces that terrorize Sean are fictional, but their roots lie in a very real historical tragedy: the Gnadenhutten Massacre, also known as the Moravian Massacre.

On March 8, 1782—towards the end of the American Revolutionary War—Pennsylvania militiamen led by David Williamson brutally killed 96 unarmed and pacifist Native Americans, nearly two-thirds of them women and children, at the Christian mission village of Gnadenhütten, near present-day New Philadelphia, Ohio.

In the interview, Sater discusses working closely with representatives of the Native American tribes connected to those who died in the massacre. He also discusses his efforts to raise awareness of this history and the inspiration he finds in rural Ohio—specifically, Tuscarawas, Coshocton, and Holmes Counties—which he fictionalizes as Homer County, the setting for Atrocity, as well as his two other horror novels: Phantom Realm: the Haunting of Misery Mansion (2023) and Mercy Killing: the Haunting of Ghoul House (2024).

If you're a fan of classic sci-fi shows like The X-Files and The Twilight Zone and are looking for a book that can scratch that itch, Little Visitor & Other Abductions may be just what the doctor ordered. This graphic novel brings together three of cartoonist Adam Szym's alien abduction tales - ""A Cordial Invitation,"" ""Little Visitor,"" and ""Frolicker"" - into one creepy package.

With Little Visitor & Other Abductions in stores now, IGN can exclusively debut a new preview of ""A Cordial Invitation."" Check it out in the slideshow gallery below:

Little Visitor & Other Abductions is written and drawn by Szym. The book is published by Oni Press and distributed by Simon & Schuster. Here's the official description of the book:

The cast and crew of an obscure film recount a tragedy that occurred during its doomed production. A young girl searches for her father in the darkness of the desert and stumbles upon an otherworldly cocktail party. Two strangers nurture violent thoughts in a bitter, lonely child as his village's harvest festival nears. Connecting these three stories is one horrific theme . . .

From cartoonist and illustrator Adam Szym comes a triptych of otherworldly science fiction horror stories about alien abduction and the negligence and malice that allows it to happen. Including the Ignatz Award–nominated A Cordial Invitation, Little Visitor, and a brand-new tale—Frolicker—this uncanny trilogy of graphic novellas is perfect for fans of The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and all things beyond our understanding.

Travis Smola   09.23.25


Cryptid animals ride that fine, blurred line between ancient myth and reality. Every corner of the globe has an alleged animal still unknown to modern science. This is not a new phenomenon. Stories about these creatures are hundreds or even thousands of years old. Native American legends have countless tales that stir the imagination, especially for those who frequently visit the outdoors. Correspondingly, many modern-day reports come from avid hunting, fishing, and camping enthusiasts who spend most of their time outside.

Science tends to be skeptical of these legends, but there is enough fact to keep things interesting. With thousands of eyewitness reports of mysterious beasts that fly, creep, and crawl, there must be something more to it. This is not an extensive look at all the evidence, but we will look broadly at the various categories of what defines a cryptid. We will also briefly examine the most interesting and famous ones said to inhabit the United States today.

In simplest terms, the Dictionary defines a cryptid as “a creature whose reported existence is unproven, such as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.” Unlike mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns, these animals often have at least some documented eyewitness reports associated with them. Scientific circles usually treat these reports skeptically, but the stories are intriguing, nonetheless.

Other known animals often lumped into the cryptid category include ones thought to be previously extinct. For instance, the Tasmanian Tiger, or Thylacine, is a real animal native to Australia and Tasmania that was declared extinct in 1982. However, unconfirmed reports show that the species might still be periodically roaming wild, remote areas. Cryptids also include unconfirmed reports of animals in places where they are not native. One typical example is reports of big cats like mountain lions and panthers outside their home range.

Subsequently, the term “cryptid” has become nebulous in nature. It is usually safe to use as a blanket term for any mysterious or unknown animal.

Persistent tales of cryptids have given rise to the field of cryptozoology, which studies hidden animals. Technically, most scientists still consider this field to be “pseudoscience.” However, a handful of professionals have studied cryptids for decades, despite the ridicule. A prime example is Jeffrey Meldrum, a professor of anthropology at Idaho State University. He has openly studied the possible existence of sasquatch for nearly 30 years.

Most skeptics are quick to dismiss claims of cryptid animals. It is hard to blame them when there is a lack of concrete evidence. However, there are notable exceptions. One prominent example is the giant squid. Once a thing of sailors' stories, it wasn't photographed in the wild until 2004. Dead ones had washed up on shore, but a confirmed sighting in the wild eluded science for years.

Another good example is the Okapi. The unusual, horned creature inhabits an isolated area of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Scientists treated eyewitness reports with the usual skepticism for years. The striped ungulate is incredibly weird-looking, so we understand the skepticism. However, in 1901, a native tribe provided British explorer Harry Johnston with a skull and pieces of skin. Later, scientists confirmed the elusive Okapi was the only living relative of giraffes.

For years, the only known record of the coelacanth was fossils. This unusual fish has been around long enough to watch the dinosaurs come and go from this planet. Thus, the scientific community was shocked when a fishing trawler hauled in a live specimen off the coast of South Africa in 1938. It turns out they had been alive and well the whole time. Conversely, local anglers scratched their heads in bewilderment at the excitement of the discovery. They had known of the coelacanth's existence for generations.

Granted, none of these cryptid discoveries are as exciting as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster. However, the Okapi and coelacanth prove it is possible for large, unknown animals to hide on our vast planet.

Legends of a tall, hairy, man-like creature are often the first thing most people think of after hearing the word cryptid. Every corner of the globe has some variation of this beast. Stories of Bigfoot date back centuries and are part of Native American lore in the United States. These creatures are six to eight feet tall and weigh over five hundred pounds. Their bodies are covered with black or brown hair. These creatures allegedly leave behind large, three- or five-toed footprints.

Bigfoot's most famous sighting was in 1967, when the Patterson-Gimlin film was captured in Northern California. Scientists and skeptics still debate the authenticity of this film.

The behavior of these creatures varies from report to report. Most describe a shy, elusive beast that tries to avoid human contact. However, a handful of reports describe an animal that is aggressive towards humans. For instance, in 1924, a Canadian man named Albert Ostman claimed a family of the creatures kidnapped him for six days. Another group of Sasquatches allegedly threw rocks at miners in a Washington cabin near Mount St. Helens the same year. Subsequently, the area of the attack became known as “Ape Canyon.” However, such tales are extremely rare. Most reports are fleeting sightings.

Most sightings originate in the Pacific Northwest, specifically Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. However, beasts with similar descriptions have earned various pet names across the U.S.

Bigfoot: The classic, tall, man-like beast with five toes that inhabits the Pacific Northwest. Standing six to eight feet tall, with long, dark hair. They are very vocal. Reports of behavior vary.

White Thang: Alabama's most famous cryptid has bright red eyes and hair that is as white as snow. Most reports come from sloughs in the northern part of the state.

Mogollon Monster: The nickname for Arizona's resident Bigfoot legend, most seen in the northern part of the state near the Mogollon Rim. Described as being seven feet tall, brown, or reddish-brown, and very smelly.

Fouke Monster: The red-eyed, three-toed monster seen for years in and around the tiny community of Fouke, Arkansas. Sightings reached their peak in the 1970s. Consequently, this legend gained worldwide fame after the release of the 1972 documentary “The Legend of Boggy Creek.”

Selbyville Swamp Monster: This hairy creature allegedly stalked the swamps of southern Delaware back in the early 1960s. Witnesses described dark hair and the beast's terrifying scream.

Skunk Ape: As the name implies, an incredibly smelly Sasquatch-like beast, most seen in the Florida Everglades. Usually described as brown or reddish-brown, they are around five to six feet tall. A handful of videos and photos that allegedly show the beast do exist.

Momo (Missouri Monster): The name given to the monster sighted during a terrifying 1972 Bigfoot encounter in eastern Missouri. This led to an influx of sightings of a dark-haired beast with large glowing eyes.

Taku-He: South Dakota Bigfoot with roots in Lakota Native American legend. This creature sometimes has supernatural qualities.

Tennessee Wildman: Another red-eye creature said to have a horrific scream. The Wildman has red or gray hair and stands around seven feet tall.

Unknown animals soaring through America's skies are a slightly rarer cryptid type. Most eyewitness reports describe creatures larger than a known bird. The reports of winged cryptids can be wild. For instance, the hooved Jersey Devil's demon-like appearance feels like something straight out of American folklore. Others, like the Thunderbird, are closer to a normal bird, only oversized.

Most of these stories are incredibly old. The Thunderbird legend has roots in traditional Native American tales. Reports of winged cryptids describe everything from oversized birds to alien-like creatures from another world. Some of these reports include sightings of UFOs and other strange phenomena in conjunction with the creature reports. America's more famous winged cryptids include the following:

Jersey Devil: An unusual, winged, and hooved cryptid, most famous in New Jersey. Thousands of reports have come from the state's Pine Barrens area over the last 250+ years.

Teratorns: Gigantic, prehistoric vultures that allegedly survived to modern times. New Mexico claims the most sightings of this lost bird.

Thunderbird: This gigantic bird is a Native American legend that sometimes controls the weather through the beating of its wings. Most often reported in North Dakota. One allegedly tried to carry away a 10-year-old boy during a famous 1977 incident in Illinois.

Mothman: Red, glowing eyes are a key feature of this bat-like creature. Point Pleasant, West Virginia, was the epicenter for sightings in the 1960s. Sightings before a famous bridge collapse in 1964 have led some to label Mothman as a harbinger of tragedy.

Van Meter Visitor: A pterosaur-like oddity sighted in Iowa in 1903. Old newspaper reports describe it as having an “unusual glowing horn.”

The Loch Ness Monster is the most famous water cryptid in the world, but it is far from the only one. Reports of water monsters span the globe. North America is no stranger to these tales. The common similarity in these reports is that the sightings take place either in or near water. Water cryptid tales seem localized in nature. Residents know the tales, but they usually fly under the radar of mass media.

The one exception in the United States seems to be Lake Champlain's plesiosaur-like “Champ.” Reports of that monster date back to the early 1800s. P.T. Barnum once put a bounty out for the live capture of the creature.

Sea serpents and plesiosaurs are the most common water cryptids. However, there are some real oddities here. For example, the otherwise unremarkable town of Churubusco, Indiana, is allegedly home to an oversized snapping turtle named Oscar. Loveland, Ohio, turned their unusual 1970s “Frogman” reports into a town mascot and source of tourism.

Unfortunately, none of the United States' water cryptids have come close to Nessie's fame, but they still make for fun legends. America's most famous water cryptids include:

Alkali Lake Monster: Nebraska legend about an alligator-like beast. Reports date back to the late 1930s.

Champ: The plesiosaur-type creature in New York and Vermont's Lake Champlain. Sightings of this creature date back hundreds of years. Analysis of a 1977 photo has been unable to prove or disprove its authenticity.

Tahoe Tessie: Lake Tahoe's resident sea serpent legend that allegedly lives in the deepest, darkest depths of the lake.

Altamaha-ha: This monster is a mix of Native American legend and early Georgia folklore. The creature is allegedly 10-30 feet long and has a head resembling that of a crocodile and a body resembling that of a sturgeon.

Sharlie: Reports of this sea serpent in Idaho's Payette Lake date back over one hundred years. Eyewitnesses claim this creature was 40 feet in length.

Beast of Busco: A dining room table-sized Indiana snapping turtle named “Oscar.” Locals tried using traps and even dynamite to capture it, without success. This legend has a local yearly festival named after it.

Sink Hole Sam: An unusual sea serpent legend for land-locked Kansas. Reports sometimes describe a giant eel or worm.

Pocomoonshine: An ancient Native American legend about a 30-foot sea serpent in Maine's Pocomoonshine Lake. Sightings of this creature date back to the late 1800s.

Loveland Frogman: Four-foot-high humanoid frogs were sighted in Loveland, Ohio, in 1972. This cryptid is now the official town mascot.

Oklahoma Octopus: An out-of-place giant octopus allegedly inhabiting the state's manmade reservoirs.

Colossal Claude: Oregon's Columbia River is allegedly home to this 40-foot-long sea serpent. The most notable sighting happened in 1937.

Block Ness Monster: Rhode Island's resident sea serpent legend. Beachgoers found a mysterious carcass in 1996. However, the body disappeared before scientists could study it.

Bear Lake Monster: Utah legend about a 50-foot creature inhabiting Bear Lake since the mid-1800s.

Other cryptids have descriptions that defy all classifications. These creatures couldn't fit into any other category. For instance, the Enfield Horror's three legs and red eyes do not match any known Earth animal. Other tales, such as the human hybrid Goatman, feel like straight-up science fiction. Consequently, some of these stories have become modern folklore. However, other cryptids still have origins in Native American legends and lore. Overall, these reports are straight-up weird.

The unusual descriptions of these creatures have led to speculation that they came from another world. Two prime examples are the hairless Dover Demon and the Hopkinsville Goblin incident in 1955. In the Hopkinsville incident, eyewitnesses reported a UFO in the sky before the creature's arrival.

Tornit: An Inuit legend about a tribe of wild men in Alaska. However, unlike other Native legends, the Tornit allegedly once lived peacefully alongside the Inuit. Often referenced in tandem with stories about Bigfoot.

Slide-Rock Bolter: Lumberjacks popularized tales of this fish or whale-like creature in the Colorado mountains.

Melon Heads: Small, humanoid creatures with large heads reported in several states. Connecticut's Fairfield County is a frequent area for sightings.

Menehune: Traditional Hawaiian folklore about a tribe of tiny people who live in the forest. Only children can see them.

Enfield Horror: A bizarre, three-legged jumping creature seen multiple times near Enfield, Illinois, in 1973.

Hopkinsville Goblins: Three-foot-high, gremlin-like creatures that attacked a Kentucky farmhouse in 1955. Eyewitnesses said the creatures were impervious to shotgun blasts.

Rougarou: A werewolf-like creature popularized in Louisiana's Cajun folklore.

Goatman: Maryland's strange half-man, half goat legend. Goatman became famous for attacking cars late at night.

Dover Demon: A four-foot-tall creature with a featureless face except for a pair of red eyes. The sightings happened near Dover, Massachusetts, in April 1977.

Michigan Dogman: Werewolf-like creatures seen throughout the state. Lumberjacks first reported sightings of Dogman in the 1890s. However, the legend did not enter pop culture until the release of a popular song in the 1980s.

Wendigo: A terrifying Native American legend about humans turning into cannibalistic monsters. Wendigo has at least two real-life murders involving cannibalism associated with it.

Pascagoula Aliens: Unusual humanoids with crab-claw hands that captured two anglers in 1973. The men claimed the creatures took them aboard a UFO.

Shunka Warakin: A cryptid hyena or werewolf-like canine hybrid spotted in Montana.

Woods Devils: The nickname given to New Hampshire's resident Bigfoot Lore. However, this one has a twist. The Woods Devil sometimes has tree-like features.

Beast of Bladenboro: An alleged big cat that terrorized Bladenboro, North Carolina, in 1954. This beast left behind dozens of dead dogs, chickens, and rabbits in its wake.

Squonk: A stout, ugly creature of Algonquin folklore said to inhabit the forests of Pennsylvania. Legend says that when captured, the Squonk dissolves into tears and vanishes.

Lizard Man of Scrape Ore Swamp: A gigantic, seven-foot lizard reported by South Carolina residents. It had a reputation for chasing and scratching cars.

Chupacabra: Spanish for “goatsucker.” This creature has two descriptions. Early reports were of a reptilian beast. More recent reports depict something closer to a feral dog with mange. Reports range across Mexico, Puerto Rico, and the southern United States.

Bunny Man: An urban legend of Maryland and Virginia of a man in a bunny costume. He allegedly smashed the windows of multiple cars with an axe.

Beast of Bray Road: Wisconsin's resident werewolf-like creature legend. Most sightings occurred in the 1990s, primarily in and around the town of Elkhorn.

Jackalope: Regular rabbits that have antlers. These unusual creatures have become a symbol of Americana and a fixture in tourist traps of the Western U.S.

The dark woods feed into our imagination, making it easy to imagine the wondrous and mysterious beasts that inhabit the shadowy areas. There have been times when I sat in a treestand in the pre-dawn hours, while knowing an animal was in front of me. However, due to the darkness, I couldn't properly identify whatever was snapping twigs and breaking brush. Plenty of outdoor enthusiasts have had similar experiences hunting, fishing, and camping.

Thus, it is little wonder that cryptid stories hold special significance in American pop culture. These stories tap into our natural curiosity about the unknown. Consequently, even the skeptics must admit that these tales make our lives more interesting. At the very least, it is fun to speculate about what else might be out there.

While we may be living in an information age, that doesn't mean the planet has spilled all its secrets. Scientists continue to find and classify hundreds of new species every year. Knowing that, we hold out hope that some of our favorite cryptids eventually make it onto the lists of known animals. Until that happens, we will continue to enjoy the mysteries for what they are.

They say people find psychics in times of crisis. During my most recent crisis, David The Medium found me. Or, more accurately, his publicist did.David had been a hot topic in the office when the email came in asking if I'd like a private reading with one of the most in-demand psychic mediums in the country, and the only one to hold public readings at the Sydney Opera House — twice.Our beauty director had seen him for a reading a few days earlier, and he had told her spooky, uncanny things that she was adamant no-one could have known: like a fleeting comment she'd made to her brother — and then forgotten about — two days prior; he'd correctly named people in her life on the first attempt; he told her she would receive signs from family members who'd passed away in the form of magpies, which then began appearing in the most unlikely of places and behaving really weirdly.

During these conversations, only one person (the magazine's fact-checker, go figure) attempted to poke holes in her reading. Some things, sure — we're admittedly in a sort-of-public-facing industry, so we're easy to find online. But unless David The Medium is to magpies what the Wicked Witch of the West is to flying monkeys, or he's in the habit of bugging people's friends and family members in the days leading up to their readings, it's all pretty astonishing. (Although, if he was able to identify, locate and mic-up close contacts while they remain none the wiser, would that be more impressive than communicating with the spirit realm?)

So when his publicist reached out to me offering that private reading, the idea had become irresistible. Plus, truth be told, I was in crisis (and, importantly, in denial about being in crisis)

Any other time, I probably would have passed on the invitation. I've never been one to feel curious about how my life is going to turn out, even though I have the kind of anxiety that suggests otherwise. And as a lapsed Catholic, I still have a hint of No, that's not right, someone grab the Holy Water when it comes to the idea of lingering spirits. I'm also scared of hearing something I can't unhear. And also, isn't talking to my deceased loved ones just going to be really, really sad? 

But in the three-month lead-up to that email, a lot had happened. My aunt died. I finished a huge, months-long project that had consumed me entirely. I'd been drinking too much wine and not enough water. I'd been staying up late and getting up early. I was not exercising at all, and then exercising too much. Then, my partner's father passed away, and the very next day, my sister gave birth to twins. 

I told people it was just emotional whiplash. My body had other ideas: days-long vertigo, weekly migraines, parainfluenza (a diagnosis I was frustrated with because it wasn't as dramatic as how I felt. Yes, I am a Leo, thanks for asking), and an eye twitch and a rash that, come to think of it, still haven't gone away. 

So, two funerals, another deadline. Another migraine. Baby cuddles (thank god for them). Fighting with the landlord, moving house (in the rain, because, of course). More baby cuddles. Another deadline. As someone who usually thrives on the chaos of having multiple stories on the go at once, it felt like my fingers were made of lead too heavy to type with.

And still — crisis, me? No way. The people around me are going through things so much harder: it wasn't my sister or my dad who passed away; they're not my newborn twins; I'm not the editor of the magazines that are going to print; we were only moving upstairs, not even to a different building. There's a genocide in Gaza and a war in Ukraine and there are people that are dying, Kim. Nothing was happening to me, just around me. How I was feeling was not a big deal, really. And yet. 

So, I said yes please and thank you to David The Medium's publicist. My reading was scheduled for three days before my birthday. The timing felt auspicious. 

I see now why millennials and gen Z are turning to psychics instead of therapists. My reading with David felt like the most enlightening therapy session of my life — most likely because I wasn't being called out for any of my bullshit and was neither encouraged to reflect on my actions nor take accountability for them.

Instead, it felt like everyone I've ever loved who has passed away was stopping by to simply say, “Hello, I love you, and I see you.” It wasn't sad, it was euphoric. I don't remember walking back to the office — I'm pretty sure I was floating.

The way David The Medium works is this: he has a bunch of the ‘claires': clairvoyance (psychic vision), clairgustance (taste), clairsalience (smell) and clairsentience (physical sensation). He essentially lends his body, mind, voice and senses to the spirits, and then communicates for them. That sounds nightmarish to me, but thankfully, he knows how to switch it off. The spirits can offer predictions for up to 12 months into the future, and can even comment on other people in your life who are still alive — like inter-realm gossip.

David wasn't always psychic. He was thriving in the corporate world when he went to see a medium with a friend, almost as a joke. She immediately spotted that he had the gift and sent him to a psychic mentoring program. At first, it was a party trick. Then, as word spread, so did his popularity. Now, the 38-year-old is in full-time contact with the other side.

During the reading, he rarely looks at me — except to laugh at a joke one of my family members makes, or ask for confirmation on a name he's guessed (spoiler: always correct) or for more context about a message that's coming through. Mostly, he has his eyes closed and is tapping the arm of his chair with his fingertips, like spiritual Morse code. 

As the first spirit enters the room, my scepticism immediately slips out the door behind it. It's my partner's dad. I'd been wondering if he'd show up: maybe it would be too soon; maybe his memory loss meant he didn't know me, so when the alarm sounded in the other realm that Alexandra English was waiting, he didn't know to come forward; maybe he retained his cynicism even on the other side; maybe none of this was real. 

“A man has followed you into the room,” David says. “He's not your dad, but he's someone's dad. Is there a [insert my partner's correct name here]?” I'm floored, but also trying to appear unflappable. I don't want to accidentally give anything away. I say yes, there's someone with that name in my life, but I don't mention that it's my partner. “[This spirit] knows you didn't think he'd come today,” David continues. “And he knows that you think he wouldn't know you, but he wants you to know that he does know you.” David goes on to correctly name my partner's father, and how he passed — and when. He even speaks with the right sense of humour. “He's mainly here to tell his son he loves him, and to test him because he knows he won't believe this.” David laughs at that.

David correctly names my immediate family members, who are all living. “Who's Daniel?” My brother. “Who's Elizabeth?” That's my sister's middle name. “Oh yes, Megan Elizabeth” Correct. “And who's Jac?” My other sister, Jacqueline. “What about Lee, Leo?” Leonie, my mum. He doesn't get “Geoff” for my dad — I think it was the G instead of a J that threw him off.

He talks about my sister's newborn twins: a boy and a girl. Our family jokes that my niece has been here before; she just has that vibe. “Your niece, she's been on earth before,” David says. “Oh?” I say. My resolve is crumbling. “Her last memories are of sitting around with her grandkids, and she closes her eyes and then she wakes up and she's a baby again and she thinks, ‘What the fuck is this?'” Now we're both laughing. That sounds right. 

David goes into great detail about my other sister's work drama, explaining that she needs a new job and suggests a different industry that, to me, doesn't sound like a natural fit. When I speak to her that afternoon, it turns out she's applied for a job in the exact industry he mentioned. A week later, she gets the job. 

He asks me if I've moved or am moving (at this point, we were in one apartment while waiting for cleaners to come to the other) and warns that the bathroom fan doesn't work. That's weirdly specific and accurate. When I tell the electrician that I called him because a psychic told me to, he doesn't really react. Maybe he's heard this before. Maybe he wants to get away from me.

Some parts of my reading are less shocking: David says I'm iron-deficient and that I want to go to Europe next year (I am exactly like the other girls). He says I should watch out for potholes; that there are changes coming at work. There are some parts of my reading that a sceptic could “A ha!” at: I've posted all my siblings on my Instagram at some point, so even though their profiles are private, you can see their names; he knows where I work; he could have checked obituaries for mine and my partner's surnames. But the manpower behind that level of in-depth research for multiple readings a day, and then the sheer ability to remember it all — I'm not convincingly unconvinced. I do think this is real. There was too much that was unknowable. 

As the reading is wrapping up, David asks, “Why is everyone up here singing ‘Happy Birthday'?” That's when I finally burst into tears. I'm misty-eyed writing this even now, imagining grandparents, my partner's dad, my aunt, long-lost friends all huddling together for a chorus of “Happy Birthday”.

A funny thing happened when I went to see my therapist next. I noticed that I was not giving her any information — I was waiting for her to guess; to contact the spirit realm and tell me what was going on with me. She was asking questions, and I was resisting answering them for fear of giving anything away, of falling for a “trick”. For the first half of our session, I gained absolutely nothing because I was not a willing participant until I snapped out of it.

And so I don't think we should be replacing our therapists with psychics. We need to vocalise what's going on in our lives and minds and take active steps to try to better our lives, with the help of a curious and knowledgeable professional. Occasional encouragement from family members in the other realm who can see that we're on the right track and want to tell us they love us is just the cherry on top. If you believe in that kind of thing.

David The Medium will be at the Sydney Opera House on October 18. He will continue his tour across Australia and New Zealand. For tickets and more information, see here.

A Utah musician accused by a Michigan State University professor of being an insider in the QAnon conspiracy theory and political movement has sued the professor and other MSU faculty and officials, alleging the professor has continually defamed him with her allegations.

Thomas Schoenberger also claims he received death threats and online harassment after MSU Communicative Sciencesprofessor Laura Dilley made comments on social media suggesting he may be to blame for the 2023 shooting at Michigan State University.

Schoenberger's lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court, filed Aug. 7, alleges Dilley has been harassing him on social media, repeatedly defaming him online and in research papers, saying he is behind QAnon, a far-right conspiracy theory that originated in 2017. Its adherents allege Satan-worshipping pedophiles control the Democratic party, the media and Hollywood, and that President Donald Trump is leading the fight against them.

Schoenberger does not ask for any particular damages in the lawsuit. A status conference is scheduled for Nov. 6.

This lawsuit stems from a paper Dilley wrote titled “QAnon Propaganda on Twitter as Information Warfare: Influencers, Networks and Narratives."" Schoenberger's lawsuit alleges Dilley's paper contained “false and outlandish allegations of and concerning Thomas Schoenberger, such as that he was the mastermind behind QAnon, that the Cicada 3301 alternate reality game (puzzle) is a direct link with QAnon, and that Thomas belongs to the IAM Cult.”

The theory that Schoenberger is involved with QAnon stems from his organization, Cicada 3301, and the complicated puzzles it has published, according to Barry Powers, Schoenberger's attorney. People began theorizing that it was a way to identify and recruit highly intelligent people into the CIA, Powers said.

A 2014 Washington Post story called the Cicada 3301 puzzles one of the Internet's ""eeriest, unsolved mysteries.""

Schoenberger created the Cicada 3301 puzzles, but denies any link to QAnon, Powers said. Powers called Dilley's paper ""yellow journalism"" and ""sensationalism.""

""If you boil down 100 pages into two words, it's 'yellow journalism.' It's ideology masquerading as scholarship,"" Powers said. ""On a basic level, my client is being attacked to this very day by officers and professors at the university, and that's not tolerable.""

MSU spokesperson Emily Guerrant declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing the pending litigation. Dilley called Schoenberger's lawsuit ""very weak"" and said her defense is strong.

""The purpose of the paper was to give an entry point to further study on networks that might be involved in spreading QAnon, and Thomas Schoenberger's account was selected as one to query for further study,"" Dilley said. ""My opinion is the lawsuit is frivolous, that it is vexatious litigation, that it should not have been brought in the first place.""

Schoenberger, of Utah, is a 64-year-old composer and musician. He created Cicada 3301 to bring together creative individuals and inspire people interested in history, music and culture, according to the lawsuit. It is not a political group, the suit says.

Both Dilley and Schoenberger have accused the other of harassing them, but only Schoenberger has taken legal action on it.

Dilley's paper, published in 2021, described what she called evidence of large-scale coordination among accounts promoting ""QAnon propaganda,"" which may have led to Russia and corporate entities' use of social media to undermine the U.S.'s democratic process. Her paper looks at five studies of QAnon's spread through social media.

In her paper, she sampled thousands of accounts on Twitter for data — including Schoenberger's, she said.

The first mention of Schoenberger in the paper is in a paragraph about connections between QAnon and ""so-called 'alternative reality games'"" and live action role play. She said people who promoted Cicada 3301 were involved in the early promotion of QAnon narratives. According to the paper, Schoenberger and an associate ""promoted the puzzle, organized groups of puzzle solvers and content creators, and groomed and enlisted some participants to post as Q.""

Dilley wrote that Schoenberger was a person ""identified to be central to the history of QAnon"" and that he is a ""QAnon insider.""

""Given Schoenberger's prominence in putative recruitment of 'trolls' for, or through, the Cicada 3301 puzzle, further connections with QAnon were indicated, among other things, by the fact that QAnon influencer and recruiter @MrDeeds1111—one of the most influential Twitter accounts in our sample in Study 1—bore the Cicada 3301 puzzle insignia in its profile,"" Dilley wrote in the study.

Dilley said she chose the topic because she wanted to do something within her skill set that was relevant to what was going on in the world in 2020. She was paying a lot of attention to social media at the time and was drawn to the question of why there was so much propaganda.

She came across Schoenberger's name from several YouTubers and media reports that mentioned him in connection to QAnon, alleging he was involved in spreading the conspiracy theories, she said.

""I think this case is significant for academic freedom, and I hope that not just my university but others will renew their commitment to standing up for faculty's freedom of speech,"" Dilley said.

Powers said the biggest impact on Schoenberger has come from Dilley's tweets the night of the mass shooting at MSU alleging Schoenberger may have had something to do with the attack. Three students — Arielle Anderson, Alexandria Verner and Brian Fraser — were killed and five others were injured in the Feb. 13, 2023, shooting.

Schoenberger, in his lawsuit, said Dilley posted on X ""asserting that he was the force behind the shooter"" and that the ""gunman was acting under the control of Thomas.""

Dilley denied making that post, and it does not currently appear on her X feed.

As the shooting was going on, Dilley posted: ""I was targeted through stochastic terrorism tactics for my research on QAnon disinformation on Twitter. Police report was filed. Remains to be seen."" This post quoted an earlier post she made in November 2022 about Schoenberger harassing her.

In later replies to her initial post, she said if there is any connection between her research and the shooting, it should be investigated.

""I literally had folks from across the country and around the world contact me to ask if these things were connected,"" she wrote on X. ""It's not for me to decide or dismiss, it's for law enforcement. There is ample evidence that goes well beyond me. That is all.""

From Feb. 13, 2023, to Feb. 15, 2023, Dilley mentioned Schoenberger once, according to a News review of her posts. In that instance, she was responding to a post that is not visible to the public, saying the Cicada 3301 puzzle was ""weaponized to incentivize people to stalk & harass me. This was initiated by and/or with Thomas Schoenberger, who is the Dilleys_Willy account. I went to the police/FBI. This is only one of many stalking incidents by this group on me & others. So.""

She tweeted about Cicada 3301 and QAnon about half a dozen times in that time period, according to a News review.

Dilley said Schoenberger misrepresented her tweet, and like many other areas of the lawsuit, it is misinformation.

Police said 43-year-old Anthony McRae was the shooter. McRae opened fire at three locations at the university, killing three and wounding five others, before taking his own life when he was confronted by police.

Michigan State University Police said in April 2023 they found ""no conclusive motive"" for McRae's actions.

For a change, Liverpool did not need a late winner to seal their 2-1 victory over Everton, and rival fans strangely criticised the once-typical three minutes of stoppage time.

Arne Slot believes referee Darren England – who was criticised by David Moyes and Jack Grealish for his performance – was right in his decision.

The lack of an extended period of stoppage time was held up by rival supporters as a conspiracy of sorts from the PGMOL to aid the champions in their title defence.

Moyes claimed he found the time added on “amazing,” while Grealish bizarrely even argued that he had “never seen that in the Premier League.”

However speaking to Liverpool's official website ahead of the visit of Southampton in the Carabao Cup, Slot rejected those suggestions of bias.



“A lot has been said about the added time against Everton but I would have loved to play on three or four seconds more because we were in a five-v-two situation at that moment,” the head coach rightly pointed out.

“Now that tells you, I think, all about the mentality we have, always wanting to score a goal.

“The three minutes were completely correct, by the way, because there were only three moments where a substitution was made.

“There was no time-wasting because that's not what we do – unfortunately, I have to say, sometimes – and there was no treatment of injuries, one goal scored.

“Then you come to three [minutes]. Where in many other games when we need a goal, there's a lot, a lot, a lot of time-wasting going on, I can tell you.”



Liverpool scored both of their goals in the first half of the Merseyside derby, having previously netted three of their last four winners in additional time.

But as Slot explained there were fewer instances of time-wasting as his side were not chasing a result: instead, they were pushing for a goal to put the game to bed while Everton themselves looked to score an equaliser.

It is after all still the standard that up to three minutes be added on at the end of a routine Premier League fixture.

Their previous late wins may have warped perceptions but it should be noted that in the 3-2 victory over Newcastle, decided by Rio Ngumoha‘s goal in the 10th minute of stoppage time, the ball was only in play for 40.8 percent of the game.

Per Opta, that is the lowest percentage in a Premier League match since Stoke's 3-0 win over Blackburn in February 2010 (40%).

In this article

Amazon plans to close all of its Fresh supermarkets in the U.K., in the latest recalibration of its grocery strategy.

The company said in a Tuesday blog that it's preparing to close all 19 of its Fresh U.K. stores, ""following a thorough evaluation of business operations and the very substantial growth opportunities in online delivery."" Five of the Fresh locations are expected to be converted into Whole Foods stores, Amazon said.

Amazon opened its first Fresh location outside the U.S. in London in 2021, about a year after it debuted the store concept in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. Fresh stores offer cheaper prices and more mass-market items compared to Whole Foods, the upscale supermarket chain Amazon acquired for $13.7 billion in 2017. Many of the stores also feature Amazon's cashierless ""Just Walk Out"" technology.

The Fresh store pullback in the U.K. comes as Amazon has continued to adjust its grocery ambitions. The company has slowed expansion of its Fresh grocery chain and Go cashierless stores in the U.S. It still maintains 500 Whole Foods locations and has opened mini ""daily shop"" Whole Foods stores in New York City.

At the same time, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and other company executives have touted the success of sales of ""everyday essentials"" within its online grocery business, which refers to items like canned goods, paper towels, dish soap and snacks.

Jassy told investors at the company's annual shareholder meeting in May that he remains ""bullish"" on grocery, calling it a ""significant business"" for Amazon.

The company on Tuesday also said that it plans to offer same-day delivery of groceries, including perishable items, in the U.K. beginning next year.

            Ryan Routh, the 59-year-old accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump as the former and future president played a round of golf on his Florida course last year – the second attempt on Trump's life during his second campaign – has been found guilty on all charges against him.
    


            Routh appeared to try to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was read, a person in the courtroom told CNN. Authorities stopped him from doing so.
    


            His daughter also had an emotional outburst in the courtroom after the verdict was read.
    


            Routh, who represented himself at his federal trial in Fort Pierce, Florida, was facing five charges, including attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, possessing a firearm and ammunition as a felon, and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Authorities say Routh created a “sniper's nest” near the sixth green of Trump International Golf Club, but never fired a shot at Trump.
    


            Jurors deliberated for under three hours before delivering the guilty verdict.
    


            Routh will be sentenced on December 18 by Judge Aileen Cannon. He faces the possibility of life in prison.
    


            Trump took to social media after the verdict to congratulate law enforcement.
    


            “Congratulations to Attorney General Pam Bondi, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and the entire DOJ team on the conviction, in Florida, of the person who attempted an assassination on my life,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.



            “This was an evil man with an evil intention, and they caught him,” the president added.
    


            US attorneys rested their case on Friday after calling 38 witnesses. Nearly two weeks of testimony and hundreds of exhibits culminated with the final witness who pieced together how Routh was allegedly “stalking” Trump and collecting both “physical and electronic evidence.”
    


            Kimberly McGreevy, an FBI supervisory special agent, focused on evidence collected between August 14 and September 15, 2024, leading up to the alleged assassination attempt. Prosecutors ticked through a mountain of evidence with McGreevy on the stand, including call logs, text messages, bank records and video surveillance.
    


            Highlighting cellphone records allegedly from Routh's “burner phones,” the witness pointed to calls and text messages Routh allegedly made to arrange for the purchase of the rifle.
    


            The FBI witness told the jury cellphone data showed Routh “in the vicinity” of the golf club for weeks before the incident, including on September 2 for 16 hours beginning at 4 a.m. A Google account on one of Routh's alleged “burner phones” showed he searched for “Trump's upcoming rallies” and “Palm Beach traffic cameras,” according to prosecutors.
    


            The government also laid out Routh's alleged getaway plan: multiple license plates, three aliases, and Google searches for “directions to Miami airport” and “flights to Mexico.” Text messages allegedly show he told a friend in Mexico, “I may see you Monday,” the day after his alleged plan to shoot Trump. Other searches online, prosecutors say, included “hospitals in the area” and instructions on “how to make a tourniquet.”
    


            On September 15, 2024, less than an hour before authorities say Routh was going to open fire on Trump, he texted his three children. His daughter Sarah at 12:55 p.m.: “Love you so much, you are the best daughter.” His son Adam at 12:56 p.m.: “You are so awesome dude, love you so much.” His son Orin also at 12:56 p.m.: “Love you so much, man. You are so brilliant.”
    


            Orin, seemingly alarmed, wrote back: “Love you too, Dad. What's up? Everything alright?”
    


            Routh was arrested as he fled north on Florida's Interstate 95 about an hour later.
    


            Eyewitness Tommy McGee also testified for the government. He told the jury he saw a “frantic and disheveled” man leaving the scene and decided to follow him. He took pictures of his black Nissan Xterra and also wrote down his license plate. McGee alerted authorities, who stopped Routh's car about 45 minutes north on Highway 95. McGee was later brought to the scene to ID him.
    


            On cross-examination, Routh told McGee, “You're a good man. You're my hero. You're an American hero.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi said the guilty verdict “illustrates the Department of Justice's commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence. This attempted assassination was not only an attack on our President, but an affront to our very nation itself.”
    


            During closing arguments Tuesday, both prosecutors and the defendant zeroed in on intent.
    


            “Even though he didn't kill Trump, he wanted to,” prosecutor Chris Browne told the jury.
    


            He said Routh “obsessively stalked and tracked his intended victim,” and planned his alleged assassination attempt “meticulously and obsessively.”
    


            The defendant, delivering his own closing argument, claimed the assassination was “never going to happen.” Routh said, “If the attempted assassination was not taken, it is not an attempt.”
    


             “There was no intent,” he told the jury.
    


            Routh's closing was interrupted by Cannon at least 10 times as he veered into territory outside the bounds of evidence and charges. She told him to “move on” numerous times.
    


            On rebuttal, the prosecution reminded the jury that the crime does not have to be “completed” to convict of attempted assassination – “nobody has to be shot,” prosecutor John Shipley said.
    


            Routh had considered testifying in his own defense, but did call three witnesses, including two friends and a former Marine sniper, Michael McClay.
    


            McClay told the jury that the SKS rifle authorities say they found at the scene jammed twice, after firing only one shot. The prosecutors disputed the weapon's capability during cross-examination, noting McClay had tested the weapon seven months after the incident at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Prosecutors also noted by then, the weapon had been treated with acid to try and restore the serial number.
    


            When Routh's testimony veered into territory like his alleged drug use with his character witnesses, the judge jumped in, telling him, “I've given you substantial latitude. Drugs and cigarettes are not relevant here. I'm going to ask you conclude the direct of this witness.”
    


            After her father rested his case without testifying, Routh's daughter, Sarah, told CNN: “I feel like he really didn't have another choice. After seeing how rigged it is, why would he put himself in that position, you know, that would be stupid. It's obviously all rigged and it's all bullsh*t.”

Ukrainian forces struck the 8-N linear production dispatching station near the village of Naitopovichi in Russia's Bryansk Oblast overnight on Sept. 23, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The news comes as Ukraine escalates attacks against Russian oil infrastructure, a key source of revenue helping Moscow fund its all-out invasion.

The Bryansk Oblast facility is part of the main oil pipeline system 8-N — Stalnoy Kon (Steel Horse) linear production dispatching station and is considered strategically important for supplying fuel to the Russian military.

Ukrainian forces have repeatedly targeted Russian energy infrastructure in the area of Naitopovichi, a village some 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the Russia-Ukraine border.

In a separate attack, Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces again targeted the Samara dispatching station in Russia's Samara Oblast. 

The facility blends high- and low-sulfur crude oil from various fields to produce the Urals export-grade oil. Samara Oblast lies some 800 kilometers (500 miles) from the front line in Ukraine.

The General Staff also confirmed that Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) hit two Russian Be-12 Chayka amphibious aircraft at the Kacha military airbase, located in occupied Crimea.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify the claims.

Kateryna holds a bachelor's degree in journalism from Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv. She also was a fellow at journalism schools in the Czech Republic and Germany.

""I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social following his meeting with the Ukrainian president.

Asked whether NATO allies should fire on Russian planes entering their territory, U.S. President Donald Trump replied: ""Yes, I do.""

""Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing. They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia,"" U.S. President Donald Trump told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly.

The meeting, their fourth since Trump returned to office in January, comes as tensions between NATO and Moscow flare up over Russian aerial incursions into allied countries.





""The message must be unequivocal: future violations will meet a response — including, if necessary, the interception and downing of intruding aircraft. This is not only about defending Estonia's borders — it's about defending NATO's borders,"" Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said.

""Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,"" NATO said in a statement. 



Former detainees reported experiencing a broad array of torture and ill-treatment during their captivity. Commonly described methods included severe beatings with various objects such as batons and sticks,  electric shocks to different body parts, mock executions, kickings, threats of death, and violence directed either to a detainee or their loved ones, according to the report.

Ukrainian forces struck the 8-N linear production dispatching station near the village of Naitopovichi in Russia's Bryansk Oblast overnight on Sept. 23, Ukraine's General Staff reported.

The IMF reportedly persuaded Ukraine to raise its initial $38 billion estimate to $65 billion after a protracted disagreement on the issue.

All flights at Denmark's Copenhagen Airport were halted after police reported two to three large drones in the area.

Victor Tregubov, spokesperson for Ukraine's Dnipro group of forces, also denied these claims, saying that Russia is trying to advance toward Kupiansk from the north.

""The door is always open for allies,"" Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in response to the Telegraph's question whether the Baltic NATO ally is ready to host the U.K.'s nuclear-capable aircraft in the future.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Donald Trump told the United Nations (UN) that European countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration.

In a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York, the US president attacked Europe several times over its immigration and green energy policies.

He said: “You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble.

“They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”

He said: “It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,” adding: “Your countries are going to hell.”

It was Mr Trump's fifth address to the UN, and his first since being re-elected.

It served as a reminder that his second term is even more America First than what came before.

His comments also come at a time when tensions between Europe and Mr Trump's Make America Great Again (Maga) movement threaten to boil over.

Senior members of his cabinet have repeatedly attacked the Continent, with JD Vance, the vice-president, saying Europe was “engaging in civilisational suicide”.

Mr Trump, who returned last week from a comparatively passive state visit to Britain, appeared to relish the UN speech as an opportunity to hit out at his opponents, reserving particular scorn for his hosts at the UN.

In a meandering address marked by ad libs, he recalled his spurned offer to refurbish the UN headquarters in the early 2000s, and used it to illustrate what he called the organisation's overspending and incompetence.

And just as Mr Trump has used his second term to confront institutions that he sees as opponents, such as the media and the courts, he used the speech to signal a shake-up of the international order built after the Second World War.

His audience watched as he bragged about his achievements and berated allies.

Mr Trump lauded his administration's “bold” measures against immigration, with the number of crossings at the US southern border reduced to a trickle.

This year, the US population is poised to shrink for the first time on record, and is forecast to lose as many as 525,000 people from net outward migration this year, thanks to Mr Trump's tough position on immigration.

His sweeping measures against illegal immigration, including deportations, have not only put the brakes on new arrivals but also pushed people to leave the country, figures suggest.

Mr Trump added: “If you don't stop people that you've never seen before that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail.

“I'm the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe. I love the people of Europe, and I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration.

“This double-tailed monster destroys everything in its wake, and they cannot let that happen any longer.”

The 79-year-old continued: “You're doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct.

“You're destroying your heritage. They must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late.”

In his longest-ever General Assembly address, which ran for more than 50 minutes, Mr Trump took credit for ending world conflicts and ran through a list of targets from “sleepy” Joe Biden to the climate lobby, as well as criticising Nato allies who have recognised a Palestinian state.

He reserved particular scorn for Sir Sadiq Khan, making the false claim that the Mayor of London wanted to impose sharia law.

“I look at London, where you have a terrible mayor, terrible terrible mayor, and it's been so changed, so changed. Now they want to go to sharia law, but you're in a different country,” he claimed.

Mr Trump said the result would be “the death of Western Europe”.

The two leaders have a chequered past. In 2019, Mr Trump branded the London Mayor a “stone-cold loser” and poked fun at his 5ft 5in stature.

Earlier this year, Mr Trump said he did not want Sir Sadiq to attend a state dinner with him in the UK, branding him among “the worst mayors in the world”.

Sir Sadiq, in turn, has previously branded the president racist, sexist and homophobic.

Sir Sadiq's office said on Tuesday that it would not “dignify” Mr Trump's “appalling and bigoted comments” by responding to them.

A spokesman for the mayor said: “London is the greatest city in the world, safer than major US cities, and we're delighted to welcome the record number of US citizens moving here.”

Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, said Mr Khan was “not trying to impose sharia law on London”.

Mr Trump began his speech by apologising to his audience about having to read from a folder, saying the teleprompter was not working.

He later added that an escalator had broken down as he and the first lady made their way up the building.

“All I got from the United Nations was an escalator that, on the way up, stopped right in the middle,” he said.

“If the first lady wasn't in great shape, she would have fallen, but she's in great shape. We're both in good shape.”

The broken lift and teleprompter served as a metaphor for UN incompetence and overspending, he said, claiming the organisation budgeted several hundred million dollars to support more than half a million migrants entering the US in 2024.

“The UN is supporting people that are illegally coming into the United States, and we have to get them out,” Mr Trump said. “The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them.”

Turning his attention to Russia's invasion of Ukraine – a war Mr Trump had vowed to end on his first day in office – he threatened to impose “a very strong round of powerful tariffs” on Russia if Vladimir Putin did not come to the table.

He claimed the measures would “stop the bloodshed ... very quickly”, but said for the tactic to work, European nations would need to join the US and adopt the same measures.

Later, Mr Trump added: “I've always said the UN has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it's not even coming close to living up to that potential.

“For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter. It's empty words, and empty words don't solve war.”

He also doubled down on his stance on the recognition of the Palestinian state, saying it was a “reward” for Hamas.

The UK joined France, Canada and Australia in announcing formal recognition of Palestine on Sunday.

Responding to the decision, the US president said: “The rewards for Hamas would be too great for Hamas terrorists and their atrocities, including Oct 7.”

He added: “Instead of giving in to Hamas... those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.”

Mr Trump's comments came after Marco Rubio, his secretary of state, said Britain and its allies had only recognised Palestine because their migration policies meant they had been “flooded with foreigners”.

Mr Rubio accused Sir Keir Starmer and other world leaders of giving in to “domestic political pressure” fuelled by high levels of immigration.

He said: “These countries are doing it frankly because of domestic political pressure in their own countries.

“Because of migration policies, these countries have been flooded with foreigners who have become politically active and are insisting their government do these sorts of things.

“That's what they're responding to. It's irrelevant, it's gonna get a little bit of attention, but there is no Palestinian state.”

Following his speech, Mr Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social that he thought it had been “very well received”.

“It was a great honour to speak before the United Nations. I believe the speech was very well received. It focused very much on energy and migration/immigration.

“I have been talking about this for a long period of time and this forum was the absolute best from the standpoint of making these two important statements.

“I hope everybody gets to watch it! The teleprompter was broken and the escalator came to a sudden [halt] as we were [riding] up to the podium, but both of those events probably made the speech more interesting than it would have been otherwise.

“It is always an honour to speak at the United Nations, even if their equipment is somewhat faulty. Make America Great Again!”

NEW YORK (AP) — The U.S. Secret Service has found and is quietly dismantling a massive network of “SIM farms” across the New York area just as world leaders gather for meetings at the United Nations.

Matt McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office, said agents found multiple sites filled with servers and stacked SIM cards, of which more than 100,000 cards were already active. Though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, he described it as a well-funded, highly organized enterprise and possibly run by nation-state actors — perpetrators from particular countries.

Officials also warned of the havoc the network could have caused if left intact. McCool compared the potential impact to the cellular blackouts that followed the Sept. 11 attacks and the Boston Marathon bombing, when networks collapsed under strain. 

So what are these SIM farms and what are they capable of?

AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on the SIM farm uncovered by the Secret Service just ahead of the UN General Assembly and its nefarious undertones.

SIM farms are hardware devices that can hold numerous SIM cards from different mobile operators. These devices then exploit voice over internet protocol (VoIP) technology to send and receive bulk messages or calls.

While initially developed for legitimate purposes, such as low cost international calling, the technology has become a cornerstone of organized fraud targeting mass audiences — phishing texts and scam calls. 

“Scams have become so sophisticated now. Phishing emails, texts, spoofing caller ID, all of this technology gives scammers that edge,” said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.

In this case, the devices were concentrated within 35 miles of the U.N. building. The investigation is ongoing, but McCool said forensic analysis currently believe the system could have been used to send encrypted messages to organized crime groups, cartels and terrorist organizations. 

Anthony J. Ferrante, the global head of the cybersecurity practice at FTI, an international consulting firm, said the photos show a very sophisticated and established SIM farm that could be used for any number of nefarious activities, including the potential to overwhelm cellular networks with millions of calls in just a few minutes.

“So if you can imagine that type of magnitude on cellular networks, it would just overwhelm them and cause them to shut down,” Ferrante said in an interview. He also notes that it's possible the system could be used for surveillance operations, given its proximity to the United Nations, “potentially that equipment could be used to either intercept communications, eavesdrop on communications, or actually, clone devices, as well.”

Ferrante, who previously served in key security positions at the White House and the FBI, says he's awaiting the results of the investigation before drawing any conclusions about the nature of the setup, but he emphasizes that the scale of the operation shows how simple tools can pose real risks to critical infrastructure. 

“The masterminds could have set this up a long time ago and be operating from thousands of miles away,” he said. “It's a stark reminder of how deeply interconnected our world has become, where local vulnerabilities can be exploited globally.”

MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — A Missouri woman was sentenced Tuesday to more than four years in federal prison for scheming to defraud Elvis Presley's family by trying to auction off his Graceland home and property before a judge halted the brazen foreclosure sale.

U.S. District Judge John T. Fowlkes Jr. sentenced Lisa Jeanine Findley in federal court in Memphis to four years and nine months behind bars, plus an additional three years of probation. Findley, 54, declined to speak on her own behalf during the hearing.

Findley pleaded guilty in February to a charge of mail fraud related to the scheme. She also had been indicted on a charge of aggravated identity theft, but that charge was dropped as part of a plea agreement. 

Findley, of Kimberling City, falsely claimed Presley's daughter borrowed $3.8 million from a bogus private lender and had pledged Graceland as collateral for the loan before her death in January 2023, prosecutors said when Findley was charged in August 2024. She then threatened to sell Graceland to the highest bidder if Presley's family didn't pay a $2.85 million settlement, according to authorities.

A woman convicted of fraud for trying to sell Graceland is headed to prison. The AP's Jennifer King reports.

Findley posed as three different people allegedly involved with the fake lender, fabricated loan documents and published a fraudulent foreclosure notice in a Memphis newspaper announcing the auction of Graceland in May 2024, prosecutors said. A judge stopped the sale after Presley's granddaughter sued.

Experts were baffled by the attempt to sell off one of the most storied pieces of real estate in the country using names, emails and documents that were quickly suspected to be phony.

Graceland opened as a museum and tourist attraction in 1982 and draws hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A large Presley-themed entertainment complex across the street from the museum is owned by Elvis Presley Enterprises. Presley died in August 1977 at the age of 42.




The public notice for the foreclosure sale of the 13-acre (5-hectare) estate said Promenade Trust, which controls the Graceland museum, owed $3.8 million after failing to repay a 2018 loan. Actor Riley Keough, Presley's granddaughter, inherited the trust and ownership of the home after the death of her mother, Lisa Marie Presley. 

Keough filed a lawsuit claiming fraud, and a judge halted the proposed auction with an injunction. Naussany Investments and Private Lending — the bogus lender authorities say Findley created — said Lisa Marie Presley had used Graceland as collateral for the loan, according to the foreclosure sale notice. Keough's lawsuit alleged that Naussany presented fraudulent documents regarding the loan in September 2023 and that Lisa Marie Presley never borrowed money from Naussany.

Kimberly Philbrick, the notary whose name is listed on Naussany's documents, indicated she never met Lisa Marie Presley nor notarized any documents for her, according to the estate's lawsuit. The judge said the notary's affidavit brought into question the authenticity of the signature.

In halting the foreclosure sale, the judge said Elvis Presley's estate could be successful in arguing that a company's attempt to auction Graceland was fraudulent.

A statement emailed to The Associated Press after the judge stopped the sale said Naussany would not proceed with the sale because a key document in the case and the loan were recorded and obtained in a different state, meaning “legal action would have to be filed in multiple states.” The statement, sent from an email address for Naussany listed in court documents, did not specify the other state.

After the scheme fell apart, Findley, who has a criminal history that includes attempts at passing bad checks, tried to make it look like the person responsible was a Nigerian identity thief, prosecutors said. An email sent May 25, 2024, to the AP from the same email as the earlier statement said in Spanish that the foreclosure sale attempt was made by a Nigerian fraud ring that targets old and dead people in the U.S. and uses the internet to steal money.

In arguing for a three-year sentence, defense attorney Tyrone Paylor noted that Presley's estate did not suffer any loss of money and countered the prosecution's stance that the scheme was executed in a sophisticated manner.

Fowlkes, the judge, said it would have been a “travesty of justice” if the sale had been completed.

“This was a highly sophisticated scheme to defraud,” he said.

Trial attorney Andrea Lewis previews the Ryan Routh trial and more on ‘Fox Report.'

Jurors on Tuesday delivered a guilty verdict for Ryan Routh on all charges after he attempted to assassinate then-presidential candidate Donald Trump at his West Palm Beach golf club last September. 

After the verdict was read, Routh reportedly appeared to try to stab himself in the neck with a pen before four U.S. Marshals restrained him.

His daughter, Sara Routh, reportedly stood up and said:

""Don't do anything. I will get you out. What the f---, f---, he didn't hurt anybody. This is not fair. This is all rigged – you guys are a--holes."" The jury was still in the room at the time. 

Routh, 59, was charged on five federal criminal counts, including attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer, and multiple firearms offenses.

The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. 

Jurors deliberated for several hours before returning to the court with a verdict.

The update comes after a nearly three-week trial. Prosecutors used the bulk of their closing arguments Tuesday to emphasize both the digital and forensic evidence presented at trial and what they described as Routh's clear intent: to kill Trump. 

They noted the 1 7 ""reconnaissance"" trips he allegedly made to Trump's golf course, and what they described as his excessive stalking of Trump, prior to the Sept. 15, 2024 incident in question.

TONY HAWK, TAIWAN AND A FLASHLIGHT: TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT'S BIZARRE DEFENSE

This part was critical for the prosecution to convict Routh on the first and most serious criminal count: Attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate. 

In order to secure a conviction on that charge, prosecutors had to prove to jurors two things: First, that the defendant had the intent to carry out the crime, and second, that the defendant had taken ""substantial steps"" to do so.

During closing arguments, federal prosecutors stressed that it should not be difficult for jurors to conclude that they'd met that bar.

""This was not a publicity stunt,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Browne told the jury. ""The evidence has shown one thing and one thing only — the defendant wanted Donald Trump dead.""

There is ""no doubt, no reasonable doubt, no doubt whatsoever that it was this man,"" Browne said, stopping to point to Routh, ""who was hiding"" in the sniper's nest for what they said was roughly 10 hours, beginning around 4 a.m. 

PROSECUTORS TO WRAP TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT CASE AS DEFENSE READIES WITNESSES

Prosecutors spent nearly two full weeks meticulously presenting their case. They walked jurors through hundreds of pieces of evidence, including call logs, text messages, forensic evidence, and surveillance footage that they used to carefully track Routh's actions.

They also used bank records to tie Routh to the purchase of a SKS semi-automatic 7.62x39 caliber rifle that was recovered near Trump's golf course.

Expert witnesses for the prosecution testified that the weapon was in working condition. Forensic experts said the fingerprint on the scope matched to Routh. They also linked Routh's DNA to matches on the rifle itself, as well as gloves, a bag, and other items. 

Browne reminded jurors Tuesday that there were 19 rounds found in the magazine of the SKS rifle that was recovered at the scene, including one in the chamber. 

""This was not a publicity stunt,"" Browne told the jury. ""The evidence has shown one thing and one thing only — the defendant wanted Donald Trump dead,"" Browne said.

RYAN ROUTH TRIAL CONTINUES AFTER AGENT TESTIFIES SUSPECT AIMED RIFLE AT HIM ON TRUMP'S GOLF COURSE

A total of 38 witnesses testified for the prosecution before it rested its arguments Friday. 

A box delivered months earlier to Samuel and Lazaro Plata — brothers from North Carolina — contained pipes, bullets, wires, and a 12-page manifesto titled ""Dear World."" In it, Routh allegedly offered $150,000 to anyone willing to ""complete the job."" After a series of court rulings, prosecutors were permitted to introduce only the first three lines of the letter.

FBI digital evidence showed web searches, flight-tracking activity, texts about Trump's rallies and plane movements, license-plate reader records of Routh's vehicle (a black Nissan Xterra) and other surveillance tying him to Palm Beach County around the same time of the assassination attempt.

Law enforcement testimony described ""sniper tradecraft"" involving a hideout near the 6th hole on the golf course, steel plates for ballistic protection, concealment, fences used for support of weaponry and long-distance shooting lanes on the 6th and 7th holes.

Routh, who represented himself in the case, did not introduce any evidence that was deemed to be admissible in court. 

He rested his own defense after just several hours Monday, and after questioning just three witness — two of whom were friends and colleagues, who acknowledged during cross-examination that they had not seen or spoken to Routh in years.
