                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova. 11 seed Elina Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into Svitolina's position as the No. Bianca Andreescu, Linette's original first-round opponent, will now face qualifier Anna Bondar. Another key storyline will be the return to action of hometown hero Zheng Qinwen, playing her first tournament since undergoing right elbow surgery in July. 7 seed, has not competed since her first-round exit at Wimbledon to Katerina Siniakova. She will open against either Suzan Lamens, a quarterfinalist last week in Seoul, or compatriot Wang Yafan. Swiatek will start against either Yulia Putintseva or wild card Yuan Yue, while Gauff will face either Kamilla Rakhimova or Lucia Bronzetti. Two former major champions are unseeded threats in the draw as they also make their way back from injury layoffs. Barbora Krejcikova takes on Anna Blinkova in her opener, with the winner to play Seoul finalist and No. Meanwhile, Bianca Andreescu returns to action for the first time since injuring her ankle in Montreal a month ago. The Canadian faces a qualifier or lucky loser, with No. Australian Open champion Madison Keys joined US Open champion Aryna Sabalenka on the sidelines, withdrawing from the tournament on Monday due to injury. [1] Iga Swiatek vs. [16] Emma Navarro[12] Naomi Osaka vs. [5] Jessica Pegula[4] Mirra Andreeva vs. [14] Daria Kasatkina[10] Clara Tauson vs. [7] Zheng Qinwen[6] Jasmine Paolini vs. [24] Veronika Kudermetova[13] Karolina Muchova vs. [3] Amanda Anisimova[8] Elena Rybakina vs. [9] Ekaterina Alexandrova[15] Belinda Bencic vs. [2] Coco Gauff Here's how the draw breaks down by quarter: 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round, No. 16 seed Emma Navarro in the fourth round and No. The player she defeated in that year's final, No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu, who will be making her tournament debut, in the third round; she currently owns a 2-1 head-to-head lead over the Briton, including 2-0 on hard courts. Whoever emerges from that tussle could face either 2019 champion Naomi Osaka, the No. After winning back-to-back WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells, Mirra Andreeva solidified her Top 5 status by compiling a 31-8 record this year through Roland Garros. 4 seed in Beijing, where she was a quarterfinalist last year, Andreeva will open against either qualifier Moyuka Uchijima or wild card Zhu Lin. She'll have to navigate a section that includes big-hitting No. 29 seed Dayana Yastremska in a potential third round. In the last 16, Andreeva could face either No. 14 seed Daria Kasatkina or her regular doubles partner, No. Shnaider could face a tricky opener against fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint, who made her first career WTA 500 semifinal last week in Seoul. The Australian teenager opens against qualifier Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva in a rematch from the US Open first round, which Joint won in two tight sets. Zheng has a mixed record against the young talents in her section. This time last year, the 19-year-old Canadian was ranked No. Mboko will bid to notch her first win since lifting the Montreal trophy against either Siniakova or Anastasia Potapova. First-round matches to watch: Jessica Bouzas Maneiro vs. Jaqueline Cristian, [Q] Victoria Jimenez Kasintseva vs. Maya Joint, Zeynep Sonmez vs. [WC] Wei Sijia, Katerina Siniakova vs. Anastasia Potapova, Suzan Lamens vs. [SR] Wang Yafan Fresh off leading Italy to a successful defense of their Billie Jean King Cup title last week, No. She could face a tricky opponent off the bat, though -- 2018 runner-up Anastasija Sevastova, whom she barely escaped in three sets at Wimbledon. 221, but since returning from an ACL injury in April the Latvian has already scored wins over Pegula and Jelena Ostapenko. Paolini's route doesn't get any easier after that. Kenin is searching for some form -- the 2020 Australian Open champion hasn't won back-to-back main-draw matches since Roland Garros -- but throughout her career has a track record of hitting her hot streaks with little warning. In the last 16, Paolini could resume her rivalry with No. 11 Elina Svitolina -- a matchup that has provided some thrilling contests this year. (Note: Svitolina withdrew from Beijing due to a hip injury on Tuesday. Magda Linette moves into her position as the No. 24 seed Kudermetova is now projected to meet Paolini in the fourth round.) The American will play her first match as a Top 5 player against either Hailey Baptiste or Katie Boulter, and is projected to face home favorite and No. A potential fourth-round meeting between Anisimova and No. 13 seed Karolina Muchova, last year's runner-up, could make for a fascinating stylistic clash. The pair have only played once previously, with Anisimova advancing via retirement at Roland Garros 2022. First-round matches to watch: [Q] Anna Bondar vs. Bianca Andreescu, Tatjana Maria vs. Marie Bouzkova, [Q] Anastasia Zakharova vs. [WC] Zhang Shuai, Katie Boulter vs. Hailey Baptiste Gauff's up-and-down form in 2025 has seen the American at her gritty best during the clay swing, which culminated in her second major title at Roland Garros -- but also fail to reach a final on any other surface, with her service yips returning to afflict her during the North American hard court swing. 25 seed Leylah Fernandez, whom she has a 2-0 head-to-head lead over, in the third round. In the last 16, Gauff could then meet either No. Since reaching the Wimbledon semifinals, Bencic's record is just 2-3, while Ostapenko has won just three out of nine matches since Roland Garros. 8 seed Elena Rybakina has landed in a section full of dangerous opponents. The big-serving Kazakhstani will have to be prepared to take on a barrage of variety in her opener against either Wimbledon quarterfinalist Laura Siegemund or Caty McNally, two players with net-rushing instincts and every shot in the book. Rybakina is 6-1 overall against Siegemund, but was forced to retire in her only previous meeting with McNally. 32 seed spot here after capturing her first WTA title in Guadalajara two weeks ago. Despite Jovic's inexperience -- Beijing will be just her 11th tour-level event -- this is already a familiar matchup for her; Rybakina defeated her in straight sets at both the Australian Open and Roland Garros this year. Two-time major champion Krejcikova's return from a back injury this year has been riveting to watch -- not least due to the number of unlikely comebacks the Czech has pulled off. Since June, she's won from match points down on four separate occasions, the latest of those being an escape from 6-4, 5-2 down against Raducanu last week in Seoul. If Krejcikova's second-round clash against Alexandrova happens, it could be one to circle; with a 41-20 record so far, Alexandrova is quietly putting together a career-best season, and the 30-year-old could be eyeing a Top 10 debut in the closing two months. Alexandrova has a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Krejcikova, though they have not played since 2021. Whoever emerges from that match could have to face either No. 20 seed Elise Mertens or McCartney Kessler -- both two-time titlists this year -- in order to reach a potential last-16 meeting with Rybakina. First-round matches to watch: Laura Siegemund vs. Caty McNally, Barbora Krejcikova vs. Anna Blinkova, Ashlyn Krueger vs. Maria Sakkari Zheng Qinwen returns to action for the first time in over two months at the China Open, and will have to navigate a section of the draw that includes Victoria Mboko, Clara Tauson and Linda Noskova.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are among the sport's biggest stars who are in action this week. Sinner returns to the China Open in Beijing, where five Top-10 players are set to compete, including Alexander Zverev. The two ATP 500 events also serve as a pivotal period for Nitto ATP Finals hopefuls seeking to amass as many PIF ATP Ranking points as possible, with aspirations of qualifying for the season finale in Turin. 1) Alcaraz makes event debut: Tokyo, the longest-running ATP Tour tournament in Asia, will welcome the World No. The winner of seven titles this year, Alcaraz boasts a season-leading 61-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He will look to strengthen his claim as World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, a position he reclaimed following his US Open triumph.

For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event. 4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively. Each of those players, besides Tiafoe, have won at least one title this season and seek to add to their trophy cabinet in Tokyo. Shapovalov, who won the ATP 500 in Dallas and Acapulco, is competing for the first time since marrying longtime partner Mirjam Bjorklund. 5) Top seeds Harrison/King seek third ATP 500 crown this year: At eighth in the PIF Live Doubles Race To Turin, Christian Harrison and Evan King are seeking a spot at the Nitto ATP Finals, a prize that would reward their dream season. 1) Sinner returns, seeking third title of 2025: In action for the first time since his runner-up finish at the US Open, Sinner is back in Beijing for the third consecutive year, amassing a 9-1 record in his previous two outings. Sinner will aim to go one step further and return to the winner's circle, which he reached in 2023. 2) Three-time semi-finalist Zverev: The German is making his sixth appearance in Beijing and just his second since 2020. Zverev has routinely gone deep in those outings, including three semi-final runs. 3) Top 10 stars: The Beijing field is stacked with five Top-10 players, including Sinner, Zverev, Alex de Minaur, Lorenzo Musetti and Karen Khachanov. De Minaur was a quarter-finalist at the season's final major. Musetti arrives after a strong start to the Asian hard-court swing in Chengdu. 4) Fan favourites Rublev, Medvedev and Bublik: Andrey Rublev and Daniil Medvedev are among the seeded players at the ATP 500. Rublev, a two-time quarter-finalist in Beijing, won an ATP 500 hard-court title earlier this year in Doha. Medvedev reached the Beijing final in 2023 and semi-finals last year. Ahead of Hangzhou, Medvedev shared that he is working with a new team, consisting of Thomas Johansson and Rohan Goetzke. Wimbledon champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who have won six titles together this year and have qualified for the Nitto ATP Finals, lead the field. Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic have also qualified for Turin and will be in action in Beijing. Several singles stars are in the field, including Rublev partnering Khachanov, De Minaur teaming Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, Musetti, Bublik and more. 3) Turin outsiders: With less than two months until the Nitto ATP Finals, every week is extraordinarily crucial for those outside the top eight in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin vying for a spot at the prestigious tournament. For 13th-placed Casper Ruud and 15th-placed Holger Rune, their showings at the ATP 500 could help them in their pursuit of qualification for the year-end event. 4) Remaining seeds aiming to add to title count: Tomas Machac, Ugo Humbert, Denis Shapovalov and Frances Tiafoe round out the seeds fifth through eighth, respectively.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- On Tuesday, September 23, the WTA celebrates the game-changing group of tennis players known as the Original 9, 55 years after they seized control of their collective destiny by signing $1 contracts with promoter Gladys Heldman to compete in a groundbreaking tournament in Houston, Texas. The nine women who were prepared to risk their careers in order to compete on their own terms were Jane ‚ÄòPeaches' Bartkowicz, Rosie Casals, Judy Dalton, Julie Heldman, Billie Jean King, Kerry Melville Reid, Kristy Pigeon, Nancy Richey and Valerie Ziegenfuss -- seven Americans, and two Australians (Dalton and Melville Reid). ‚ÄúThe Original 9's bold collaboration with Gladys Heldman sparked a new trajectory for women's tennis and, 55 years later, remains a defining moment in sports,‚Äù said Portia Archer, CEO of the WTA. ‚ÄúThe courage and commitment to equality demonstrated by these trailblazers has inspired generations of WTA athletes and remains at the heart of the global game fans enjoy to this day.‚Äù The tournament, which saw Casals defeat Dalton in the final, 5-7, 6-1, 7-5 proved such a hit that Joseph Cullman III, the tennis-mad chief executive of Philip Morris, extended Virginia Slims sponsorship for a comprehensive circuit of events starting in 1971. But Heldman and her players worked tirelessly to grow their innovative league, which brought the sport to new cities across America, often in non-traditional venues. Fashion designer Ted Tinling's custom dresses married rhinestone-glamor with sporting prowess and helped to build the brand. Finally, a talent pool of more than 60 players was united, and the stage was set for women's professional tennis to boom. In 2025, the Hologic WTA Tour is comprised of 51 tournaments across 25 countries and regions on six continents (not including WTA 125 events) with a global audience of more than 1 billion. Prize money, including the Grand Slams, is almost $250 million -- a figure unmatched in women's sports. Julie Heldman, who was not present for that historic moment, took her rightful place in the position that had been occupied by her late mother, Gladys. In 2021, they became the first group of players to be inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.</p>
