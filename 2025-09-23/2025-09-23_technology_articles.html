                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI announced on Tuesday that it plans to build five new AI data centers across the United States with partners Oracle and SoftBank through its Stargate project. Three of the new sites are being developed with Oracle. The new Stargate AI data centers are part of OpenAI's massive infrastructure buildout, as the company works to train and serve more powerful AI models. On Monday, OpenAI said it would receive a $100 billion investment from Nvidia to buy the chipmaker's AI processors and build out even more AI data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The sites, which are being developed in partnership with Oracle and SoftBank, bring Stargate's current planned capacity to nearly 7 gigawatts—roughly the same amount of power as seven large-scale nuclear reactors. “AI is different from the internet in a lot of ways, but one of them is just how much infrastructure it takes,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said during a press briefing in Abilene, Texas, on Tuesday. He argued that the US “cannot fall behind on this” and the “innovative spirit” of Texas provides a model for how to scale “bigger, faster, cheaper, better.” The move follows an agreement Oracle and OpenAI announced in July to develop up to 4.5 gigawatts of US data center capacity on top of what the two companies are already building at the first Stargate facility in Abilene. These are located in Lordstown, Ohio, and Milam County, Texas. Stargate is one of several major US technology infrastructure projects that have been announced since President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year. OpenAI said in January that the $500 billion, 10 gigawatt commitment between the ChatGPT maker, SoftBank, Oracle, and MGX would “secure American leadership in AI” and “create hundreds of thousands of American jobs.” In July, Trump announced an AI action plan that called for speedy infrastructure development and limited red tape as the US tries to beat other countries in the quest for advanced AI. OpenAI initially framed Stargate as a “new company” that would be chaired by Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. Oracle is in the process of standing up eight data center halls in Abilene, which will each support roughly 100 megawatts of power. When it is done, the facility will house more than 400,000 GPUs and support more than 1.4 gigawatts of power, sources close to the project say. The initial Stargate announcement called for companies with land, equipment, and other relevant resources to get involved. After it was published, OpenAI executives say they were inundated with messages from firms that wanted to participate. One executive estimates that OpenAI has surveyed around 700 sites in the US where data centers could potentially be built. For the five projects announced Tuesday, OpenAI claims it reviewed more than 300 proposals together with its partners from roughly 30 states. “China's immense electricity consumption underscores not only its industrial dominance but its ability to rapidly deploy AI infrastructure including new data centers, semiconductor fabs, and manufacturing hubs.” Earlier this week, OpenAI also announced a new strategic partnership with Nvidia to deploy 10 gigawatts of data center capacity—dwarfing even the size of OpenAI's deal with Oracle. The initial build-out will include 4 to 5 million GPUs, Nvidia said, and the chipmaker will make investments “progressively” as each gigawatt is deployed. Jonathan Koomey, a visiting professor at UC Berkeley who has studied computing and data center efficiency for decades, says the enormous size of OpenAI's data center investments may not be enough to guarantee the company's success. Earlier this year, the Chinese startup DeepSeek debuted an impressive AI model built using relatively little computing power, a feat that suggested OpenAI could still be beat out by lesser-resourced competitors. But that thesis has still yet to be proven, he adds. Koomey is also concerned that the tech industry may be abandoning its environmental commitments in pursuit of new data center capacity, and he questions whether such sacrifices are really warranted. “I would question the sense of urgency,” he says. While some data center projects, like a massive complex being developed by Meta in Louisiana, have received pushback from the local community, the site in Abilene appears to have strong support from local politicians. Trump administration officials have helped arrange some of the infrastructure deals with allied nations, betting the deals would help American companies capture market share globally. But questions have swirled around Stargate ever since its inception.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While production is currently paused for Spider-Man: Brand New Day, Sony Pictures is making sure to let us know that the show's not stopping with even more casting announcements. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse villain Tombstone is making his way to Spider-Man: Brand New Day, as Deadline reports that Marvin Jones III (Black Lightning) will be reprising the animated role in live-action. One of many crime bosses in Spider-Man's rogues gallery, Tombstone is usually depicted as an imposing Black person with albinism; he has sharp chompers and granite-like skin that's hard to cut. The creation, by writer Gerry Conway and artist Alex Saviuk, first made his Marvel Comics debut in Web of Spider-Man #36 in March 1988, and has been a staple of Spidey's criminal underworld ever since. Given Tombstone's recent appearance in the Spider-Verse films, there's no doubt going to be a lot of speculation that Brand New Day could potentially give us the MCU's own take on Miles. The recent casting of Liza Colón-Zayas (The Bear) and Trammel Tillman (Severance) also has left fans wondering if the Morales family in some way will be a presence, and of course, Miles' uncle Aaron already appeared in Spider-Man Homecoming, played by Donald Glover. Whether or not we see Miles or any other Spidey-sona in Brand New Day, Jones is joining a stacked cast of familiar faces that includes Jon Bernthal as the Punisher, Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, and Michael Mando returning as Homecoming‘s version of Scorpion. Despite its current production delay, Spider-Man: Brand New Day is still currently set to release July 31, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent discovery of a sprawling SIM farm operation in the New York City area has revealed how these facilities, typically used by cybercriminals to flood phones with spam calls and texts, have grown large enough that the US government is warning it could have been used not just for crime, but large-scale disruption of critical infrastructure. On Tuesday morning, the US Secret Service revealed that it had found a collection of facilities across the “New York tristate area” holding more than 100,000 SIM cards housed in “SIM servers,” devices that allow them to be managed and operated simultaneously. Due to the sheer scale of the infrastructure of this single SIM farm—and the fact that it reportedly came onto the Secret Service's radar after it was exploited in “swatting” attacks that targeted US members of Congress around Christmas of 2023—the agency has warned that the operation, which has been at least partially dismantled, posed a serious threat of a disruptive attack on cellular service. “To give you an idea of capacity for disruption, this network could be used to send approximately 30 million text messages per minute, meaning it could anonymously text the entire United States in around 12 minutes.” These devices can connect around a hundred SIM cards simultaneously. No arrests have been made, according to the law enforcement source. Despite speculation in some reporting about SIM farm operation that suggests it was created by a foreign state such as Russia or China and used for espionage, it's far more likely that the operation's central focus was scams and other profit-motivated forms of cybercrime, says Ben Coon, who leads intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Unit 221b and has carried out multiple investigations into SIM farms. “My gut is telling me there was some type of fraud involved here.” In this case, according to a CNN report on the Secret Service's investigation, the agency got onto the trail of the New York area SIM farm after it was used in a pair of swatting incidents around Christmas Day in 2023 that targeted congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and US senator Rick Scott. Those incidents appear to have been tied to a pair of Romanian men, Thomasz Szabo and Nemanja Radovanovic, who were working with the American serial swatter Alan Filion, also known as Torswats. Though all three men have since been convicted on swatting-related charges, the Secret Service's McCool noted in his statement that the agency's investigation followed “telecommunications-related imminent threats directed towards senior US government officials this spring.” MobileX SIM card packages discovered by the US Secret Service. Cybercriminals have long used the massive collections of centrally operated SIM cards for everything from spam to swatting to fake account creation and fraudulent engagement with social media or advertising campaigns. The SIM cards are typically housed in so-called SIM boxes that can control more than a hundred cards at a time, which are in turn connected to servers that can then control thousands of SIMs each. SIM farms allow “bulk messaging at a speed and volume that would be impossible for an individual user,” one telecoms industry source, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the Secret Service's investigation, told WIRED. “This means that there is great intelligence and significant resources behind it,” the person added. But it's the most concentrated in such a small single geographic area. The “clean, tidy racks” of equipment in a well-lit room shows that the operation may be well-organized and professional, says Cathal Mc Daid, VP of technology at telecommunication and cybersecurity firm Enea. Photos released by the Secret Service show multiple racks of telecom equipment neatly set up, with individual pieces of tech numbered and labeled, plus cables on the floor being covered and protected with tape. Each SIM box, Mc Daid says, appears to include around 256 ports and associated modems. “This looks more professional than many of the SIM farms you see,” says Mc Daid. Mc Daid notes, however, that he's tracked similar operations discovered in Ukraine—some of which have been as large or even larger than the one revealed on Tuesday by the Secret Service. These SIM farms have been used to operate fake social media profiles that can spread disinformation and propaganda. Additional equipment found in the New York–area SIM farm sites. Since SIM farms are typically used for indiscriminate fraud rather than swatting or other more disruptive threats, the unusual use of this particular SIM farm to swat US officials was likely the source of its downfall, notes Allison Nixon, the chief research officer for Unit 221b. “Swatters are also fraudsters, so they know how to use criminal proxy services.

While Innosilicon Technology's products may not be prominently featured on the list of the best graphics cards, the company has been hard at work developing its Fenghua (translated as Fantasy) series of graphics cards. As ITHome reported, Innosilicon recently unveiled the Fenghua No. The graphics card reportedly borrows a page from OpenCore Institute's Nanhu V3 project. The Fenghua No.3 is also purportedly compatible with Nvidia's proprietary CUDA platform, which could open many doors for the graphics card if it holds true. The company plans to deploy the graphics card in different sectors, including AI, scientific computing, CAD work, medical imaging, and gaming. Therefore, it's safe to assume there will be other variants of the Fenghua No.3. The graphics card is also reportedly equipped to support ray tracing. However, there was no available information on game settings, resolution, and actual frame rates, so take these claims with a grain of salt. The Fenghua No.3 reportedly comes equipped with 112GB+ of HBM memory, making it an ideal product for AI. Innosilicon claims unconditional support for the DeepSeek V3, R1, and V3.1 models, as well as the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families. Innosilicon also boasted that the Fenghua No.3 is China's first graphics card to support the YUV444 format, which offers the best color detail and fidelity—a feature particularly beneficial for users who perform extensive CAD industrial work or video editing. The graphics card can drive up to six 8K monitors at 30 Hz. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The Fenghua No.3 is the world's first graphics card to offer native support for DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine). It enables the precise visualization of X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, and ultrasounds on standard monitors, eliminating the need for costly, specialized grayscale medical displays. Although it is unlikely to rival that of the United States in the near future, it may not necessarily need to do so. China's primary goal is to achieve self-sufficiency in key areas. Announcements such as the Fenghua No.3 may seem insignificant individually.

It follows the March launch of Nova Act, Amazon's AI model and toolkit for creating autonomous agents in web browsers. Nova Act was the first release from Amazon's AGI Lab in San Francisco. Amazon says features of the new extension include natural-language script generation, a notebook-style builder for cell-by-cell execution, live debugging with a unified view of code and browser actions, and an ‘Action Viewer' to compare workflow versions side-by-side. Nova Act is part of a broader effort by Amazon to compete with rivals including OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft, and Google in offering agentic AI tools to developers and businesses, attempting to expand beyond generative AI tools that require active user involvement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As expected, President Donald Trump and U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the podium Monday afternoon to blame acetaminophen (known by the brand name Tylenol) for causing autism—an assertion that many experts reject. But both men also took some time to point the finger at one of their favorite scapegoats: vaccines. Throughout yesterday's news conference announcing the HHS' apparent findings on autism, ostensibly focused on acetaminophen and folate deficiency, Trump and Kennedy repeatedly circled back to the topic of vaccination. These moments, off-script as they may have been, are a strong signal that RFK Jr. and his allies are still planning to officially blame vaccines for causing autism. The HHS announcement on autism released yesterday, not so much a report as it is a purported fact sheet, mostly concerned the drugs acetaminophen and leucovorin, the latter being a medication used to treat certain kinds of folate deficiency. Outside scientists have already torn apart the findings, arguing they're based, at best, on weak and mixed evidence. But that didn't stop Trump and RFK Jr. from loudly proclaiming during the conference that they've come closer than anyone yet to finding the true answer to rising reported autism rates. Actual experts say most of the rise is simply due to better screening and expanded criteria for what qualifies as autism. Blame Tylenol For Autism in New Report, but Experts Push Back Trump certainly emphasized the primary findings, more than once yelling at pregnant women to not take Tylenol and to instead tough out their episodes of pain and fever since it apparently comes with no drawbacks. Leaving aside the misery of having to bear these symptoms without medication, fever during pregnancy may be a risk factor for neurodevelopmental conditions like autism. All that said, it didn't take too long for Trump to start ranting about vaccines. The “too much liquid” part seems to be a unique Trumpism, but it's certainly true that many antivaxxers fearmonger about the number of vaccines children are mandated to receive, often by highly exaggerating the figure as Trump did. The tally can differ depending on the state's policy, but kids are typically encouraged to receive around 15 different vaccines before adulthood. Many vaccines require boosters, so antivaxxers will try to fudge the math by counting every single dose as a separate vaccine. People, kids and adults alike, are also generally recommended to get a seasonal flu shot (and until recently, a regular covid-19 booster), but even if you included both yearly flu and covid shots until age 18, you still wouldn't get to 80. This fuzzy math is pointless anyhow, since only some childhood vaccines are actually mandated by states for children to enter and stay in public school. New York, for instance, requires children to take ten vaccines throughout their school years. He claimed that Amish communities, some of which are skeptical about vaccines, do not experience autism—a complete falsehood. That's a longtime goal of the antivaccination movement, but it would actually put children at risk, since fewer families have the time or resources to get all three vaccines individually. Though RFK Jr. had less speaking time during the announcement, he too made it a point to bring up the debunked link between vaccines and autism. During one particularly astonishing moment, he tried to frame people's opposition to the antivaccination movement as the “gaslighting” of mothers who believe their children's autism was caused by vaccines, even arguing that it went against the common refrain of “believing all women”—a sentiment wholeheartedly endorsed by the White House, which highlighted it on its social media accounts. "Some 40-70% of mothers who have children with autism believe that their child was injured by a vaccine. President Trump believes that we should be listening to these mothers instead of gaslighting and marginalizing them like prior administrations." The HHS autism announcement released yesterday only contains a brief, but important, reference to vaccines. HHS has also reportedly hired well-known antivaxxer David Geier to conduct a new study reexamining the link between vaccines and autism. But given their comments yesterday, it seems like they're raring to keep undermining vaccination too. The state of the country's public health is bad now, but it could certainly get even worse from here on out. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's also the first class in history to include more women than men. These candidates are joining NASA's astronaut corps at a time when human exploration of Mars is a key objective for the agency. Acting Administrator Sean Duffy introduced the class on Monday at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, reiterating the agency's focus on maintaining its leadership in space by pursuing a “bold exploration plan for the future.” “One of these 10 could actually be one of the first Americans to put their boots on the Mars surface, which is very, very cool,” acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy said during the ceremony, according to CBS News. “No pressure, NASA, we have some work to do,” he said. Any of NASA's current astronauts could theoretically go to Mars, but this new class has the best shot. With their tenures just beginning, they're most likely to see NASA reach this ambitious, long-term goal. In recent years, however, progress has stalled due to repeated Artemis mission delays. Just last week, the agency's safety advisory panel warned that completion of SpaceX's Starship Human Landing System (HLS)—the lunar lander for the Artemis 3 mission—could be “years late.” Artemis 3, which will return American astronauts to the Moon for the first time in more than 50 years, is slated to launch by mid-2027. The agency has already delayed this mission multiple times and now expects to launch in April 2026. NASA's 24th astronaut class will spend the next two years in basic training before embarking on their first missions. The class includes Anna Menon, a former biomedical flight controller in Mission Control at Johnson Space Center; Lauren Edgar, former deputy principal investigator for the Artemis 3 Geology Team; and Yuri Kubo, a former ​​co-op student at Johnson. Menon is the first astronaut candidate with prior spaceflight experience, having flown on SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission in 2024. All 10 candidates have advanced scientific expertise, with backgrounds in engineering, neuroscience, geology, and other disciplines. Their skill sets will certainly come in handy while conducting research aboard the International Space Station, but it's not yet clear what other flight assignments they'll be tapped for. During Monday's event, NASA officials expressed hope that the new astronauts may embark on later Artemis missions and, of course, go to Mars, but for now, their futures remain uncertain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We've got these really spiky workloads — I would dearly love to be able to overclock … because then we would need way fewer servers and deliver a better experience,” said Jim Kleewein, a Microsoft technical fellow and development director for core Office 365 services, recounting the challenge he originally brought to Microsoft's silicon development teams. Instead of placing a cooling plate on top of a chip, the approach brings liquid coolant directly inside the processor itself through tiny channels. But Microsoft says it has developed a new approach that uses AI to customize the cooling system for the unique heat signatures of different chips running specific workloads. The design, inspired by biology, ends up resembling the veins in a leaf, delivering coolant with greater precision to a chip's hottest spots. While the working prototype was demonstrated on a commercially available Intel Xeon chip, Microsoft says the innovation is part of a broader strategy to improve its entire hardware fleet. As a next step, the company is looking to incorporate the cooling technology into future versions of its own silicon, potentially including its Azure Cobalt chip and Maia AI accelerator. The company is competing to efficiently train and run cutting-edge AI models against Amazon, Google, and others, which are also making their own chips. Microsoft still uses third-party chips, including industry-standard GPUs from Nvidia and other suppliers, but it says a more integrated approach is necessary to meet the challenges of the AI era. “The demands of Al are such that, frankly, hardware on its own cannot keep up,” Borkar said during a recent media briefing and tour of Microsoft's Silicon Lab in Redmond. “We really are all about co-designing, co-optimizing every layer of the stack.” Longer term, the company sees the cooling technology as a foundational step toward a revolutionary new type of chip architecture: 3D stacking. Microfluidics could eventually solve that by allowing coolant to flow between each layer of the silicon brick, a breakthrough that Microsoft's Kleewein believes could be transformative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta has raised the stakes in Big Tech's fight against AI regulation. The Facebook-maker is investing “tens of millions” of dollars into a new super PAC to fight state-level tech policy proposals that could stifle AI advancement, reports Axios. Last month, Meta launched a California-focused PAC to back tech-friendly candidates in state races. Axios reports that Meta's new super PAC will be run by Republican veteran Brian Baker and Democratic consulting firm Hilltop Public Solutions, and will work to elect tech-friendly politicians from both parties in next year's midterm elections. The focus on parental control comes amid growing child safety concerns surrounding AI tools. Meta has come under particular scrutiny after leaked internal documents showed the company's chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” chats with kids and whistleblower reports alleged that the company may have suppressed research on child safety. More than 1,000 bills were introduced in all 50 states related to AI during the 2025 legislative session. In California specifically, two bills passed and are awaiting signature or veto by Governor Gavin Newsom: SB 243, a bill that would regulate AI companion chatbots to protect minors and vulnerable users, and SB 53, a bill that would set new transparency requirements on large AI companies. Last month, Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI president Greg Brockman launched a Silicon Valley super PAC with $100 million dedicated to advocating against AI regulation. Earlier this year, a proposal that would bar states from regulating AI at all for 10 years almost made it into the federal budget, but was ultimately struck down.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's Monday morning, and a global bank's customers can't log into their accounts. The culprit isn't ransomware, a DDoS attack, or even insider sabotage. What if that same faulty certificate isn't unique to one bank, and is embedded in a widely used third-party software package adopted by dozens of other financial institutions? Yet, too often, certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is still treated as a low-level IT task. Developers pull in third-party libraries, vendor-provided components, and open-source packages at scale. Vendors may provide software signed with certificates that are expired, improperly issued, or even designed to last a century. Open-source packages may rely on self-signed certificates with weak encryption. These flaws create hidden attack surfaces — entry points adversaries can exploit to infiltrate not just one company, but entire downstream customer ecosystems. Websites go down, applications stop authenticating, and customers can't transact. That's why calling this an IT issue misses the point. The failure of certificate governance exposes an organization's inability to ensure operational continuity. In industries like financial services, health care, and critical infrastructure, such lapses aren't just inconveniences; they're existential risks. An outage or breach can damage customer trust, invite regulatory scrutiny, and cost millions in lost business. Without that top-down mandate, organizations remain vulnerable to preventable failures. Certificates may be scattered across silos, managed differently by developers, DevOps teams, and security operations, with little coordination. Developers may pull in new open-source libraries without vetting their certificate trustworthiness, leaving CISOs without a central inventory or clear picture of where risks lie. What makes certificate failures operational problems is that no one has the whole map. Without central governance, an expiring or untrusted certificate can ripple across critical applications, triggering outages, exposing sensitive data, and magnifying risk far beyond the technical domain. Enterprises need dependency-aware inventories — not just a list of certificates, but an understanding of what each certificate secures, where it originates, and what dependencies it touches. This contextual understanding transforms CLM from reactive firefighting into proactive governance. Human error is often the source of certificate-related failures, whether it's a missed renewal deadline or an overlooked validation step. Automating CLM ensures that discovery, renewal, revocation, and policy enforcement happen systematically, without relying on manual oversight. It is about orchestrating trust across the entire software supply chain. By redefining CLM as supply chain trust orchestration, organizations can elevate certificate management into a core element of operational resilience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seemingly unshackled from Microsoft, OpenAI's major drive towards a high-value IPO begins. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Following its joint announcements of major UK investments last week, ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has kicked off this one with a slew of new deals to enhance its own capabilities and increase its valuation ahead of a potential IPO. The company struck a deal for Nvidia hardware worth upwards of $100 billion, a deal with Chinese firm Luxsure to begin building consumer AI devices, and there are several negotiations said to be ongoing with other Chinese Apple suppliers, according to CNBC. Despite the company being structured as a non-profit and its yearly revenue projections topping out at just under $13 billion (following a $5 billion loss in 2024), it has announced investments worth hundreds of billions of dollars in data center infrastructure. For these kinds of investments to be possible, OpenAI needs to restructure as a for-profit company, which it can now do after the recent progress in its Microsoft negotiations. It also needs the cash generated from a potential IPO, with some estimates already valuing the company at over $500 billion, despite its lack of any kind of actual profitability. Though that may well be a form of circuitous, parasitic relationship where Nvidia invests money in OpenAI, so it can, in turn, purchase Nvidia hardware for its various data center projects. Crucially, however, this deal also marks OpenAI as one of the first customers for Nvidia's next-generation hardware. This deal will see Nvidia invest an initial $10 billion once the deal is agreed upon, with the first Nvidia hardware set to be delivered in late 2026. These chips will be Nvidia's next-generation Rubin architecture, likely offering significant performance and efficiency advantages over existing Blackwell GPUs. More Nvidia investment will be forthcoming as further gigawatts of computing power are set up, with the final project said to equate to around 10 gigawatts of AI compute power. The electricity use alone would be enough to power over 8 million homes. "On the one hand [this deal] helps OpenAI deliver on what are some very aspirational goals for compute infrastructure, and helps Nvidia ensure that that stuff gets built," said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, via Reuters. Although there are very real services these companies can offer each other, the kind of AI projects they all want to launch will require incredible infrastructure development, which will require Herculean levels of investment. When those have burst in the past, they tend to take entire companies with them. If anything like that happens before OpenAI (and others) can realize their goals, they could be left with enormous promises and balance sheets that are deep in the red. Alongside its drive towards IPO cash generation, OpenAI is also looking to diversify as it searches for a viable profit model for its soon-to-be for-profit company. It hired the former head of Meta's Orion augmented reality glasses project in November last year to head its consumer devices and robotics divisions. It's also alleged to be in talks with Goertek, a Chinese company that builds Apple's AirPods and other smart devices. Similar to the smart speakers made by Apple, Amazon, and Google for their Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant smart assistants, OpenAI sees ChatGPT as a direct competitor for these kinds of tools and seems set to build out smart devices that can leverage the technology in a more physical sense. According to The Information, Luxshare is already working on prototypes with a plan to launch a viable gadget in late 2026 or early 2027. OpenAI previously partnered with Apple product-design icon, Jony Ive, lending further credence to the idea of OpenAI pivoting towards hardware as a potential avenue towards increasing both its profitability and physical presence in people's everyday lives.

Nvidia wants to make it clear that, despite any deals it's done with certain companies to provide future hardware, it will still ensure all customers get access to next-generation GPUs, as first reported by Bloomberg. This follows the announcement of a $100 billion Nvidia investment in OpenAI, which will see the chip giant give OpenAI money, so that it can purchase Nvidia's GPUs in a circular strategy that has buoyed both companies since the announcement was made. "Our investments will not change our focus or impact supply to our other customers--we will continue to make every customer a top priority, with or without any equity stake," an Nvidia spokesperson told Toms Hardware in a statement. Nvidia became the world's most valuable company in recent years because of the scramble to buy its cutting-edge GPUs in order to power a new generation of "AI factories" and AI training and inference data centers. But that hasn't stopped those same companies from looking for alternative sources lest Nvidia itself become a bottleneck, through chip supply issues or granting favour to one company over another. Other major chip firms like Nvidia competitor AMD do offer their own AI hardware. It might not be as impressive as Nvidia's and lacks the CUDA ecosystem, which has helped give Nvidia such a near-monopoly in the professional GPU space for many years, but its hardware is capable nonetheless. Chinese firms have also been making major efforts to untether themselves from Nvidia amidst ongoing trade negotiations and tariff talks with the United States. Other Nvidia investments, which are likely to give other actual or potential customers pause, include the Intel deal, which will see Nvidia work together with the CPU giant to fabricate new chips that combine their hardware into a single chip. Nvidia's recent investment and pseudo-takeover of GPU networking hardware firm Enfabrica also smacks of Nvidia shoring up its near-monopoly in the AI hardware space. AMD is one such potential alternative, but Qualcomm is working on its own accelerators, and if Chinese innovation in the space has shown us anything in the past couple of years, it's that they can surprise with their speed and capabilities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Between April and June of this year, US Customs and Border Protection says it searched nearly 15,000 devices, outpacing the previous quarterly record by over 2,000. Combined with visitors allegedly being turned away for content on their devices and hours-long detentions at ports of entry, it's reasonable to be a little worried about entering the US. There's a lot you can do to protect yourself at the US border, but most people have at least some sensitive information they need to keep on a phone or laptop while traveling. That's where 1Password, the password manager, and its Travel Mode feature come into play. Although it can't remove everything, Travel Mode can erase a lot. The way it works is simple: You organize your logins, notes, attachments, and other sensitive information into a series of vaults. When you turn on Travel Mode, your selected vaults aren't only hidden; 1Password claims they're entirely removed from your device. Broadly speaking, CBP can't deny entry to US citizens or green card holders if they don't comply with a device search. But they can make your life really difficult, with longer detentions and device seizures. “You can state that you don't consent to such a search, but unfortunately, this likely won't prevent Customs and Border Protection from taking your phone,” according to the Texas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. According to CBP's own policies, “Officers may not use the device to access information that is solely stored remotely.” Unfortunately, those policies may not always play out cleanly. “This is essentially a limitless authority that they claim for themselves to search travelers without a warrant and to search the full scope of information people carry on them,” says Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. Travel Mode can't prevent a search, but it could help you store information you'd rather border agents not see. First, Travel Mode removes marked vaults from your device completely. You can sign into the 1Password app and do everything else you normally would, but your travel vaults won't be there. 1Password says you can only turn Travel Mode on or off from a browser (at 1password.com) that's been authenticated with both your secret key and master password. So, even if a border agent seizes your phone, there's no way to turn off Travel Mode from the 1Password app. “As a practical matter, a border agent can't search what isn't in your possession when crossing the border,” Bill Budington, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, wrote to WIRED in an email. “As a feature that limits the amount of data you carry with you, Travel Mode seems like a good way to protect that data.” It's easy to turn Travel Mode on and off with 1Password, but there's some important housekeeping you should do beforehand. For existing vaults, you can mark them as safe or not safe for travel using the cog icon on the vault at my.1password.com. 1Password has an emergency kit, which includes your secret key, login email, a setup QR code, and a space to write (or type) your master password. You can generate an emergency kit at my.1password.com with the Manage Account button. You can print this and physically store it somewhere safe, or upload it to an encrypted cloud storage service like Proton Drive; make sure the device you're traveling with isn't logged into that storage service. In the event you can't log back into your account and turn off Travel Mode, you can get in using any browser and your emergency kit. 1Password doesn't have a hard limit on the number of vaults you can create, so it's worth spending some time organizing different entries into their own vaults. You can store a lot of information in your 1Password vaults beyond passwords, including documents and passkeys. Separating sensitive documents from your Spotify login will make it a lot easier to toggle on Travel Mode without double-checking all of your entries. You can remove all of your vaults, but I recommend keeping some essentials available through 1Password. Ideally, you'll turn on Travel Mode before heading to the airport and only turn it off after you're through customs. Once that's done, you can turn on Travel Mode following these steps: Travel Mode is handy in the context of your phone. Technically, CBP isn't allowed to turn off Travel Mode through the browser on your laptop, but that doesn't account for any rogue actors or other, more strict border agencies. Unfortunately, there isn't a Travel Mode for your laptop, but there are some options if you want to make sure your devices are completely secure. Most laptops come with ways to encrypt data. That layer of encryption protects against dumping your PC for later analysis, but if you're forced to enter your password, it doesn't do much. It's a free, open source encryption app that can encrypt full drives, as well as operating system partitions, similar to BitLocker or FileVault. The big feature of VeraCrypt is plausible deniability. Within that free space, you can set up another encrypted volume with a different password. VeraCrypt is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Alternatives are available for iOS and Android, as well, but I haven't tested those myself. But if you need protection regardless of the hassle, it's a good option to consider. But there's a lot of other data on your phone that could cause issues that neither of them helps with. Photos, messages, and even apps you have installed could all cause problems, so it's a good idea to either travel with a secondary device or clean up your primary device. “The general principle of data minimization can go a long way,” Budington says. CBP's official policy is that it can't search data stored in the cloud, but a lot of storage services will keep a local copy when disconnected from the internet.
