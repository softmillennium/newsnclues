But about an hour into the procedure, surgeons came to a screeching halt. She even said Hoover appeared to have tears in his eyes. Hoover suffered severe, long-term complications to his memory, mobility, and speech as a result of the drug overdose, but ultimately lived. Hoover's shocking story isn't the only case of an individual seemingly “waking up” from death–and challenging what we know about the final moments of our consciousness. Some people have woken up in morgues and coffins, while others have described seeing bright lights or hearing voices of deceased relatives while dying. Researchers have recorded sudden bursts of gamma-waves, or surges of high-frequency brain activity associated with memory, in patients even after they died. These near-death experiences (NDEs) could serve as the brain's last-ditch attempts to stay alive–and change what we know about the function of consciousness once we die. But many questions still remain unanswered about death and consciousness. Were people who experienced NDEs truly dead to begin with? Why would the brain launch a surge of activity as it dies? How should NDEs impact protocols for practices like organ donation? Read all about the research investigating NDEs in Pop Mech's full feature on twilight consciousness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A self-learning memristor is our closest step yet to recreating synapses in the human brain. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. In 1971, American electrical engineer and computer scientist Leon Chua reasoned that there must exist a fourth fundamental element of computing. There's the resistor, capacitor, and inductor, but Chua believed there also existed a “memristor”— a portmanteau of “memory” and “resistor” that described a simple, non-volatile memory component that could store information even when turned off. This sounds like a simple function, but it provides the technological foundation of neuromorphic (a.k.a. brain-like) computing—an effective memristor would essentially act as an artificial synapse in an AI neural net, as it can achieve both data storage and computation at the same time (which is something our brain does). Since researchers “discovered” memristors back in 2008, scientists and engineers around the world have been slowly improving their capabilities in the hopes of bringing about computers that are as efficient and powerful as human brains. In January of this year, KAIST president Kwang Hyung Lee announced that his institute had successfully developed a memristor that can correct errors and learn from mistakes, meaning it could solve problems that were previously difficult for neuromorphic systems. The researchers say, for example, that this chip could separate a moving image from a background during video processing, and actually improve its ability to do this task over time. This breakthrough means that AI tasks could be performed locally (instead of relying on cloud-computing servers) while also improving privacy and energy efficiency. “This system is like a smart workspace where everything is within arm's reach instead of having to go back and forth between desks and file cabinets,” Hakcheon Jeong and Seungjae Han, both researchers from KAIST, said in a press statement. Developing better and better memristors brings us incremental steps closer to creating a true brain-on-a-chip, essentially supercharging AI and (possibly) pushing us ever closer toward the singularity—the moment when AI surpasses human intelligence. However, “intelligence” is a notoriously complicated subject, and just because an AI can perform certain calculations like the human brain, that doesn't mean it is capable of all of the brain's functions. Of course, some scientists argue that such a capability means these machines could simply be “alien minds”—neural constructions unlike our own but undeniably intelligent in their own unique way. But for now, the human brain remains king in terms of hyper-efficient computing. With the help of improved memristors, however, AI could one day claim that neural crown for its own.</p>

In a preprint posted on medRxiv on 12 September1, researchers identified more than 400 such papers published in 112 journals over the past 4.5 years, and demonstrated that AI-generated biomedicine studies could evade publishers' anti-plagiarism checks.

To test whether AI can help to produce multiple papers from the same data set, the researchers used OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and Google's Gemini to rewrite three of the most heavily redundant articles identified by their analysis (each reported a particular association that had already been published five or six times). “They weren't perfect, and the LLMs did create some errors.

Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD. In late 2017 and early 2018, the city of Cape Town, South Africa, was threatened by an unprecedented water scarcity crisis, known as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), triggered by an exceptional 3-year rainfall deficit that started in 20151. This event was characterized by the lowest river flows recorded since 19042 in the Sonderend River and drained the largest reservoir3, Theewaterskloof, to critical levels. The vulnerability and scale of the population exposure made it one of the most extreme multi-year droughts on record, leading to severe water restrictions and socio-economic consequences4,5. The long duration of the drought and the high water demand made the situation dire, especially for a city relying for 96% on surface water and only 4% on groundwater6. Although Cape Town ultimately avoided reaching DZD, due to the slightly above-average rainfall in winter 2018 and subsequent wetter years, this event remains the major urban drought in recent history. Similar crises occurred in cities like Chennai in 20197, while other cities like Los Angeles8 remain highly vulnerable. These cases highlight the growing global concern over urban water security and serve as a wake-up call to the risks of water insecurity. Traditional droughts, meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological, are typically assessed in isolation based on deficits in precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow. In contrast, water scarcity is a multidimensional event arising from insufficient quantity, compromised quality, and unmet environmental flow requirements, constraining the sustainable availability of water sources for human and ecological systems9. This study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, driven by anthropogenic supply-demand imbalances. However, DZD represents an acute water scarcity triggered by the simultaneous occurrence of multi-year precipitation deficits, river flow depletion, and high-water demand, leading to a critical depletion of reservoirs. Therefore, DZD is a multi-year compound extreme event arising from the concurrent occurrence of several interdependent events10. A compound extreme event refers to a simultaneous occurrence of multiple extreme events that can have drastic effects on a large scale, far greater than the impact of an individual event11,12. Multi-year meteorological drought, driven by insufficient precipitation and potentially exacerbated by global warming, can lead to hydrological droughts characterized by abnormally low river flows, reducing water availability. Such combined events considerably increase the risk of water scarcity when the available supply is less than the demand. Hence, the simultaneous occurrence of several climate extremes can lead to more severe impacts13 on water supply14 and subsequently on society and ecosystems15, highlighting the need for integrated drought assessment frameworks that account for compound events. Intensive water consumption due to economic development, population growth, and modern agriculture, heightens the risk that water resources, depleted by drought, will not be able to meet sectoral water demands. On a global level, future climate projections indicate that global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the water cycle variability16, leading to more severe wet-dry fluctuation periods17, enhancing evapotranspiration18, and reducing precipitation and surface runoff16 in many regions. These changes are expected to increase the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological water stress19,20,21,22. Despite the distinct nature of drought and water scarcity, their relationship is crucial in the hydrological system23. Climate change and socioeconomic development drive global freshwater scarcity24,25,26, affecting numerous populations27. However, the risk of future global water scarcity, caused by anthropogenic climate change and rising water demand across all sectors, and its impacts28,29 remain poorly understood due to the complexity of its socio-economic and physical interactions. Few studies have focused on understanding the DZD drivers, and then mainly for Cape Town, South Africa1,2,4,30,31,32,33. The event was caused by a wet-season rainfall deficit and long-term decline in the frequency and intensity of rainy days, making the rainy season shorter than the dry season34,35. Anthropogenic climate change contributed to DZD36,37 and is expected to increase its future likelihood33. However, global-scale assessments of the emergence and attribution of DZD-like events under global warming remain limited. Understanding where and when such compound events will emerge is crucial for local and global water security strategies. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have assessed the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of extreme events such as unprecedented hydrological drought38 and water scarcity39, under human-induced climate change. For instance, Liu et al.39 estimated the ToFE of water scarcity and its potential disappearance based on a per-capita water availability metric. However, the understanding of ToFE of water scarcity driven by the compound effects of hydrological drought and socio-economic growth remains limited. Here, water scarcity arises when freshwater demand exceeds the available supply, including reservoir storage, under compound drought conditions. Reservoirs are essential for managing local water availability and assessing the severity of water scarcity under climate change40. However, reservoir feedback41,42 due to reservoir dependence can increase vulnerability to water shortages during prolonged drought, as increased storage capacity encourages greater water consumption. Reservoirs help mitigate hydrological extremes, but over-reliance can mask water stress and delay adaptation strategies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for in-depth research on reservoir-related water security risks to achieve water-related sustainable development goals. This study assesses the characteristics of global physical water scarcity caused by hydrological drought in anthropogenic climate change using a probabilistic framework based on large-ensemble model simulations. Our study specifically addresses water scarcity that arises when prolonged drought reduces water supply below demand. To investigate the emergence of extreme drought-driven water scarcity, we use 100 ensemble members of climate projections with the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) under the SSP3-7.0 scenario for probabilistic analysis. We also include the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios for the sensitivity of our results, using 10 ensemble members for each scenario to ensure consistency. The CNRM-based analysis is solely for the sensitivity of the ToFE due to its coarser spatial resolution relative to CESM2-LE. We evaluate the global ToFE of prolonged drought-driven water scarcity, such as DZD, using a method based on the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) of the joint probability of compound extremes, incorporating reservoir and lake levels. Our study focuses on DZD as an acute water scarcity event due to a long period of unprecedented compound extreme events in water supply shortage and rising demand under a warming climate. We identify when and where anthropogenic DZD first emerges, how long these events will last, and how many people will be exposed to DZD. We investigate drought-driven water scarcity as a compound extreme event characterized by the concurrent exceedance of thresholds of four indicators: the 48-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), and the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), as illustrated in Fig. 1, and Time for Reservoirs to Dry (TRD, Supplementary Fig. Although SPEI is widely used for capturing atmospheric water demand through Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), it does not reflect actual water losses from the land surface, which actual evapotranspiration better represents. Nonetheless, PET-based indices remain suitable for detecting climate-driven drought in long-term, large-scale studies due to their broader data availability and methodology. a–c Present the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48), indicating long-term climatic water balance at a 48-month timescale. d–f Show the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48), capturing hydrological drought conditions at a 48-month timescale. g–i Depict the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48), reflecting the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption at a 48-month timescale. Each panel represents the ensemble mean, illustrating the spatial pattern and severity of compound water stress indicators over time. Negative values of SPEI48 and SRFI48 indicate increasingly dry conditions, while lower SWSI48 values (i.e., supply-to-demand ratios below normal) signal intensifying water scarcity driven by growing demand. Together, these projections reveal areas at high risk of compound, long-term water stress under future climate and socio-economic scenarios. Our results quantify the spatial distributions of water stress and suggest that some regions will encounter unprecedented regional drought conditions due to global warming under the SSP3-7.0 scenario (Fig. Regarding the SPEI48 and SRFI48 indices, most regions are expected to experience unprecedented severe multi-year hydrological droughts, especially towards the end of the twenty-first century under anthropogenic climate change. SWSI48 shows the emergence of regional water scarcity in future periods. Towards the end of the twenty-first century, almost all regions are at high risk of severe and pronounced persistent drought (i.e., SPEI48, Fig. Our findings align with a previous study43 indicating a persistent increase in severe multi-year drought in the future over southern Africa, northern South America, the Mediterranean Region, Australia, and Chile. Conversely, regions like Argentina, East Africa, and high-latitude Russia are projected to experience wetter climates. Similarly, the spatial distribution of SRFI48 (Fig. 1e, f) indicates an increase and intensification of severe multi-year river flow extremes in the future44. This is projected to intensify in the far future45,46. A substantial decline in the Yangtze River water level is projected in the near future, followed by a slight increase in the far future. The increase in streamflow in the far future is driven by increased snowmelt47,48 and precipitation49, which could lead to water level rises. Notably, anthropogenic climate change is projected to also alter the world's largest river flow systems, such as the Amazon River. However, an increase of a high risk of the occurrence of extreme floods50 is projected in the far future for the biggest rivers, such as the Rio de la Plata, Nile, Congo, and Yellow Rivers. The SWSI48 addresses the multi-year impact of increasing water demand with a decrease in water supply in a warming world. Our results show the emergence of acute water scarcity in the future (Fig. The expansion of regions impacted by water scarcity shows the intensification of SWSI48, particularly in the western United States of America, Mediterranean regions, northern Africa, southern Africa, India, northern China, and southern Australia. Consequently, our results state that several regions will at the same time encounter severe dryness, as indicated by SPEI48 less than −1.5, persistent reduction in river discharge, by SRFI48 less than −1.5, and chronic acute water scarcity, defined by SWSI48 less than 0.6. Therefore, these simultaneous occurrences of multiple water-related stress factors driven by long-duration rainfall deficits, increased evapotranspiration, depleted river flow, and increased water consumption are projected to intensify jointly under a warming climate scenario, CESM2-LE SSP3.7-0. This compound pattern of multi-year water stress underscores an increasing prevalence of extreme water stress26,38,45,51 and scarcity52 in the future, especially in already drought-prone regions. This study defines ToFE as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk (FAR) for DZD exceeds 0.99, indicating a 99% likelihood that human activities caused the onset of these unprecedented compound drought-scarcity events. ToFE is assessed relative to pre-industrial conditions (1850–1899), which serve as the baseline for detecting anthropogenic emergence. The focal hotspot regions affected by unprecedented DZD, with their respective decade of ToFE and the distribution of the ToFE, are shown in Fig. Our results indicate that anthropogenic climate change is projected to trigger the onset and occurrence of DZD, primarily due to severe and persistent compound multi-year hydrological droughts, reservoir depletion, and high-water demand. a Spatial distribution of the decadal ToFE of DZD events across the globe from 1900 to 2100. Colored shading indicates the first decade during which DZD becomes statistically attributable to anthropogenic climate change, defined as the first decade in which the Fraction of Attributable Risk is greater than 0.99 (FAR ≥ 0.99). Gray regions indicate grid cells where no DZD event attributable to anthropogenic climate change is projected to emerge before 2100. For regions with reservoirs, the ToFE is considered to be the first decade after the year of completion (Supplementary Fig. 6) of their respective reservoirs, when all DZD criteria are simultaneously met. By aligning the emergence timing with the operational onset of water storage infrastructure to reflect the real-world system resilience dynamics. b Circular diagram illustrating the temporal distribution of ToFE by decades. The color scale indicates the percentages of grid cells (land areas) experiencing their ToFE distribution in each decade from 1900 to 2100. It provides a temporal overview of how the ToFE is distributed over time and the trends in DZD emergence. About 14% of the global reservoirs from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRand) database (Supplementary Fig. 5, see Methods for more information regarding the reservoirs) would dry out due to a high risk of DZD during their respective ToFE, as shown in Fig. The 74% of regions covered by DZD are projected to experience an unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, under the SSP3-7.0 scenario of CESM2-LE. Moreover, almost 35% of those regions are facing the emergence of water scarcity, including their reservoirs, between 2020 and 2030 (Fig. This will threaten the local freshwater availability in DZD-prone regions (Supplementary Fig. Declining precipitation and river flows, combined with rising water demand, can dry up the reservoirs and cause water scarcity across sectors, heightening the risks of water, food, or socio-economic insecurity. The ToFE of DZD is influenced by the severity of the precipitation deficit and increases in evapotranspiration (SPEI48), river drought (SRFI48), and water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa (Supplementary Fig. In parts of Asia and America, increased water consumption can influence the early emergence of DZD compared to other factors. This rise in water consumption is associated with population growth and socio-economic development, encompassing expanded water use across domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining sectors. These findings emphasize the importance of jointly considering all four drivers: climate, hydrological supply, event duration, and human demand, since no single factor can fully characterize a compound hydrological extreme event like DZD. This compound approach highlights that water scarcity can be triggered by various drivers rather than a single stressor. For instance, a precipitation deficit without strong demand pressure may not induce water scarcity, while excessive demand alone may not trigger a water crisis if demand remains below supply. However, unsustainable consumption driven by population growth and socio-economic development alone can also trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource. Therefore, the simultaneous occurrence of these factors can lead to the emergence of an unprecedented acute water scarcity. In addition, reservoir characteristics, specifically the Time for Reservoir to Dry (TRD), play a crucial role in detecting the ToFE of DZD. TRD serves as a proxy for how long a reservoir can sustain water supply under drought conditions when river inflow is the only source of water. The longer it takes for an unprecedented drought to drain water in reservoirs, the later the ToFE will occur, particularly in Mediterranean regions. An increase in TRD, quadrupling the TRD, will affect the ToFE of the 8% of the DZD-prone regions, causing later emergence than in Fig. Therefore, the duration of drier conditions, combined with rising human water consumption, can dry the reservoirs and trigger severe DZD, including reservoir-dependent regions. However, excluding both drought duration and TRD increases the event occurrence in both historical and future periods and raises their probability. This will delay the human-induced signal (FAR ≥ 0.99), leading to later ToFE compared to Fig. 2, particularly in the Mediterranean regions (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, DZD emerges earlier in other regions because the probability of future events exceeds the pre-industrial baseline earlier, enabling earlier detection of FAR ≥ 0.99. Therefore, including the multi-year drought duration and TRD makes these events unprecedented versus pre-industrial conditions, highlighting their importance for understanding the emergence and magnitude of anthropogenic water scarcity and the critical role of reservoirs in water crisis vulnerability. These insights underline the need for future work research integrating dynamic reservoir operations and adaptive water management strategies where region-specific data is available. Furthermore, the ToFE of unprecedented water stress and scarcity can be dependent on model structure and scenario pathways38,39. To address this, we use data from the CNRM model under two scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0. Both scenarios project that 51% of DZD-affected regions will face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020-2030 (Supplementary Fig. The influence of the scenario on DZD ToFE is region-specific (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c, f) due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Both high (SSP3-7.0) and moderate (SSP2-4.5) scenarios can advance, delay, or have no change on DZD emergence, depending on the region. Model structure also drives spatial discrepancies (Supplementary Fig. 21a, b, d, e): CESM2-LE projects broader DZD regions in northern Africa, while CNRM highlights other regions such as South America and Australia. Nonetheless, both models consistently identify the Mediterranean, parts of southern Africa, and North America as key emerging hotspots. The recurrence and persistence of compound drought events are critical to understanding future water risk. In this context, we assess the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated as the number of months a DZD event lasts. Both factors can importantly exacerbate the societal and ecological impact of DZD because its continuity is destructive and costly, especially when the waiting time is short and the duration is long. The duration plays a crucial role in determining the event's extremeness and affects the exposure and vulnerability of society. Short waiting times between successive events limit the recovery period, thereby amplifying stress on water systems. The spatial distribution and the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of DZD duration and waiting time across hotspot regions reveal distinct regional variations in the magnitudes and the distribution (Fig. The heavy-tailed PDFs, with the 99th percentile exceeding 48 months, suggest that climate change can cause long durations of DZD events, although such extremes remain rare events due to long waiting times between events. However, short waiting times and durations of less than 48 months are more likely to occur, as illustrated by the shape of their PDFs and their spatial distribution (Fig. Moreover, the probability of having a waiting time above 48 months for all regions affected by DZD is above the 90th percentile. In terms of duration, the likelihood of an event lasting less than 48 months is above the 90th percentile, except for the Mediterranean Region, Southern Africa, Asia, and Australia, indicating shorter tails of waiting times and longer tails of duration. Thus, in these regions, the DZD tends to last longer with shorter waiting time periods. These prolonged DZD can dry up the reservoirs, heightening the risk of long-term acute water scarcity with a large-scale impact during the twenty-first century. This will be exacerbated by climate change in the future, cascading to “zero water” as many reservoirs will not have enough water to meet the demand of the projected population. Altered precipitation and river flow patterns can prolong the dry conditions and reduce the volume of inflows to freshwater systems, exacerbating water shortages. Increased evapotranspiration and water consumption deplete water sources (water available in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs) more quickly and prolong DZD duration. The volume of water that reservoirs can retain will decrease due to prolonged periods of stress caused by both climate change and human activities. As ecosystems are weakened and less capable of retaining water, even brief periods of rainfall may be insufficient to end a drought or replenish water supplies, limiting the recovery period before the next DZD event. The central spatial map shows the spatial distribution of the ensemble-mean waiting time (a) and duration (b) of DZD events, respectively, following the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) at each grid point of DZD-prone regions across the globe. c represents the spatial distribution of the frequency (%) of extreme DZD events, defined as those where the event duration exceeds the waiting time, indicating prolonged water scarcity impact and short recovery period. The accompanying inset circular diagram of c illustrates the distribution of these events, with the color scale indicating the proportion (percentages) of grid cells experiencing such conditions. This visualization highlights where and how frequently extreme DZD conditions with long duration and short waiting time emerge. The surrounding paired panels depict the Probability Density Function (PDF) of waiting time and duration for DZD events across seven DZD-prone regions. Colored lines represent the PDF of each ensemble of 100 CESM2-LE, while the black line is the ensemble mean of the respective PDF. The vertical dashed lines mark the ensemble mean (black), 90th percentile (blue), and 99th percentile (green) for each region. The period considered for each grid point started from the month after each decade of their respective ToFE and continued until 2100. The duration distributions vary considerably in the tails compared to the waiting time, determining the likelihood of extreme DZD events with longer durations. The 90th and 99th percentiles, the extreme upper tails, show some consistency among the ensembles, indicating that DZDs are projected to have a long-lasting duration but can also have long waiting times between events. An upper tail of the waiting time density greater than the duration denotes the possibility of rare DZD to occur in America and Northern Africa. The localized nature of DZD characteristic is driven by the variation of climate (via SPEI48 and SRFI48), water consumption (via SWSI48), and reservoir capacity (via TRD) across regions, as the climate, the capacity of the reservoirs, agricultural irrigation, industrial development, and population-driven demand differ substantially across regions. To identify where DZD events will be most severe, Fig. 3c shows the DZD-prone regions and their frequency, defined as a case where DZD event duration exceeds its waiting time, indicating short recovery periods and prolonged impact. Almost 47% of the global high-risk regions will experience extreme DZD events with a frequency between 20% and 30%. Around 12% of the DZD-prone regions have a frequency of extreme prolonged DZD events above 50%, indicating that almost half of the events have longer durations than waiting times, suggesting frequent and severe water crisis conditions with substantial socio-economic impacts. Regions with high water demand and strained reservoirs, such as the Mediterranean, exhibit both high frequency and long durations of extreme DZD. In these areas, the compounded effects of hydro-climatic stress and human demands intensify the severity and persistence of DZD, exposing heightened vulnerability to water crises and limiting recovery capacity. These findings underscore that the duration and waiting time of DZD are shaped by complex, location-specific socio-hydrological feedback. Moreover, the DZD characteristics are crucial for identifying vulnerable zones where adaptive water governance is urgently needed to mitigate future water crises. Understanding these localized dynamics enables more targeted drought preparedness and infrastructure resilience planning. We quantify the number of people living in each grid cell during the decade in which DZD first emerges (ToFE). We assess the population exposure across the total, rural, and urban populations. Results reveal a disproportionate exposure of vulnerable populations across time, regions, and warming levels (Fig. Under the SSP3-7.0 scenario, over 753 million of the total population (Fig. 4a, almost 9% of the current global population) will be exposed to DZD, with populations in urban areas (467 million) more affected than in rural areas (286 million). The urban population is most exposed in the Mediterranean, with 196 million urban and 85 million rural residents at risk. In contrast, rural populations are disproportionately impacted in Northern Africa, Southern Africa, and Asia (Fig. a Spatial distribution of the total population exposure at the ToFE of DZD across the global DZD-prone regions. The color scale indicates the total population (urban and rural) exposed when DZD first emerges in each grid cell. b Global distribution of the Global Warming Level (GWL, in °C above preindustrial) corresponding to the ToFE of DZD, providing insight into the warming levels associated with the onset of DZD events. c Circular diagram illustrating the rural, urban, and total population exposure to DZD at the ToFE, spanning the period from 1900 to 2100. d Regional distribution of rural, urban, and total populations affected by DZD, computed as the sum of exposed respective rural, urban, and total population within each regional hotspot (demarcated black box in a) at their respective ToFE. e Distribution of population exposure relative to the GWL at ToFE. Radar plots c–e emphasize the relative contributions of rural and urban populations to total exposure, highlighting disparities in vulnerability and exposure across both time and regions. In rural areas reliant on rainfed agriculture and surface water, DZD will threaten livelihoods, food security through crop failures, and economic stability. Although urban areas generally benefit from more robust infrastructure, they remain highly vulnerable to DZD over the next few decades (Fig. As cities expand, rising water demand often exceeds supply, making the area susceptible to energy shortages, restricted domestic water consumption, and socio-economic instability. The Paris climate goals are expressed in terms of global warming levels (GWL), making it essential to assess the societal impact of DZD related to the warming level at the ToFE of DZD relative to the baseline period. By linking the ToFE of DZD-affected regions to their respective GWLs, we estimate the distribution of exposed populations. The results show that 61% of GWL related to the ToFE of DZD-affected regions are in the range of 1–2.5 °C (Fig. This indicates that over half of these regions will experience DZD in a 1–2.5 °C warmer world. Notably, more urban population would be exposed to DZD than rural population (Fig. The future impact on urban DZD-prone regions will be severe under these warming levels due to the higher population densities and escalating demand. 4e), with a total population of 488 million, which can be decomposed into 322 million of urban and 166 million of rural population, suggesting the urgent need to limit warming at most 1.5 °C. This study emphasizes how climate change, socio-economic development, and water scarcity interact to increase the DZD risks, particularly affecting vulnerable populations unequally, even before the most extreme warming scenarios are reached. In addition, the risks of urban DZD are not just a future concern in a warming world, but also a near-term reality, with high population exposure by 2020 (Fig. These compounded challenges underscore the urgent need for proactive and targeted policy responses, particularly in regions where rapid development, insufficient water infrastructure, and climate vulnerability coexist. The emergence of DZD highlights the urgent need for proactive, integrated water management within policy frameworks to address the compound risks of climate change and unsustainable water use. Climate policy and water security are tightly interconnected in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)53,54, so mitigation and adaptation strategies must align with global targets while fitting regional and community-specific needs for long-term resilience55. Defining DZD events as water scarcity driven by climate change underscores the challenges in sustainable water supply (SDG target 6.1) and efficient water use under stress (SDG target 6.4). Assessing the ToFE of DZD supports early warning signals (SDG target 13.1) and integration of climate adaptation strategies into water management policies (SDG target 13.2). Empowering communities to design local adaptation strategies fosters equitable and context-appropriate responses56, through water conservation, crop selection, water storage solutions, and efficient cross-sectors water use, context-specific responses in DZD-prone regions. Building resilience requires integrating local knowledge, adaptive cooperative management57, water governance58, and diversified supply strategies, including the re-planning of water reservoirs, desalination, rainwater harvesting, and wastewater recycling. Climate-resilient infrastructure investments, which have been underfinanced59, need to balance conventional and innovative approaches to ensure sustainable water access in drought-prone regions. A key limitation of this study is the reliance on the CESM2-LE and a limited number of CNRM simulations for the sensitivity analysis. CESM2-LE provides robust ensemble consistency, suitable for probabilistic analysis, but lacks scenario diversity and structural uncertainties across Earth System Models (ESMs). Conversely, the CNRM model includes more scenarios but has fewer ensemble members and lower spatial resolution, limiting its ability to capture localized extremes. These limitations underrepresent inter-model variability in drought drivers, including precipitation and evapotranspiration, whose trends may vary among ESMs60,61, limiting our uncertainty assessment. Moreover, CESM2-LE's land model assumes static aquifer storage, excluding dynamic groundwater variability. This overlooks the critical role of groundwater as a vital buffer during drought, particularly in groundwater-dependent regions. Groundwater contributes to the global water cycle, influencing river discharge and evapotranspiration, while also being altered by both climate change and human activities62. Incorporating dynamic groundwater processes is essential to improve water stress risks assessments. Groundwater is declining globally, leading to dry wells63. Climate change stresses groundwater62 through increased use during droughts and reduced natural recharge, potentially worsening the impacts of continued drought64. Prolonged rainfall deficits can disrupt the hydrological cycle in a warmer world and can lead to groundwater drought65. Despite its important role in water scarcity, global modeled and observed groundwater datasets remain scarce. However, its long-term relationship with atmospheric drought (partially captured by SPEI48; Supplementary Fig. 13) provides insight into its response to hydroclimatic stress. Notwithstanding anthropogenic global warming, population growth and economics remain the major drivers of the water crisis by increasing demand27,34. Our study considers the socio-physical aspects of water security and excludes factors like national water policies, governance, quality, and environmental flow requirements. The GRanD database provides valuable reservoir data but lacks information on real-time-varying hydrological dynamic details and includes unverified entries, limiting the number of reservoirs used. Although our study assumes stationary TRD, the static TRD effectively defines the minimum drought duration required to deplete reservoirs below critical storage levels, but it limits the ability to capture the future dynamic reservoir operations during drought. In the era of ongoing dam construction, time-varying TRD is essential for understanding how reservoir strategies influence water scarcity, but such data are currently unavailable. The interaction between socio-physical drivers and reservoir management is essential for defining compound climate extreme events23,66 and assessing DZD impact. Despite data limitations, our approach provides a practical and reproducible framework for vulnerability assessment. The reconstruction of historical total water consumption data (1850–2009) assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and overlooks historical disruptions like wars, technological innovations, or abrupt policy changes. Moreover, the reliance on a scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. These assumptions affect the accuracy of past water use estimates. Addressing these data gaps will help refine water scarcity risk analysis in the context of climate and socio-economic change. This study reveals when and where DZD may first emerge under climate change, emphasizing the importance of the compound drought duration and reservoirs40 in driving the severity of long-term drought-driven water scarcity and the unprecedented nature of these events. Excluding these factors delays ToFE, particularly in reservoir-dependent regions (Supplementary Fig. Integrating reservoir response and drought persistence dynamics into future models will improve the relevance and robustness of water scarcity for near- and long-term assessments while considering risk and mitigation benefits. Our findings align closely with Stolte et al.67, highlighting the increase in the likelihood of urban drought in the future, a potential driver of urban DZD. In addition, it is important to consider the impact of upstream land use change, as it can intensify the effects of drought and exacerbate water scarcity in downstream areas26. Unlike broader water scarcity metrics like the Falkenmark indicator, used by Liu et al.39, which use per capita water availability and relative population demand, our approach incorporates sector-specific water use and regional imbalance between supply and sectoral consumption (via SWSI) under human-induced climate. Note that SWSI on its own can identify water scarcity driven by high water consumption, but that can occur without climate-caused drought conditions. This distinction is important in the context of our study, as we define DZD as a prolonged anthropogenic drought-driven water scarcity caused by socio-physical factors, including water supply, human-made reservoirs, lakes, and sectoral water consumption. Therefore, it is essential to consider multiple indicators for assessing extreme events68, including SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48. Although this study focuses on socio-physical water scarcity, incorporating water quality and environmental flows, as highlighted by Liu et al.9, is critical for a holistic understanding of future water risks. Using the FAR method, we found that the contribution of human-induced climate change to DZD increases throughout the twenty-first century (Supplementary Fig. Identifying ToFE with a very high attribution confidence (FAR ≥ 0.99) of human-induced signal relative to the pre-industrial period (1850–1899) provides robust scientific attribution, but it offers limited practical guidance for planning and adaptation, since most water infrastructure and management systems were designed based on the late twentieth-century (Supplementary Fig. 6) climatic conditions rather than pre-industrial norms. Regions with FAR < 0.99 (Supplementary Fig. 19) may still face DZD in the future, but with weaker anthropogenic attribution. DZD, which has threatened Cape Town, is a multifaceted crisis that disproportionately affects low-income communities and exacerbates socio-economic inequalities69. It affects the domestic water supply, particularly in urban areas, with cascading effects on public health and societal risk. The impacts of drought vary across regions and sectors, with the least developed countries most vulnerable due to disparities in physical, social, economic, and knowledge-based factors70. In agriculture, DZD can reduce crop yields, threaten food security, and impact livestock through water and feed shortages. The need for sustainable irrigation of economically water-scarce cropland is critical to alleviating food insecurity71. Water-reliant industries and hydropower regions, including mining, can risk operational disruptions, energy shortages, and economic losses. Prolonged drought can degrade freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, compromising water quality, biodiversity, and long-term ecological resilience. These cross-sectoral impacts underscore the need for integrated potential solutions29 and adaptation strategies with equitable water governance and management58 at a regional scale. To support such efforts and reduce uncertainty in water scarcity assessment, expanded hydrological simulations across diverse models and emission scenarios are urgently needed. We use climate projection data from the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble (CESM2-LE) simulation72. This is a 100-member single-model ensemble simulation using the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways SSP3-7.0 scenario covering the period 1850 through 2100. The atmospheric data have a 1-degree spatial resolution, which serves as the reference for the interpolation of all CESM2-LE variables used in this study to ensure the consistency across datasets for the spatial analysis. We use monthly mean data, derived from daily data, including average temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and total precipitation from CESM2-LE. We also use river discharge (Supplementary Fig. 2) over land from the Model for Scale Adaptive River Transport (MOSART), the CESM2-LE river model component. In addition, we use the same variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5-Land) within the period 1979–2022, as well as river discharge data from the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) hydrological time series forced with ERA5 meteorological reanalysis (GloFAS-ERA5). To assess the sensitivity of our results to model structure and emission scenarios, we also include simulations from the Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques (CNRM) model under both SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios. For consistency, we analyze 10 ensemble members available for each scenario and consider the same hydroclimatic variables as used with CESM2-LE. Due to the coarser spatial resolution and limited ensemble size of the CNRM simulations relative to CESM2-LE, the CNRM model is used exclusively for sensitivity analysis of the event emergence time. The CESM2-LE large ensemble enables us to compute probabilistic estimates of the ToFE, duration, and waiting time of extreme events. Our 100-member CESM2 large ensemble provides enough data to robustly estimate extreme event statistics. Only CESM2-LE and CNRM provide the variables necessary for our analysis, so other large ensemble simulations cannot be used in our study. We use the global reservoirs database, which includes information on reservoir location, capacity, and the long-term average discharge (1971–2000) available from the Global Reservoir and Dams (GRanD)73 database. The global reservoir database includes both reservoirs constructed by humans and natural lakes, according to Lehner et al.73. The GRanD database version 1.3 was used due to its highly adaptable geodatabase that offers expanded attribute coverage and spatial precision, making it possible to implement regional or global analysis at unprecedented spatial resolution73,74,75. We assigned reservoirs to the closest grid point in CESM2-LE to facilitate integration with climate model outputs. The monthly global gridded water consumption data for sectoral water use under SSP3 and SSP2, and the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario, RCP6.0 and RCP4.5, covering the period from 2010 to 2100, were downloaded from Khan et al.76. Both scenarios are available from the same five Global Climate Models (GCMs): GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM. We use the available SSP3-RCP6.0 data due to the unavailability of sectoral water use data for SSP3-RCP7.0. We consider the available water demand data from different sectors, such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, to capture the socio-economic development water use demand. To our knowledge, there are no global historical and observed data for sectoral water consumption, covering in particular domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, for the historical period from 1850 to 2009. This lack of historical and observational data represents a major challenge for the analysis of long-term water demand. Therefore, we reconstruct the water consumption data from 1850 to 2009 using a backward nonlinear logarithmic regression approach based on the Dose-Response Curve (DRC) model in R77. The model is trained with each specific month of future water consumption for the period 2010–2100 and then applied to predict past values. Specifically, the logarithmic curve DRC.logCurve() function is used to estimate water consumption for each month of the year for the period 1850–2009. This approach is implemented for each grid point from the global climate models provided by Khan et al.76 to obtain a monthly gridded long-time series of water demand for the study period, from 1850 to 2100, for each grid. Importantly, to preserve the seasonal cycle and interannual variability, the nonlinear model was fitted independently for each month: for example, the curve was fitted using all January values from 2010–2100 to reconstruct the backward trend for January from 2009 to 1850; this process was repeated separately for each calendar month (January to December), in each grid cell of each GCMs. This method allows us to generate plausible historical estimates that align with the socio-economic trends incorporated in the scenario data, while recognizing the associated uncertainties. We acknowledge that this method introduces uncertainties as it assumes smooth socio-economic transitions over time and does not explicitly account for unexpected historical disruptions in water use patterns or development pathways, such as technological innovations or abrupt policy changes. Additionally, the reliance on the scenario means that reconstructed trends reflect a world characterized by high socio-economic fragmentation and challenges to sustainable development, which may not fully align with actual historical pathways. Despite these limitations, this reconstruction approach offers an estimate of historical water consumption trends, maintaining spatial, temporal, and sectoral variability. The spatial patterns and temporal evolution of water demand, along with inter-period differences, are illustrated in Supplementary Fig. These reconstructed datasets serve as structured estimates to support consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial resolution of all data is interpolated to the CESM2-LE and CNRM resolution using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the Climate Data Operator78 (CDO) for their respective analysis. We also use global spatial population datasets from the history database of the global environment (HYDE), version HYDE3.3 from Klein Goldewijk et al.79, to assess the population exposure from 1900 to 2009 at decadal intervals. In addition to that, we use the global spatial population projections SSP3 scenario obtained from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)80, from 2010 to 2100, at decadal intervals to assess the future population exposure. The drought index, Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), is a widely used indicator for investigating drought characteristics81,82,83,84,85,86, including onset, duration, and magnitude. This study uses the SPEI to quantify and classify drought severity due to its capacity to reflect the change in water deficiency. The index does not account for actual water losses from the land surface but considers potential evapotranspiration (PET), a significant factor87 in the future risk of extreme drought83, making it more robust in categorizing drought and detecting its onset and evolution in the context of global warming88 due to its contribution to the interaction of land-atmosphere conditions and drought87. Thus, the monthly gridded SPEI was obtained through the method proposed by Vicente-Serrano et al.88 using the modified Hargreaves method89 to investigate the importance of the range of maximum and minimum temperatures in drought conditions. Moreover, the SPEI allows comparisons between regions across different climatic conditions and considers the onset and duration of drought. The SPEI can be used to investigate the impact of prolonged multi-year drought trends on hydrological and ecological variables, as well as on water storage deficits90,91. SPEI can effectively be utilized to depict the hydrological drought on a longer time scale91. However, hydrological drought is a complex phenomenon involving various factors92,93,94 such as runoff or stream flow95, water balance, human activities, and water demand. The interaction between precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, recharge, groundwater, and discharge has been known65, but its application to drought is relatively recent. Thus, the causes of hydrological drought are complicated as they involve the atmosphere and hydrological processes that supply moisture to the atmosphere, contribute to water storage, and generate runoff to streams93. In addition, the streamflow drought will be defined as a multi-year insufficient river discharge, as most of the water supply comes in the form of river flow or runoff after all surface physical processes have been completed. In snow-fed river systems, river flow can still act as a water supply independent of immediate precipitation inputs. For instance, during periods of low precipitation, melting snow can sustain river flow. This is where the Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI) plays a crucial role, as it captures river drought conditions based on streamflow variations, reflecting both precipitation-driven and non-precipitation-driven water inputs. Therefore, we use a single input standardized drought index, called SRFI, the same as Vicente-Serrano et al.96, to represent and categorize the severity of the river flow resource depletion. The river discharge data was used as the input to calculate SRFI. The concept of the calculation of SPEI and SRFI is made by fitting an empirical cumulative distribution function to reference periods (1979–2014), using the spei() function in R as proposed by Begueria and Vicente-Serrano97. The fitted distribution is then applied to the monthly cumulative precipitation-evapotranspiration (SPEI) or streamflow (SRFI) to obtain cumulative probabilities, which are transformed into a standard normal distribution. This process effectively standardizes the data relative to the reference period (1979–2014), allowing for easy interpretation. Both drought indices, SPEI and SRFI, were computed at a 48-month timescale for each grid cell in every ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, covering the period from 1850 to 2100. To investigate the degree of water scarcity, we adopt the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI), which is conceptually equivalent to the Supply and Demand Balance Index introduced by Huang and Yin98, to represent the overexploitation of the water resources when the demand exceeds the supply. This index captures the imbalance between water availability and demand by taking the ratio of total water supply to total water consumption. The SWSI with a time scale of 48 months is used. The SWSI was chosen due to its capacity to represent the dynamic processes98 between the interaction of the water supply and demand for domestic usage and production in a region. The SWSI48 is the ratio of the 48-month accumulated total water supply and 48-month accumulated total water demand. The total water supply is estimated as the sum of surface water resources, including river flow and the net water balance (precipitation minus evapotranspiration), representing the available freshwater availability. The total water demand is the sum of water consumption from all sectors, such as domestic (dom), irrigation (irrig), industry (ind), electricity (elec), livestock (liv), and mining (min). Therefore, to calculate SWSI48, the total water consumption from the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) provided by Khan et al.76 (GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM) is randomly distributed across the total water supply from the CESM2-LE and CNRM (see Supplementary Fig. where TWS is the total water supply, Prec represents the precipitation, E is for evapotranspiration, flow for the river flow, and TWC represents the total water consumption. The definition of water scarcity from Huang and Yin98 is used for the degree of SWSI48, as extreme lack of water [0,0.3], acute shortage of water [0.3,0.6], moderate water shortage [0.6,0.9], slight shortage of water [0.9,1], and no shortage of water [≥1]. To assess the interdependence among the water stress indicators used in this study, we computed spatial correlations between the ensemble means of the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 derived from CESM2-LE simulations over the period 1850–2100. All-time series were detrended to remove systematic long-term trends associated with climate change and ensure that correlations reflect interdependence among the indicators. 4 shows strong positive correlations across most regions, indicating that the water stress tends to vary together over the multi-year time scales of 48 months. In contrast, the negative correlations between SPEI48 and SWSI48, and between SRFI48 and SWSI48, are generally weak, particularly across Africa, reflecting the influence of non-climatic drivers such as water demand on SWSI48. Overall, both weak positive and negative correlations are observed in many regions, suggesting a more complex relationship between climate-driven drought indicators (SPEI48 and SWSI48, and SRFI48 and SWSI48). In order to minimize the model errors, this study used a bias correction method to reduce model bias. 1 shows a more detailed structure of the steps in the methods and the processes used in this study. The monthly database from ERA5-Land (1979–2022) was used to calculate ERA5's SPEI48 and SRFI48, with 1979–2014 as the reference period, which is used as the observational drought indices reference to calibrate the drought indices for each ensemble member of CESM2-LE individually. Although observational sources are the best to achieve the ideal bias correction, we opted for reanalysis products because they consistently assimilate a variety of variables in a physically consistent manner, and it is assumed to be close to observed data. This choice ensures global coverage and temporal completeness, particularly important in data-sparse regions or for long historical records where high-quality observational data are unavailable or inconsistent. The ERA5-Land dataset was found to be a trustworthy reference to calibrate CESM2-LE indices. In order to increase our confidence in future extreme drought projections, we applied the univariate Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM), as Ansari et al.99 found it to be more robust for the correction of indices. 14 shows that direct correction (post-processing QDM) of the drought indices as a single variable reduces the bias between ERA's SPEI48 and the ensemble mean of the CESM2-LE's SPEI48 and manages to capture the distribution of SPEI48. In addition, Van de Velde et al.100 stated that the simpler univariate BC methods are better to use for climate change impact assessment, as the multivariate BC methods failed to handle non-stationary climate conditions. This approach maintains the model-projected climate change signal while simultaneously correcting the distributional biases. The QDM bias correction method, introduced by Cannon et al.101, is a cumulative distribution function (CDF)-based bias correction method designed specifically to reduce the biases between the modeled and observed distribution of drought indices, while preserving the model-projected climate change signal. The additive form of QDM is applied to bias correct the systematic biases in each quantile of the drought indices calculated from the CESM2-LE and CNRM simulations, using the ERA-derived indices as observational references while preserving the model-projected absolute changes across all quantiles of the distribution. The important concept of QDM is its ability to maintain the trend in all the quantiles within the distribution of the climate model output, which is important when future changes are not uniform across the distribution. It is used to quantile detrend the model projections and adjust distributional biases in model projections, ensuring the sensitivity of the underlying climate model without affecting the distribution101,102,103. Instead of directly fitting the full distribution of the future model, QDM quantifies the change at each quantile between the historical and future period model values at that same quantile level. This allows distribution biases to be corrected while maintaining quantile-specific climate change signals, thus preserving the sensitivity of the climate model. The univariate bias correction was performed using the QDM method available in the Multivariate Bias Correction (MBC) package in R. For each grid cell, drought indices from each member of the CESM-LE and CNRM are corrected independently, using their quantile location relative to the observed (ERA5) drought indices. Specifically, each value of SPEI48 and SRFI48, computed from each grid cell of every ensemble member of the CESM2-LE and CNRM datasets, within the period 1850-2100, is corrected as a single variable following the direct QDM approach, respectively. To correct the bias in SWSI48, we applied the univariate QDM method to the total water supply (precipitation-evapotranspiration + river discharge) at each grid cell of each ensemble member of CESM2-LE and CNRM, treated as a single aggregated time series rather than bias-correcting each individual component (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and river discharge). This aggregated variable represents the net variable water and is more relevant for capturing water scarcity as reflected in SWSI48. We could not apply the bias correction of the total water demand (consumption) due to the unavailability of consistent observed sectoral water use data across the historical period at the global scale. To assess the effect of different bias correction strategies, we evaluated both pre- and post-processing approaches using CESM2-LE under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 14, post-processing (i.e., direct bias correction of SPEI, Supplementary Fig. 14c) better captures the distribution of SPEI from ERA5 (Supplementary Fig. 14a), while pre-processing (i.e., bias correction of precipitation and temperatures prior to computing the index; Supplementary Fig. 14d) tends to introduce additional bias, particularly by amplifying wet conditions. Furthermore, we evaluated the distributional properties of the corrected indices using Q-Q plots, shown in Supplementary Fig. These plots compared the quantiles of SPEI48 from CESM2-LE (with and without correction) and ERA5, both at the global mean scale and for a representative grid point (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°). At the grid level (longitude 43.40° and latitude −23.21°), the correction successfully adjusted for extreme droughts and ensured consistency with observed drought characteristics. Overall, our bias correction method effectively improves the distributional agreement between CESM2-LE and ERA5, while maintaining long-term trends. This provides a more accurate basis for assessing drought characteristics and their implications for water scarcity under historical and future climate conditions. As with most bias correction methods, QDM has limitations, as it assumes that model biases are relative to the present reference dataset, which may change in the future. Although this assumption simplifies the correction process, it may not hold under evolving climate conditions. An important aspect of drought impacts is the availability of water in reservoirs. The onset of drought conditions and continuing water demand will also affect reservoir water levels. To assess the severity of the drought events, we have to also consider the Time for the Reservoir to Dry (TRD) as the ratio of the maximum capacity and the monthly average discharge at reservoir locations, by considering only the reservoirs with verified, good and fair quality index73, which represents 93% of the GRanD' reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. For human-made reservoirs, the maximum capacity refers to the maximum value of the storage capacity, and for natural lakes, it is the given lake level by Lehner et al.73. The lack of water level time series in the reservoirs makes it hard to estimate the time scales by which they might run dry. Instead of the available capacity of the reservoir (maximum minus minimum capacity), the maximum capacity was used because it was a readily available parameter for most reservoirs and due to the lack of the points layer of minimum capacity in the GRanD database. Moreover, climate change may alter the future operation of reservoirs, so using the maximum capacity is useful for assessing the suitability of water storage strategies. The TRD is similar to the resident time (time of water spent in reservoirs) and can be considered as the duration to take for a drought event to dry the water in the reservoirs if the only source of the water supply of the reservoirs is the depleted river flow during a drought period. This reflects hydrological drought situations in which rivers continue to flow, albeit at diminished levels insufficient to meet water demand, allowing assessment of how long reservoirs can sustain supply under such stress. We define the compound multi-year drought, based on the IPCC104 definition of a compound event, as extended periods, often spanning several years (e.g., 48 months or 4 years for this study), during which multiple hydrological indicators, such as long-term rainfall deficiency, streamflow, water demand, and reservoir storage, experience simultaneous and persistent deficits. Here, these droughts are characterized by the concurrent occurrence of below-normal water availability across various hydrological systems, exacerbated by interrelated factors such as reduced precipitation with increased evapotranspiration (SPEI48), increase in water consumption (SWSI48), and depleted river flow (SRFI48). The compound nature of these events indicates the presence of multiple interacting drivers that collectively intensify water scarcity over a prolonged period. We define “Day zero drought” (DZD) as an acute water scarcity event driven by a compound multi-year hydrological drought, during which water demand exceeds water supply under prolonged drought conditions. DZD occurs due to a critical imbalance between supply and demand, driven both by climate-induced reduction in supply and anthropogenic pressures increasing demand. In fact, water can be retained in the reservoir through different parts of the hydrological cycle and different resident times (time of water spent in reservoirs) considered similar to TRD. As the river flow contributes to the long-term storage of water in the reservoir, we considered the river discharge to be an appropriate parameter. DZD is the impact of the simultaneous occurrence of a long-term (48-month) critical rainfall deficiency and extreme dearth of water of low-flow river discharge during a prolonged drought in the context of global warming and long duration exceeding the time for the reservoirs to run out of water. This is formalized as follows: where \({{dur}}_{{ce}}\) is the duration of the compound extreme. The identification of DZD was carried out at each grid cell across each of the 100 members of the CESM2-LE model, offering a comprehensive and probabilistic perspective on future water scarcity risk. However, global warming is expected to disrupt and intensify the variability of the water cycle16, leading to increasingly frequent and severe fluctuations between excessively wet and dry periods17. Warmer climates are projected to enhance the evapotranspiration, resulting in dry conditions18. Additionally, reductions in precipitation and surface runoff are expected in many regions16, further increasing the likelihood of both climatological and hydrological droughts19,20,21,22. Moreover, population growth, economic development, and expansion of modern agriculture drive the rise in water consumption, placing additional pressure on water resources. Therefore, dry conditions driven by anthropogenic climate change and socio-economic development are jointly altering the global balance between water supply and demand, thereby amplifying the risk of DZD. Our concept distinguishes between drought and water scarcity, while also capturing their interaction in driving the DZD event. Drought refers to a reduction in water availability either through decreased precipitation, increased evaporation, or reduced river flow. Water Scarcity is often human-driven from anthropogenic pressure, such as population, growth, agricultural expansion, industrial use, and mismanagement of water resources. Water scarcity can occur even in the absence of climate change if water use is unsustainable. In this study, we focused on water scarcity driven by drought, where the reduction of water supply is driven by dry conditions. In this context, the water stress is considered as a result of a compound event due to atmospheric conditions (precipitation and evaporative demand; SPEI48), streamflow conditions (SRFI48), and demand condition (SWSI48) of 48-months occur with important depletion of water supply and increase of water demand; and where the duration of the event is longer than the time of the closest reservoirs to dry (TRD). This study offers a global-scale assessment of DZD emergence and its characteristics, capturing the interactions between climate human-driven factors. Therefore, DZD is considered as an extreme water scarcity event, characterized by the fact that the water resources available in a region are largely below the limited reservoir's capacity compared to the pre-industrial period. This is attributed to both anthropogenic climate change and an increase in water use. To our knowledge, this study is the first global-scale assessment of the timing of the emergence of Day Zero Drought conditions and its characteristics. DZD is characterized by the concurrent exceedance of critical threshold in four indicators: (1) The standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI48) below minus 1.5 (SPEI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviations, signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts to classify the arid atmospheric condition, through prolonged deficits in precipitation and increased evapotranspiration, leading to a long-term surface water stress and can significantly influence the change in groundwater (Supplementary Fig. (2) The Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) below minus 1.5 (SRFI48 ≤−1.5, exceedance of 1.5 standard deviation), signifying 1.5 standard deviation droughts, to detect the depletion of river flow conditions, representing the state of the severe drought in river flow during dry periods. (3) The Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) below 0.6 (SWSI48 ≤0.6) is used to quantify the imbalance between total water supply and demand and to represent the long-term average insufficiency of resources relative to demand during periods of drought, leading to an acute water scarcity. (4) The duration of the compound event (\({{{{\rm{dur}}}}}_{{{{\rm{ce}}}}}\)) exceeding the estimated time for reservoir depletion (TRD), when reservoirs exist. If no reservoir is present, the DZD is defined by the first three indicators. This framework reflects the reality that water scarcity emerges from the convergence of multiple stressors. Each indicator plays a distinct but interrelated role in defining DZD; therefore, none is weighted as more important than another. Their simultaneous exceedance is necessary to identify a DZD event, filtering out less severe or isolated events. For instance, precipitation deficits alone may not result in a crisis without demand pressure. i.e., in low low-demand case, just as high demand may not lead to scarcity if the supply is still enough. Similarly, even in the absence of climate variability, unsustainable consumption alone can trigger water scarcity if water use surpasses the available resource. To evaluate the CESM2-LE ability to reproduce observed compound drought conditions, we compared the spatial distribution of compound hydrological extremes computed from the ERA5-Land reanalysis and CESM2-LE (ensemble mean of the number of compound hydrological events) data for the period 1979–2022. Specifically, we examined the number of occurrences where both 48-month scales of Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration (SPEI48) and Standardized River Flow Index (SRFI48) were less than or equal to −1.5. This threshold represents severe to extreme dry conditions. Due to the lack of observed data on total water consumption across all sectors (domestic, irrigation, industrial, electricity generation, livestock, and mining), we were unable to include the 48-month Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48) in this observation comparison. 18) indicates that CESM-LE reasonably captures the spatial patterns of compound events defined by \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5 \cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\), as observed in ERA5. Although ERA5 exhibits slightly more compound events overall, the CESM2-LE ensemble mean estimates comparably and even exceeds ERA5 over China and Russia, indicating possible regional differences in model response. FAR has been found to be effective in identifying the anthropogenic signal behind extreme events105,106,107 such as DZD. According to Perkins-Kirkpatrick et al.105, FAR can be useful for understanding climate change signals, but more useful results are achieved by refocusing attribution questions on changes in impact return value and magnitude across large samples. To the best of our knowledge, the evaluation of ToFE of the DZD relative to the anthropogenic signal with a predefined threshold of joint probability by FAR has not yet been carried out. Therefore, this study proposes an innovative method to assess the ToFE of compound extreme events by considering human-induced attribution. Few studies have used different alternatives to define or identify the ToFE when the hydrological drought differs from their past counterparts38. We are aware that even with such different methods, including our method here, uncertainties may arise, for example, due to internal variability108 or the considered scenarios109. By applying the FAR method, we measure the influence of anthropogenic climate change by comparing the probability of occurrence of DZD in the baseline period (pre-industrial period: 1850–1899) with the anthropogenic forcing period. We identify DZD events using a threshold-based approach, as outlined in Eq. This ensures that the events are derived from the indices (SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48) and reflect extreme drought event conditions and acute water scarcity. By applying a threshold-based approach, we transform the continuous drought indices into distinct, binary events (e.g., DZD or no DZD). Which aligns with the requirements for FAR analysis. Once the DZD events are identified, the events are treated as independent occurrences, ensuring that the FAR method is aligned with its intended purpose of analyzing distinct extreme events. The calculation of the probability of the forcing events has been conducted on decadal time scales. Where \({P}_{{preindustrial}}\) represents the probability of the counterfactual scenario, which is calculated as the ratio between the total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensemble members during the preindustrial period (1850–1899) and the total number of samples within the same period (\({N}_{{preindustrial}}\)). While \({P}_{{forcing}}(t)\) represents the probability under the factual scenario, which is the ratio between the decadal total number of DZD event occurrences across all 100 ensembles during each decade from 1900 to 2100 and the total number of samples during that decade (\({N}_{{forcing}}(t)\)). The ToFE of DZD is identified as the first decade in which the FAR is greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs (Supplementary Fig. We computed the ToFE by considering the year of construction of a reservoir. Each reservoir has a different year of construction; therefore, if a reservoir existed in the considered grid point, the DZD detection period would extend from the year of completion to 2100. But if there is no reservoir, we use 1900–2100. Hence, we aim to detect events that have not occurred during the preindustrial period, but which will occur and intensify in the future as a result of anthropogenic global warming. In that sense, we identify unprecedented hydrological extreme events. While the ToFE is an important measure of global warming impacts, its true impact is measured by how long these events last and how soon they will re-occur once they have emerged for the first time. The length of time of a DZD event is defined as the DZD duration, while the waiting time is identified as the time elapsed between the end of the previous event and the start of the next consecutive DZD event, as illustrated in Supplementary Fig. To quantify these characteristics, we calculate the DZD duration and waiting time at each grid cell globally across the CESM2-LE for all ensemble members. We calculate the waiting time directly by counting the number of months after the decade of the ToFE under anthropogenic influence until the next event, for all consecutive DZD events until 2100, while the duration is calculated by the length of a DZD event once it occurs. In addition, we assess the frequency of extreme DZD conditions, characterized by events that are both frequent and prolonged. Specifically, for each grid point and each ensemble member of CESM2-LE, we identify all DZD events occurring between the decade of ToFE and the year 2100. We then count the number of DZD event where its duration exceeds the waiting time, i.e., cases where the DZD event persists longer than the recovery period before the next event. These counts are aggregated at each grid across all 100 members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100. The frequency of extreme DZD conditions is computed at each grid cell as the ratio of the sum of these events to the total DZD events across all members of CESM2-LE within the ToFE and 2100 period. This spatially explicit frequency is then mapped globally (Fig. 3c) to highlight regions most vulnerable to sustained and recurrent DZD conditions. For each DZD-prone region shown in central spatial map of Fig. 3, we then average the values across all grids located within the regions. To characterize the statistical distribution of these metrics, we fit probability density functions (PDFs) to the distributions of DZD duration and waiting time. The ToFE depends partly on the used global warming scenario. In order to provide an alternative view, we also estimated the global warming levels at each DZD event emergence. We tested the sensitivity of ToFE to six factors. Therefore, to test the robustness of the DZD definition, we performed a sensitivity analysis using different thresholds for SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48 (Supplementary Fig. The ToFE emerges later than in Fig. 2a, particularly in Africa, where ToFE is sensitive to SPEI48, i.e., to the decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration. 10c, k), particularly in the northern part of Africa. Then, as we continued to modify SRFI48 so that it is less than −1 (Supplementary Fig. 10d, l), the ToFE becomes earlier than Fig. 2a, mostly in the northern part of Africa. After that, we repeated the same analysis, but considering SWSI48 less than 1, SPEI48 less than −2, and SRFI48 below −1.5 (Supplementary Fig. 10e, m); while SRFI48 below 1.6 for Supplementary Fig. 10f, n. The results show that ToFE is more likely to start earlier than Fig. 2a in a few regions, meaning that ToFE is more likely to be sensitive to streamflow depletion (SRFI48) and increased water consumption (SWSI48). 10g, o; and SWSI48 below 0.6 for Supplementary Fig. Therefore, we can conclude that the ToFE of DZD is more sensitive to the severity of decreasing precipitation and increasing evapotranspiration (SPEI48), the river flow drought (SRFI48) and increasing water demand (SWSI48), particularly in Africa, while increasing water consumption solely have an impact on the early emergence of ToFE in some parts of Asia and America, compared to the other factor. The SRFI48 and SWSI48 are more closely related to the actual availability of river flow and water use, respectively. When water demand rises, the available water supply (e.g., river flow, even if unaffected by precipitation) becomes insufficient to meet demand, triggering drought-like conditions (or water scarcity) in terms of availability. Secondly, to assess whether the treatment of grid cells with and without (as defined in Eq. (3) for DZD) or solely without reservoir (DZD is defined as a compound event of \({{{\rm{SPEI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\,\cap {{{\rm{SRFI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}-1.5\cap {{{\rm{SWSI}}}}48{{{\rm{\le }}}}0.6\)), introduces inconsistencies in the spatial patterns of ToFE, we conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing ToFE patterns (Supplementary Fig. The results reveal that spatial differences are negligible in most regions. The most noticeable delays are confined to the Mediterranean region, where major reservoirs constructions were completed mid- to late-twentieth century (Supplementary Fig. As climate change influences the onset of compound events, it is critical for decision-makers to revisit the role of existing water infrastructure in future water security planning. The application of FAR greater than 0.99, combined with localized reservoir adjustment of DZD detection, ensures that the global ToFE pattern represents both high attribution confidence and hydrological realism, without introducing methodological biases between grid cells with and without reservoirs. Our approach seems to be reasonable, and we also checked the sensitivity of our assumption by doubling and quadrupling the TRD time scale (Supplementary Fig. The results show that only a few regions have a small change of one decade with increased TRD. However, the TRD is also influenced by various socio-economic factors, such as water demand and the socio-economic sectoral usage, which we address using the Standardized Water Scarcity Index (SWSI48). It is important to note that political decisions regarding management were not included in this modeling approach. Fourthly, we have looked at the sensitivity of the time scale by considering the 36- and 60-month time scales (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16) of long-duration compound events for SPEI, SRFI, and SWSI. Only a few regions, located almost entirely in Africa, show changes in ToFE using a 36 or 60-month timescale of extreme events, as shown in Supplementary Fig. We repeat the analysis, looking at the model uncertainty by looking for the ToFE for each member in CESM2-LE, based on the following formulation of FAR below (Eq. This allows us to examine the spread of emerging timing of Fay Zero Droughts (DZD) and to evaluate the inter-member agreement as shown in Supplementary Fig. The result exhibit, Supplementary Fig. 20a, substantial variability among ensemble members between 1900 and 1990, reflecting high uncertainty during this early period when the anthropogenic signal is still weak relative to internal variability, showing that structural uncertainty arising from the use of a single model remains an important caveat. However, a strong ensemble consensus emerged after 2000, with most members indicating emergence between 2020 and 2030, and increasing agreement toward the end of the twenty-first century. Individual ensemble members (thin green lines) show very synchronized emergence between 2030–2040. There is a sharp, narrow peak, indicating low ensemble spread and high confidence in ToFE under strong forcing. This coherence across members supports the robustness of our findings in terms of both timing and magnitude of anthropogenic influence on DZD events in CESM2-LE under SSP3-7.0. The ToFE of DZD has been considered as the first decade of FAR greater than 0.99, where a 99% probability of the impact of the acute water scarcity that has emerged can be associated with a human-induced signal after the decade of completion of reservoirs. Sixthly, to evaluate the influence of model structural uncertainty on the ToFE of DZD events, we extended our analysis beyond CESM2-LE by using hydro-climatic data from the Centre National de Recherche Météorologiques (CNRM) models (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 with 1.4 ×1.4 degrees) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Specifically, we analyzed simulations under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, including monthly precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, and river discharge data spanning 1850-2100. Due to the unavailability of water demand projections under SSP3-7.0, we used water consumption estimates from SSP3-RCP6.0 across the five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM, which account for sectoral water use sectors such as domestic, irrigation, industry, electricity, livestock, and mining, capturing socio-economic development water use demand. We applied the same methodology used for CESM2-LE. Computing the three key indicators, the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applying quantile delta mapping (QDM) bias correction using drought indices ERA5-based references. To ensure methodological consistency and data completeness, we selected 10 ensemble members from the CNRM model that include both atmospheric and river discharge variables across historical and both SSP2-45 and SSP3-7.0 future scenarios: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). We use the methods as structured estimates that enable consistent analysis across regions and sectors. The spatial patterns (Supplementary Fig. 21) reveal pronounced inter-model and scenario differences. Results from the CNRM model indicate that, under both SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios, 51% of DZD-affected regions are projected to face unprecedented water scarcity by 2100, with 22% experiencing emergence as early as 2020–2030 (Supplementary Fig. 21a), which projects later DZD emergence and a more geographically confined hotspot, especially in the Mediterranean, the United States of America (USA), and Africa, the CNRM model (Supplementary Fig. 21b, c) shows earlier and more widespread emergence. The inter-model comparison (Supplementary Fig. 21d, e) reveals that CESM2-LE and CNRM disagree on the emergence of DZD in 76% of DZD-prone regions, indicating that emergence is detected in only one of the two models in some areas. Notably, 14% of ToFE show later emergence under CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. 21d), even under the same forcing scenario (SSP3-7.0), suggesting that CESM2-LE is more conservative in detecting later emergence of compound hydrological extremes. However, CESM2-LE and CNRM agree on DZD occurrence across 24% of the DZD-prone land area, though within this overlap, CESM2-LE projects later emergence over 14% of the area and earlier emergence over 10% compared to CNRM. Moreover, ensemble spread within CNRM (Supplementary Fig. The PDFs of individual members are more dispersed, with multiple peaks and flatter. The thick green line (representing ToFE derived from Eq. (4)) is broader and flatter, indicating the variability in ToFE across ensemble members, reflecting uncertainty in the timing of DZD emergence across members. This variability emphasized the challenge of detecting a robust probabilistic signal from a limited ensemble size. These findings highlight the critical role of model structural differences in shaping projections of hydrological extremes. Importantly, probabilistic attribution methods, such as the FAR, require large ensemble sizes to confidently characterize forced emergence signals. The relatively small ensemble available for CNRM under SSP3-7.0 limits the reliability of such analysis and reinforces the need for larger and more consistent multi-model ensemble frameworks to assess future water scarcity risks. Finally, to assess the sensitivity of the ToFE of DZD relative to future socioeconomic scenarios, we applied our detection framework to hydro-climatic simulations from CMIP6 CNRM models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario. We utilized the same ensemble members of the CNRM model to ensure consistency: CM6-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2, r6i1p1f2), ESM2-1 (r2i1p1f2, r3i1p1f2, r4i1p1f2, r5i1p1f2), and CM6-1-HR (r1i1p1f2). The analysis incorporated available water consumption projections from five Global Climate Models (GCMs) from GFDL, HADGEM, IPSL, MIROC, and NORESM under SSP2-RCP4.5. The approach followed the same methodological steps as applied to CESM2-LE (Supplementary Fig. Specifically, we computed the SPEI48, SRFI48, and SWSI48, and applied the bias correction method, QDM, using ERA5-based reference indices, and subsequently determined the ToFE. All datasets are interpolated to the CNRM atmospheric resolution (1.4° × 1.4°) using the first-order conservative remapping (remapcon) method from the CDO. 20c) reveal substantial spread among ensemble members under CNRM SSP2-4.5, highlighting pronounced uncertainty in DZD emergence timing throughout the twenty-first century. Compared to the higher-emission SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 20b), the emergence is delayed and more dispersed, with broader PDFs and later peaks, suggesting that moderate forcings lead to slower distribution and less certain emergence of water scarcity extremes. When comparing the special pattern of ToFE under CNRM SSP2-4.5 with CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0 (Supplementary Fig. 21e), results show that high spatial disagreement of 76% of land areas exhibit uncertain DZD emergence, meaning that emergence is detected in only one of the models. Only 9% of regions show earlier emergence in CESM2-LE SSP3-7.0, while 14% indicate later emergence relative to CNRM SSP2-4.5. By considering the same model, CNRM, under different scenarios, SSP3-7.0 and SSP2-4.5 (Supplementary Fig. 21f), the uncertainty still dominates but decreases to 43% of the land area, and spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios. Notably, the near-equal split between earlier and later emergence in different regions indicates that scenario choice (SSP3-7.0 vs. SSP2-4.5) may affect ToFE more symmetrically but also underscores the spatial heterogeneity of hydrological responses to combined climate and water use stress. The results show that the influence of emission scenarios on DZD ToFE is region-specific, due to the interaction between regional climate drivers and human water use. Under the high-emission scenario (SSP3-7.0), DZD emergence can either advance or be delayed depending on the region. Notably, spatial discrepancies in DZD-prone regions persist across scenarios, with 43% of the land area remaining uncertain between the SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0 scenarios within the CNRM model. However, both scenarios, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, agree on DZD emergence across 57% of the DZD-prone land area. Within this overlap, SSP3-7.0 projects later emergence over 17% of the area and earlier emergence over 18% compared to SSP2-4.5, while 22% of the area shows no change in the ToFE between the two scenarios (Supplementary Fig. These findings underscore the role of both scenario and model structures in shaping DZD emergence. Notably, even under high-forcing SSP3-7.0, CESM2-LE may still project later ToFE than CNRM under moderate forcing (SSP2-4.5), pointing to differences in model sensitivity to hydro-climatic stressors. This highlights the importance of multi-model and multi-scenario assessments when evaluating risks associated with extreme emergence and water scarcity. Furthermore, a probabilistic approach such as the FAR requires large ensembles to ensure robust estimates. The relatively small ensemble size of CNRM limits the confidence in scenario-attribution results, underscoring the need for ensemble expansion and multi-model convergence to improve attribution robustness and risk quantification. Given these model differences, CESM2-LE provides output at a higher spatial resolution (1.25° × 0.9375°) compared to the lower-resolution CNRM model (1.40625° × 1.40625°). CESM2-LE detects finer-scale features and localized extremes that may be overlooked or underrepresented in the CNRM. Therefore, we have not aggregated events across both CESM2-LE and CNRM, since increasing the CNRM resolution to the resolution of CESM2-LE could introduce spatial biases and distort the representation of extreme events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Indigenous Infants, This Devastating Virus Finally Meets a Formidable Foe She now works to raise awareness about RSV and its effects on the reservation. This article is part of “Innovations In: RSV,” an editorially independent special report that was produced with financial support from MSD, Sanofi and AstraZeneca. At first, Ethel Branch thought her two-year-old son, Patro, had a cold or maybe the flu. That day, fever, congestion and lethargy set in to the point that Branch took Patro to an emergency room in Winslow, Ariz., where he was diagnosed with croup, given steroids and released. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Frantic, Branch rushed Patro to the larger Flagstaff Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), placed on oxygen and admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. “My son got COVID, and it was not that bad,” Branch recalls. “In fact, he didn't even really present symptoms. But with RSV, I couldn't have waited any longer before taking him into the ER because his chest was depressed.” Patro left the hospital after four days, but his recovery was far from over. Three years later, he still goes to the emergency room for oxygen and breathing treatments every winter. For Branch, a Harvard-trained lawyer and former attorney general of the Navajo Nation, her son's encounter with RSV was eye-opening. She realized that the dangers of RSV were largely unrecognized—not just by her or the health care workers who initially misdiagnosed him but across her tribal community as well. Over time, she also learned that her son's experience was shockingly common among Native Americans, especially those on reservations, where lack of infrastructure and multigenerational households make them uniquely vulnerable to this and other illnesses. But one year after Patro's RSV scare, scientific breakthroughs emerged that have begun to bend the RSV curve among young children in Native communities: a monoclonal antibody and a maternal vaccine that can dramatically cut RSV-related hospitalizations among infants. Throughout their history, the Diné—like many other tribes—have endured devastating epidemics, including smallpox, mumps and pneumonia in the 17th and 18th centuries, which decimated their population. Their forced removal from their lands in 1864, known as the Long Walk, led to deadly outbreaks of measles, dysentery and pneumonia at the Bosque Redondo internment camp at Fort Sumner, N.M. In his seminal history on the pre-Columbian Americas, author Charles C. Mann noted that none of the major infectious diseases—including smallpox, measles, typhoid, leprosy, bubonic plague, tuberculosis, scarlet fever, diphtheria, influenza and cholera—existed in the Western Hemisphere prior to European contact. Recognizing the lethality of these diseases, the Europeans turned to biological warfare to destroy and subjugate Native communities by giving them smallpox-infected blankets, clothing and other “gifts,” deliberately spreading the deadly illness among Indigenous populations, according to medical researchers at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in Greece. This was one of the deadliest demographic collapses in human history. When COVID arrived in early 2020, tribal nations across North America immediately understood the threat and implemented strict prevention measures, including lockdowns, checkpoints, temperature checks, masking and other methods to protect their communities. Despite these efforts, tribal communities from Alaska to Maine still experienced some of the highest rates of COVID infection and death in the country. But even as COVID captured global attention, a quieter but relentless virus continued to stalk tribal communities, striking Native American infants and toddlers with unmatched severity: RSV. RSV has been a persistent threat among all tribes. These stark disparities have been driven largely by generations of displacement, broken treaties and systemic neglect. “Water alone is a huge public health issue for us because roughly 30 percent of the households on our reservation have no running water,” Branch says. “And it's very expensive for our people to haul their own, and they have to ration, which has had a direct impact on the health of the Navajo Nation.” Access to basic resources and challenging living conditions have created environments where infectious diseases thrive—which highlights how health outcomes are tied to social inequities, says Laura Hammitt, director of Infectious Disease Programs at the Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health. Laura Hammitt, director of Infectious Disease Programs at the Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health, guided the Indigenous research portion of a worldwide nirsevimab study. American Indian and Alaska Native children have some of the highest rates of RSV transmission, hospitalization and mortality in the country. “So I had a hyperawareness of things like this. But even so, I had no idea what RSV was.” After her son's hospitalization, Branch began researching RSV and was shocked to learn that high transmission rates on the Navajo Nation reservation had been a serious problem for years. As COVID cases began to decline and lockdowns eased on the reservation, she realized a public health crisis was emerging as people began to gather again, spreading germs. Meanwhile frontline health workers, armed with experience from COVID, were building better systems to track and fight infectious diseases, laying the groundwork that continues to shape the Navajo Nation's response to RSV and other medical threats. Burrage led the efforts at Tuba City's hospital by organizing a comprehensive response, including data collection, contact tracing, community outreach, disease surveillance, testing, vaccination campaigns and staff training. Once that infrastructure was in place, Burrage and her team could apply these same tools to other infectious diseases such as RSV. “Prior to COVID, we did not have anybody on staff at Tuba City focused on the data or tracking the RSV tests that were positive and cases that were hospitalized,” says Burrage, who serves as the facility's medical director of public health. She splits her time between her clinical practice and public health efforts aimed at improving disease surveillance, prevention and response across the region. Amanda Burrage, a pediatrician and public health expert, is leading the efforts at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation on the Navajo Nation reservation to ensure children receive nirsevimab immunizations against RSV. As COVID cases began to recede, RSV transmission and hospitalizations started to spike at Tuba City, signaling the virus's aggressive return after people stopped isolating. For some children, this can quickly spiral into pneumonia or bronchiolitis, requiring hospitalization and sometimes intensive care. Because young children have more fragile immune systems and lungs, RSV can overwhelm their bodies quickly, making it one of the most dangerous respiratory viruses for infants and toddlers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nirsevimab, under the commercial name Beyfortus, is a monoclonal antibody that provides infants passive immunization from RSV. Developed jointly by AstraZeneca and Sanofi, it's not technically a “vaccine” but an immunization that works by delivering antibodies that target the RSV-F protein, offering the strongest protection in the weeks after it is administered. Out of 1,490 global participants in that phase, approximately 83 Navajo infants were enrolled at Fort Defiance, Ariz., and at Shiprock and Gallup in New Mexico. The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices subsequently endorsed nirsevimab for all infants under eight months born during or entering their first RSV season. The committee made a special recommendation that American Indian and Alaska Native children aged eight months to 19 months receive a second dose for their second RSV season. When the trial began, prior to COVID, “we had pretty comprehensive data on what RSV looked like in a prepandemic setting,” Hammitt says. After nirsevimab's approval in 2023 by the Food and Drug Administration, public health officials at the Navajo Nation set their new public health apparatus in motion, reaching out to parents with eligible babies. Pfizer's RSV vaccine for pregnant people, Abrysvo, was also approved that year and offered parents another option to protect their babies. A single dose administered between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation confers protection to the fetus through the placenta and lasts for about six months after birth. “We were very proactive in reaching every family who had a child that was eligible,” says Burrage, whose staff worked overtime on parent outreach at Tuba City. But given the risks and high prevalence of RSV among Navajo children, she says, the vast majority are choosing to immunize their children. A second antibody injection, Enflonsia, was approved by the FDA for infant use in June 2025. “We certainly recognize this to be a game-changer for us in our community,” Burrage says. She encourages all Indigenous parents to get their children immunized against the virus. Branch, who now serves as deputy county attorney for the Coconino County Attorney's Office in Flagstaff, Ariz., hopes her son's story will serve as a wake-up call regarding the dangers of RSV. Patro fell ill before any prevention measures were available. Every winter she has to whisk him to the emergency room if he shows signs of wheezing or labored breathing, a vestige of his serious brush with RSV in 2022. “You don't want your kid to get RSV—ever,” Branch says. “So get that vaccine so you can save yourself and your child the trauma of having it in the first place, which is a horrible experience for everyone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tolkien, but in geology, they are very real, large-scale salt deposits within the Earth. For years, these deposits have been an area of focus for University of California (UC) Santa Barbara professor Eckart Meiburg, who has studied the fluid dynamics of the Dead Sea—a hypersaline terminal lake that just so happens to be the saltiest body of water on Earth. “These large deposits in the Earth's crust can be many, many kilometers horizontally, and they can be more than a kilometer thick in the vertical direction,” Meiburg said in a press statement. Being a terminal lake means that water only has one way of escaping the Dead Sea—evaporation, which tends to leave behind lots of salt in the process. This backdrop—in addition to other behaviors, such as internal currents and surface waves—is slowly forming salt giants, strangely mimicking the geologic past of a nearby aquatic neighbor. “But when tectonic motion closed off the Strait of Gibraltar, there couldn't be any water inflow from the North Atlantic.” This is known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis, which occurred around 5.96 to 5.33 million years ago.

Cell clusters that resemble the uterine lining grow with support cells in a synthetic hydrogel.Credit: Juan Gnecco, Linda G. Griffith In 2017, Ashley Moffett, a reproductive immunologist, walked to the pharmacy near her laboratory at the University of Cambridge, UK, to buy a pregnancy test. But she needed a way to be sure. The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health The new science of menopause: these emerging therapies could change women's health “We must do a pregnancy test on them,” Moffett said. If Turco was correct, the miniature ball of cells she had created would secrete HCG, the hormone that triggers a positive pregnancy test. “I took the stick, put it in, and it was positive,” says Turco, now a reproductive biologist at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research in Basel, Switzerland. Scientists make organoids such as this by coaxing stem cells to grow in a jelly-like substance and to self-assemble into clumps of tissue. The typically hollow or solid balls of cells don't look anything like real organs. But they do take on key aspects of the organ that they're meant to represent — liver, brain, lung or stomach, for instance. The cells divide, differentiate, communicate, respond to their environment and, just like in a real organ, die. “Animals are good models in the generalities, but they start to fall down in the particulars,” says Linda Griffith, a biological engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Over the past decade, organoid research has exploded. Researchers have used them to study early brain development, test cancer therapies and much more. And these 3D models stand to become even more crucial as US agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, aim to move away from animal testing. Women's health research lacks funding — these charts show how Women's health research lacks funding — these charts show how Now researchers are using organoids to study female reproduction, an area in which animal models can be especially limited. That challenge, along with a historical lack of funding for women's health research, has left basic questions unanswered. “I really see it as a powerful model to do science,” says Mirjana Kessler, a cell biologist at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany, who has developed an organoid that mimics the fallopian tube1 and a biobank of ovarian cancer organoids2. Organoids of the placenta, endometrium, ovary and vagina could help to reveal how these organs function, and what happens when things go awry. The placenta plays a key part in maternal health during pregnancy. Humans aren't the only species that develops a placenta, but the “human placenta is quite different than most other species, even primates actually, apart from apes”, says Moffett. Exactly what happens during the early days of placental development is still unclear, but problems at this stage can have serious consequences later. The invasive cells open up the arteries, “essentially making a channel so that mom can provide what she needs through her blood supply”, says Victoria Roberts, a developmental biologist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Beaverton. The process can be deadly if it goes wrong. If the placenta invades too deeply, a condition called placenta accreta, the expectant mother can lose too much blood during birth. And if the organ doesn't invade deeply enough, then the fetus might not get enough nutrients to sustain its growth. Organoids made of placental cells can help reveal how the organ invades the uterine lining.Credit: Turco lab, Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research Shallow invasion can also impact the mother's health. “It's a very serious pregnancy complication that goes silent and undetected until very late into pregnancy,” says Quinton Smith, a chemical engineer at the University of California, Irvine. To better understand the condition, Smith, Turco and other researchers are using organoids made of placental cells called trophoblasts to model the molecular processes involved. “It's got to be a compromise,” Moffett says. Organoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases Organoids grown from amniotic fluid could shed light on rare diseases As a case in point, when an embryo implants somewhere the lining doesn't exist — on a scar left by a previous caesarean delivery or in a fallopian tube, for example — “there's no control of the invasion at all”, Turco says. When Turco, Moffett and their colleagues exposed the mini-placentas to these chemical signals and analysed which genes the cells expressed, they found that many were associated with pre-eclampsia5. “I'm sure it's not the whole story,” Moffett says. “But it does show you how you can use those organoids to ask these fundamental questions about human pregnancy.” Turco's first attempt to create a mini-placenta in 2016 didn't go as planned. The placental tissue she was working with contained not only trophoblasts, but also a few rogue maternal cells from the endometrium, the uterine lining that builds up and then sheds each month during menstruation. Those maternal cells “kept on growing and taking over”, she says. But now Turco sees it as a wonderful discovery, because she instead grew organoids that represent the endometrium6. This, along with another endometrial model published in the same year7, really opened the door for everyone else, says Griffith. Griffith has been studying the endometrium for more than a decade. When Griffith hit puberty, she developed a debilitating condition called endometriosis. The disease, which affects about 10% of people with a uterus who are of reproductive age, occurs when endometrium-like tissue grows in places it doesn't belong. Because this tissue is trapped inside the body, it can't be shed properly. Although existing therapies address some of the symptoms, they don't provide a cure. Organoids are typically grown in Matrigel, a jelly-like substance extracted from mouse tumour cells that allows the cells to assemble into 3D structures. Griffith wanted to put epithelial cells, which compose the uterine lining, with stromal cells that support that lining. But Matrigel is packed with proteins that can hamper the cell-to-cell communication. So Griffith and her colleagues developed a hydrogel that's entirely synthetic8. To do this, she and her colleagues placed the organoid on a microfluidic chip surrounded by cells that form blood vessels. “We put all of these cells in together at the beginning in a gel, and the blood vessels form spontaneously,” she says. “So the organoids turn into lesion-like structures,” she adds. Griffith and her team have created these model systems from the cells of about a dozen people with endometriosis, and they're beginning to use them to test compounds that could be promising therapies for the condition. Turco, meanwhile, has developed her endometrial organoid into a model of menstruation9. Her team treated the endometrial organoids with hormones to mimic what happens when the endometrial lining is regenerating.

In the meantime, to ensure continued support, we are displaying the site without styles and JavaScript. Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases. Bone marrow is a significant fat storage site across species, ranging from fish to mammals1. Adipocytes are a normal component of the bone marrow microenvironment and collectively form bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT), which comprises over 70% of bone marrow volume and ~10% of total fat mass in lean, healthy adults2. BMAT further increases with age and in various pathological and iatrogenic conditions, including osteoporosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), radiotherapy, and glucocorticoid exposure2,3,4. Unlike other adipose depots, BMAT also expands in energy-deficient states such as anorexia nervosa and during controlled caloric restriction2,5,6,7,8. The molecular and functional characteristics of BMAT vary based on its skeletal location, with distinct differences between axial and appendicular bones2. Together, these observations show that BMAT is a normal feature of vertebrate anatomy that is altered in diverse pathophysiological contexts and has site-specific properties. However, compared to the study of white and brown adipose tissues, research on BMAT has been surprisingly limited2. Thus, the physiological and pathological roles of BMAT remain largely unknown. Several methods allow non-invasive measurement of bone marrow adiposity. The gold standards are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with chemical shift-encoding for water–fat separation, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which can each quantify the bone marrow fat fraction (BMFF)9,10. This has been done in numerous small-scale human cohort studies, providing some insights into how BMAT changes in specific pathophysiological contexts. A particular focus has been on ageing and related conditions, especially skeletal and metabolic diseases3,11. For instance, higher bone marrow adiposity at the lumbar spine has been linked to morphometric vertebral fractures and lower bone mineral density (BMD) in both osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic individuals3,11,12. However, these observational studies have never analyzed more than 729 participants13 and typically follow a case–control design for specific diseases, limiting the ability to detect other associations. Critically, whether BMAT directly influences the development and progression of musculoskeletal, metabolic or other diseases remains unknown. To address these limitations, we developed a deep-learning algorithm for large-scale analysis of BMFF in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In what is the world's largest health imaging study, 100,000 UKBB participants are undergoing MRI of the brain, heart and whole body, as well as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to measure BMD14; imaging of all 100,000 participants was completed in July 2025. Our deep-learning method allows accurate and efficient measurement of BMFF within the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis13,15. These four sites cover the axial and appendicular skeleton and include major sites of fracture burden, ensuring that the BMFF measurements allow detection of site-specific and clinically relevant BMAT characteristics. We have since applied our deep-learning models to measure BMFF of the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis in over 44,000 individuals15 and used these data for genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) to identify the genetic variants associated with altered BMFF at each site15. Moreover, we established the associations between BMFF and age, body mass index (BMI), BMD, regional adiposity, and other physiological and anatomical traits15. Intriguingly, these genetic and anatomical associations often differ for BMFF across the four skeletal sites, underscoring the site-specific nature of BMAT formation and function. Herein, we use our site-specific BMFF measurements and polygenic risk scores (PRSs) derived from our GWAS to perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), thereby comprehensively identifying diseases associated with altered BMFF. Finally, we use Mendelian randomization analysis (MR) to establish evidence of causality between altered BMFF and human diseases. Together, these findings represent a groundbreaking advance in our understanding of the clinical relevance of BMAT. The study design is presented in Fig. A Deep learning was used to segment the spine, femoral head, total hip, and femoral diaphysis from MRI scans of participants in the UKBB imaging study, allowing BMFF measurements at each site. Genetic associates of BMFF were identified by genome-wide association meta-analyses (GWAS), from which polygenic risk scores (PRS) were established for BMFF at each site. B, C PheCODES were used to classify disease outcomes for phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). D Mendelian Randomization was done, including the Bayesian MR-HORSE method, to assess causal relationships between BMFF at each site and osteoporosis, fracture, and type 2 diabetes.

A total of 10,750 unique International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) and 3113 ICD-9 codes were summarized from hospital inpatient, cancer registry, and death registry data of the UKBB cohort. In Obs-PheWAS, the exposure was the rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region, as measured by our deep-learning models13,15. The outcomes were PheCODEs for incident disease cases diagnosed at least six months after participants underwent the MRI scan. Obs-PheWAS sample quality control is shown in Supplementary Data 1, while the PheCODEs used for Obs-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 2. Associations were considered statistically significant after applying FDR correction. In the femoral head Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', but with decreased risk of acute renal failure and osteoarthritis (Table 2; Fig. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging. P values were corrected for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) q value threshold of 0.05.

B Venn diagram showing significant disease associations shared between regions or unique to each region. Further details are in Table 2 and Supplementary Data 2−3. In the total hip Obs-PheWAS, eleven PheCODEs, spanning nine disease groups, were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. Among these, higher total hip BMFF was associated with increased risk of musculoskeletal diseases (osteoporosis and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage) but decreased risk of nine other diseases (T2D, essential hypertension, obesity, sepsis, septicemia, acute renal failure, cholelithiasis, chronic airway obstruction, and malignant neoplasm of female breast). It is helpful to note that “chronic airway obstruction” maps to ICD-10 codes J44.8/J44.9, for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hereafter, we refer to ‘chronic airway obstruction' as COPD. The diaphysis Obs-PheWAS identified two PheCODEs, increased risk of osteoporosis and decreased risk of T2D, that were associated with BMFF (Table 2; Fig. In the spine Obs-PheWAS, 40 PheCODEs were associated with higher BMFF. These could be categorized into ten disease groups and included diseases such as osteoporosis, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', spondylosis without myelopathy, spinal stenosis, T2D, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, gout, two benign neoplasms, and several cardiovascular conditions (Table 2; Fig. Unlike for each femoral region, spine BMFF was also associated with numerous diseases affecting the circulatory system, digestive system, and sense organs (Table 2; Fig. Moreover, whereas femoral BMFF was associated with decreased risk of some diseases, spine BMFF was associated with increased risk of all the identified disease groups. Among all of the BMFF-associated PheCODEs identified by Obs-PheWAS, six were shared between two or more bone regions (Fig. Osteoporosis was the one significant PheCODE with consistent direction of effect for all four bone regions, in each case showing a positive association with BMFF (Table 2; Supplementary Data 3). Another musculoskeletal PheCODE, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage', was positively associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, and spine. T2D showed consistent negative associations with BMFF in the femoral head and total hip, but a positive association in the spine. Importantly, both spine BMFF and total hip BMFF remained significantly associated with T2D even after controlling for variation in visceral adipose tissue or overall peripheral adiposity, each of which is an independent risk factor for T2D17,18 (Supplementary Data 4). Thus, these associations between BMFF and T2D are independent of adiposity outside of the bone marrow. The three remaining PheCODEs shared for two bone regions were COPD, acute renal failure, and osteoarthritis. Intriguingly, each of these diseases was associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head, total hip, and/or diaphysis (Table 2; Fig. For each bone region, we also conducted a sensitivity PheWAS analysis that included both incident and prevalent cases. This identified a total of 35, 43, 14, and 142 significant PheCODEs (FDR q < 0.05) associated with BMFF in the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine, respectively (Supplementary Data 5; Supplementary Figs. This analysis identified additional associations with fracture and site-specific associations with osteoarthritis, several cancers, chronic kidney disease, and various circulatory, digestive, genitourinary, and respiratory conditions. Forty-two PheCODEs were identified for two or more bone regions (Supplementary Data 6), and five PheCODEs showed significant associations for all four bone regions (osteoporosis, fracture of radius and ulna, T2D, gout, and essential hypertension) (Supplementary Fig. To investigate if any BMFF-associated diseases are sex-specific, we conducted the main (incident cases) and sensitivity Obs-PheWAS (incident + prevalent cases), stratified by sex, for the four bone regions. In females, four, seven, three, and 11 significant PheCODEs were associated with BMFF in these respective bone regions (Supplementary Data 7). The majority of identified significant diseases were also found in the sex-combined Obs-PheWAS (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7). In the spine, four PheCODEs, including T2D, hypercholesterolemia, other mental disorders, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), were positively associated with BMFF in both male and female groups. ‘Essential hypertension' and ‘iron deficiency anemia' were associated with spine BMFF in males, but not in females or in the sexes combined. All other significant PheCODEs identified for spine BMFF in the sex-sensitivity analysis were also observed in the sex-combined analysis (Table 2; Supplementary Data 7-8). In contrast to spine BMFF, the incident diseases associated with BMFF at each femoral site were sex-specific, with no overlap between males and females (Supplementary Data 7). When prevalent cases were included, there was some male-female overlap among the diseases associated with each femoral site; for these diseases, the directions of the associations with BMFF were the same in each sex (Supplementary Data 9-10). To further explore the clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity, we generated PRSs for BMFF at each bone region and used these as the exposures for PRS-PheWAS across the larger UKBB cohort. We generated two PRSs, PRS1 and PRS2, for each bone region (Table 3). PRS1 included all SNPs that passed quality control (Supplementary Data 11). The same SNPs were used in PRS2, except that any SNPs independently associated with BMD were excluded (Supplementary Data 12). The rationale for this is that BMD-associated SNPs could confound the detection of associations between each BMFF PRS and osteoporosis, which was the disease most consistently associated with BMFF in our Obs-PheWAS. The only exception was for diaphysis, in which PRS1 contained no BMD-associated SNPs; hence, PRS2 was not required for this site. The quality control of genetic IVs (SNPs) and samples used to construct PRSs for each bone region is described in Supplementary Data 11–13, with the SNPs (rsid, chromosome, position, beta, R2, F-statistics) used to generate each PRS described in Supplementary Data 14-15. The linear regression of PRS on BMFF in each bone region, stratified by sex, is presented in Supplementary Fig. Positive associations were observed, with β coefficients (log OR) ranging from 0.189 to 0.381 (P < 2 × 10−16). PRS-PheWAS was performed using PRS1 for each of the four bone regions, and PRS2 for femoral head, total hip, and spine, giving a total of seven separate PheWASes. The PheCODEs used for PRS-PheWAS are summarized in Supplementary Data 16, while the baseline characteristics of each PRS-PheWAS sample for each bone region are summarized in Table 3. PheCODEs significantly associated with PRS1 or PRS2, after FDR correction, are presented in Table 4. In the femoral head PRS-PheWAS, nine PheCODEs in four disease categories were associated with PRS1, including negative associations with two neoplastic diseases and positive associations with osteoporosis, fracture of humerus, and viral pneumonia (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. In the total hip PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs were associated with PRS1. Higher genetically predicted BMFF was associated with lower risk of myeloproliferative disease and ‘other derangement of joint', but with higher risk of three musculoskeletal diseases: osteoporosis, pyogenic arthritis, and ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. In the femoral diaphysis PRS-PheWAS, eight PheCODEs, spanning five disease groups, were associated with PRS1. Positive associations were observed with osteoporosis; multiple myeloma; esophagitis, GERD and related diseases; late effects of cerebrovascular disease; and fracture of the radius and ulna, hand or wrist, and femoral neck. In contrast, diaphysis PRS1 was negatively associated only with spinal stenosis (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. In the spine PRS-PheWAS, five PheCODEs demonstrated positive associations with PRS1, including osteoporosis and four PheCODEs for fractures at different skeletal sites; no PheCODEs were negatively associated with spine PRS1 (Table 4; Supplementary Fig. We found a high degree of overlap in significant PheCODEs identified across the two PRSs (Table 4; Fig. PRS2 was associated with the same PheCODEs, with the same effect directions, as PRS1 for each site in the total hip, diaphysis, and spine; there were no major discrepancies in the association effect sizes, with a median OR difference of ~0.001. The only disparities for PRS1 vs PRS2 occurred for the femoral head, for which PRS1 was positively associated with both fracture of humerus and viral pneumonia, but PRS2 was not. Therefore, the BMD-associated SNPs, which were excluded from PRS2, have minimal influence on the PRS-PheWAS outcomes for each bone region. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components. We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini–Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses. A–D Volcano plots show odds ratios (OR) and −log10(P) values for PheCODE diseases associated with femoral head PRS2 (A), total hip PRS2 (B), diaphysis PRS1 (C), and spine PRS2 (D). For PRS2, each PRS was first calculated based on significant SNPs from meta-GWAS after QC; SNPs independently associated with BMD were then excluded from the instrumental variants selected. PRS2 for diaphysis was not calculated due to the absence of a corresponding BMD GWAS. Labels of disease names are shown for all significant diseases (FDR < 0.05); significant associations with OR < 1 are shown as blue dots; those with OR > 1 are red dots; and non-significant associations are shown as gray dots. Forest plots beneath each volcano plot are included to show the OR (red or blue circles) with 95% CIs. Further details are in Table 4 and Supplementary Data 16, 17. Volcano plots for PRS1-PheWAS are presented in Supplementary Fig. Among all diseases identified by PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, only three were common to two or more bone regions. Higher BMFF-PRS was associated with increased risk of osteoporosis for all four bone regions, with this relationship being stronger for each femoral site than for the spine (Supplementary Data 17). Fracture of radius and ulna was positively associated with each PRS for the diaphysis and spine, whereas ‘other derangement of joint' was inversely associated with each PRS for the femoral head and total hip (Supplementary Data 17). Together, these PRS-PheWAS analyses demonstrate that genetic markers of altered BMFF can be leveraged to further identify BMFF-associated diseases. In the sex-sensitivity PRS-PheWAS, no significant disease outcomes were identified as male-specific after FDR-q correction, and no diseases were associated with spine PRS1 or PRS2 in females (Supplementary Data 18). However, in females, several diseases were associated with PRS1 for the femoral head, total hip and diaphysis, and these overlapped entirely with the diseases associated with PRS2 for each of these sites (Supplementary Data 18). Among these, only osteoporosis was shared for all three femoral bone regions, for which higher BMFF PRS1 and PRS2 were consistently associated with the increased osteoporosis risk (Supplementary Data 19). Consistent positive associations with osteoporosis were found for BMFF in all four bone regions in both Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS. In addition, ‘other disorders of bone and cartilage' were identified with increased disease risk for total hip BMFF (Supplementary Data 20). The corrected C-statistics of PRS1 and PRS2 in each bone region were around 0.771, indicating a moderate-to-good discrimination of individuals with and without osteoporosis. There was no statistical difference in the predictive accuracy between PRS1 and PRS2 (ROC test P > 0.05). We conducted two-sample MR to test if there is evidence of causality between altered BMFF and three of the diseases identified from our PheWAS analyses (Tables 5–7). Instrumental variables (IVs) were selected under two linkage disequilibrium (LD) clumping thresholds (r² < 0.001 or r² < 0.6) to evaluate robustness to variant correlation. Among all the PheCODEs identified from Obs-PheWAS, PRS1-PheWAS and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis was the only disease consistently associated with all four bone regions (Supplementary Data 20). Fracture-related PheCODEs were also prominent among the PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS results, while Obs-PheWAS revealed strong associations, in varying directions, between BMFF and T2D in total hip, diaphysis and spine (Table 2). Each of these diseases (osteoporosis, fractures, and T2D) has been a focus of previous BMAT research2,3,4 and each imposes a substantial burden on public health. Therefore, we focused our MR analyses on these three diseases. In the MR analysis, the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic variants ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions, indicating that genetically predicted BMFF is a robust IV for the MR analysis (Supplementary Data 15, 22, 23 and 24). The causal association of BMFF genetic predisposition with osteoporosis is summarized in Table 5. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), positive associations with osteoporosis were found for total hip BMFF and diaphysis BMFF based on the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method and for diaphysis BMFF based on MR-Horse. Moreover, consistent positive associations were detected for all three femoral sites when the less-stringent LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied (Supplementary Data 25). However, no causal association was found in the spine, regardless of the r2 threshold used. As outlined in the Discussion, the lack of causality for spine BMFF is surprising and could have several explanations, including osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB being driven more by bone loss in the hip than in the spine. The Cochran's Q statistic of MR-Egger and IVW methods indicated heterogeneity (Table 5, Supplementary Data 25). However, MR-Egger intercept in the analysis showed no horizontal pleiotropy for each bone region. The results were also consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. There was no difference in MR-PRESSO outlier correction-adjusted causal estimates. The MR-PRESSO global test indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Distortion coefficients for femoral head, total hip, and diaphysis were non-significant, suggesting more robust estimates after outlier correction. The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with fractures is summarized in Table 6. Each of the MR methods found no significant causal associations for any of the four bone regions when using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r² <0.001). However, when the more lenient LD clumping threshold of r2 < 0.6 was applied, IVW and MR-Horse showed positive associations with fractures for all three femoral sites (Supplementary Data 28). Horizontal pleiotropy was found only in MR for the femoral head (P = 0.015) when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold. The results were consistent after leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. MR-PRESSO analyses (Supplementary Data 27) also supported the positive causal associations with fractures in femoral head and total hip. MR-PRESSO global test found evidence of heterogeneity only for the diaphysis when using the more lenient LD clumping threshold. The causal association of BMFF genetic liability with T2D is summarized in Table 7. When using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), none of the MR methods found significant causal associations in any of the four bone regions. At the less-stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.6), the findings suggested negative associations with T2D in the total hip and diaphysis, whereas MR-Horse observed a positive association between BMFF genetic liability and T2D in the spine (Supplementary Data 30). Evidence of heterogeneity was detected across all regions, but pleiotropy (Egger intercept) was not significant in most cases (only P-diaphysis = 0.022 for MR using r2 < 0.6), supporting the validity of the causal estimates. The results remained consistent in leave-one-out analysis (Supplementary Figs. The MR-PRESSO global test (Supplementary Data 27) indicated evidence of heterogeneity across all regions. Only the diaphysis region found a significant distortion coefficient under all r2 thresholds, indicating potential influence from outliers. Overall, the association of T2D remained consistent in the MR-PRESSO analyses after removal of outliers. Finally, to assess whether BMI adjustment introduced collider bias in the MR, we compared MR results (r2 < 0.001) based on IVs from meta-GWAS with and without BMI adjustment15. We found no distinct discrepancies in the comparisons (Supplementary Data 32–34), with the effect estimates remaining directionally consistent between BMI-adjusted and unadjusted analyses (Osteoporosis: median OR difference = 0.027; Fractures: median OR difference = 0.022; T2D: median OR difference = 0.004). Thus, BMI adjustment does not significantly alter the MR results. Our understanding of the diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity has been based on smaller-scale studies incapable of comprehensively revealing the pathophysiological relevance of BMAT. These have typically used case-control designs addressing specific pathophysiological contexts; have lacked comprehensive healthcare records and genotype data for participants; often focused on only one or two skeletal sites; and have never exceeded more than 729 individuals13. Herein, we have overcome these limitations by using our deep-learning measurements of BMFF at the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 44,000 participants in the UKBB, as well as establishing PRSs for BMFF at each of these sites. Our Obs-PheWAS provides a systematic identification of the clinical conditions associated with altered BMFF at each site, while our PRS-PheWAS demonstrates the utility of genetic markers of altered BMFF for further elucidating clinical associations. These analyses greatly extend the scope of diseases associated with altered bone marrow adiposity. Finally, our MR studies reveal that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the total hip and femoral diaphysis is causally associated with osteoporosis and suggest that spine and femoral BMFF may also be causally associated with fractures and T2D. Together, these findings substantially advance understanding of the impact of BMAT on human health and disease. The entire scope of BMFF-associated diseases is too extensive to discuss here in full; hence, below we consider those of particular interest. This PheCODE includes ICD-9 code 733.00 (Osteoporosis NOS) and ICD-10 codes M81, M81.0, M81.6 and M81.8, which refer to age-related, localized, or “other” osteoporosis, without current pathological fractures. From our incident Obs-PheWAS, PRS1- and PRS2-PheWAS, osteoporosis is the only disease associated with BMFF at all four sites. This extends numerous reports of the inverse relationship between bone marrow adiposity and BMD3, including our recent population-scale findings in the UKBB15. The persistence of this relationship in our PRS2-PheWAS is intriguing because PRS2 excludes BMD-associated SNPs, demonstrating that the relationship between genetically predicted BMFF and osteoporosis is independent of genetic markers of altered BMD. Our PheWAS and MR findings confirm and greatly extend previous observations, as well as strengthen the evidence of causality between increased BMFF and osteoporosis in humans. Intriguingly, the observed causal association exists for BMFF at each femoral site, particularly when using the more lenient LD threshold, but not for spine BMFF. This is consistent with our PheWAS findings, which show weaker BMFF-osteoporosis relationships for the spine than for each femoral site; however, it is surprising given our finding that spine BMFF has a robust inverse association with spine BMD15. This discordance could result from an indirect relationship between BMFF and BMD in the spine: either increased spine BMFF is a consequence, rather than a cause, of lower BMD, or these are independent effects driven simultaneously by other factors. However, another possibility is that osteoporosis diagnoses in UKBB are driven more by decreased BMD in the hip than in the spine. Indeed, BMD T-scores across the UKBB population are lower in the proximal femur than in the spine (see UKBB data fields 23300 vs 23205, respectively), echoing observations in other aged populations19. If low spine BMD plays a lesser role in UKBB osteoporosis cases, this may explain our finding that increased spine BMFF has no causal association with osteoporosis, despite its robust association with decreased spine BMD. Among the femoral sites, the causal association with osteoporosis is strongest for diaphysis BMFF. The biological reasons for this are unclear but may result from site-specific differences in BMAT formation and function2,20,21. For example, bone marrow adipocytes secrete a range of anti-osteogenic and/or pro-resorptive factors2, and this may differ between the diaphysis and the proximal femur. Another theory is that, because BM adipocytes and osteoblasts derive from a common progenitor (the skeletal stem cell), any increase in adipogenesis will necessarily come at the expense of osteogenesis2. Indeed, site-specific differences in human skeletal stem cells have recently been identified22. Thus, another possibility is that the balance between adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis varies across skeletal sites, contributing to site-specific differences in the BMFF-osteoporosis relationship. Notably, relatively few studies measure bone marrow adiposity in the femoral diaphysis, instead focusing on the spine and proximal femur3. These site-specific differences may also help to inform the potential of using bone marrow adiposity to improve clinical management of osteoporosis. Another key finding is that genetically predicted BMFF is associated with fractures, with MR providing evidence for causality when using the more lenient LD threshold. This is important because fractures impose a huge burden on public health23 and, although BMD is a major determinant of fracture risk, most fractures occur in people without osteoporosis24. This highlights the need for improved fracture prediction, which has motivated research into bone marrow adiposity as a fracture risk factor3. Previous studies show that increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with prevalent vertebral fracture in men, independently of BMD25, and with incident bone loss in elderly women26. However, others report that bone marrow adiposity in vertebrae and the proximal femur does not differ between subjects with and without prevalent fracture27,28,29. Moreover, the largest previous study of bone marrow adiposity and incident fracture included 298 men and women but found no association between vertebral bone marrow adiposity and incident fractures in either sex26. This is similar to our main Obs-PheWAS results, in which there are no associations between BMFF and incident fractures, regardless of BMFF site or fracture type. Indeed, among all incident fractures, even the most common subtype (fracture of the radius and ulna) has <200 incident cases (Supplementary Data 35), which is below the threshold for inclusion as a PheWAS outcome. This threshold is exceeded for many fracture subtypes in our sensitivity PheWASes (Supplementary Data 36), which show robust positive associations between fractures and BMFF at each site; for spine and diaphysis, this is replicated in our PRS-PheWAS. The associations with fracture in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS may also be due to reverse causality; hence, in the future, it will be important to conduct even larger studies to increase the power to detect associations between BMFF and incident fractures. Nevertheless, our findings highlight roles for diaphyseal BMFF, which previous studies have overlooked, and show that genetically predicted BMFF is positively associated with fracture, independent of genetic predictors of BMD. As for osteoporosis, our MR results for fracture represent a major advance in knowledge because they demonstrate evidence of causality. Indeed, it is intriguing that spine BMFF may directly affect fractures but not osteoporosis. This underscores the concept that factors influencing bone quality, beyond BMD, contribute to fracture pathogenesis30,31. However, causality was not observed using the more stringent MR LD threshold (r2 < 0.001), highlighting the need for stronger IVs to test causal associations. It will also be important for future studies to establish how increased BMFF at each site impacts bone quality and thereby contributes to fracture risk, and if bone marrow adiposity, and/or its genetic surrogates, can improve fracture prediction beyond traditional risk factors. In addition to musculoskeletal diseases, the relationship between bone marrow adiposity and T2D has attracted increasing attention4. Several previous studies report increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in T2D, including obese subjects32,33, non-obese women34, and older men35. In contrast, a recent larger study found only a trend for increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity36, while earlier research detected no differences between control and T2D subjects27,37,38. However, the largest of these studies included only 199 people36, and most have focused only on bone marrow adiposity in the spine, overlooking appendicular bones. Our present observations, therefore, substantially advance understanding of this relationship through large-scale analyses of multiple skeletal sites. Perhaps our most intriguing finding is that, unlike osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship with T2D is positive for spine BMFF but negative for each femoral site, particularly for the total hip. This divergence between the spine and femur occurs for several other T2D-associated diseases, including obesity and gout39. It is also consistent with recent research from Badr et al., which found that, unlike for vertebrae, proximal femoral bone marrow adiposity is lower in T2D patients vs controls36. One possibility is that these BMFF-T2D associations are confounded by common associations with peripheral adiposity traits. Indeed, T2D is strongly associated with adipose distribution, with excessive visceral adiposity being a major risk factor for this disease17,18. Moreover, we previously demonstrated that spine BMFF is positively associated with total body fat % and visceral adiposity, whereas total hip and diaphysis BMFF are each negatively associated with visceral adiposity and have variable relationships with other adiposity traits15. However, we show that the BMFF-T2D associations for spine and total hip BMFF persist even after controlling for peripheral adiposity. Thus, BMFF at these sites is significantly associated with T2D incidence, independently of adiposity outside of the bone marrow. The strength of the associations with T2D is further demonstrated by our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS, in which T2D is the most-significant association for femoral head, total hip and spine, and the second most-significant for diaphysis BMFF. Even when focusing on incident cases, T2D is among the diseases most strongly associated with spine BMFF, with an OR similar to that for osteoporosis. Our MR results further suggest that genetic predisposition to increased BMFF at the spine, total hip, and diaphysis has direct causal associations with T2D that mirror the site-specific PheWAS relationships. Importantly, these causal associations are significant only when using the more lenient LD threshold, again underscoring the need for future, larger-scale BMFF GWAS to allow stronger IVs to be established. Nevertheless, it is intriguing to speculate how femoral and spinal BMFF might exert divergent effects on the pathogenesis of T2D. One possibility is that femoral BMAT is a site of safer, more metabolically inert lipid storage, analogous to gluteo-femoral adipose tissue, whereas spinal BMAT is akin to more metabolically active visceral adipose tissue, releasing metabolites and endocrine factors that promote insulin resistance18. Clearly, it will be important to establish the differences between spinal and femoral BMAT, both on molecular and functional levels, to better understand the relationships between BMAT and T2D. In addition to osteoporosis and fracture, we reveal further associations between BMFF and other musculoskeletal conditions. One of the most consistent relationships is with ‘Other disorders of bone and cartilage' (PheCODE 733), which is positively associated with BMFF in the spine, femoral head, and total hip. This association is complex to interpret because this PheCODE includes 373 different ICD-10 codes, with diseases as diverse as hypertrophy of bone, osteolysis, skeletal fluorosis, chondromalacia, and physeal arrest. It will be important to determine if the BMFF associations are spread across these conditions or are focused on a subset of diseases within this broad category. Another common musculoskeletal association is osteoarthritis. Compared to osteoporosis and fracture, the relationship between BMAT and osteoarthritis has received relatively little attention40. Our findings are important because they reveal that osteoarthritis is positively associated with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF of the femoral head or total hip. The latter is consistent with one small human study of osteoarthritic patients, which found that proximal femoral BMFF decreases with increasing disease severity41. Thus, alternative mouse models may be needed to study the site-specific BMAT-osteoarthritis relationships that exist in humans. Our PRS-PheWAS also shows that monoarthritis is inversely associated with BMFF in the femoral head, suggesting a robust relationship between femoral head BMFF and different forms of arthritis. Understanding whether BMAT directly impacts arthritis incidence and progression will be an important goal for future research. The earliest studies of bone marrow adipocytes focused on their relationship with hematopoiesis2,43. Therefore, it is notable that our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS identifies associations with several hematological diseases, including anemias and neutropenia. The positive association between these diseases and spine BMFF is consistent with longstanding observations of an inverse relationship between hematopoiesis and BMAT expansion2,43; however, these diseases are also negatively associated with femoral head BMFF. This disparity may result from site-dependent differences in bone marrow adipocyte function, as reported for regenerative hematopoiesis in mouse models2,43. Beyond these diseases, our PheWASes also identify associations with several hematological cancers, as discussed below. Our findings are also relevant to the links between marrow adiposity and cancer. Preclinical studies suggest that bone marrow adiposity influences tumor development and progression, including for hematological cancers and bone metastases of solid tumors2,44,45. In particular, bone marrow adipocytes secrete factors that promote the migration, viability, and/or survival of multiple myeloma cells, leukemic blasts in acute myeloid leukemia, and metastases from breast or prostate tumors2,44,45,46,47. Bone marrow adipocytes also promote a quiescent state in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, helping them to evade chemotherapy48. For some of these cancers, altered bone marrow adiposity has been reported in smaller-scale clinical studies2,44,45,49,50; however, our study is notable because it identifies associations across such a large population, and for BMFF at multiple sites. These results are consistent with the above preclinical findings and with one report of increased vertebral bone marrow adiposity in breast cancer patients49. The positive association between chemotherapy and spine BMFF, and between ‘effects of radiation' and both spine and total hip BMFF, echoes longstanding reports of increased bone marrow adiposity following cancer treatment2. Thus, the positive BMFF-cancer associations observed in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS could represent confounding effects of cancer therapy and/or reverse causality, with these diseases directly increasing bone marrow adiposity. In contrast to the above cancers, we also reveal a negative association between total hip BMFF and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. This extends our previous observation of extremely low femoral BMFF in some people with this disease13. Notably, unlike for the spine, total hip BMFF is negatively associated with malignant breast cancer; hence, it is important to take account of skeletal site when considering BMA-cancer relationships. In addition to these Obs-PheWAS results, our PRS-PheWAS identifies a positive association between diaphysis BMFF and multiple myeloma. This contrasts with one small study that found a trend for lower axial bone marrow adiposity in multiple myeloma patients50 but extends observations from mouse models that show increased tibial bone marrow adiposity in early-stage myeloma47. Thus, the BMFF-myeloma relationship may vary across skeletal sites. This is important because changes in bone marrow adiposity may identify patients at risk of multiple myeloma progression51. In contrast, we find no associations with leukemias, despite reports of decreased bone marrow adiposity in chronic lymphoid, acute lymphoid, and chronic myeloid leukemia2,44,48; multiple myeloma is also absent from our Obs-PheWAS results. This may reflect insufficient statistical power caused by the low incidence and prevalence of these conditions among the UKBB population52. Despite this limitation, we extend the number of neoplastic conditions that are associated with bone marrow adiposity. Therefore, our findings should inform future efforts to determine if bone marrow adiposity directly influences cancer incidence and/or progression. Unlike the above disease classes, few studies report associations between bone marrow adiposity and cardiovascular or respiratory diseases. By identifying such associations, our PheWAS results greatly extend the clinical relevance of bone marrow adiposity. Among these diseases, COPD is notable because its positive association with spine BMFF is stronger than for any other incident disease. In contrast, incident COPD is inversely associated with total hip BMFF. This disparity between spine and femoral BMFF is similar to their relationships with several other diseases, including T2D. Given that T2D itself is associated with COPD53, we speculate that spine and femoral BMFF may have opposing relationships with COPD because of their divergent causal association with T2D. Several other cardiometabolic diseases are also associated positively with spine BMFF but negatively with femoral BMFF, particularly when prevalent cases are considered. Here, essential hypertension is especially striking because it is strongly associated with BMFF at all four sites. This relationship may involve the interplay between BMAT and hematopoiesis, combined with the positive causal effect of lymphocyte count on blood pressure54; if so, BMFF may be associated with hypertension via effects on lymphopoiesis. Finally, the positive relationship between spine BMFF and incidence of several other cardiovascular conditions suggests a more widespread impact of vertebral BMAT on cardiometabolic dysfunction. Another notable finding is that there are site and sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. As discussed above, the BMFF-disease relationships frequently differ depending on skeletal site, with many diseases associating positively with spine BMFF but negatively with BMFF at one or more femoral sites. While this is perhaps most notable for T2D, our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS reveals similar divergent site-specific associations for many other conditions across multiple disease classes. Many of these are interrelated disease clusters, including cardiometabolic diseases and other age-associated chronic diseases. Thus, BMFF distribution may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of these complex multi-morbidities. These findings highlight the critical importance of analyzing BMFF at multiple anatomical locations and underscore the concept that the pathophysiological functions of BMAT are skeletal site dependent2,20,21. Indeed, BMAT has been proposed to exist in two broad subtypes, regulated BMAT (rBMAT) and constitutive BMAT (cBMAT), which differ in anatomical location and in their molecular and functional characteristics2,20,21. Thus, cBMAT forms earlier in development, contains densely packed adipocytes, predominates at distal skeletal sites, and is less changeable in response to environmental and pathophysiological variables. In contrast, rBMAT forms later in development, features adipocytes interspersed with hematopoietic red marrow, predominates in the axial skeleton and more-proximal regions of the limbs, and more readily increases or decreases in response to varying environmental stimuli and pathophysiological states. These characteristics are broadly consistent with our observations, with spine BMFF corresponding to rBMAT and femoral BMFF being more cBMAT-like. However, some disease associations are even stronger for femoral BMFF than for spine BMFF, suggesting that cBMAT is not always more inert than rBMAT. The three femoral sites also differ from one another, suggesting that this binary cBMAT/rBMAT classification is an oversimplification. It will be important for future studies to further dissect these site-specific differences on molecular and functional levels. Disease risk factors, incidence and outcomes also differ between males and females55, including for the relationships between body composition and cardiometabolic health56,57. Our present findings extend understanding of these phenomena by identifying the extent of sex differences in BMFF-associated diseases. Many associations occur in both sexes, especially for spine BMFF; in such cases, the direction of the BMFF-disease association is the same in each sex. Sometimes this is because the disease itself is sex-specific, such as those affecting reproductive organs; this is particularly common when prevalent cases are included. However, most of the sexually dimorphic associations among incident cases occur for diseases that can affect males and females. For example, acute renal failure is identified only in males, while the positive association between BMFF and incident osteoporosis occurs for all four sites in females but none in males, even when prevalent cases are included. The latter is reminiscent of previous observations that vertebral bone marrow adiposity is associated with incident bone loss in elderly women, but not in elderly men26. Together, our findings highlight sex differences in the clinical impact of bone marrow adiposity. We acknowledge that our study has several limitations. First, the UKBB MRI data allow fat fraction mapping but do not include spectroscopy, and therefore cannot be used to measure lipid saturation and unsaturation3. This is notable because vertebral bone marrow lipid saturation is positively associated with risk of incident fracture in older adults58 and with prevalent fracture in T2D27. The latter, small-scale study found no relationship between fracture and overall bone marrow adiposity, suggesting that bone marrow lipid saturation is an even stronger driver of fracture risk. Bone marrow lipid saturation is also higher in T2D4; however, whether this has a direct causal effect on diabetes is unknown. Secondly, while vertebral fractures are estimated to affect up to 25-50% of people over the age of 50, many are asymptomatic, with only 30-40% coming to medical attention59,60. This likely explains why the positive association between BMFF and vertebral fracture is detected only in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS: while reverse causality may play a role, the number of fracture cases in the incident Obs-PheWAS is too few to detect these associations (Supplementary Data 35). Under-reporting of vertebral fractures may also account for our MR results, which show that the causal association of BMFF with fracture is weaker for the spine than for each femoral site. The challenge of insufficient incident cases also applies to other diseases. The UKBB population is relatively healthy52, which can limit the ability to detect associations and causal effects of BMFF on many health outcomes. As for vertebral fracture, having insufficient cases may explain why many associations, such as multiple myeloma, are detected in our sensitivity Obs-PheWAS and/or PRS-PheWAS, but not the incident Obs-PheWAS. It may also explain some differences in our sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS. For example, BMFF is associated with osteoporosis in females but not in males; this may result from genuine sex differences in disease pathogenesis but could also reflect males' lower incidence of osteoporosis23, which would limit the power to detect this association. However, it is important to acknowledge that reverse causality may contribute to the additional associations identified when prevalent cases are included. We will overcome the challenge of insufficient cases by measuring BMFF in the remaining ~50,000 UKBB imaging participants and by applying our BMFF PRSs to other large-scale genomic cohorts, including meta-analyses of multiple datasets, to further explore the clinical impact of BMAT. Thirdly, medication use may influence some of the observed BMFF-disease associations. For example, glucocorticoids are used to manage COPD, and they also increase BMFF2. However, UKBB participant medication history is mostly from self-reported data, with primary care records being available for only a subset of participants; thus, it is not possible to systematically control for use of medications that may influence the observed associations between BMFF and disease outcomes. Fourthly, we defined PheCODES based on national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) in UKBB, which did not include diagnoses from primary care. This may result in incomplete case ascertainment for conditions predominantly diagnosed and managed in the primary care setting. Fifthly, we generated PRSs using PRS-CT (clumping + p value thresholding: to generate weighted PRS based on SNP associated with BMFF) because it is more interpretable for causal inference. However, the inclusion of correlated SNPs reduces this advantage. The PRS-CS method, which utilizes a Bayesian regression framework by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes61, would be valuable for future work characterizing the full polygenic architecture of BMFF. There are also some limitations to our MR analysis. MR relies on genetic instruments (SNPs) associated with BMFF, but the proportion of variance (R2) explained by the genetic instruments ranged from 0.06% to 0.41% and the F-statistic ranged from 29.82 to 179.79 across the four bone regions. This limited variance suggests potential weak instrument bias, which could lead to underpowered or biased causal estimates; this is particularly true using the more stringent LD clumping threshold (r2 < 0.001), which found causal associations for total hip or diaphysis BMFF and osteoporosis, but not for any other BMFF-disease associations. However, horizontal pleiotropy, where genetic variants influence the outcome through pathways other than BMFF, cannot be entirely ruled out. Our study used MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO to test for pleiotropy. MR-Egger and MR-PRESSO tests suggested minimal pleiotropy, while the presence of heterogeneity across different bone regions suggested some genetic variants may have pleiotropic effects, potentially biasing the causal estimates. However, a major strength of our MR analysis is that we also used MR-Horse, which is protected from bias due to pleiotropy62. Relating to this, a potential limitation of our conservative exclusion of BMD- and T2D-associated variants is that, while this approach reduces the risk of horizontal pleiotropy, it may also lead to a reduction in IVs strength. However, excluding these variants in our MR analyses had minimal impact on overall IVs strength (Supplementary Data 37). Moreover, Steiger filtering63 confirmed correct causal directions for all variants, including those associated with both exposure and outcome (Supplementary Data 38-41). In addition, although the sample overlap between exposure and outcome GWAS was minimal ( < 5%), residual bias cannot be entirely ruled out. We seek to validate our MR findings in the independent dataset once these data are available. A final limitation is that the MR analysis was conducted in a predominantly white European population from the UK Biobank, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other ethnic groups. Finally, the UKBB imaging study has plans to include repeat imaging of 60,000 participants, but does not yet have longitudinal MRI data. Such data would be necessary to determine whether changes in BMFF precede disease onset or are a consequence of disease progression. This will provide critical insights into the temporal dynamics of BMFF alterations and their role in disease incidence and progression. Despite these limitations, our study is a breakthrough in understanding the fundamental biology and clinical implications of bone marrow adiposity. Our large-scale MR-PheWAS identifies the overall and sex-specific disease outcomes associated with BMFF and its genetic liability at multiple skeletal sites. To explore the short-term effects of BMFF, we conducted Obs-PheWAS, analyzing 1808 disease outcomes using deep-learning-quantified BMFF measurements obtained at the time of MRI scanning. Complementing this, PRS-PheWAS establishes the long-term effects by evaluating the cumulative genetic risk for elevated BMFF levels. Our Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS not only enhance statistical power and reduce bias but also validate the findings and strengthen causal inference. The unexpected breadth of BMFF-associated diseases highlights the potential of BMFF as a biomarker for the improved prediction, prevention and treatment of diverse diseases. This includes leveraging our BMFF PRSs as genetic biomarkers, which could benefit clinical practice by eliminating the need for expensive and time-consuming MRI analyses. Our results provide evidence of causality for altered bone marrow adiposity on osteoporosis, fracture, and T2D, which suggests that modulating bone marrow adiposity could be a viable therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Together, our study reveals extensive insights into BMAT function that have the potential to benefit human health. UKBB has ethics approval from the National Health Service North-West Center Research Ethics Committee (Ref11:/NW/0382). All participants provided informed consent. Data for this work were obtained under an approved UKBB project application (ID 48697). UKBB is a large population-based prospective cohort study of 502,352 participants aged 40–60 years recruited between 2006 and 201064. In this study, we used participant data from the ongoing UKBB multi-modal imaging study, initiated in 2014, which comprises brain, cardiac, and abdominal MRI, carotid ultrasound scan, and whole-body DXA14. We developed and validated a light-weight attention-based U-Net model for simultaneous detection and segmentation of tiny structures in large 3D MRI imaging data, to generate volumes of interest (VOIs) corresponding to bone marrow regions, including femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and the thoracic and lumbar spine (Python code [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13959673]. The segmented VOIs were then applied to the fat fraction (FF) maps. The deep-learning BMFF measurements of the four bone regions were conducted in two batches based on the availability of MRI data released by UKBB (N = 50,226). Method details for deep-learning training, development and validation are described in our previous publication13. We conducted meta-GWAS analyses (combining the two batches of BMFF measurements) in the population of unrelated white UKBB participants to identify genetic variants associated with the BMFF of each bone region (method details are described in our previous publication15). We generated BMFF polygenic risk scores (PRS) for each bone region using formula 1: where N is the number of SNPs in the score, βi is the effect size (beta coefficient) of variant i and dosageij is the number of copies of SNP i in the genotype of individual j. We followed the pipeline in UKBB developed by Collister et al.65 and used PLINK 2.066. Each SNP effect estimate derived from our BMFF meta-GWAS is referred to as the ‘βi'. To be specific, the PRS for each bone region was constructed by adding up the number of BMFF-increasing alleles for each SNP, weighted for the SNP effect size on BMFF level (beta coefficients from meta-GWAS). The quality control of the SNPs and samples used to generate PRS for each bone region is summarized in Supplementary Data 11-13. In SNP quality control, we retained significant SNPs (linkage disequilibrium LD r2 < 0.6, P value < 5 × 10−8) found in meta-GWAS, with missingness <0.05, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium test P value > 10–12, non-multiallelic, imputation quality (INFO) > 0.4, and minor allele frequency > 0.005. We further excluded ambiguous AT/CG variants, and insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels). In addition, we conducted a sensitivity PRS analysis, which further excluded SNPs associated with BMD from the instrumental variants selected. LD proxies (r2 > 0.6) for significant SNPs passing quality control were generated using the LDproxy function in the LDlinkR package (https://github.com/CBIIT/LDlinkR (version 1.4.0) with 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 as LD reference panel). We searched the GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD of each bone region (BMD GWAS details are presented in Supplementary Data 42). A GWAS for diaphysis BMD was not found. The BMD GWASes for the remaining three bone regions (femoral head, total hip, spine) reported distinct significant SNPs associations (Supplementary Data 43). We cross-compared BMFF LD proxies and BMD SNPs and excluded any overlapping SNPs from the list of instrumental variants to construct the PRS. In the PRS sensitivity analysis, the PRS were calculated based on 46 SNPs for femoral head, 114 for total hip, and 117 for spine (Supplementary Data 15). The PRS for diaphysis was not updated due to the absence of a corresponding GWAS or overlaps of instrumental variants in the remaining three bone regions. The variance explained by genetic instrumental variants (R2) for each PRS was estimated following formula 2: Here, EAF represents the effect allele frequency and β denotes the SNP beta coefficient67. In sample quality control, we sub-grouped participants based on their ancestry as ‘White' using the UKBB data-field 22006 (“Genetic ethnic grouping”) and excluded UKBB withdrawals, individuals who were outliers for heterozygosity or missing rates, individuals with a missing rate >0.02 on autosomes, individuals with sex discordance (between the phenotypic and genetically inferred sex), individuals who were not in a maximal set of unrelated individuals up to 3rd degree, and participants included in our meta-GWAS. In summary, we generated two PRSs for each bone region as presented in Supplementary Data 14-15. We performed a PheWAS to identify disease outcomes associated with BMFF in four bone regions. Disease outcomes were defined based on the PheCODE schema (with 10,750 unique ICD-10 codes and 3113 ICD-9 codes) using national medical records (inpatient hospital episode records, cancer registry, and death registry) until 31 March 2023. The PheCODE schema combines correlated ICD codes into a distinct code based on the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10) and excludes patients with related diseases from the corresponding control groups68. Herein, we defined cases based on the presence of at least one ICD code mapping to each PheCODE, consistent with our previous publications69,70,71,72,73. We translated the ICD codes into PheCODE groups, which included 1808 PheCODEs classified into 17 disease categories70,74,75,76. Further details of the PheCODE schema and application are provided in the Supplementary Information (Supplementary Note 1). In Obs-PheWAS, BMFF was measured by our deep-learning models and is presented as rank-transformed (normalized) BMFF for each bone region. The quality control of Obs-PheWAS sample is presented in Supplementary Data 1. We used deep-learning BMFF measurements as the exposure and included only incident cases (defined as disease diagnosed after at least six months of undergoing UKBB MRI imaging) in the PheWAS analysis. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between rank-transformed BMFF and each PheCODE, with adjustment for age at imaging, sex, and BMI at imaging. We performed the analysis only for those PheCODEs with >200 incident cases, the threshold suggested by the power estimates for PheWAS analysis77. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis to include both incident and prevalent cases. We corrected the P values for multiple testing using the false discovery rate (FDR) q value threshold of 0.0578. In PRS-PheWAS, BMFF PRS were generated for each bone region. We used genetically proxied BMFF level as the exposure and included PheCODEs with >200 incident and prevalent cases. We used multivariable logistic regression models to test the associations between BMFF PRS and each PheCODE, adjusting for age, sex, assessment center, and the first 10 genetic principal components (PC). We applied the FDR correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant) following the method by Benjamini-Hochberg to account for multiple testing in each of the phenotype-wide analyses78. To investigate sex-specific associations in each bone region, we performed sex-stratified Obs-PheWAS and PRS-PheWAS analyses. We conducted two-sample MR analyses to investigate the potential causal associations between BMFF (exposure) and the risk of osteoporosis, fractures and T2D (outcomes). We followed the STROBE-MR (strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology using Mendelian randomization) guidelines (Please see Supplementary Note 2 in the Supplementary Information file). To meet the assumptions, we obtained IVs by filtering for BMFF meta-GWAS genome-wide significant SNPs (P < 5 × 10−8), followed by linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based clumping using the ‘TwoSampleMR' R package with the following parameters: clump_kb = 10, 000, clump_r2 for two thresholds (r2 = 0.001 or r2 = 0.6), pop = ”EUR”, and excluded those SNPs associated with BMD or T2D to ensure that any observed association between IVs and outcomes is mediated through the exposure (BMFF), maintaining the validity of causal inference. The F-statistic was calculated using formula 3: The F-statistic was estimated to assess whether there was a possibility of weak instrument bias. The genetic instruments for each outcome were derived from summary statistics of the most recent publicly available GWASes of European ancestry with the largest sample size, obtained from the MRC IEU GWAS database (https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/). BOLT-LMM coefficients, if reported in the outcome GWASes, were transformed to log-odds scale. SNP effect data for the exposure and outcome were harmonized to ensure consistency in effect direction and allele matching. Harmonization (‘harmonise_dat' function in ‘TwoSampleMR' package) involved aligning the effect alleles across exposure and outcome datasets, correcting for strand mismatches, and excluding palindromic SNPs with ambiguous allele frequencies. In MR analyses, six methods were employed to examine the causal association between exposure and outcome, including IVW, MR-Horse62, MR-Egger, weighted mode, weighted median, and simple model, among which IVW and MR-Horse were the primary methods83. MR-Horse is a Bayesian model with horseshoe shrinkage that can account for valid instruments, uncorrelated and correlated pleiotropy62. Horizontal pleiotropy tests were performed based on (i) MR-Egger regression (intercept close to 0, P value > 0.05: no evidence for horizontal pleiotropy), and (ii) MR-PRESSO (detected and corrected for horizontal pleiotropy by identifying outlier variants)84. The heterogeneity test was estimated based on Cochran's Q statistic. MR results were visualized using scatter plots (to display the consistency of causal estimates across different MR methods, and the overall direction of causality), forest plots (to present the causal effect estimates of individual SNPs), funnel plots (to detect asymmetry, which could indicate horizontal pleiotropy or publication bias), and leave-one-out plots (to test IV outliers on the causal estimates). In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses using IVs derived from the BMI-unadjusted BMFF meta-GWAS (LD clumping threshold: r²<0.001) to assess potential collider bias in our primary MR results. MR applied the FDR-Q correction (q value < 0.05 as statistically significant). The analysis was performed using the ‘TwoSampleMR', ‘MR-PRESSO', and ‘R2jags' packages [https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR] (R version 4.4.1). Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. All data for BMFF and BM segmentation volumes have been uploaded to the UKBB (upload ID 5858), where they will be available under UKBB Category 105 to any individuals with an approved UKBB project. Researchers can apply for UKBB access via the UKBB Access Management System (https://ams.ukbiobank.ac.uk/ams/). PheCODEs were generated using data from the Phemap v1.2 (https://phewascatalog.org/phecodes_icd10). PRSs were constructed using data from our previous BMFF meta-GWAS15 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-55422-4). To exclude any SNPs independently associated with BMD or type 2 diabetes, we searched GWAS catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) to identify the most recently published GWAS with the largest sample size for BMD or type 2 diabetes; these studies are described in the manuscript.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Engineers in Australia have developed a new building material with about one quarter of concrete's carbon footprint, while reducing waste going to landfill. In Australia alone, more than 2.2 million tons of cardboard and paper are sent to landfill each year. Meanwhile, cement and concrete production account for about 8% of annual global emissions. "Modern rammed earth construction compacts soil with added cement for strength. Cement use is excessive given the natural thickness of rammed earth walls," he said. "By simply using cardboard, soil and water, we can make walls robust enough to support low-rise buildings," Ma said. "This innovation could revolutionize building design and construction, using locally sourced materials that are easier to recycle. "It also reflects the global revival of earth-based construction fueled by net zero goals and interest in local sustainable materials." Study corresponding author and leading expert in the field of structural optimization, Emeritus Professor Yi Min 'Mike' Xie, said this advancement can spearhead a leaner, greener approach to construction. "Instead of hauling in tonnes of bricks, steel and concrete, builders would only need to bring lightweight cardboard, as nearly all material can be obtained on site," Xie said. "This would significantly cut transport costs, simplify logistics and reduce upfront material demands." Ma said cardboard-confined rammed earth could be an effective solution for construction in remote areas, such as regional Australia, where red soils - ideal for rammed earth construction - are plentiful. "Rammed earth buildings are ideal in hot climates because their high thermal mass naturally regulates indoor temperatures and humidity, reducing the need for mechanical cooling and cutting carbon emissions," he said.

AI-designed bacteriophages were capable of infecting and killing host bacteria. Researchers used the model's suggested sequences to select 302 viable phages. An influential panel of US vaccine advisers that became controversial after it was abruptly reconstituted by US health secretary and long-time anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr has come together, with vague results. The group indefinitely delayed its guidance on hepatitis B vaccination for newborn babies. Harvard University scored a victory in court two weeks ago, when a US judge ruled that its research grants should be reinstated and its funding unfrozen. On Friday, in a joint status update before a judge, both Harvard and the US government asked for more time to “work through implementation issues” of complying fully with the court order. The new approach uses an array of rubidium atoms inside a high-vacuum vessel, with a gas of more rubidium atoms suspended just below it. At each step, a fresh array is created at the bottom, then brought up to interact with an existing array, which might have lost some atoms while performing quantum computation. The old array is then moved up and discarded.Credit: Neng-Chun Chiu et al/Nature In The Great Holocene Transformation, complexity scientist Peter Turchin sets out to explain how, over the past 10,000 years, small collectives of farmers and foragers grew into powerhouse societies. His answer, “depressingly and paradoxically, is war”, says science writer Laura Spinney in her review. Turchin has addressed the same question in a previous book, she writes, but “this time, he shows his workings, and he has more data and better tools”. Ironically, this data-driven approach is likely to further repel some of the conventional historians that Turchin has previously failed to win over, Spinney says. It is early days, but researchers have used these tools to trace the growth of mouse embryos and capture gene activity in animal brains. Scientists are also exploring how to harness these tools for real-time disease monitoring — by engineering cells that patrol the body and log signs of trouble in molecular memory. Johannes Huber is a wood scientist and engineer at Luleå University of Technology in Skellefteå, Sweden.Credit: Elin Berge for Nature “Wood has character; no two logs are alike,” he says. Using industrial CT scanners, Huber can create detailed models of the wood's internal structure. • Nature Briefing: Careers — insights, advice and award-winning journalism to help you optimize your working life • Nature Briefing: Translational Research — covers biotechnology, drug discovery and pharma Daily briefing: Device senses silent speech without an invasive brain implant Daily briefing: The most- and least-improved countries for chronic disease You have full access to this article via your institution.
