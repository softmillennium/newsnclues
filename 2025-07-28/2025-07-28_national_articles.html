                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States and the European Union announced a trade framework Sunday after a meeting between President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. US President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met in Turnberry, Scotland, on Sunday to discuss trade with Trump saying a trade deal between the two was “was 50-50" President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shake hands after reaching a trade deal at the Trump Turnberry golf course in Turnberry, Scotland Sunday, July 27, 2025.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. The tariffs, or import taxes, paid when Americans buy European products could raise prices for U.S. consumers and dent profits for European companies and their partners who bring goods into the country. Here are some things to know about the deal: Bottles of spirits are labeled with a star in Bilka in Randers, Denmark, making it easier for customers to buy European goods, Monday, March 17, 2025. Trump and von der Leyen's announcement, made during Trump's visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, leaves many crucial details to be filled in. The headline figure is a 15% tariff rate on about 70% of European goods brought into the U.S., including cars, computer chips and pharmaceuticals. The remaining 30% is still open to further decisions and negotiations. Von der Leyen said that the two sides agreed on zero tariffs on both sides for a range of “strategic” goods: Aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products and some natural resources and critical raw materials. Additionally, companies in the European Union would purchase what Trump said was $750 billion (638 billion euros) worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel over three years to replace Russian energy supplies that Europe is seeking to exit in any case. Meanwhile, European companies would invest an additional $600 billion (511 billion euros) in the U.S. under a political commitment that isn't legally binding, officials said. Brussels and Washington will shortly issue a joint statement that frames the deal but isn't yet legally binding, according to senior officials who weren't authorized to be publicly named according to European Commission policy. The joint statement will have “some very precise commitments and others which will need to be spelled out in different ways,” a senior European Commission official said. EU officials said that the zero tariff list could include nuts, pet food, dairy products and seafood. Trump said that the 50% U.S. tariff on imported steel would remain. Von der Leyen said that the two sides agreed to further negotiations to fight a global steel glut, reduce tariffs and establish import quotas — that is, set amounts that can be imported, often at a lower rate or tariff-free. Von der Leyen said that the pharmaceuticals issue was “on a separate sheet of paper” from Sunday's deal. And von der Leyen said that when it came to farm products, the EU side made clear that “there were tariffs that could not be lowered,” without specifying which products. A handles molten metal at the Thyssenkrupp steel factory in Duisburg, Germany, April 27, 2018. The 15% rate removes Trump's threat of a 30% tariff. But it effectively raises the tariff on EU goods from 1.2% last year to 17% and would reduce the 27-nation bloc's gross domestic product by 0.5%, said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics. Higher tariffs, or import taxes, on European goods mean sellers in the U.S. would have to either increase prices for consumers — risking loss of market share — or swallow the added cost in terms of lower profits. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal which avoided “an unnecessary escalation in trans-Atlantic trade relations” and said that “we were able to preserve our core interests,” while adding that “I would have very much wished for further relief in trans-Atlantic trade.” Senior French officials on Monday criticized the accord. “This is an unequal and unbalanced agreement,” he said. While the rate is lower than threatened, “the big caveat to today's deal is that there is nothing on paper, yet,” said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank. “With this disclaimer in mind and at face value, the agreement would clearly bring an end to the uncertainty of recent months. Asked if European carmakers could still profitably sell cars at 15%, von der Leyen said the rate was much lower than the current 27.5%. That has been the rate under Trump's 25% tariff on cars from all countries, plus the preexisting U.S. car tariff of 2.5%. Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($232.5 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more from European businesses than the other way around, and has said that the European market isn't open enough for U.S.-made cars. However, American companies fill some of the trade gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings and legal and financial services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen met in Turnberry, Scotland, on Sunday to discuss trade with Trump saying a trade deal between the two was “was 50-50" U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. President Donald Trump reads from a paper and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen listens after reaching a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU at the Trump Turnberry golf course in Turnberry, Scotland Sunday, July 27, 2025. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba speaks to the media as President Donald Trump announced a trade framework with Japan, at the prime minister's office in Tokyo, Japan, Wednesday, July 23, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is getting his way with the world economy. On Sunday, the United States and the 27-member state European Union announced that they had reached a trade framework agreement: The EU agreed to accept 15% U.S. tariffs on most its goods, easing fears of a catastrophic trans-Atlantic trade war. There were also commitments by the EU to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy products and make $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to the White House. “We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,” Trump said Monday. But there's no guarantee that Trump's radical overhaul of U.S. trade policy will deliver the happy ending he's promised. Financial markets, at first panicked by the president's protectionist agenda, seem to have acquiesced to a world in which U.S. import taxes — tariffs — are at the highest rates they've been in roughly 90 years. Several billion in new revenues from his levies on foreign goods are pouring into the U.S. Treasury and could somewhat offset the massive tax cuts he signed into law on July 4. Outside economists say that high tariffs are still likely to raise prices for American consumers, dampen the Federal Reserve's ability to lower interest rates and make the U.S. economy less efficient over time. “It's pretty striking that it's seen as a sigh of relief moment,” said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut.” More one-sided trade deals are likely as countries try to beat a Friday deadline after which Trump will impose even higher tariffs on countries that refuse to make concessions. The U.S. president has long claimed that America erred by not taking advantage of its clout as the world's biggest economy and erecting a wall of tariffs, in effect making other countries ante up for access to America's massive consumer market. To his closest aides, Trump's use of tariffs has validated their trust in his skills as a negotiator and their belief that the economists who warned of downturns and inflation were wrong. “Where are the ‘experts' now?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X. “The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the U.S. favorable trade terms while accepting U.S. tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist. In May, a federal court struck down those tariffs. And he's yet to reach an accord with China — which has deftly used the threat of retaliatory tariffs and withholding exports of rare earth minerals that are desperately needed for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines to avoid caving in to Trump's demands. The U.S. and China are talking this week in Stockholm, Sweden. There is also skepticism that tariffs will produce the economic boom claimed by Trump. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said “the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,” but not a recession. While autos made in the EU and Japan will no longer face the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed, they will still face a 15% tax that has yet to appear in prices at U.S. dealerships. “Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,” Morgan Stanley said in a separate note. “Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.” Economist Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of a “slow-burn efficiency loss'' as U.S. companies scramble to adjust to Trump's new world. For decades, American companies have mostly paid the same tariffs – and often none at all – on imported machinery and raw materials from all over the world. Now, as a result of Trump's trade deals, tariffs vary by country. firms have to change their designs and get inputs from different places based on these variable tariff rates,'' she said. There's all these things that are acting as longer-term drags on economy, but their effect will show up only slowly.'' “I wouldn't take a victory lap,'' Zandi said.</p>

CIA Director John Ratcliffe is expected to declassify the underlying intelligence, including a classified annex, related to former Special Counsel John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe. CIA Director John Ratcliffe, joined at center by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, testifies as the Senate Intelligence Committee holds its worldwide threats hearing, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, March 25. In 2020, Fox News Digital exclusively reported that former CIA Director John Brennan, in the summer of 2016, briefed former President Barack Obama and administration officials on intelligence that then-Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Clinton was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence, declassified Brennan's handwritten notes memorializing that meeting, which were exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020. On July 28, 2016, Brennan briefed Obama on a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors "to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service." Comey, then-Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, were at the Brennan-Obama briefing. After that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: "Crossfire Hurricane." Fox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: "The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate."

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) "An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server." The FBI on July 31, 2016, opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane." The source told Fox News Digital on Monday that the declassification and release of the classified annex is being done with close coordination between Ratcliffe, FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and acting National Security Agency Director William Hartman— along with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who will ultimately release the document to the public. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, center, is flanked by FBI Director Kash Patel, left, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, as the Senate Intelligence Committee holds its worldwide threats hearing, on Capitol Hill in Washington, on Tuesday, March 25. All three answered questions about the Signal text chain leak. A source familiar told Fox News Digital that the CIA and NSA have signed off on declassifying their sensitive intelligence that serves as the basis for the classified annex's findings. A former senior Trump official told Fox News Digital that Ratcliffe advocated for releasing the intelligence publicly then, but that Durham, who, at the time, was expected to release an interim report prior to the 2020 election, declined on the basis that it could negatively impact his investigation, which had not yet reached a determination on potential prosecutions. "Durham said he wanted to preserve his investigation but was going to release an interim report," the former official told Fox News Digital. Special Counsel John Durham indicated the Department of Justice and FBI "failed to uphold their mission of strict fidelity to the law" when it launched the Trump-Russia investigation. Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the FBI's original "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation. After nearly two years, Mueller's investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election. Shortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe. Robert Mueller, former special counsel for the U.S. Department of Justice. Ratcliffe said it would be an overview of Durham's findings. "What the intelligence shows..is that part of this was a Hillary Clinton plan, but part of it was an FBI plan to be an accelerant to the fake Steele dossier, to those fake Russia collusion claims by pouring oil on the fire, by amplifying the lie and burying the truth of what Hillary Clinton was up to," Ratcliffe said. The expected release of the declassified annex comes after Ratcliffe and Gabbard released declassified records revealing that Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to push the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. FBI Director Kash Patel has opened criminal investigations into Brennan and Comey, and Gabbard sent criminal referrals to additional Obama-era officials.

Nancy Mace of South Carolina tells Fox News Digital that if she launches a Republican campaign for governor, ‘we're starting out front, in the lead' Republican Rep. Nancy Mace is moving closer to launching a campaign for governor in her home state of South Carolina. "I will be making a decision in the coming days," Mace said this past weekend in a Fox News Digital interview. And Mace gave a similar response in a Fox News Channel interview Sunday, telling host Jon Scott that "I will be making a decision over the next couple of days about my future." Mace, a three-term congresswoman who represents a coastal district in the state's Lowcountry, gave what appeared to be a big hint of her next political steps as she delivered a speech Friday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics. Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina delivers an address at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics on July 25, 2025, in Manchester, New Hampshire. Delivering an address at the Politics and Eggs speaking series, which for a quarter-century has been a must-stop for White House hopefuls, Mace told the crowd that "not only do you pick presidents, maybe you can pick the next South Carolina governor too while were here today, because we're going to be announcing a run very shortly potentially for that as well." Mace told Fox News Digital that there were a number of reasons why she would bid for South Carolina governor. "We have the highest state income tax in the southeast, making us not competitive with other neighboring states, and a growing, booming economy under Donald Trump," Mace said. My state has been run over by illegals and our leaders have turned a blind eye. We've got this gender bending ideology in colleges and universities across South Carolina, and we've got to end it," she argued. Mace would be entering a crowded GOP primary field in the 2026 race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who is the Palmetto State's longest-serving governor. Pamela Evette, and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell are all seeking the GOP nomination in the reliably red state. They were joined on Sunday by Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who declared his candidacy. Mace said that if she launches a gubernatorial campaign, "we're starting out front, in the lead, and it's a two-man race" between her and Wilson. And she pledged that "if I get in, I will fight to the finish, and I will take out South Carolina's Attorney General, because he's turned a blind eye on women and on children and on the state for a lot of reasons. Mace, in a bombshell speech on the U.S. House floor in February, alleged that Wilson ignored evidence of sexual assault against her and other women. In her hour-long speech, Mace accused four men, including her ex-fiance, of sexual crimes and said she was among the victims. Wilson vehemently denied Mace's accusations, saying at the time "that allegation was never made to me — no one in my office." Wilson, in a statement to Fox News on Monday, argued that "Nancy Mace is a liar who will do anything to get attention to distract from her liberal voting record. I've served our country and dedicated my civilian career to protecting children." "Her attacks are, again, categorically false and are just a distraction from her liberal agenda," he added. "South Carolina families need a Governor who will fight for our values, not someone who will compromise them for political gain and social media clicks." South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, is running for governor in the 2026 race to succeed term-limited GOP Gov. Mace, who dropped out of high school at age 17, and worked at a Waffle House before eventually becoming the first female graduate of the Citadel's Corps of Cadets, won election to Congress in 2020. Mace, who worked on President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, strongly criticized his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, when Trump supporters attempted to upend congressional certification of now-former President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election. Trump backed a primary challenger against Mace when she was up for re-election in 2022, but she successfully won re-nomination and re-election. Mace later came to Trump's defense after the then-former president was indicted for mishandling classified documents. And she endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. Trump's grip over the GOP, thanks to his 2024 victory to win back the White House, is stronger than ever, and his endorsements in GOP nomination races are extremely influential. Asked if she could land the president's endorsement if she ran for governor, Mace told Fox News Digital, "I'll be working very hard if I get in to earn his support." GOP Rep. Nancy Mace speaks with an audience member after the Republican lawmaker from South Carolina appeared at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics, on July 25, 2025, in Manchester, New Hampshire. "I love being here in the Granite State, because this is where real men protect women," Mace said in her opening remarks. They want men showering next to our 12-year-old daughters," she argued. I'm just here to say the biological truth is not that." Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Climate Summit, Monday, Nov. 11, 2024, in Baku, Azerbaijan. ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban's top environment official on Monday called for Afghanistan's inclusion in U.N. climate talks, saying extreme weather and water scarcity are having a “profound impact” on people's lives and the economy. A Taliban delegation attended last year's COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, but as observers. Khalis said he wanted inclusion at COP30, which is being held in Brazil later this year. “Afghanistan is severely affected by climate change,” Khalis told a conference in Kabul. “ Drought, water shortages, declining arable land, flash floods, and threats to food security are having a profound impact on people's lives and the economy. “Although Afghanistan's contribution to global climate change is almost nonexistent, it suffers greatly from its consequences.. As a victim of climate change, Afghanistan has the right to be present at global platforms, especially at COP30, to voice the damages it has endured.” Earlier this month, the U.N. published a report that said June was marked by below-average precipitation and higher-than-average temperatures across Afghanistan. “The current monsoon season has started earlier than usual, beginning in May instead of the typical June or July, and is more intense than in recent years. Forecasts indicate above-average rainfall in many regions.” In Baku last November, Khalis told The Associated Press that authorities had prepared national action plans to deal with climate change and would be updating their climate goals. He said the country had great potential for wind and solar power, but needed international support to develop it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper launched his campaign for U.S. Senate on Monday, setting up a high-stakes battle in one of the nation's most competitive states and giving Democrats a marquee contender in their push to retake the majority. Cooper, a two-term governor who left office in January, enters the race to succeed retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) with strong name recognition, statewide infrastructure, and a record of winning tough races in a state that has trended red at the federal level. His candidacy immediately reshapes the 2026 Senate map, offering Democrats a rare pickup opportunity in a cycle in which they are largely on defense. He focused on expanding Medicaid, boosting education funding, and blocking GOP-led legislation, often clashing with the Republican legislature. Despite the state's conservative tilt, Cooper remained popular and won reelection in 2020 even as Trump carried North Carolina. The race is expected to pit Cooper against Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who has secured President Donald Trump's “complete and total endorsement.” Whatley is preparing his own campaign and is widely viewed as the GOP front-runner following the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump's decision not to run. “Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' bidding, releasing violent illegal aliens into North Carolina streets, and championing radical transgender ideology,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez. Cooper is expected to face a primary challenge from former Rep. Wiley Nickel, but Democratic operatives anticipate the party will quickly consolidate around the former governor. First elected in 2014, Tillis delivered a fiery floor speech last month denouncing Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, warning that its deep Medicaid cuts would “betray the promise Donald Trump made” to voters. He was one of just two Republicans to vote against the bill, a defiant stand that drew an immediate backlash from Trump, who threatened to back a primary opponent. Less than 24 hours later, Tillis announced he would not run for reelection. North Carolina has consistently ranked among the nation's most competitive states. In 2024, Trump won it by just over 3 points, continuing a streak of razor-thin margins. The Senate races have been no different: Tillis edged out Democrat Cal Cunningham by fewer than 2 points in 2020, while Ted Budd defeated Cheri Beasley by about 3 points in 2022.</p>

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital on the US-Israel relationship, Iran, prospects for a hostage deal, and enlarging the Abraham Accords. The Trump administration is set to boycott a high-level summit on Palestinian statehood, co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, scheduled to take place at United Nations headquarters in New York City on Monday. The event was originally planned for June with French President Emmanuel Macron in attendance but was postponed due to the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. Representatives from more than 50 nations are expected to speak at the High-level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine, with dozens of additional countries listed as participants. Reuters reported last month that a U.S. diplomatic cable had urged governments to skip the "counterproductive" U.N. event, which Washington described as an obstacle to efforts to end the war in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron took to X on Thursday to announce France's formal recognition of the Palestinian State at the United Nations General Assembly in September. Bayefsky added, "This latest U.N. confab embodies the rejectionist culture: shove a Palestinian state down Israel's throat, without negotiations, and without Palestinian acceptance of the Jewish state. "After October 7, and the reality that the Palestinian Authority serves as Hamas's wingman on the international stage, it is painfully clear that an armed Palestinian state means more war, not peace," she said. Hamas terrorists take up positions ahead of a hostage release in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip on Saturday, Feb. 8, 2025. In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that "the prospect of a Palestinian state has never been so threatened—nor so necessary." "[It is] necessary, because expecting to achieve a lasting ceasefire, the release of hostages held by Hamas, and its surrender without first outlining a political horizon is an illusion," he added. French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Jean-Noel Barrot delivers a speech during the annual conference of French ambassadors at the International Conference Centre of the French Foreign Affairs ministry in Paris on Jan. 6, 2025. Monday's event comes on the backdrop of Macron's decision to recognize a Palestinian state. President Donald Trump immediately dismissed the move, arguing that Macron's statement "doesn't matter." Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee mocked Paris' decision in a series of social media posts. If Macron can just ‘declare' the existence of a state perhaps the U.K. can ‘declare' France a British colony!" In May, Huckabee told Fox News Digital, "If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian state, I have a suggestion for them—carve out a piece of the French Riviera." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning Paris' move "to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre." Key European nations have not yet backed Macron's initiative, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stating on Saturday that recognizing a Palestinian state was premature. "I am very much in favor of the State of Palestine, but I am not in favor of recognizing it prior to establishing it," Meloni said. "If something that doesn't exist is recognized on paper, the problem could appear to be solved when it isn't." A German government spokesperson said on Friday, "Israel's security is of paramount importance," and therefore Berlin "has no plans to recognize a Palestinian state in the short term." French President Emmanuel Macron addresses the 72nd United Nations General Assembly at U.N. headquarters in New York. In a video statement on Friday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is "working on a pathway to peace in the region focused on the practical solutions that will make a real difference to the lives of those who are suffering in this war." By contrast, NATO member and U.S. ally Turkey welcomed the French move, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan congratulating Macron during a phone call between the two leaders. Avi Pazner, former Israeli ambassador to France and Italy, told Fox News Digital that there is "no rational explanation" for Macron's decision, as everyone understands that it is "not feasible." Pazner suggested that Macron may be attempting to gain credibility with France's significant Muslim and Arab minorities, which some estimate to be between 8%- 10% of the country. Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former negotiator at the State Department under both Democratic and Republican administrations, told Fox News Digital that Trump has his own set of objectives and sensibilities regarding the issue of Palestinian statehood. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas holds a leadership meeting in Ramallah, the West Bank, on April 23, 2025. "It was the view of successive administrations that unilateral statehood would prejudge and undermine the conditions necessary for negotiations," he added. "If France is recognizing a Palestinian state, within what borders? The French and Saudi-sponsored conference is expected to run through Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Washington insiders, seeing and hearing is no longer believing, thanks to a spate of recent incidents involving deepfakes impersonating top officials in President Donald Trump's administration. Digital fakes are coming for corporate America, too, as criminal gangs and hackers associated with adversaries including North Korea use synthetic video and audio to impersonate CEOs and low-level job candidates to gain access to critical systems or business secrets. Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, creating realistic deepfakes is easier than ever, causing security problems for governments, businesses and private individuals and making trust the most valuable currency of the digital age. Responding to the challenge will require laws, better digital literacy and technical solutions that fight AI with more AI. “As humans, we are remarkably susceptible to deception,” said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO and founder of the tech firm Pindrop Security. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio listen during a meeting with Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, July 16, 2025, in Washington. This summer, someone used AI to create a deepfake of Secretary of State Marco Rubio in an attempt to reach out to foreign ministers, a U.S. senator and a governor over text, voice mail and the Signal messaging app. In May someone impersonated Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Another phony Rubio had popped up in a deepfake earlier this year, saying he wanted to cut off Ukraine's access to Elon Musk's Starlink internet service. The national security implications are huge: People who think they're chatting with Rubio or Wiles, for instance, might discuss sensitive information about diplomatic negotiations or military strategy. “You're either trying to extract sensitive secrets or competitive information or you're going after access, to an email server or other sensitive network,” Kinny Chan, CEO of the cybersecurity firm QiD, said of the possible motivations. Synthetic media can also aim to alter behavior. Last year, Democratic voters in New Hampshire received a robocall urging them not to vote in the state's upcoming primary. Their ability to deceive makes AI deepfakes a potent weapon for foreign actors. “Can you imagine what would happen if the Chinese government decided to do this?” The greater availability and sophistication of the programs mean deepfakes are increasingly used for corporate espionage and garden variety fraud. “Even individuals who know each other have been convinced to transfer vast sums of money.” In the context of corporate espionage, they can be used to impersonate CEOs asking employees to hand over passwords or routing numbers. Deepfakes can also allow scammers to apply for jobs — and even do them — under an assumed or fake identity. Others just want the work and may be working a few similar jobs at different companies at the same time. Authorities in the U.S. have said that thousands of North Koreans with information technology skills have been dispatched to live abroad, using stolen identities to obtain jobs at tech firms in the U.S. and elsewhere. In some cases, the workers install ransomware that can be later used to extort even more money. Within three years, as many as 1 in 4 job applications is expected to be fake, according to research from Adaptive Security, a cybersecurity company. “We've entered an era where anyone with a laptop and access to an open-source model can convincingly impersonate a real person,” said Brian Long, Adaptive's CEO. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio gestures as he boards his flight before departing from Subang Air Base, on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, on Friday, July 11, 2025, after attending the 58th ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting. Researchers, public policy experts and technology companies are now investigating the best ways of addressing the economic, political and social challenges posed by deepfakes. Lawmakers could also impose greater penalties on those who use digital technology to deceive others — if they can be caught. The best tool for catching AI may be another AI program, one trained to sniff out the tiny flaws in deepfakes that would go unnoticed by a person. Systems like Pindrop's analyze millions of datapoints in any person's speech to quickly identify irregularities. The system can be used during job interviews or other video conferences to detect if the person is using voice cloning software, for instance. Similar programs may one day be commonplace, running in the background as people chat with colleagues and loved ones online. Someday, deepfakes may go the way of email spam, a technological challenge that once threatened to upend the usefulness of email, said Balasubramaniyan, Pindrop's CEO.</p>

The idea that Middle East peace cannot and should not advance without a formal agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is outdated and demonstrably untrue. Indeed, it has done little but exacerbate conflict over the last 30 years and undermine U.S. interests in the region. The Abraham Accords, brokered by President Trump in 2020, offer a far more reliable solution. They provide a new paradigm for peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including the Palestinians. President Donald Trump obviously deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for breaking with the failed Oslo peace process paradigm still sanctified by legacy media and a bipartisan community of foreign policy elites, and for building new bridges of mutually-beneficial cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Those truly interested in Middle East peace should work to expand the circle of regional normalization and integration. Doing so will not only advance tolerance, understanding and growth in the Middle East, but also provide a pathway towards a lasting solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. This would certainly surprise former Secretary of State John Kerry, who in 2016 declared that peace between Israel and the Arab world would be impossible in the absence of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. "There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world," he declared. Trade, tourism and innovation cooperation quickly grew. Even in the outbreak of war begun by Hamas's October 7, 2023 terror attack, trade continued to rise. Nevertheless, despite the Biden administration's inability to add any additional countries, the prospect of expanded peace and cooperation was still seen as a grave threat to the Iranian regime and its terror proxies, including Hamas. This fear of Abraham Accords expansion was one of the motives behind Hamas decision to launch its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. 2025 saw the continuation of high-level diplomatic meetings, such as the repeated visits by Israel's foreign minister to Abu Dhabi, and the ratification of important bilateral agreements between Israel and its Accords partners. In addition, the Abraham Accords have had a direct positive impact on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel has worked closely with the UAE and Morocco on the delivery of such aid, coordination made possible due to the trust built between Israel and its Accords partners since 2020. The return of President Trump to the White House has created renewed momentum towards regional cooperation and integration. The benefits of such a peace could include not only those to be derived from bilateral relations with Israel and expanded ties with the United States, but those connected to groundbreaking multilateral initiatives such as the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, and a Middle East Security Alliance. The Palestinian Authority, for its part, stands at a crossroads. Its leader, Abbas, now in the 20th year of his first four-year term, oversees an Authority that continues to promote incitement, while failing to combat corruption or advance meaningful economic growth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ET Monday),﻿ following days of clashes across the two countries' disputed border. The ceasefire was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), who mediated talks between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai at his official residence near the capital Kuala Lumpur. Both sides have accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the ongoing fighting, which has killed at least ﻿38 people and injured more than 200, according to figures from Thai and Cambodian officials. The dispute over their border goes back decades. Cambodian authorities accused Thailand of striking at least two locations in the early hours, while the Thai army said clashes were taking place in three provinces. Reports of fighting dragged on even after the ceasefire was announced. US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the Southeast Asian nations had agreed to ceasefire talks, but localized fighting continued throughout the weekend. Trump said he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued. “This is an important step towards reducing tensions and restoring peace and security,” Hun Manet said in a statement confirming the ceasefire, in which he thanked the Malaysian prime minister, the Chinese government and Donald Trump specifically for their support in the negotiation process. Violence is flaring again on the Thai-Cambodian border. He also announced that the two countries will establish a Cambodian-Thai General Boundary Committee, which will hold an initial meeting on August 4, hosted by Cambodia. “Today's outcome reflects Thailand's desire for a peaceful resolution, while continuing to protect our sovereignty and the lives of our people,” Phumtham said in the news conference. “We agreed to a ceasefire that will be carried out in good faith by both sides.” Malaysia is prepared to deploy a team to “ensure implementation and observation” of the ceasefire, Ibrahim said, adding that both Thailand and Cambodia will resume direct communication at the level of prime ministers, foreign ministers and defense ministers. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes. In the call, Paetongtarn could be heard calling Hun Sen “uncle” and appeared to criticize her own army's actions in the border dispute, which led to her suspension after opponents accusing her of compromising the country's interests. The most recent flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion last week, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor. That was followed by days of deadly clashes and heavy weapons fire across their disputed border, displacing more than 139,000 people from seven provinces in Thailand, and at least 80,000 people in Cambodia. Thailand on Monday said 25 people have been killed since hostilities began, 14 of whom are civilians. Cambodian authorities previously said that in Oddar Meanchey province, which borders Thailand's Surin, 13 people had been killed, including eight civilians, and 50 wounded.

Country music legend Dolly Parton discusses her book and her Dollywood resort that focuses on entertaining families, on 'America Reports.' For Dolly Parton, spirituality is nothing to take lightly. The country music superstar has often spoken out about her faith over the years, but in a conversation with famed celebrity interviewer Lawrence Grobel, Parton revealed just how intensely she feels about the topic. Grobel, who has interviewed and written about a number of celebrities over his decades-long career, recently shared some diary entries with Vanity Fair – many of them describe conversations he's had with Parton, who he first met in 1978. Dolly Parton once told celebrity interviewer Lawrence Grobel that she believed Charles Manson would steal his soul were he to interview him. The two became friends, and in 1981, after he was presented with an opportunity to interview notorious serial killer Charles Manson, he asked Parton for her thoughts on the matter, since he'd been having trouble deciding whether he wanted to go through with it. "I think he'd steal your soul," she told him, per Grobel's diary entry. "I can't even look at a picture of him." The "Jolene" singer told Grobel that he "wouldn't make a difference" by interviewing Manson because any attention the story got would go to the infamous killer, who was convicted in 1971 of the murders of seven people. "I know it's an amazing story," she said, "but being the way we are, you and me, with the wonderful, pure force in you, just one minute with him could destroy all that we can be about. I'd be afraid it would get to me." Grobel wrote that Parton had told him that "this devil has come up between us," referring to Manson, and that she said that if he did choose to do the interview, "You and me would be more like in a battle and I'd be looking at you differently, because it would change you and you may not even know it. The darkness is something not to get involved with." The author ultimately declined the interview, and in his diary, he wrote that Parton "pretty much made my decision for me." "No candy if I play with the devil," he remarked. While the cult leader wasn't known to worship Satan as some people believed, he did invoke some Satanic imagery in public statements he made. Charles Manson is escorted to court for a preliminary hearing on December 3, 1969, in Los Angeles, California. At one point during his trial, Manson arrived to court with a shaved head, declaring, "I am the devil, and the devil always has a bald head." At a 1986 parole hearing, he said, "From behind the time locks of courtrooms and from the worlds of darkness, I did let loose devils and demons with the power of scorpions to torment." Grobel previously recounted the story of Parton's concerns about Manson on his website in 2017. There, he wrote that Parton was surprised that he had even needed to think about whether he wanted to do the interview, calling Manson "evil incarnate." He remembered her saying, "And to tell you the truth, that you even have to think about this concerns me." Parton has long been open about her beliefs, telling Fox News Digital in 2023 that she asks God to keep "the right people" in her life and to take "the wrong ones" out of it. "My faith impacts everything that I do because I do believe that, through God, all things are possible," she said at the time. And my spiritual energy has really been a great force to keep me going all these years and still being productive." Earlier this month, Parton appeared on Khloé Kardashian's "Khloe in Wonder Land" podcast, where she admitted that people have told her that she shouldn't speak so much about her faith. "I'm not telling you what to do. She said that if God can "shine through" her to other people, that's good enough for her. Emily Trainham is an entertainment editor for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universities across America are brazenly defying President Donald Trump's executive orders that banned diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, and Congress needs to hold them accountable. This week, undercover videos showed administrators at the University of Tennessee admitting that they are merely changing the name of their race- and gender-based programs to skirt Trump's orders. “We had to take our current programming and our future programming and make sure that it aligns so that we can do the work that we're trying to do, while also catering to the Department of Education, the federal,” he said in the video, adding, “The biggest thing is using language as a tool for protection.” In June, Accuracy In Media released a video depicting a University of North Carolina at Charlotte employee saying, “We've renamed, we've reorganized, we've recalibrated, so to speak.” She added that “if you're looking for, like, an outward DEI position — not going to happen. Some members of Congress and the administration are on to them. On Wednesday, during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution meeting on DEI, Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, observed, “This is not unusual compared to what we saw in the Brown v. Board of Education era,” referring to the Supreme Court case outlawing “separate but equal” policies. “We saw government officials openly defying those orders by rebranding, using different methods, and it took decades to root that out,” Dhillon said. “Hopefully, it doesn't take decades to root this out, but we've seen similar defiance.” At Belmont University, an administrator in the office of Hope, Unity, and Belonging acknowledged that it's just a word game. “If you're navigating in the shadows, nobody's paying attention to Belmont.” But even students know the school is just trying to be clever. “Every student at Belmont knows that it's the DEI program or the DEI office,” Belmont senior Mya Goodmanson said. “President Trump campaigned on immigration enforcement,” Noem said during a visit to Nashville. We taxpayers elected Trump to clean up this rotten ideology. Don't let bureaucrats and ideologues undermine the Trump agenda.

DroneUp CEO Tom Walker speaks with Fox News Digital about his Congressional testimony calling for a nationalized database of drone pilots and flights amid changing technology, while warning the country's airspace regulations are unprepared. As drone technology rapidly advances, industry experts are warning Congress about potential airspace lapses creating the next national security threat if left unregulated. In a U.S. House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing held last week, drone industry experts testified about the looming threats to airspace safety posed by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). "More than half of all near misses with commercial and general aviation are with drones," Tom Walker, CEO of DroneUp, told Fox News Digital. Drone experts are asking Congress for a centralized database to track flights and pilots in an attempt to fill gaps in airspace regulations. Walker leads the world's largest drone services network while working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Departments of Transportation (DOT), Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS) to implement changes on national airspace policy. While on Capitol Hill, Walker implored lawmakers to build a nationalized system that has the ability to identify each drone, pilot and mission throughout the country. "We don't have awareness of our airspace," Walker said. "We don't have a common operating picture. Drones have been responsible for several incidents involving rescue aircraft being struck during lifesaving efforts, including a firefighting airplane in California and a helicopter in Texas. Currently, the federal government does not have a centralized database that identifies a drone and its pilot in real-time, creating security lapses around critical infrastructure throughout the country and a lack of accountability surrounding rules and regulations of airspace. The implementation of Remote ID – a "digital license plate" for drones – was rolled out in an attempt to identify UAS systems, but can easily be overridden to conceal a pilot's identity, according to Walker. "We have a policy that says you can't go above 400 feet. We have a policy that says you can't fly during Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). We have a policy that says you can't fly in restricted airspace. And those policies have been violated over a million times." Walker pointed to several high-profile incidents in recent months involving drones interfering with law enforcement efforts. Earlier this year, a California man pleaded guilty to federal charges after his drone struck a Canadian Super Scooper firefighting aircraft while authorities raced to battle the devastating Palisades Fire. As a result, the potentially lifesaving plane was grounded for approximately five days. "The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing, and a critical piece of response equipment is now out of service until further notice," the City of Kerrville said in a statement. While officials have insisted these instances were completely preventable, Walker points to a lack of a centralized system to identify and locate unlawful drones. "I would argue we have no awareness of the airspace whatsoever," Walker told Fox News Digital. Although the vast majority of regulations have been implemented through policy changes, Walker believes officials are focusing their efforts on counter-UAS systems in a misguided attempt to regain control of the country's airspace. "You don't own and control your airspace just by having defensive postures. Walker's solution would initially be rolled out in areas that are at a high risk for drone incursions in what he calls a "phased approach," with agencies having access on an as-needed basis. "Let's start with protecting critical infrastructure," Walker said, before pointing to the United States' recent airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. "All it would've taken is a kid with a [drone] flying over that airbase and they wouldn't have been able to launch." As government officials look to integrate drone policies during a time when technology is changing at a rapid rate, Walker encourages collaboration between UAS experts and authorities to aim for long-standing regulations that benefit Americans while stressing that the current guidelines do not adequately address airspace concerns. "What systems do we have in place that are tested, tabletop exercised and in place to prevent that today?" "If you look at the number of things that are being smuggled into prisons, it's not just drugs, cellphones and SIM cards," Walker said. And we, as a country, have done very little up to this point, other than policy." Steven Willoughby, DHS director of counter-UAS program management, testified in a Senate Judicial Committee hearing on Tuesday about cartels using drones to carry out illegal operations at the border, echoing Walker's sentiment. "Drones have also been used increasingly to conduct kinetic attacks or warring cartel functions have attacked one another using drone delivered explosives, and it's only a matter of time before Americans or law enforcement are targeted in the border region." The FAA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The implementation of a nationwide, real-time database of UAS flights could ultimately allow drones to exist alongside manned aircraft, further cementing the United States' ability to protect both its domestic and international assets while aiding its citizens. "We should have both manned and unmanned aircraft working together harmoniously in a symbiotic environment and creating a force multiplier that allows us to save more lives," Walker said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Hunger in Gaza: A growing starvation crisis has stalked Gaza for weeks under Israel's strict controls of all supplies sparking growing international outrage over people dying from hunger in the territory. • Israel eases some restrictions: Israeli troops began a daily “tactical pause in military activity” for three parts of Gaza on Sunday. It's one in a series of moves somewhat easing Israel's grip on the enclave, after global outrage mounted over the growing number of Palestinians starving to death. Palestinians raced through the streets to reach supplies from the aid drops, which have been sharply criticized by some humanitarian groups as expensive, inefficient and dangerous. Over 100 trucks delivered supplies to the enclave Sunday, the UN said, but navigating Gaza is difficult even during pauses in fighting, and medical workers fear the trickle of aid may be too late to save starving children. Our live coverage of Israel's war in Gaza has ended for the day. Hamas' Qatar-based leader Khalil Al-Hayya blamed Israel and the US for stalling the Gaza ceasefire talks in a televised speech Sunday, saying that the starvation crisis in Gaza meant there is “no point in continuing negotiations” under current conditions. Al-Hayya stated there is “no point in continuing negotiations” while Gaza faces an ongoing siege and “starvation.” He demanded the “immediate and dignified entry of food and medicine” as a prerequisite for any further talks, refusing to let Palestinian suffering be used for “occupation's negotiating tricks.” He also accused the US and Israel of “wasting time” to intentionally delay progress to facilitate the continued devastation of Palestinians in Gaza. Two of the remaining sticking points in negotiations over a potential ceasefire deal in Gaza are the exchange of prisoners for hostages and the schedule for Israel's withdrawal, a senior Hamas official told CNN on Friday. Israel began its “tactical pauses” in military operations for parts of Gaza on Sunday, and more than 100 trucks delivered humanitarian aid to the enclave. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates dropped additional supplies from aircraft. The trickle of aid came after Israel made a series of moves to somewhat ease its blockade on Gaza, as it faces mounting global outrage over the growing number of Palestinians starving to death. Finally, here's a closer look at the Israel Defense Forces' “tactical pauses”: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again denied that Palestinians in Gaza face starvation as he delivered remarks at an event in Jerusalem with Paula White, the leader of the White House Faith Office. “Israel is presented as though we are applying a campaign of starvation in Gaza. Netanyahu also repeated the unproven claim that Hamas steals humanitarian aid in Gaza. “Hamas robs, steals this humanitarian aid and then accuses Israel of not supplying it,” he said. His remarks come after Israel lifted some restrictions on aid entering Gaza in the face of growing global outrage about starvation in the enclave. CNN has been reporting on the dire conditions, including children dying of hunger and doctors fainting from lack of food while treating their malnourished patients. “This is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,” Fletcher said in a statement. The world is calling for this lifesaving aid to get through. We won't stop working for that,” Fletcher said. Global outrage over starvation deaths in Gaza reached fever pitch this weekend, and after ceasefire talks crumbled on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was left with mounting international pressure. His new aid distribution plan — including “tactical pauses” in military activity for parts of Gaza, the establishment of aid corridors, and renewed airdrops — resulted in public criticism at home. The slap-down was unsurprising coming from hard-right ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir, but many other Israelis also cannot fathom Netanyahu's apparent climbdown, hinting more strongly at a political bind for the prime minister. The timing of Netanyahu's announcements may also be because he thinks that bind will soon loosen. The Knesset, Israel's parliament, goes on vacation for several months on Monday, and Ben-Gvir and others won't be able to collapse his government once it does. Hamas decried the Israeli government's move to resume air-dropping aid and establish corridors for humanitarian deliveries in Gaza as “nothing more than a formal and deceptive step aimed at whitewashing its image before the world.” Israel has been facing intensified global pressure over starvation in Gaza while its blockade throttles the entry of aid to the enclave. In a statement on Sunday, the militant group criticized Israel's initiatives as insufficient and humiliating to Gazans. “The occupation's plan for airdrops and control of so-called humanitarian corridors represents a blatant policy to manage starvation, not end it,” Hamas' statement reads. Eyewitnesses have spoken of the horror of trying to get aid in western Gaza on Sunday.A Palestinian man in western Gaza City described one area where desperate people gathered to grab what they could from trucks carrying flour and air drops as a “death area.” The young man, who was carrying a bag of flour, said he saw at least one person killed and several injured when Israeli forces opened fire at close range on Sunday. The Israel Defense Forces told CNN it was “not aware of any incident at that time and location”.Another eyewitness, who was at the site, said he managed to get a bag of flour from “under death,” saying several people were killed without providing further details. A Palestinian woman who was in the area said she risked her life to bring food for her two kids, claiming she was surrounded by (Israeli) tanks while there. Bodies brought to hospital: In a separate incident earlier in the day, Al-Awda Hospital said it had received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point in the central Gaza Strip operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday it was “not aware of any casualties” after its troops fired warning shots near the aid distribution site in central Gaza. Earlier on Sunday, Al-Awda Hospital said it had received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point in the central Gaza Strip operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). It did not take place at a GHF site in central Gaza where a separate incident occurred earlier in the day. In July alone, 24 children under five years old died of malnutrition-related causes. Gaza has been gripped by an escalating hunger crisis as Israel imposed a blockade on the enclave, slowing the entry of aid to a trickle. Over 5,000 children under 5 were admitted for outpatient treatment of malnutrition in just the first two weeks of July, the WHO said. The WHO also acknowledged that their figures are likely an underestimation due to the difficulties many families face while trying to reach health facilities. The organization issued a plea for “urgent, sustained efforts to flood the Gaza Strip with diverse, nutritious food, and to expedite the delivery of therapeutic supplies for children and vulnerable groups, as well as essential medicines and supplies.” The operation comes after international pressure on Israel to ease its blockade reached a fever pitch, with stark images of the starvation crisis gripping Gaza causing widespread outrage. Israel appears to be reversing its highly contentious Gaza aid policy that led to international outrage over needless deaths and starvation of Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that the new aid distribution plan is not a climbdown only fuels speculation that it is. He is ensnared in a breakdown of his own creation. Ceasefire talks crumbled Friday when he pulled the Israeli delegation back to Jerusalem, just as international criticism over malnutrition deaths in Gaza reached fever pitch. The scrutiny was crushing his hopes of wrenching concessions from Hamas, which, from Israel's perspective, is reveling as they squirm and would exploit the starvation narrative. But no amount of aid will stop those close to death from dying of starvation and international anger is unlikely to abate quickly. Hamas may feel emboldened use that pressure to seek better terms in ceasefire negotiations. Before Netanyahu's apparent climbdown, it seemed he was on the verge of getting Hamas to revise down their demands again. In the midst of a dire hunger crisis in Gaza, Israel and other countries have begun dropping aid by plane into the Palestinian enclave. CNN's Nic Robertson breaks down how much relief this measure could offer and explains why it faces criticism from some aid groups: In the midst of a hunger crisis in Gaza, Israel and other countries have begun dropping aid by plane into the area. CNN's Nic Robertson breaks down how much effect this measure can offer, while the UN calls for substantial relief to come from aid trucks moving in quickly through open corridors. As the Israeli military began what it called a “tactical pause” in operations in three parts of Gaza, a dozen people were reported to have been killed while trying to get food aid from a distribution point in central Gaza on Sunday. Al-Awda Hospital said it received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and treated more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point operated by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. The Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Sunday that it was “not aware of any casualties” after its troops fired what it described as “warning shots” near an aid distribution site. More victims arrive at hospitals: There have also been further casualties among people seeking aid in northern Gaza, according to hospital officials. Abu Salmiya told CNN that 120 injured people had also arrived at the hospital. This post has been updated with a response from the IDF. US President Donald Trump on Sunday blamed Hamas for the breakdown in Gaza ceasefire talks last week, echoing his administration's claim that the militant group had not been “acting in good faith” during the negotiations. “They had a routine discussion the other day, and all of a sudden they hardened up,” Trump said of Hamas, in response to questions from reporters during his trip to Scotland. “They don't want to give them back,” he added. More background: The US recalled its negotiating team from Doha last week, where talks on a ceasefire to end the war in Gaza had been taking place. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said at the time that the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.” Officials in Hamas' political bureau said the group was “surprised” by the US description of events and have claimed a breakthrough was “close.” CNN's Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood contributed reporting to this post. President Donald Trump said Sunday that the US will provide more humanitarian assistance to Gaza while reiterating his claims that Hamas is stealing aid. Asked by reporters in Scotland whether Israel should be doing more to allow food into Gaza, Trump said, “Well, you know, we gave $60 million two weeks ago and nobody even acknowledged it, for food. If we weren't there I think people would have starved, frankly. They would have starved, and it's not like they're eating well, but a lot of that food is getting stolen by Hamas,” Trump claimed. Some key context: An internal US government review found no evidence of widespread theft by Hamas of US-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza, contradicting the State Department's claims that were used to justify backing a controversial private organization that took over aid distribution in the enclave. “There was no indication that there was a systemic loss due to Hamas interference or theft or diversion,” a source familiar with the report told CNN. Six more Palestinians died from starvation in the last 24 hours, Gaza's health ministry says, bringing the total to at least 133 since October 2023. More from Trump: Trump, who was sitting alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said the US will provide additional aid to Gaza. While our hostages are in Gaza, our prime minister is sending humanitarian aid to Gaza,” Itamar Ben-Gvir said Sunday in a statement on video. He has been vocal about pressing on with the war in Gaza and has consistently opposed any negotiated ceasefire with Hamas. As controversial airdrops resumed in parts of Gaza on Sunday, some Palestinians spoke of their struggle to access the humanitarian aid once it had fallen to the ground. Massad Ghaban — who was looking for aid in Beit Lahia, a city in northern Gaza where some aid parcels were dropped — told the Reuters news agency that airdrops are “insulting.” “From 6 a.m. until now we didn't eat or drink. Another Palestinian in the same area of Gaza, Mahmoud Soukar, said he followed the planes in search of aid but returned empty-handed. “They dropped (the aid) around 3 kilometers from where people were gathered, and we didn't get aid,” Soukar said, according to Reuters. Why airdrops are controversial: Aid airdrops have been sharply criticized in recent days by some humanitarian groups, who say they are expensive, inefficient and dangerous for those on the ground, with pallets of supplies having crushed Palestinians in the past. Proponents say the method can act as an additional means to deliver aid to hard-to-reach areas and within a short period of time. Democratic US Rep. Madeleine Dean says there is “tremendous pressure” on President Donald Trump over the ongoing starvation crisis in Gaza. Since then, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — which has been positioned to replace the efforts of an embattled United Nations agency — has been criticized by the UN for its inability to provide ample support and safe aid checkpoints for people in Gaza. “You see now, what is going on is that my constituents are calling me about Gaza, are calling me about the other issues that the president is not dealing with as he's off in Scotland promoting his golf courses,” Dean said, referring to Trump's ongoing trip to the United Kingdom. Humanitarian groups delivering aid in Gaza face a risky path through the war-torn Strip — even during pauses in fighting, according to the United Nations. Aid convoys are headed toward the Palestinian enclave Sunday after Israel announced it would establish corridors for humanitarian deliveries and implement “tactical pauses” in fighting for some densely populated areas. OCHA proposed allowing more basic commodities from the private sector to enter Gaza, saying, “Humanitarian aid cannot sustain a population of over 2 million people.” Six more Palestinians in Gaza have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to at least 133 since October 2023, according to Gaza's health ministry. According to the UN's World Food programme, nearly 100,000 women and children alone are suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Gaza.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was firm on Sunday that he would not allow any more wind turbines to be built in the United States, calling them “very destructive.” Trump made the comments during a four-day trip to Scotland, where he just announced a trade deal with the European Union. As he took questions from reporters alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he directed his ire at wind turbines, some of which he saw while playing golf at his course in Turnberry. “We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They're killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains,” Trump said, before describing what he saw in Scotland. Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world, right? I said, ‘Isn't that a shame?' What a shame you have the same thing all over, all over Europe, in particular, you have windmills all over the place.” @POTUS spits facts: "We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They're killing the beauty of our scenery … It's the most expensive form of energy. Trump also criticized wind energy more broadly, calling it a “con job.” “The whole thing is a con job. It's very expensive, and in all fairness, Germany tried it, and wind doesn't work. While seated next to von der Leyen, Trump gave some advice to European leaders who have embraced wind energy. “I say two things to Europe. Under the current framework, the EU will purchase $750 billion worth of American energy and increase its investment in the U.S. by more than $600 billion above its current levels.</p>
