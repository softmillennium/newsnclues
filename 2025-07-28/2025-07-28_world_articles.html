Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) has denounced a bill advancing through the House that threatens sanctions on South Africa over its genocide case against Israel in the Hague and other actions against Israel, calling it an “extremist disgrace.” Last Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly voted to advance a bill that requires the U.S. to reexamine its relationship with South Africa and proposes sanctions on South African officials, specifically naming leaders of the African National Congress party. It's unclear if House or Senate leaders would put the bill to a full chamber vote. However, the advancing of the bill, introduced by Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson (Texas), is yet another show of U.S. lawmakers' willingness to bend over backwards to please Israel in a time when it is committing genocide in Gaza and ethnic cleansing in the occupied West Bank. “Congress is threatening to sanction South Africa for their courageous leadership against the Israeli regime's genocide in Gaza,” said Tlaib in a statement on social media on Monday. Republicans and any Democrats who vote for this should forever keep [Nelson] Mandela's name out of their mouths.” The bill also names cooperation with China and Russia as a reason to reexamine ties — though South Africa also maintains close ties with U.S. allies. Other Democrats have criticized the bill as counterproductive, saying that it would only push South Africa closer to adversaries by cutting ties with the U.S. Israel was once close with South Africa, in the apartheid era. Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers have taken numerous steps to retaliate against international figures and institutions in order to shield Israel from any shred of consequences for its genocide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ramirez, an Illinois representative and Democrat who sits on the committee, is requesting a hearing to address “human rights abuses” at the facility, where the US government sent nearly 300 immigrants after Donald Trump's second presidency began in January. The Guardian viewed Friday's request letter, sent by Ramirez to the homeland security committee chair, Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican. Details continue to emerge regarding the treatment of Venezuelans by Salvadorian prison officials. On 18 July, the US, El Salvador and Venezuela engaged in a prisoner swap that released 252 Venezuelan men from the notorious Central American megaprison. According to press reports, Venezuelan immigrants who were sent by the US to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot for its Spanish acronym, have said they were subjected to horrific abuse, including beatings, torture, denial of food and, in one case, sexual assault. “I am concerned that, in paying the Salvadoran government to detain immigrants at Cecot, the administration funded human rights violations with taxpayer dollars,” Ramirez's letter says. “I urgently request that we hold a hearing on how US funds were used to enable these flagrant human rights abuses at Cecot.” Garbarino did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment about Ramirez's letter. But in mid-March, immigration officers quietly filled planes with Venezuelan and Salvadorian immigrants who were detained by the US and quickly sent them to El Salvador to be detained in the Cecot prison. A federal judge ordered the planes to return after they took off. See more of the Guardian's immigration crackdown charts and data here. The Trump administration sent more people to El Salvador's Cecot prison later in March. One case that gained significant media attention was that of Andry Hernández Romero, a 32-year-old gay makeup artist whose crown tattoos near the words “Mom” and “Dad” in Spanish were cited as evidence that he was a gang member. The Venezuelan men were sent back to Venezuela, while a number of US nationals detained in the country were returned to the US – among them a former US marine who had been convicted of a triple murder. After his release, Hernández Romero told journalists his time in Cecot was “an encounter with torture and death”, Reuters reported. “Many of our fellows have wounds from the nightsticks; they have fractured ribs, fractured fingers and toes, marks from the handcuffs, others have marks on their chests, on their face … from the projectiles.” In another interview with Venezuelan media, Hernández Romero said he was sexually abused by guards. The Venezuelan government has said it will investigate El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, a close Trump ally, over the alleged abuses. Bukele's Cecot prison has been a defining centerpiece of his administration in recent years. Bukele reportedly requested the return of key MS-13 leaders from US custody, critics say, to allegedly prevent them from revealing further information about a controversial 2019 pact between his government and the gang.</p>

The “aid” airdrops that Israel authorized in Gaza did little to nothing to alleviate Israel's starvation catastrophe while also injuring roughly a dozen Palestinians, with reports that they even collapsed homes and landed on tents in the region. They did not receive any assistance and are fearful for their safety.” Health officials have said that they have recorded roughly 11 people being injured from the airdrops, which were sent from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. There were roughly 25 tons of aid dropped into the region on Saturday — but Palestinians report that the aid is being dropped in Israeli military-controlled areas, and that the aid is being looted and stolen, potentially by groups armed by Israel in Gaza. Meanwhile, Israel has touted “humanitarian pauses” in al-Mawasi and other parts of Gaza that Israel supposedly already designated as “safe zones” to allow for the entry of aid. But Palestinians say that these have made little difference as well. “What the world calls ‘humanitarian aid' is, in reality, a new tool of collective punishment. Humanitarian groups have condemned the airdrops, with UN Relief and Works Agency chief Philippe Lazzarini saying on Saturday that they are nothing more than “a distraction and screensmoke.” “They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians,” Lazzarini said. UN and other humanitarian aid groups have said that a return to the UN-led humanitarian aid system, as well as a ceasefire and full access to the Strip, is the only way to end Palestinians' starvation. “Israel's announced ‘tactical pause' in Gaza is desperately insufficient while it commits genocide against Palestinians, who are facing the catastrophic conditions Israel deliberately engineered,” said Amnesty International in a statement on Monday. Nonetheless, the airdrops and “pause” strategy have been touted by media as a solution to Israel's starvation crisis — despite the mountain of experts saying that Israel is not interested in alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe that it has deliberately and meticulously created. Instead, Israel is dismantling the aid system piece by piece, announcing last week that it is no longer automatically renewing visas for UN humanitarians, and will only be granting access on a one-month basis.

The conditions of the victims at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno were not immediately known, said a Reno police spokesperson, Chris Johnson. The gunman was being treated at a hospital, Johnson said. Caroline Ackerman, a spokesperson for Renown regional medical center, said the hospital's emergency department received several patients with gunshot wounds. The local news outlet KRNV reported that Reno police responded to a report of an active shooter at the Grand Sierra Resort at about 7.25am. Within four or five minutes, officers found the suspect, who was then taken to a hospital after what police described as an officer-involved shooting. Four people were hospitalized in the shooting, and three others were injured, the newspaper added. In the US, the phrase “active shooter” frequently refers to someone firing at multiple victims at random, and an officer-involved shooting refers to an officer shooting someone. “We don't know yet quite how it started or who was involved.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian delegation, which also includes Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev and Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy, all under EU and Swiss sanctions for supporting Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, was granted temporary entry permission by Swiss authorities, according to Swiss media outlet Blick. Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) explained that under its host-state agreement with the IPU, it is obliged to facilitate the participation of official delegates in international events held on Swiss territory. According to a provisional list of attendees published by the conference organizers and cited by Blick, both Russian and Ukrainian delegations are registered for the event, which is taking place from July 29 to 31 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. Ukraine's delegation is reportedly led by Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk and includes four members. Speaking from the podium in Geneva, she repeated standard Kremlin propaganda narratives, accusing Ukraine of targeting civilians in Donetsk Oblast and justifying Russia's invasion as a necessary intervention to "stop the bloodshed." Matviyenko invited leaders from other countries to visit Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories. The IPU, founded in 1889, brings together parliamentary leaders from almost all UN member states. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Videos and social media posts circulating online impersonate the Kyiv Independent's branding, falsely claiming that President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a list of American citizens, such as Steve Bannon, Donald Trump Jr., Elbridge Colby, Mike Flynn, and Senator Mike Lee. Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) explained that under its host-state agreement, it is obliged to facilitate the participation of official delegates in international events held on Swiss territory. "This is a serious and unacceptable incident," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. "That message has been clearly communicated to the Russian charge d'affaires." "We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever," U.S. President Donald Trump said. "Each system currently produced for Ukraine includes three medium-range SLM launchers, and two short-range SLS launchers, as part of a unified complex," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said. By labeling missing soldiers as deserters, Russia not only conceals its true war losses but also avoids paying social benefits to the families of the deceased, IStories reported. Another 555 people were freed separately from prisoner exchanges with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky added. "According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump has said he will slash the 50-day deadline he gave for Russia's Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine by weeks, to just “10 or 12 days” from now. But does a shorter deadline make a difference at all, if, as Trump says, his Russian counterpart has already made up his mind to not make peace? By September 3 – when the original 50-day mark would have passed – many of the gains Moscow is in the midst of making would likely be realized. Ukraine would have lost control of most of the towns it relies on now to hold the east, and be struggling to retain a grip on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. Trump's words were welcomed in Kyiv, where Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said he was “standing firm and delivering a clear message of peace through strength.” What comes in 10 to 12 days is key. Another empty threat or altered Trump deadline would play into the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) sensitivities of his administration and be a gift to those who doubt that Trump is willing to really play hardball with the Kremlin. Imposing the secondary sanctions, or tariffs, that Trump has threatened would, however, have enormous global impact. India is a US ally, hugely dependent on Russian energy and allowed to buy it through various complex mechanisms to prevent its demand on other energy markets causing oil prices to soar, damaging the American economy too. China is a Russian ally, even more dependent on Russian energy, and caught in a complex, at times symbiotic, economic relationship with the United States, which often teeters towards a trade war. If Trump sanctions either, it will damage the US and the global energy market, and mean his actions have likely been more pronounced and aggressive than any of the actions of his predecessor, US President Joe Biden. Chinese pressure could influence Moscow's behaviour, but Beijing has also told European diplomats it cannot afford for Russia to lose because the US would then turn its entire attention to China. China may bank on a weakened Trump rather than rejig its entire geopolitical approach. And so, we have a fortnight in which Moscow must persuade its allies and customers to hold fast in buying the energy they so badly need. Ukraine must try to hold whatever positions it can, in the face of a furious and successful Russian assault. And the Trump administration must decide whether its threats mean something. And if they are unwilling to impose and endure a vast economic earthquake, they must find a convincing off-ramp so their deadlines and threats continue to carry some weight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TEHRAN, July 28. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry said its agents prevented assassinations of 23 high-ranking officials during the 12-day war with Israel. "We were able to detect and neutralize terrorist plans of the regime (Israel - TASS) aimed at assassinating 23 of the country's high-ranking officials during the 12-day war, as well as 13 similar conspiracies in the months preceding the war, the uncovering of which, by God's grace, led to the prevention of assassinations of 35 high-ranking civilian and military officials," it said in a statement recapping the conflict. Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Nine days later, the US entered the fray. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24. Israeli strikes killed Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence General Gholam Reza Mehrabi, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations General Mehdi Rabbani, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mohammad Bagheri, Commander of Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters Lieutenant General Gholam Ali Rashid, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Commander Lieutenant General Hossein Salami, IRGC Aerospace Force Commander General Amir Ali Hajizadeh and at least seven other high-ranking officers at the IRGC Aerospace Force.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump met on Monday at one of his Scottish golf courses with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who pressed him on the U.S. taking a larger role in helping quell a growing food crisis in Gaza amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in the territory. But the prime minister didn't wait until they were inside to insist that Gaza would be a key topic in their meeting, calling what's occurring there “a desperate situation.” Trump expressed concern about the humanitarian situation and urged Israel's leader to take action as images of emaciated children have emerged. Trump was asked if he agreed with Netanyahu's remarks about concerns of mass starvation in Gaza being overstated and replied, “I don't know. Trump said Israel “has a lot of responsibility” for what's happening but said the country is hampered by considerations of the remaining hostages it wants to see kept alive and freed. “I think Israel can do a lot,” Trump said, without offering more information. Starmer is famously not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name – and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics. The prime minister wants Washington's help in convincing Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and attempting to end what Downing Street called “the unspeakable suffering and starvation” while pushing for a ceasefire. Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for “withholding essential humanitarian assistance” as hunger spreads in Gaza. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid after Israel temporarily eased restrictions. Trump spoke before the meeting with Starmer about wanting to help starving children, but he has also repeatedly complained about the U.S. not getting enough credit for organizing past food aid into Gaza. Starmer is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move both Israel and the U.S. have condemned. Trump, however, said Monday of Starmer doing so, “I don't mind him taking a position.” Trump said two weeks ago he would implement “severe tariffs” on Russia unless a peace deal is reached by early September, as he expressed exasperation with Putin over the bombardment of Ukrainian cities amid the Republican president's attempts to stop the fighting. The plan includes possible sanctions and secondary tariffs targeting Russia's trading partners. The formal announcement would come later Monday or on Tuesday, he said. “No reason in waiting,” Trump said of the shorter timeline. Mounted police walk along Balmedie Beach ahead of Trump and Starmer's Monday visit at the president's Menie golf course in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.Jane Barlow/The Associated Press Trump's new golf course near Aberdeen opens to the public on Aug. 13 and tee times are already for sale – with the course betting that a presidential visit can help boost sales. Protesters have planned a demonstration in Balmedie, near Trump's existing Aberdeen golf course. That follows protests across Scotland on Saturday decrying the president's visit as he was out golfing. While China initially responded to Trump's tariff threats by retaliating with high import taxes of its own on U.S. goods, it has since begun negotiating to ease trade tensions. Starmer and his country have taken a far softer approach. Starmer and Trump then signed a trade agreement during the G7 summit in Canada that freed the U.K.'s aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and used quotas to reduce them on auto-related industries from 25% to 10% while increasing the amount of U.S. beef it pledged to import. Because I like them – that's their ultimate protection,” Trump said of U.S. tariff policy during the G7. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending. The president has for months railed against yawning U.S. trade deficits around the globe and sees tariffs as a way to try and close them in a hurry. Census Bureau figures this year indicate that the surplus could grow. First Minister John Swinney said the spirit's “uniqueness” justified an exemption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday used his luxury golf course on Scotland's southeastern coast to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, mixing critical discussions on the deepening food crisis in Gaza, Russia's war in Ukraine and tariff rates with boasts about the property's opulence. Starmer came determined to press the U.S. to take a larger role in helping quell what he called a “desperate situation” amid increasing reports of starvation in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war rages. Trump at first was focused on complaining about the U.S. not having gotten enough credit for previously providing food aid. But he shifted tone when reporters questioned him about images of emaciated children from Gaza. Asked if he agreed with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks about concerns of mass starvation in Gaza being overstated, he replied, “I don't know. He said Israel “has a lot of responsibility” for what's happening but is hampered by what its actions might mean for the prospects of Israeli hostages Hamas has been holding since it attacked Israel in 2023. “I want him to make sure they get the food,” Trump said. That follows protests across Scotland on Saturday decrying the president's visit as he was out golfing at Turnberry. A protester on Balmedie Beach holds Palestinian and Scottish Independence flags on Monday ahead of Trump and Starmer's visit to Trump International Golf Links, the U.S. President's Menie golf course in Aberdeenshire.Jane Barlow/The Associated Press So much attention on his golf courses allows Trump to try to make good on a post from his first term in 2019, when he wrote of Turnberry, “Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Starmer is famously not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name – and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics. Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for “withholding essential humanitarian assistance” in Gaza as hunger spreads. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid into Gaza after Israel temporarily eased restrictions. As the leaders took more than an hour of reporters' questions, their sit-down at times played out like Trump's meetings with foreign leaders in the Oval Office. There, the president fields questions while his guest mostly sits quietly – even though this meeting took place in Starmer's U.K. Carney says Canada's trade situation with U.S. differs from that of the EU The meeting followed Trump sitting down after golfing on Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending. First Minister John Swinney said the spirit's “uniqueness” justified an exemption. Trump was noncommittal, though, smiling as he said, “I'm not a big whiskey drinker.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's fencing team claimed two bronze medals at the World Championships on July 27 in Tbilisi, a contest held amid protests over the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes. Sabre fencer Alina Komashchuk, 32, and epee fencer Nikita Koshman, 23, each won bronze in the individual events, the first individual World Championship medals of their careers, according to Ukraine's National Fencing Federation (FFU). In total, Ukraine has secured three medals at the championships, including a gold won by epee fencer Vlada Kharkova. The same day when Komashchuk and Koshman earned their bronze medals, local activists held protests against the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under neutral status, without national symbols or colors. On July 8, the International Fencing Federation (FIE) allowed 40 Russian and Belarusian athletes, including Russian Army Major Sofia Velikaya and Lieutenant Yana Yegoryan, to participate in the championships. Velikaya has also been a close confidante of President Vladimir Putin since 2024. Demonstrators lit firecrackers and displayed a banner reading: "Russian pigs, you are not welcome here! She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport. She holds a bachelor's degree in political journalism from Taras Shevchenko University and a master's degree in political science from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. "This is a serious and unacceptable incident," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. "That message has been clearly communicated to the Russian charge d'affaires." "Each system currently produced for Ukraine includes three medium-range SLM launchers, and two short-range SLS launchers, as part of a unified complex," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said. By labeling missing soldiers as deserters, Russia not only conceals its true war losses but also avoids paying social benefits to the families of the deceased, IStories reported. Another 555 people were freed separately from prisoner exchanges with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky added. "According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT. The suspected agent was identified as a 24-year-old unemployed local resident who had sought quick money via Telegram. Ukraine's state energy giant Naftogaz has signed its first agreement to import natural gas from Azerbaijan, the company said in a press release on July 28. The deal comes as gas storage reserves have fallen to their lowest level in at least 11 years, driven by Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid. A pro-Ukrainian hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed responsibility for a large-scale attack on Aeroflot's IT infrastructure, allegedly conducted in cooperation with the Belarusian opposition hacktivist group, Cyber Partisans BY.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Since Hamas's surprise attack on October 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 Israelis, the Israeli military has assailed and occupied much of the Gaza Strip, ramped up operations in the West Bank, struck Houthi targets in Yemen, devastated Hezbollah in Lebanon, hit nuclear and military sites in Iran, and bombed parts of Syria. All these adversaries have links to terrorism: in the decades before October 7, Hamas and Hezbollah used terrorism against Israel, killing over 1,000 civilians as well as many soldiers. The war in Gaza has caused tremendous civilian suffering. Those operations have caused approximately 1,000 deaths and displaced tens of thousands more Palestinians. Along with the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and numerous Jewish settler depredations there, Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel have many reasons to be outraged at Israel. Despite that anger and despite Israel's long slate of adversaries, the number of terrorist attacks within Israel since October 7 has been surprisingly low. Israel has not seen high-casualty terrorist attacks or even a sustained series of low-level incidents. By trying to stave off its adversaries and protect itself from terrorist attacks, Israel will in fact be entering a state of permanent war. Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis have used rockets, missiles, and drones to strike Israel in the last two years. But these incidents have more in common with the evolving nature of conventional warfare, as seen in Ukraine, for example, than they do with the suicide bombings, shootings, stabbings, and car rammings that formed the familiar repertoire of terrorists against Israelis in recent decades. According to media reports, terrorists have killed an estimated 20 Israeli civilians within Israel itself since October 2023 and another 14 in the West Bank. Terrorists have also not successfully targeted Israeli facilities or Israelis overseas, as they did famously in the twentieth century. Given Israel's constant state of war in the last two years, this death toll from terrorism seems like a relatively small number. In the 1990s, car bombs, suicide attacks, and kidnappings, such as the 1996 suicide bombing at a bus station in Jerusalem that killed 26 people and another a week later that killed 19, helped derail peace talks. In addition to substate groups, such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Iran regularly used terrorism against Israel, often working with Hezbollah, its closest proxy. In 1994, they killed 84 people when they bombed a Jewish community center in Argentina (Iran and Hezbollah regularly claim that Jewish and Israeli targets are identical). A suspected Hezbollah-linked suicide bomber blew up a bus full of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria in 2012, killing five Israelis and the Bulgarian bus driver. All these attacks, Iran and Hezbollah claimed, were revenge for Israeli offenses, including the killing of Iranian nuclear scientists and the targeting of Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon. Israel's adversaries certainly should not be short of motivation. In June, Israel conducted a sustained bombing campaign that destroyed much of Iran's nuclear program. It assassinated numerous Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. In September and October 2024, following a sustained low-level war, Israel defanged Hezbollah through a slew of assassinations, including the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the group's revered longtime leader. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to destroy the group. Hamas, in contrast to Iran and Hezbollah, has little incentive to refrain from attacks: Israel's campaign is relentless, and old forms of terrorism may be the best way to get revenge and demonstrate Hamas's continued relevance. These attacks on Palestinians could easily engender large-scale retaliatory violence. Several factors explain why Israel has not suffered a spate of more traditional terrorist attacks. As Israeli campaigns against Hamas in the past have demonstrated, killing terrorist group leaders, especially at a rapid pace, can undermine the overall effectiveness and capacity of these outfits. Guarding against Israeli strikes also creates its own logistical problems. They must trust few people and meet with fewer. To be sure, disrupting the leadership of terrorist groups does not stop all terrorism. Moreover, uncoordinated attacks, often by motivated individuals acting on their own, can still occur, as has happened in Israel since 2023. Israel's military and intelligence activities in the West Bank have also constrained Hamas and other militant groups even as they have hurt Palestinians. Israeli forces have flooded into the West Bank, arresting suspected terrorists and killing others. Operation Iron Wall, for instance, conducted in January right after the announcement of a cease-fire in Gaza, saw Israeli troops and tanks swarm into Jenin as well as over 100 air and drone strikes on Palestinian targets. Israeli officials insist that they are simply seeking to snuff out launch points for attacks into Israel, but the Israeli military appears to be preparing for a long-term presence in Jenin, Tulkarm, and other areas in the West Bank that it considers hot spots of Palestinian militancy. Israel has also greatly expanded its use of administrative detention in the West Bank and cut off some parts of the territory from others, hindering militants—and ordinary Palestinians—from moving back and forth. Such a heavy-handed approach has, at least according to Israeli official statistics, yielded positive results: compared with 2024, terrorist plots originating in the West Bank are down significantly. In addition to cutting off Gaza, Israel suspended around 150,000 work permits for Palestinians in the West Bank, preventing them from crossing into Israel. These movement restrictions, both within the West Bank and between the West Bank and Israel, will no doubt have made it harder for militants to stage operations in Israel proper. In addition, Israel has hardened its internal defenses and borders. It has deployed troops along Egypt's border with Gaza and Jordan's border with the West Bank to clamp down on weapons smuggling into Palestinian territories. These steps make it harder for Hamas, Hezbollah, and other militant groups to infiltrate operatives into Israel. The Shin Bet, Israel's internal security and counterintelligence service, has increased its surveillance of neighborhoods with high proportions of Arabs and has arrested hundreds. With Israel on the front foot in military campaigns in Gaza and the West Bank and with settlers on the rampage, Palestinian militants are focusing on operations in these areas rather than finding targets within Israel. Palestinian militants, for instance, frequently use roadside bombs against Israeli forces in the West Bank. But the vast majority of militant attacks on Israeli troops have not resulted in casualties. Fatigue and disillusionment may be setting in among the Palestinians. Although approximately half of Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank still support Hamas's decision to attack on October 7, this support has fallen from a high of 72 percent in December 2023. Many Palestinians still believe that fighting Israel is appropriate, but the devastation of Gaza is causing many to think twice about the costs of violence. For Hezbollah and perhaps Iran, another factor is in play—deterrence. Both before and after the 2024 Israeli campaigns, Hezbollah did not want to escalate the war, worried that it would lose, as indeed happened. Iran, too, sought to walk a fine line before the 12-day war in June, using missiles and drones to attack Israel but signaling that it sought to avoid escalation, even alerting Israeli officials in advance so that civilians could reach shelters and that Israel could ready its defenses. It is probable that, today, Israel has succeeded in deterring both Iran and Hezbollah from attacking it, at least for a little while. Iran has little interest in renewing an all-out war with Israel. Iranian-supported terrorist attacks would disrupt the fragile cease-fire and any negotiations toward a peace deal, leading to a resumption in fighting, possibly with further American involvement. Hezbollah, reeling from the blows it received last year, was unable to support Iran militarily in its ill-fated war with Israel. Israel's devastating campaigns against a wide range of groups and its efforts to subdue Palestinians have, so far, been effective, but sustaining these efforts requires a high operational tempo that is draining the country. Its military, which relies heavily on reserves, is not designed for long, grinding campaigns, such as what it is conducting in Gaza. Israel has had to raise taxes to finance the war, and constant fighting has created labor shortages as well as an uncertain environment for investors. Weary Israeli reservists are exhausted by repeated deployments and increasingly bitter toward ultra-Orthodox Israelis, who are exempt from mandatory service in the armed forces, an exception that is fostering social and political divisions. Twenty-eight Israelis died from missile attacks in the latest exchanges with Iran. These numbers pale in comparison with the military losses suffered by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, but they are still large numbers for a small, casualty-sensitive state. Israeli strikes in Lebanon left almost 4,000 dead, many of whom were civilians, while Israel has killed dozens of Yemenis and approximately 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7. Civilian deaths in Gaza are far higher, with tens of thousands dying (in total, close to 60,000 Gazans have perished, a figure that includes Hamas fighters). Beyond the carnage, Israeli authorities also appear to be pursuing an expansionist ideological agenda long harbored by the country's far right. In the West Bank, counterterrorism operations in refugee camps dovetail with the goal of extreme right-wing politicians to dislodge their residents and to divide the West Bank into isolated enclaves, preventing Palestinians from establishing a contiguous state. Many Israelis may not care or may see their country's conduct as a necessary evil in a fundamentally just campaign against terrorist groups and the governments that support them. That fall does not hinder Israeli operations today, but it may shape them tomorrow. Nor is the threat of international terrorism necessarily diminished. Hamas has not hit Israeli targets outside Israel or the Palestinian territories, but the risk of attacks from Iran and Hezbollah remains high. Israel's military-heavy approach also reduces the feasibility of other options. Although the October 7 terrorist attacks raised some hopes that a two-state solution or other negotiated settlement might be the final outcome of Israel's destruction of Hamas, Israeli leaders and the public have little faith that peace talks could work. On the other side, Israel's demolition and occupation of much of Gaza has made Palestinians all the less willing to reconcile with and forgive Israel. With no political solution in sight, Israel will likely continue its “mow the grass” approach to Gaza and the wider region. It will focus on reducing the capacities of its enemies, acknowledging that any military campaign will have only temporary effects and that Israel will eventually need to do it again and again to keep the threat from growing back. Such a strategy may succeed in protecting Israelis from terrorist violence. In seeking to protect itself from terrorism, Israel will be creating costly occupations and forever wars that will drain its economy, worsen social divisions, and deepen the country's international isolation.

GODDARD is Betty Freyhof Johnson '44 Professor of Political Science and Associate Provost for Wellesley in the World at Wellesley College. CHRISTIAN KREUDER-SONNEN is Junior Professor of Political Science and International Organizations at Friedrich Schiller University Jena. Stacie E. Goddard, Ronald R. Krebs, Christian Kreuder-Sonnen, and Berthold Rittberger The liberal international order is dying, and its transatlantic backers are grieving. During the first Trump administration, many were in denial, but few are now. Some are angry, denouncing a villain—usually U.S. President Donald Trump—for having unnecessarily destroyed what they hold dear and vowing to step forward to bolster global institutions: in March, for instance, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock declared that “a ruthless time has begun in which we must defend the rules-based international order and the strength of law more than ever against the power of the strongest.” Others, such as NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, hope they can bargain—that by coming on bended knee to the White House and flattering Trump, they can persuade the United States to reinvest in its historic alliances and defend key principles such as territorial sovereignty. Few of these mourners seem truly ready to accept the order's passing. These factors did play a role, but the postwar order ultimately decayed because what many saw as its greatest strength—how its institutions, norms, and rules were grounded in liberal principles—was actually a source of weakness. By providing universally acknowledged public goods, creating inclusive institutions, and committing to the rule of law, its backers believed that the order would prove particularly hardy. The unexpected consequence, however, was an order that was rigid and unresponsive, which only encouraged the forces clamoring for its demise. Paradoxically, if a multilateral, cooperative international order that facilitates peace and prosperity and allows liberal democracies to thrive is to be revived, its structure and procedures cannot be too rigidly pinned to liberal principles. Instead, it should be resurrected in a much more pragmatic and pluralistic form that replaces liberal proceduralism with greater political contestation. There are many narratives about the postwar international order's demise, but they typically share a common origin point and their first chapters overlap. In the late 1940s, Western leaders were gripped by a sincere desire to avoid the self-interested and shortsighted mistakes that had given rise to fascism and World War II. These norms and institutions established an international order that defined legitimate state behavior in line with liberal commitments. And its acknowledged leader, the United States, was a remarkably benevolent hegemon. One story line traces the order's fall to its underlying, often hidden hypocrisy. They never permitted truly free flows of trade, investment, ideas, and people because they feared a world of real equality. As a result, those on the periphery were always running but never catching up. The solution: fully eliminate power and privilege from the international order so it finally lives up to its claimed liberal ideals. A second, more tragic narrative blames the order's decline on post–Cold War triumphalism. A third story line attributes the order's collapse to sabotage. China's rise and Russia's return weakened the order from within. The solution: evict those states that are not true believers. What all three narratives share is a nostalgic desire to return to a moment when the international order worked. They envision traveling back in time to just before things went awry. Yet all three narratives fall short because they fail to see that the order's death was foreordained. American power built and sustained the international order that took shape after World War II, but liberal rhetoric defined its purpose, underpinned its design, and gave the order legitimacy. Its defenders argued that an international order would advance the universal interests for which all rational individuals yearn. The order's founders and backers also maintained that its institutions were necessary because the public goods they ensured would otherwise be in short supply. Consistent with individualistic liberal premises, supporters maintained that even if everyone wants common goods, such as collective security and free trade, they would prefer that others pay the costs of providing those goods. This appeared to be the clear lesson of interwar international politics, when beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies led to self-defeating protectionism, and shortsighted self-interest undermined the League of Nations. Finally, the postwar international order would, like liberal national constitutions, invoke the rule of law to tame power politics. Decision-making and enforcement would be shielded from countries' naked exercise of power. A rules-bound international trading regime, U.S. President Harry Truman declared in 1949, would mean that “all countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources.” Collective security organizations, such as the United Nations and NATO, were founded because of the universal truth that, as Carlo Sforza, Italy's minister of foreign affairs, put it at the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty signing ceremony, “no nation in the world can feel secure in its prosperity and peace if all its neighbors are not as safely marching towards the same goals of prosperity and security.” Because NATO advanced the good of all, Belgian Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak declared, all “the peoples of the world have . A generation later, the text of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty stated that its aim was to avoid “the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind by a nuclear war.” Despite the inequality the NPT formalized between nuclear haves and have-nots, it purported to be legitimate because it had rules to which its signatories had freely consented and that technocrats at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would impartially enforce. When he signed the NPT, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson promised that “the United States is not asking any country to accept any safeguards that we are not willing to accept ourselves.” All international orders are contested; even the most inclusive order distributes costs and benefits unevenly. Later, as China became an economic powerhouse, it demanded more say in the World Trade Organization (WTO). More recently, India's leaders have asked why their country's growing wealth has not resulted in a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. After globalization transferred manufacturing jobs out of wealthy, industrialized economies, populists in those countries promised to use state power to rein in markets. But the postwar liberal international order was supposed to be uniquely capable of channeling this kind of discontent into reforms that sustained the order's principles and its basic shape. Because the order provided public goods, everyone should have a stake in its survival. Because its institutions were open to all, everyone could lodge complaints and seek redress through existing processes. And if those processes failed, because institutional rules and procedures were open to debate, challenges could result in deeper institutional reforms. Justifying the order in terms of universal interests and public goods meant that those charging it with systemic injustice could be—and often were—dismissed. If all rational, moral individuals wanted what the order provided, then critics were either irrational and uninformed or immoral and disingenuous. When critics from the global South advanced a competing vision of trade centered on developing countries' national interests, defenders such as Peter Thomas Bauer, a prominent British economist, sneered at them as “intellectual barbarians” who failed to grasp the “basic tenets of economics.” When the entrepreneur Ross Perot assailed the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement in his 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, predicting in a debate that year that it would result in “a giant sucking sound going south,” mainstream economists such as Paul Krugman accused him of “telling malicious whoppers.” Democratic vice-presidential candidate Al Gore alleged that Perot was merely selling a “politics of negativism and fear” for his own benefit. Twenty-five years later, Trump's protectionism was part of what made him and his backers “deplorables.” Countries that sought nuclear weapons, regardless of their very real security concerns, were frequently stigmatized as “rogues,” “outlaws,” “mavericks,” “renegades,” or even “demons.” Even when the order's defenders acknowledged that critics had a point, they responded in ways that left those critics thwarted and discouraged. If critics accused wealthy Western countries of not abiding by the rules, then the liberal answer was straightforward: eliminate loopholes, make laws more binding, and grant more authority to international courts and organizations. As a result, in response to waves of challenges, the order's rational-legal architecture flowered. To attempt to insulate rule enforcement from power politics, the WTO was outfitted with trade courts, armed with the power to adjudicate disputes and interpret and discharge the law. The International Criminal Court was set up to hold individuals, including state officials, accountable for particularly grievous crimes. International bureaucrats came to govern matters large and small, from crimes against humanity to safety standards for cruise ships. For liberals, arbitrariness is the enemy of legitimacy in political orders and legal systems, and uncertainty is a wellspring of conflict. Transparent processes that are grounded in clear rules and that yield predictable outcomes are the foundation of both order and justice. Eliminating exceptions and stamping out imprecision are, from a liberal vantage point, necessary steps to perfect the order's congenital flaws. The postwar order had once been more tolerant of ambiguity in international rules and institutions. The GATT, which was signed in 1947 after the prospects for an International Trade Organization dimmed, allowed states to breach some of their obligations for reasons of “national security” and largely permitted states to define national security for themselves. Broad support never would have coalesced around the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights if it had outlined rights in detail and insisted on binding domestic or international enforcement. The 1968 NPT, meanwhile, passed muster only because its ambiguous text left both nuclear and nonnuclear states some wiggle room. Existing nuclear powers committed “to pursue negotiations in good faith . Had nonnuclear states insisted on a binding process by which the nuclear powers had to rid themselves of their weapons, the NPT would never have been signed, and many more states may well have acquired nuclear weapons by now. So it came to seem that the only consistent way forward was to tighten up the rules, eradicate ambiguities, and make enforcement more binding. Yet these very steps, taken to preserve the order, ultimately made it more brittle and fragile. To distance international institutions from the pitfalls of power politics is also to divorce them from the rejuvenating spring of national politics. Politics, as the democratic tradition rightly stresses, is a critical source of legitimacy. It connects policy outputs to the interests of individuals and countries. As that connection withered, decisions made by international judges and technocrats seemed arbitrary despite their expertise and despite the supposed fairness of their procedures. Flagrant violations across diverse policy realms suggested that the order's commitment to the rule of law was rhetorical window dressing. Absent a steady stream of feedback from national politics, absent forums and procedures that permitted adjustments on that basis, international institutions became rigid sites of rules application. Protectionist U.S. and EU agricultural policies were, for instance, increasingly called out as evidence of systemic rot. As India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Arun Jaitley put it in 2003, these rules stood “against equity, justice and fair play.” The scholar Matthew Stephen's analysis of speeches made by representatives of global South countries at WTO meetings confirms that, between 2001 and 2013, officials not only objected to Western hypocrisy on trade but raised growing doubts about the core values of reciprocity and open trade on which the postwar regime was based. India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, wrote in Foreign Affairs in 1998 that the world's nuclear powers were propping up a system of “nuclear apartheid,” suggesting that the system was intrinsically corrupt and beyond reform. Critics charged the nuclear powers with hypocrisy, for example by turning a blind eye to Israel's hidden nuclear deterrent and by granting India a waiver from the nuclear export control regime, which prompted one diplomat to quip to Reuters: “NPT RIP?” Thanks to the NPT's legitimacy deficit, the “Humanitarian Initiative,” which denied the value of nuclear deterrence to national and human security, swiftly gathered steam. Doubts about the trading order's legitimacy also gave rise to increasingly existential challenges. In the wealthy global North, people who perceived that giant multinational corporations had excessive influence also called for the order's radical reconstruction. Famously, over 50,000 protesters converged on Seattle in 1999 to disrupt the WTO's Third Ministerial conference. Populist nationalists such as Trump, the United Kingdom's Brexiteers, and Hungary's Viktor Orban found the political terrain increasingly fertile. Gazing mournfully at the wreckage, some of its supporters are, understandably, calling on its most ardent defenders to rebuild and shore up liberal international institutions. But this approach is no longer feasible, thanks in large measure to the successes the liberal international order produced. Despite the rise in near-shoring and “friend shoring,” despite increased protectionism and tariffs, the world's economic interdependence remains impressive by historical standards. But they have also created new challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, and forced migration, that demand international collaboration. And there are more nuclear powers arranged in less tightly integrated alliance blocs, so curbing proliferation is a more complicated task. Some kind of global order is not optional. A multilateral, cooperative, and durable international order can rise from the ashes. But not if world leaders cling to legalism, technocratic governance, and the language of universal public goods. A pragmatic order must limit itself to issues that most countries agree are significant threats to peace and prosperity. Yet the NPT review conference has failed to produce a consensus document since 2010. The 2020 NPT review conference (held in 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic) failed to produce agreement after ancillary matters derailed it. Sticking points included Russia's objections to phrasing about the war in Ukraine, contention over a proposed zone in the Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, and disputes about the Nuclear Ban Treaty. A pragmatic approach would focus more narrowly on advancing shared commitments to nuclear safety and arms limitations. With the next review conference a year away, nuclear states should seek to agree on this pragmatic agenda and to grow the circle of like-minded pragmatists. The liberal order envisioned eliminating difference: inspired by its allegedly universal values, it denied legitimacy to non-liberal political communities and sought to transform them into good liberals, whether through coercion or engagement. A more durable order must acknowledge, embrace, and even celebrate the reality of a world marked by deep differences in values. One means toward such a pluralistic end would be to encourage the strengthening of regional institutions—not as an alternative to current global institutions but as a complement. Regional bodies are less likely than their global counterparts to face an irresolvable variety of political commitments, economic circumstances, and cultural values. Historically, when thorny international problems were addressed in smaller regional blocs, this smoothed over differences and promoted regional trust; countries gained experience in negotiating difference. The political scientist Katherine Beall has shown, for instance, that Latin American countries that resisted international efforts to secure human rights proved willing to create regional organizations to enforce these norms. Going forward, regional institutions should facilitate local arrangements on issues such as trade, pollution, and migration. Regional development banks, which are closer to the ground than the World Bank, should set investment priorities, and regional security institutions such as the African Union's Peace and Security Architecture should be empowered to engage in more diplomacy and peacebuilding. Regional agreements may serve as a platform to establish the cross-regional and global deals that have, until now, been impossible to achieve. Wealthy and powerful states and blocs, however, continued to wield disproportionate influence through such legalized processes, which undermined those processes' legitimacy. In a more pragmatic and pluralistic order in which regional coalitions were empowered, smaller states could more effectively balance individual great powers through collective action. They could still vocally advocate for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. When possible, they could partner with existing rights-oriented regional institutions such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, whose efforts to call out violations of human rights may seem less self-righteous than when liberal outsiders take the lead. In an international order that acknowledges difference, however, liberal actors must recognize that a variety of morally defensible formulas exist for balancing competing rights and responsibilities. Finally, a more durable, cooperative global order would ground its legitimacy not in supposedly neutral technocratic governance but in expressly political exchanges. Inclusive, representative political bodies sometimes end up representing such a broad range of views and interests that they cannot make headway toward concrete goals: consider how few tangible results the NPT's consensus-oriented review conferences have managed to produce in recent years. To correct this, smaller, selective multilateral groupings should be convened under the NPT's aegis and seek agreement on concrete questions of proliferation, escalation, and safety. The existing nuclear powers would likely still exert significant sway at these bargaining tables, but formally bringing in specialized bodies, such as the current Nuclear Suppliers Group, would give nonnuclear weapons states and activists more influence over selective subgroups' agendas, procedures, and deliberations. Multilateral organizations must also reconnect their decision-making processes with national politics. Although international institutions should set broad goals—such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions—much of the enforcement should be left to national governments rather than supranational bureaucratic mechanisms. This was the approach taken by the Paris climate accord, which generated a useful collective financial infrastructure to support climate-related policies. With good reason, critics doubt that countries can or will effectively implement or enforce international programs, but unresponsive global governing bodies lose legitimacy and effectiveness anyway. National leaders need to persuade their citizens of the value of collective action, not hide behind distant international judges and bureaucrats. Improving the links between international order and national political legitimacy will also require all states, and especially liberal democracies, to renew their commitment to nonintervention in other countries' domestic affairs. A pragmatic and pluralistic international order need not legitimize political repression. It would not require its members to keep their mouths shut in the face of massive violations of human rights. It would, however, place clear bounds on the policies that liberals adopt in such circumstances: they should not use coercive material instruments—military or economic—to effect change or support liberal forces in other countries by covert means. Liberals must turn to more humble but still powerful instruments: persuasion and demonstration. A pluralistic, multilateral global order might not quite live up to liberal aspirations, but it would foster transnational cooperation and would be more adaptable, responsive, and resilient. By decreasing the chances of catastrophic conflict between major powers and tackling a key set of global challenges, such an order would help maintain a world in which liberal democracy could flourish.
