                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new rate limits will go into effect August 28 for subscribers to Anthropic's $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100 and $200-per-month Max plans, the company said Monday in an email to subscribers and a post on X. We're rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude Pro and Max in late August. We estimate they'll apply to less than 5% of subscribers based on current usage. Anthropic says its existing usage limits, which reset every five hours, will remain in place. Anthropic says Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates. The announcement comes just weeks after Anthropic quietly introduced rate limits for Claude Code. Anthropic's status page shows that Claude Code has experienced a partial or major outage at least seven times in the last month — perhaps because some power users seem to be running Claude Code nonstop. “Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch,” said Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham in an email to TechCrunch about the weekly rate limits. Rotherham notes that “most users won't notice a difference,” however, did not offer specifics about how much usage subscribers should now expect. The company notes that this limit will affect less than 5% of subscribers, based on their current usage patterns. Most Pro users can expect 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 within their weekly rate limits, according to Anthropic. However, Anthropic notes that usage may vary based on codebase size and other factors. Several providers of AI coding tools are revisiting the pricing strategy around their products. However, Anysphere later apologized for poorly communicating those changes, leading to some users paying more than they expected. Another AI coding tool provider, Replit, made similar pricing changes in June as well. Update 1:37 pm PT: This story was updated to include comments from an Anthropic spokesperson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Ahern said that both he and New York Governor Kathy Hochul are worried that the Trump administration's cuts to cybersecurity are putting the country at risk. We need and want the federal government to be effective,” Ahern told TechCrunch. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut cybersecurity spending across federal agencies by more than $1.2 billion, including cutting CISA's budget by $135 million, all the while earmarking $1 billion over the next four years for offensive cyber operations for overseas hacking operations. “Everybody wants a federal government that has significant capabilities to deter our adversaries that is resilient against cyberattacks and other attacks from our enemies,” Ahern told TechCrunch. While the U.S. federal government shoulders much of the responsibility for the country's cybersecurity, individual states share a significant mandate to secure their own networks, state organizations like public schools, as well as those of critical infrastructure, such as water utilities. Earlier this month, Hochul wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to ask for funding available under the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which provides state and local agencies with funds to improve security both in the real world and online. “HSGP funding is vital to securing and maintaining critical infrastructure assets (transportation hubs, power grids, water systems, communication networks),” wrote Hochul, who urged Noem to make funds available “immediately.” Last month, the governor signed new legislation that will require anyone working with a computer in a state, city, county, or district government office in the state of New York to take cybersecurity awareness training. Last week, Hochul also announced new proposed legislation to start a new grant program for water and wastewater organizations with the goal of helping them fund upgrades that they will have to come up with to comply with upcoming regulations. Ahern said he hopes to recruit some who lost their jobs because of the Trump administration. New York says you're hired,” said Ahern, referring to the government's public slogan for this hiring effort. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Much like Frankenstein's monster itself, the monster at the center of Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein is a mash-up of inspirations. There's Boris Karloff, the original and most famous Frankenstein. There's artist Bernie Wrightson, whose illustrations of the character greatly impacted del Toro. There's Mary Shelley, of course, whose novel the film is based on. It was this looseness,” Hill told Vanity Fair. “Then he has these real somber moments where he watches you really deftly, and his eyelids are low, with the long lashes like Karloff. His demeanor is innocent, but it's encompassed in a six-foot-five frame. Though this Frankenstein will look unlike others we've seen, he's described as being “kintsugi-like.” That's the art of repairing pottery with gold, and it begins to give you some idea of what to expect. “When fully exposed, the creature resembles a marble statue from antiquity that has been shattered and fused back together,” the Vanity Fair piece reads. For the performance, Elordi binge-watched all of Karloff's movies and put Wrightson's art all over his apartment (which Isaac also did in his trailer). “I turned it into this shrine to all things that I felt pertained to the creature,” Elordi told the magazine. Which he had to do very quickly because, mere weeks before production, Andrew Garfield—who was originally cast as the monster—had to drop out. It was a blow, but in Elordi, who is several inches taller than Garfield, the production found someone even more intimidating. “Andrew Garfield stepping out and Jacob coming in. Very few things I have to say, and he does it.” For many more words on Frankenstein, including hints at the plot, characters, and more, head over to Vanity Fair.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gamers in the United Kingdom have found a surprisingly simple way to bypass online age verification checks now required by law on some websites using just a video game. On July 25, he posted that he had bypassed Discord's age verification check using the photo mode in the video game Death Stranding. Sterkhov made the post just days after the U.K. began enforcing the Online Safety Act—a set of laws passed in 2023 aimed at preventing children from accessing porn or other “harmful” content related to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders. Companies that fail to comply with the new laws could face fines of up to 18 million pounds ($24.2 million) or 10% of their global revenue, whichever amount is higher. “Prioritizing clicks and engagement over children's online safety will no longer be tolerated in the U.K.,” said Ofcom executive chief Dame Melanie Dawes in a statement. “Our message to tech firms is clear – comply with age-checks and other protection measures set out in our Codes, or face the consequences of enforcement action from Ofcom.” But it turns out some of these age verification methods aren't all that hard to trick. Most of these companies rely on third-party platforms to handle age verification. These services typically give users the option to upload a government-issued photo ID or submit photos of themselves. Discord uses a platform called k-ID for age verification. Warren was also able to bypass Reddit's age check, which is handled by Persona, using the same method. However, the trick didn't work with Bluesky's system, which uses Yoti for age verification. Discord and Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. ProtonVPN reported on X that it saw an over 1,400 percent increase in sign-ups in the U.K. after the age verification requirements took effect. VPNs let people browse the web as if they were in a different location, making it easier to bypass the U.K.'s age checks. Nine states in the U.S. have also passed laws requiring parental consent or age verification for social media platforms. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Thankfully, we have researchers like the team of scientists over at Zhejiang University who are working hard to reduce this waste and make 3D printing more sustainable as a whole. The team is directed by Professor Xie Tao and Professor Zheng Ning, who led the group in developing a 3D printing resin that can be recycled over and over again. This lends to their ultimate goal of helping reduce resin waste when UV printing. There is reportedly no compromise in performance when using the recycled resin as opposed to the original, unprocessed batch. Professor Xie Tao confirmed that the resin is broken down at the molecular level and can then be reprinted. With resin printing, beams of light are used to solidify layers of liquid resin that are stored in a small vat. The resin used by most UV printers today can be recycled sometimes, but not easily—especially in the way that this team has created. It ensures makers have reliable material with the performance they need while providing a reusability factor that reduces overall cost. At the moment, no 3D printer can say they produce zero-waste, but there are tons of cool things you can print that help make the world a better place.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cylindrical tower cooler designs caused a stir at Computex. The flagship design is now available for around $55 in Korea. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Korean cases and cooling specialist Zalman Technologies has released the jet-engine inspired Zet5 CPU cooler to retail. According to Korea's Quasar Zone, this appealingly curvy cooler has been released on its home turf with a special offer. First impressions are that enthusiasts will be paying a premium for the unique design. We expect that those prices include 10% VAT for locals. We saw the Zalman Zet5 CPU cooler at Computex in May and noted that the new lineup (which included a smaller Zet4 and Zet3) was a complete revamp of the firm's dated CNPS9000 series of circular tower coolers. The flagship Zalman Zet5 stood above its brethren with five nickel-plated heatpipes and its range-topping rating, which suggested it would be capable of handling CPUs with up to 200W TDP. They all share the same design language, but Zalman prunes back fans/heatpipes for cheaper, lower TDP models. Shifting focus back to the Zalman Zet5, in particular, and Quasar Zone shares some tasty packaging and unboxing images to give a good idea of the retail experience. It had samples of both the black and white Zet5. We also enjoyed seeing the Zalman Zet5 posed on Jet Wing style presentation stands by Quasar Zone. In summary, Quasar Zone's unboxing and hands-on time seems to have been dominated by the resident photographer. Having said that, we hope Zalman Zet-series samples start to arrive in the West shortly. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The car in front is lit by its rear lights only. A woman appears and jumps up, wrapping her legs around him. The whole time, a private investigator named Stephanie A., who goes by Your Fav Investigator online, has been sending videos of the interaction to the man's wife, who she says hired her to sleuth for suspected infidelity. While the man's face is obscured and no personal information is revealed, the video of his misdoings has been “liked” by over 85,000 people on Stephanie's Instagram. Infidelity stake-out videos on Instagram and TikTok titled ‘Trust your gut … CASED CLOSED!' “I love everything” about being a PI Stephanie, 39, explains over Zoom. I really enjoy helping people find peace of mind or clarity in their situations.” She did not want her last name used due to the nature of her work. With a family history in law enforcement and a background in loss prevention, Stephanie is at the vanguard of a new wave of very online private investigators, often focused on outing cheaters, with each of them sharing the ins and outs of the PI life to massive TikTok followings in the US and beyond. It's like riding shotgun into someone else's drama,” says Stephanie. Once relegated to hidden-camera reality shows like Cheaters, dozens of prominent social media PIs have sprung up over the past few years, focusing on topics like insurance fraud, missing persons, and even high-stakes heists. But by far the most viral videos center on infidelity, with the most popular internet PIs carrying out surveillance and even background checks on men their clients have deemed suspicious. “It still shocks me how bold some people are, not just lying and cheating openly in public but sleeping over and playing house while their spouse is out of town,” says Stephanie, who has been working as a private investigator for 12 years. The boom in these investigations comes at a time when online shaming around cheating seems to have reached a fever pitch, the most recent example being former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, who was caught tightly embracing his company's chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, on the Jumbotron at a Coldplay concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 16. The couple scattered from the Jumbotron's gaze—Byron literally diving out of frame—prompting Coldplay frontman Chris Martin to quip, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.” Predictably, the footage went massively viral, resulting in both Bryon's and Cabots' resignations and Byron's wife being inundated with Facebook messages from strangers offering their sympathies. The moment has also been endlessly memed and turned into a video game, and online betting companies are offering odds on whether the ensnared couples are going to get divorced. It's easy, in what to most is an entertaining internet lark, to forget that people's very real lives are impacted by exposés such as this. And while many people believe that justice is being served in public cheating scandals, others feel that intense surveillance tools should not be deployed on strangers, particularly ones who are not public figures. Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor in media studies at Queens College, City University of New York, and a writer on internet literacy, says there's a rawness to these social media stings that appeals to the public. “We like watching true-crime content [on social media], because we can lean into a plot that isn't scripted or gate-kept by traditional media. There's no executive producer or editors; it's happening in fairly real time.” Like all good crime novels, the best stakeouts have numerous twists and turns. Lisa Allen-Stell, who runs her own agency, Pink Lady Investigations in California, recalls being hired on a two-year contract by a married man who wanted to make sure that his mistress—who was also married—wasn't in a third relationship with his married best friend. Allen-Stell got into online investigating after a “horrible” divorce and custody battle made her empathetic to the plight of women in similar circumstances. So far she has racked up 1.4 million likes on various stakeout videos and stories about her work as a PI. All of the PIs interviewed for this piece have completed the relevant training in their local jurisdiction, but certification requirements differ across states and countries—some, like Idaho, don't require any. And while PIs like Stephanie and Allen-Stell don't market themselves as influencers, they do utilize popular TikTok formats in their posts. Stephanie often posts rundowns of her meals when she's tailing suspects in restaurants or does her skin care routine in her car, noting, “Everyone seems to love it.” In her recent videos, Allen-Stell demonstrates how to sweep a hotel room for hidden cameras and talks about the HydroJug cup she's "obsessed" with, taking it on stakeouts and flights. Philip Marlowe and Jake Gittes never broadcast from the front seat of their car wearing a Yankee's hat and under-eye masks, but for Stephanie, it's her preferred stakeout attire. This unvarnished relatability has helped Stephanie and Allen-Stell blow up, with both able to make a living from their work. Stephanie charges a minimum retainer of $650 for surveillance cases and says she has built a “comfortable and growing” career, with most of her cases coming via the internet and her Instagram and TikTok pages fueling “major growth.” TikTok's Creator Rewards Program, which is open to accounts with at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in a 30-day span, even pays for views, with partnerships across both platforms adding another income stream to her work. Allen-Stell offers background checks from as little as $20, with surveillance costing clients $125 per hour in most cities and slightly more in Los Angeles and San Francisco, due to higher overheads. “Investigative work includes critical thinking, discretion, patience, and being quick on your feet,” she says. “I've found that women tend to blend in more easily during surveillance and often have a sharper eye for detail.” PI work calls for empathy and emotional intelligence, she adds, “especially since the majority of my clients are women navigating deeply personal situations. Plus, it would be cool to have an all-woman team, especially in a male-dominated industry.” Based in Queensland, Australia, Cassie Crofts, aka Venus Investigations, is also focused on safety, with a team of investigators offering women background checks on potential dates or flatmates. While she does offer in-car surveillance like Stephanie, she more often focuses on background data for definitive proof, accessing databases available to PIs. In one case, she traced a man's supermarket rewards card to a town miles from where he told his wife he would be—a town where his ex-girlfriend happened to live. She also might ask for information around shared bank accounts. “There was one case where they had access to each other's phones, and I said to check his most frequently used emojis. “The idea of going up to a middle-aged man in a suit and spilling the deepest worries about your relationship and the love of your life is a really hard thing to do, let alone to someone who doesn't feel like they're an empathetic presence. She says safety is one of the reasons these investigations resonate with women. Women are aware that there are quite a few men who think this way, and it's probably increased their fear so they want to know more about men before they meet them, to filter out that stuff and to actually meet a partner who is a decent human being and who values them as an equal.” Allen-Stell says that one of her most harrowing cases involved a 17-year-old girl hooked on heroin and being trafficked. Naturally, online audiences want to know how the stories they get so invested in turn out. Stephanie says her followers often ask, “Can we know what your client did after? But, beyond vague details, no good PI will reveal personal information about their clients; protection is paramount. When Allen-Stell and Stephanie do share videos online, they say it's always with the client's approval. Just one client of the PIs WIRED interviewed wanted to share her experience for this piece, and only briefly. “I specifically chose a woman for the job, as I felt her insight and intuition would be invaluable in a sensitive situation,” she says, adding that she would recommend Allen-Stell to anyone seeking a PI. While sleuthing comes with potential pitfalls, the subjects of these investigations can also be at risk. “Some private investigators are sharing way too much,” says Allen-Stell. “I hope they're not on surveillance showing the person's actual house. ‘Oh, she's doing surveillance, so that means this person is cheating?' I don't think it's fair to out people publicly.” In the case of Andy Byron, of Coldplay concert infamy, there are multiple articles asking “who is his wife?” and speculating about his family. As 404 Media writes, the incident is “emblematic of our ​​current private surveillance and social media hellscape,” where TikTok commenters are using face-recognition tools to identify random people online. “The internet normalizes content as it progresses, meaning anything extreme must continue to become more extreme … We're also living through a period of perceived lawlessness, and true-crime investigations and shaming seem like justice, albeit amateur, vigilante justice.” I don't want to reveal too much, but I can assure you it was nothing illegal or bad enough to deem me a 'bad person.' According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 9.5 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide attempt, as of 2023, meaning that putting a stranger's business on main can have real, and sometimes devastating, consequences. But this mentality also means if something bad happens to someone—like being caught cheating online and having your family messaged by strangers as a result—we're more likely to victim blame, because we see them as deserving it. Ironically, Fox Hamilton says that “people who have that belief in a just world are often more likely to publicly shame or jump on the bandwagon with stuff like this, because they think ‘you did a bad thing, it's your fault, and I'm not responsible for anything bad that happens here. There's also a slippery slope when we start policing people according to our own morals and assumptions. “There are so many issues going on in the world at the moment with big tech companies, and I think to some people Andy Byron represents that in a symbolic way,” says Fox Hamilton. “What started out as holding people accountable has turned into the sport of public humiliation,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It processed massive amounts of text—mechanisms for doing this powerfully and easily were part of the language—and it was even used in bioinformatics, munging and churning through genetic data. Based on one list, the companies that used Perl ranged widely: Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Deutsche Bank, Akamai, Citibank, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, Mozilla. A lot of Craigslist was programmed in Perl. Even at its peak use, the popularity of Perl was always a bit surprising. There is an amalgamated mashup nature to Perl, all in service of its motto: “There's More Than One Way to Do It.” Just as there are synonyms in English, Perl has a variety of approaches to writing the same thing. I have a distinct memory, in the early 2000s, of writing code in Perl one day, and the next day not understanding what I had written. But this clutter and baroque structure are in fact intentional and part of the broader philosophy that underlies Perl. The language's creator, Larry Wall, was trained in linguistics, and his intention was to become, along with his wife, a missionary involved in rare languages. Wall ended up taking a different path and fully embraced coding. But his deep thoughts around how languages work never left him. Wall's perspective seemed to be that an obsession with linguistic purity was overrated. There is an organic process going on here, and the final products needn't be orderly. And so, a broad—and nonjudgmental—approach to language construction is vital, whether it's a language designed to write scripts or sonnets. Perl has its “more than one way” to do things and English has its numerous styles and flexible nature, a nature that can contain everything from cooking recipes to haikus, shopping lists to Faulkner. As Wall once said: “I'm a firm believer that a language … ought to be an amoral artistic medium.” If Perl has any overarching vision or dogma, it's merely the fact that, perhaps, there shouldn't be programming dogma at all. To be clear, I was never a deep user of Perl. Its syntax and messiness overwhelmed its power for me, and when I was introduced to the well-ordered structure of Python, I ran to that language and never really looked back. This might in fact be a hint as to why the language lost its luster. Even in 1998, during its heyday, there were suggestions that Perl's bloat might lead to a desire to jump to something “cleaner.” Whatever the reason, Perl is no longer as popular as it once was. Still, I find myself returning to this strange language, and I think it's because of the humility at its core. We need humility as we recognize that our world is more complicated than we might be able to comprehend, even or especially when it comes to the large technological systems of our own making (AI, cough cough). A single comprehensive theory or model won't cut it in a world of exceptions and edge cases and raging complications. We need slow, stumbling approaches, and Perl's evolved pluralism can show us the way. If I had to choose a language that is furthest from Perl, it might be Lisp. Developed around 1960, Lisp is elegant, almost mathematical in its construction. The “Maxwell's Equations of Software,” as its definition has been described—just to give you a sense of the esotericism. For all its messiness, in other words, it's a language of the people. And that's the thing about programming languages: They are actually for people; they can't just be parsable by machines. In the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the authors make this clear: “Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Yes, the joke is that Perl is “write-only”—but you can always tell it was written by human beings. But perhaps the lesson of Perl is timeless.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hi, we're Shraman and Shreyas Kar, brothers and founders of Golpo: the most powerful AI video generator for explainer videos. Golpo turns your documents, internal workflows (PDFs, Jira boards, GitHub repos, Google Calendars, etc.) into fully produced, customizable explainer videos through our platform or API in any language. Our videos can be used for anything from creating complex workflows, product demos, technical papers, or even stories starring your baby cousin and Captain Underpants in Bengali. Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc… But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes</p>
