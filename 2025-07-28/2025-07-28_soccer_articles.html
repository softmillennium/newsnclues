                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two major tournaments in women's soccer concluded this weekend with England besting World Cup champion Spain on Sunday in a penalty kick shootout to win the UEFA Women's Euros for the second straight time and Nigeria rallying from two down to score three second-half goals and capture the country's 10th Women's Africa Cup of Nations title. While the USWNT was out of competitive action, the quality of these tournaments provided women's football fans in America and around the globe entertaining soccer at a high level. Interest in the tournament extended far beyond Europe. Golden Boot leader Esther González of Gotham FC was the top scorer at the Euros with four goals – and very nearly made it five with a wicked header in the final against England that drove just wide of frame. Jess Carter, who also plays for Gotham, was superb defensively for England in the final, playing a full 90 minutes and making several gutsy stops when Spain pushed to find the game-winner in extra time. She joined NWSL figures Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit) and Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride) on England's championship squad. In total, eight players from the NWSL played in the African Cup of Nations, including Ghana midfielder/forward Stella Nyamekye (Gotham FC) and Zambia striker Barbra Banda (Orlando Pride). As we gear up for a new season of college soccer, which kicks off next month, the NCAA was also well represented at the Euros. Four Lionesses played college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels, including England's head coach, Sarina Wiegman. The Dutch manager played alongside USWNT legends Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly at UNC under head coach Anson Dorrance. Wiegman now has an impressive three Euro titles to her name after previously managing her native Netherlands to the crown in 2017. USWNT head coach Emma Hayes shouted out both Euros finalists Sunday on Instagram, saying that “our game is here to stay.” Forward Catarina Macario showed up in Switzerland to root for her Chelsea FC teammates. USWNT legend Alex Morgan also made the trip to Europe to attend the semifinal between Spain and Germany. And World Cup champion Carli Lloyd sat behind the desk on the FOX Sports broadcast, offering analysis alongside four-time European champion Ariane Hingst, Alexi Lalas and Stu Holden. The USWNT also got a look at one upcoming opponent. 22-ranked team in FIFA did give semifinalist Italy a run for their money. The two sides played to a 1-1 draw in the group stage behind an 89th minute equalizer from Portugal's Diana Gomes. Aside from Portugal, fans of U.S. Soccer got a look at their team's best competition. As of July 28, the USWNT is ranked No. 1 in the world FIFA rankings and we're still two years away from the next major women's tournament, but countries like No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As reported by NBC Philadelphia, the Volunteer Center will be located on 901 Market Street and will serve as a training and recruitment spot for those looking to volunteer at the much-anticipated World Cup. Alongside those duties, the Volunteer Center is set to include an in-house FIFA museum, promising to provide volunteers with a deeper understanding of the World Cup's storied past and the specific goals of Philadelphia Soccer 2026. The city is gearing up to host six World Cup matches in the summer of 2026 and is expected to quickly recruit approximately 3,000 volunteers to effectively manage the incoming wave of soccer enthusiasts and logistical demands. This section of the city, known for its vacancies and dilapidated buildings, could see a much-needed injection of energy and reinvestment as the World Cup draws nearer. Michelle Singer, co-chair of Philadelphia Soccer 2026, expressed her satisfaction with the location, stating, "The site is easily accessible — volunteers can walk, take public transit or drive — and it is located just blocks away from the country's most historical sites and the city's economic center," in a statement reported by CBS Philadelphia. Mayor Cherelle Parker highlighted the center's significance for Philadelphia, saying, "The center will not only help power critical volunteer efforts supporting FIFA World Cup 26™ but also generate significant economic activity for our local businesses, restaurants, and hotels," as noted by CBS Philadelphia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Atlanta United Unified Team presented by Gallagher has traveled to Houston, Texas to participate in the Genuine World Cup, an international competition with teams from over 30 countries, that raises awareness for the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities and autism. In 2017, Spanish sports club Gimnàstic de Tarragona, organized the Champions Genuine, an international soccer tournament for people with intellectual disabilities. The inaugural Genuine World Cup 2024 (GWC) was held on August 3, 2024 in Houston, Texas, raising awareness for the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities and autism. GWC offers an opportunity to experience the values of ‘genuine soccer' through a 12-team tournament featuring athletes with intellectual or neurological differences. You can follow the competition on Atlanta United's Digital platforms. Europe has the majority of participants, including soccer powerhouses FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayer Leverkusen, AS Roma and Atlanta United's first opponent in the tournament, Ajax. There are also a few national representatives, such as a team from the Mexican Federation and the Puerto Rican Federation. See the list below for all participating teams: Atlanta United Unified will play their first match of the competition vs Dutch powehouse Ajax on Tuesday, July 29 (time TBD). Depending on the result of that match, we will know who Atlanta's next opponent is. Here are a few more things to know about the Atlanta United Unified Team: The Unified program is a league-wide initiative that began in 2013 as a part of MLS Works, Major League Soccer's community outreach program, in partnership with Special Olympics North America (SONA). Atlanta United's founding president Darren Eales and current Director of Community Engagement Marissa Ahrens were both passionate about Atlanta having a Unified Team and made it a priority for the new club. That first year, there were 14 members and the team played two matches, one home and one away against Orlando City SC. Atlanta United remains undefeated over the last two seasons and in 2025 has one win, two draws and one more home match pending August 24 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium vs Toronto FC to close out the Unified season. The Unified team includes a combination of individuals with intellectual disabilities (Special Olympics athletes) and individuals without intellectual disabilities (Unified partners) as members of one team. This year, the team consists of eight athletes and 10 partners. For matches, the Unified team is outfitted in authentic uniforms provided by adidas. All the players received personalized travel bags and training gear. For the Genuine World Cup, only Special Olympics athletes are elegible to play.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus star Tim Weah's agent has lashed out at the Serie A giants' handling of his ongoing transfer saga, going so far as to accuse one of the people involved of “disrespect” towards the U.S. international. Since leaving Lille in 2023 for just over €10 million, Weah has struggled to find his feet at the Old Lady, appearing primarily as a substitute throughout his two seasons in Italy, scoring just seven goals in 78 games. Now with three years remaining on his contract and a new head coach in place in Igor Tudor, Juventus is attempting to move Weah on. A move was proposed in June that would have seen the 25-year-old swap Serie A for the Premier League, with him and now-ex-teammate Samuel Mbangula moving to Nottingham Forest for $25.7 million Weah turned the move down with his focus being a return to Ligue 1, while Mbangula was eventually sold to Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. Subsequently, Weah has been heavily linked with a transfer to Marseille, but it appears the teams have hit an impasse, with the French side not willing to move from its $17.6 million offer, while Juventus is seeking $23.5 million, per The Athletic. In response to the frustrating situation for his client, Weah's agent Badou Sambague has said in a statement, “The sporting department is managed by three persons. Two have class, and another is still searching himself [sic]. “Two are looking for solutions, and one is creating problems. Tim Weah, is always professional, was left out during the [FIFA Club] World Cup. “Today, as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us. “These are old-fashioned methods that won't sit well with me. Class can't be bought for a manager, that's for sure, but it has always been part of the history of Juventus. The Club World Cup, which was held in the U.S. and ultimately won by Chelsea, saw Weah make just one appearance for Juventus, playing 45 minutes in a 5-0 win against Al-Ain in their group opener. To date, since Pochettino took charge of the USMNT in September, Weah has made just three appearances, starting all three.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team winger Tim Weah's agent has come out and blasted Juventus for holding up a summer transfer to Olympique Marseille. Weah has been linked with a move to Marseille this summer after turning down a proposed deal to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Lille player is thought to be prioritizing a return to France ahead of a pivotal season preparing to fight for a starting role in Mauricio Pochettino's side at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Badou Sambague, Weah's agent, released a statement of frustration amid stalling transfer talks. “Juve is a fantastic club,” he told The Athletic. “The sporting department is managed by three persons. Two have class, and another is still searching himself [sic]. Two are looking for solutions, and one is creating problems. “Tim Weah, is always professional, was left out during the [Club] World Cup. Today, as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us. “These are old-fashioned methods that won't sit well with me. Class can't be bought for a manager, that's for sure, but it has always been part of the history of Juventus. The player's side believes an offer was previously accepted by Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, but the club are now thought to be pushing for a €20 million ($23.5 million) figure. Weah has three years left on his Juventus contract and seemingly is upset by a missed opportunity to represent his country and impress Pochettino in the Gold Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunderland are reportedly interested in signing Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Garcia. A fee of £13m has been mooted for the 21-year-old and his capture would be a stunning one if the Black Cats can pull it off. Potential signings were a hot topic after Sunderland's 3-0 defeat to Hearts and ahead of tonight's latest pre-season clash against Hull City. Head coach Regis Le Bris spoke to the media and was asked for the latest on whether further incomings are imminent following rumours of a move to sign Granit Xhaka. He told the press: “All I can say right now is that we are trying our best to improve the team. We will have to see what happens. "If you look at the Hearts game, then it looks as though we are far away from where we need to be. But at the same time, it is always a work in progress. “Maybe you get confidence against a certain type of team or a certain style of play, but then later, if you don't play with the right level of intensity, you can be surprised, and I think the game against Hearts was part of that process. “Then, when it comes to where the squad is at, we will see. It is still unpredictable, so we always have to manage the players we have and be confident with them. A new centre-forward to rival Eliezer Mayenda and Wilson Isidor appears to be on the to-do list, with Garcia of interest. According to reports in Spain, Sunderland have now submitted an offer to sign Garcia from Real Madrid worth an initial £13m. He is capable of playing anywhere across the front three and has broken through into Madrid's first team after starring for Real Castilla. Please note that your preferences are browser specific.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A few weeks back, the FIFA Club World Cup concluded with Chelsea FC defeating Paris Saint-German. Flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Donald Trump, greeted by a chorus of boos from fans at MetLife Stadium, took to the field during the trophy ceremony, As Edge of Sports' Dave Zirin reported, Infantino, “has been using the tournament to continue toadying up to Donald Trump, in advance of the North American–hosted World Cup, and to representatives of another future World Cup host, Saudi Arabia” (https://www.edgeofsports.com/column/fifa-is-abusing-its-players-to-keep-authoritarians-happy/index.html). As FIFA expands its global footprint with a larger, more lucrative 2026 tournament in North America, the organization's willingness to placate powerful leaders is raising questions about who really benefits. Kansas City, Missouri will be hosting six matches at Arrowhead Stadium. The following commentary World Cup is by Randy Gould, editor and chief reporter for the Kansas City-based Oread Daily email newsletter. “The World Cup is coming to Kansas City next year. We do not have any domed stadiums here, so if we are in the middle of summer heat in this new hot era, maybe the games could be rescheduled for like 3 AM! “I don't know if people are noticing that sporting events are more and more often being canceled due to extreme heat. Hmm, what should we take from that in regard to the soccer World Cup? “We should take from that exactly what Dave Zirin's article headlined ‘FIFA Is Abusing Its Players to Keep Authoritarians Happy' makes clear. They just do not care, despite the concerns raised by many players and others.” Back in 2023, the union noted that the Club World Cup schedule ‘demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives. Gould: “Infantino does care about cozying up to the rich and powerful. In its relentless drive to court petro-tyrants and authoritarian strongmen, FIFA has once more revealed itself as not merely complicit in oppression — but actively enabling it. Zirin's piece exposes how football's global governing body has sacrificed player safety, worker rights, and even basic human dignity on the altar of authoritarian appeasement and corporate greed. Zirin points out that “The tournament total prize money pool has $1 billion in it, with $525 million doled out to clubs simply for participating and another $475 million allocated based on results. Manchester City, owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi United Group, reportedly walked off with nearly $52 million just for reaching the final 16 of the tournament. Gould: “Whether it's the almost slave like conditions for stadium workers in Qatar, the gagging of political expression, or the weaponization of tournaments by regimes like Saudi Arabia,  Erdoğan's Turkey, and Trump's USA, FIFA continues to function as a de facto propaganda ministry for the world's most repressive governments. While players are expected to shut up and entertain, their labor—and their bodies—is commoditized in service of soft power and profit, not solidarity or sport. It's another chapter in the global assault on democracy, workers, and dissent — another instance of top-down structures silencing bottom-up voices. The same systems that crush unions, bulldoze Indigenous land, and surveil dissidents in the USA and numerous other States are draped in FIFA banners and presented to us as celebration.</p>

Miami-Dade County Commissioner Kionne McGhee on Friday said that he will “ask for a special meeting to undo past funding votes to cover local expenses for the seven soccer matches scheduled for Hard Rock Stadium next summer” in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, according to Douglas Hanks of the MIAMI HERALD. The county currently “plans to spend” $46M on subsidies for the event. McGhee represents a suburban district in South Miami-Dade that has “some of the county's highest concentrations of poverty.” He said, “We are obligated as elected officials to get this money back and give it to the nonprofits.” Hanks noted the approved $46M for the World Cup overlaps with what is “likely to be the leanest budget year for the county since the aftermath of the 2008 housing crash.” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has proposed a 2026 budget “that slashes” about $40M in “funding for county charity grants.” The $46M is made up of $21M in “planned cash payments for the games” and $25M in “free police, paramedic services and other county staff.” To secure a special meeting revisiting a “politically fraught issue that's already gone through a commission vote,” McGhee needs a “signed request from at least six other commissioners on the 13-member board.” FIFA World Cup 2026 Miami Host Committee Chair Rodney Barreto said, “I know tough decisions have to be made. I think the county can make them and still fully support FIFA World Cup 2026 in Miami-Dade” (MIAMI HERALD, 7/25).</p>

Kansas City shows up for women's sports, and we know our region and CPKC Stadium will deliver an unforgettable atmosphere on an iconic night.” Opened in 2024 as the home of the Kansas City Current, CPKC Stadium has become a global symbol of innovation and investment in women's sports. “The investment that Angie and Chris Long have made in their club and this venue is massively impressive, important for the future of the women's game in the USA and deserves to be rewarded with a match like this,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes. CPKC Stadium is a smaller venue than we usually play in, but in this instance, it's important to bring the National Team there.” With a capacity of 11,500, CPKC Stadium has sold out every KC Current regular season home match in the National Women's Soccer League.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Serie A forward and Italian World Cup winner Luca Toni has claimed Juventus “need to hit the gas if they want to catch up and fight for the title”, with Liverpool's Federico Chiesa, Newcastle United's Sandro Tonali and Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund names mentioned as ideal reinforcements for the Bianconeri. He's out of the project at Liverpool and I would bet on his hunger for redemption.” Juventus are also in the market for a new striker, with Serbian forward Dusan Vlahovic rumoured to be leaving the club this summer. The Bianconeri have already added Canadian attacker Jonathan David to their squad, of whom Toni was highly complimentary: “Numbers are everything for a striker and David's are excellent. I'm curious to see if he can maintain that rhythm in Italy, where there is less space and stronger defences. Keeping the Turkish talent feels like a huge signing for Juve, especially these days when it is tough for anyone to resist Premier League offers.” Toni described the Frenchman as “a European level striker who already knows Tudor, Juventus and Serie A – it makes sense to go after him again.” During his time at Atalanta, before the move to Manchester United, he gave me really good vibes. I'd go off that, not the struggles he has had in England.” Hojlund had a disappointing 2024-25 campaign with the Red Devils, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances. The Danish forward has been linked with Milan, Inter and Napoli this summer but no concrete moves have been made for the 22-year-old.</p>
