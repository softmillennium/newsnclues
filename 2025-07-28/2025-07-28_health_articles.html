                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than 11,000 additional women opted for the most effective form of birth control-long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)-within just 15 months of B.C. New research from the University of British Columbia and collaborators shows a 49-per-cent jump in LARC dispensations after the province introduced universal, no-cost coverage in April 2023. That's a seismic shift in how reproductive-aged women are managing their reproductive choice, the researchers say. The study tracked nearly 860,000 women aged 15–49 and found that cost had been a major barrier to accessing the most effective methods like intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, which can cost up to $450 out of pocket. The policy was not promoted heavily through advertisements and such-just standard government announcements with a simple promise: You won't pay a cent. And that was enough to tip the scales for thousands of women who had been priced out of the most effective options. LARC methods are 10 times more effective than the birth control pill or condoms. has found a straightforward way to prevent unintended pregnancy and promote reproductive autonomy. According to lead author Dr. Laura Schummers, assistant professor in UBC's faculty of pharmaceutical sciences, B.C.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apart from carrying the information to encode proteins in, RNA molecules can adopt intricate 2D and 3D structures. Specifically, the same RNA molecule can switch between ON and OFF structures, modulating the ability of ribosomes to bind to the RNA and translate it into proteins. A new study, led by University of Groningen molecular biologist Danny Incarnato and authored by postdoctoral researcher Dr Ivana Borovska, identifies hundreds of such regulatory RNA switches in E.coli bacteria and human cells. It was published in Nature Biotechnology on 25 July. Several years ago, Incarnato developed a method to map the alternative shapes adopted by RNA molecules in living cells. Using this method, he identified regions of RNA capable of shapeshifting between two different structures, each with its own effect. Incarnato: 'The ability of RNA to switch between alternative structures usually implies some sort of regulation, similar to an ON-OFF switch.' Incarnato's team has now used this method to study the complexity of RNA structures in living cells. Moreover, they developed a new tool that leverages evolutionary information to identify functional RNA structural switches with high accuracy. They used the tool to uncover hundreds of them. For example, small molecules could be designed to modulate these switches, which could ultimately lead to new treatments for diseases. The current research, which has taken more than three years to complete, builds on some six years of fundamental research into the detection of 2D RNA shapes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients who develop alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) after major surgery face significantly higher risks of complications, longer hospital stays, and increased health care costs, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons (JACS). Using the National Inpatient Sample (2016–2019), researchers analyzed data from 3 million adults who underwent major operations, including colectomy, cardiac surgery, and liver resection. DT is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can include shaking, confusion, and hallucinations. AWS is a preventable complication, yet it's often overlooked in surgical planning. Timothy M. Pawlik, MD, PhD, MPH, FACS, lead author, surgeon-in-chief at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center The study highlights actionable strategies to improve outcomes: "A patient recovering from major surgery shouldn't also battle withdrawal," said Dr. Pawlik, recalling a case where AWS led to aspiration pneumonia post-surgery. "We can change this by addressing alcohol use before surgery and ensuring safer recovery environments." Limtations: The study relied on administrative data, potentially underestimating AWS incidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have discovered a way to make the immune system's T cells significantly more effective at fighting cancer. By blocking a protein called Ant2, they were able to reprogram how these cells consume and generate energy—essentially rewiring their internal power supply. This shift makes T cells more active, resilient, and better at attacking tumors. A new study may pave the way for a new generation of cancer therapies—by training the body's own immune system to work smarter and hit harder. Led by PhD student Omri Yosef and Prof. Michael Berger from the Faculty of Medicine at Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Magdalena Huber of Philipps University of Marburg and Prof. Eyal Gottlieb of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the international team discovered that fine-tuning immune cells metabolism dramatically improves their ability to destroy cancer. At the heart of the research is a powerful insight: when T cells—key players in the immune system—are forced to rewire how they convert energy, they become significantly more effective at identifying and attacking tumors. "By disabling Ant2, we triggered a complete shift in how T cells produce and use energy," explains Prof. Berger. "This reprogramming made them significantly better at recognizing and killing cancer cells." In simpler terms, blocking this protein forces the immune cells to adapt their metabolism, turning them into stronger, faster, and more aggressive cancer fighters. By deliberately disrupting a specific energy pathway inside T cells, the team essentially rewired the cells' engines, creating a state of heightened readiness and potency. The altered T cells exhibited greater stamina, faster replication, and sharper targeting of cancerous threats. Perhaps most importantly, the researchers showed that this metabolic rewiring can be triggered not only through genetic modifications but also with drugs—opening the door for potential clinical applications. This discovery is part of a growing movement in cancer immunotherapy that focuses not only on guiding the immune system but upgrading its inner machinery. While more studies and clinical trials are needed, the implications of this breakthrough are promising: new treatments that harness the body's own defenses, fine-tuned for peak performance. "This work highlights how deeply interconnected metabolism and immunity truly are," says Prof. Berger. "By learning how to control the power source of our immune cells, we may be able to unlock therapies that are both more natural and more effective." Metabolic reprogramming driven by Ant2 deficiency augments T Cell function and anti-tumor immunity in mice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major global health concern, affecting approximately 1.5 billion people. There is currently no treatment for CLD other than liver transplantation. Vitamin D is commonly consumed for enhanced bone health. Prof. Hyo-Jung Kwon from the College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National University in Daejeon, Republic of Korea, and his colleagues have studied the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications of Vitamin D in liver disease. Our data reveal that vitamin D supplementation ameliorates ductular reaction and reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis largely through TXNIP," comments Prof. Kwon. Their study was published online on 13 May 2025, in Nature Communications. While initially protective, excessive or prolonged ductular reaction contributes to inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, researchers observed that lower plasma levels of vitamin D were associated with more severe ductular reaction in patients with CLD. Vitamin D upregulates the expression of TXNIP (Thioredoxin-interacting protein). This was confirmed in a mouse study where Txnip deletion in cholangiocytes promoted ductular reaction and even exacerbated liver inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analysis revealed the Vitamin D/TXNIP molecular axis. Research that supports early diagnosis and better treatment for CLD is not only warranted but essential. "Our preclinical data reveal a new mechanism by which vitamin D supplementation ameliorates CLDs and support the idea that the vitamin D/TXNIP axis could be a promising therapeutic target in clinically addressing the ductular reaction and CLDs," comments Prof. Kwon. Further research is needed to validate the clinical application of vitamin D supplementation as a standard supportive therapy for patients with chronic liver disease. Ultimately, this work could improve outcomes for millions worldwide by offering safer and more personalized liver disease therapies. Vitamin D supplementation ameliorates ductular reaction, liver inflammation and fibrosis in mice by upregulating TXNIP in ductular cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colorectal cancer is among the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide, with liver metastases occurring in nearly one-third of patients and accounting for a major share of cancer-related deaths. Traditional research has primarily focused on single genes or pathways, limiting our understanding of the metastatic process and hampering therapeutic progress. The emergence of high-throughput "omics" technologies now allows researchers to probe cancer's complexity at multiple molecular levels. By analyzing DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, and microbes, scientists can capture a multidimensional view of tumor evolution and host interaction. Owing to these unresolved clinical challenges, an integrated multi-omics perspective is urgently needed to guide future discoveries in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). The article explores how six omics disciplines—genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics—contribute unique but complementary insights into the mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of CRLM. This cross-disciplinary overview not only catalogs scientific advances but also advocates for a unified omics approach to tackle one of colorectal cancer (CRC)'s deadliest outcomes. The review highlights how each omics layer uncovers distinct dimensions of CRLM. Genomic studies reveal key mutations like TP53, KRAS, and SMAD4, and show that metastatic lesions harbor more genetic instability than primary tumors. Epigenomic analyses identify DNA methylation changes and histone modifications—such as hypermethylated TPEF or altered H3K27me3—that could serve as early indicators or drug targets. Proteomic data show structural protein shifts, such as increased ECM proteins and EMT regulators like THBS1, which facilitate invasion. Metabolomic findings reveal how altered pathways, including cholesterol or succinate metabolism, may foster immune exhaustion and resistance. Meanwhile, microbiomics links species like Fusobacterium nucleatum to immunosuppressive microenvironments and therapy response. Crucially, integrated multi-omics studies identify patterns missed by individual layers—for instance, how SMAD4 mutations activate STAT3 signaling to blunt chemotherapy efficacy. Together, these findings present a rich, multidimensional framework for decoding CRLM. Dissecting cancer through a single lens is no longer enough. By integrating data across the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and beyond, we gain a panoramic view of how colorectal cancer evolves and spreads. This multi-omics synergy opens up new avenues for discovering actionable biomarkers, designing personalized treatments, and ultimately improving survival for patients facing liver metastasis." Clinicians could one day tailor treatment plans using personalized omics profiles, while non-invasive liquid biopsies may track disease progression through cfRNA or methylation markers. As these methods mature, they promise to reshape how colorectal liver metastasis is detected, treated, and prevented—moving precision medicine from concept to clinic.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Columbia Engineering have established a framework for the design of bioactive injectable hydrogels formulated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Published today in Matter, Santiago Correa, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering, and his collaborators describe an injectable hydrogel platform that uses EVs from milk to address longstanding barriers in the development of biomaterials for regenerative medicine. EVs are particles naturally secreted by cells and carry hundreds of biological signals, like proteins and genetic material, enabling sophisticated cellular communication that synthetic materials cannot easily replicate. In this study, Correa and colleagues designed a hydrogel system where EVs play a dual role: they act as bioactive cargo but also serve as essential structural building blocks, by crosslinking biocompatible polymers to form an injectable material. Using an unconventional approach that leveraged milk EVs from yogurt, the team was able to overcome yield constraints that hinder the development of EV-based biomaterials. "This project started as a basic question about how to build EV-based hydrogels. Yogurt EVs gave us a practical tool for that, but they turned out to be more than a model," said Correa who led the study with Artemis Margaronis, an NSF graduate research fellow in the Correa lab. "We found that they have inherent regenerative potential, which opens the door to new, accessible therapeutic materials." He is also a member of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center and collaborated on this project with Kam Leong, a fellow Columbia Engineering faculty member. The study was further strengthened through international collaboration with researchers from the University of Padova, including Elisa Cimetta (Department of Industrial Engineering) and graduate student Caterina Piunti. By combining Padova team's expertise in agricultural EV sourcing with the Correa lab's experience in nanomaterials and polymer-based hydrogels, the team demonstrated the power of cross-disciplinary, global partnerships in advancing biomaterials innovation. By using yogurt-derived EVs, the team defined a design space for generating hydrogels that incorporate EVs as both structural and biological elements. They further validated the approach using EVs derived from mammalian cells and bacteria, demonstrating that the platform is modular and compatible with diverse vesicle sources. This could open the door to advanced applications in wound healing and regenerative medicine, where current treatments often fall short in promoting long-term tissue repair. Because the hydrogel is injectable, it can also be delivered locally to damaged tissue. Early experiments show that yogurt EV hydrogels are biocompatible and drive potent angiogenic activity within one week in immunocompetent mice, demonstrating that agricultural EVs not only enable fundamental biomaterials research but also hold therapeutic potential as a next-generation biotechnology. In mice, the material showed no signs of adverse reaction and instead promoted the formation of new blood vessels, a key step in effective tissue regeneration. Correa's team also observed that the hydrogel creates a unique immune environment enriched in anti-inflammatory cell types, which may contribute to the observed tissue repair processes. The team is now exploring how this immune response could help guide tissue regeneration. Being able to design a material that closely mimics the body's natural environment while also speed up the healing process opens a new world of possibilities for regenerative medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experiencing physical abuse in childhood was linked to a threefold increase in the likelihood of lifetime depression, while exposure to sexual abuse or parental domestic violence more than doubled the risk. "Our findings shine a light on how trauma in the earliest years can echo through decades, shaping patterns of mental health and well-being," says the first author, Megha Goel, a doctoral student at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging (ILCA). The researchers also found that a strong sense of purpose matters: Individuals who rarely felt life had meaning were more likely to suffer from depression. This research reinforces what many people intuitively know-when we feel disconnected from purpose, our mental health suffers. Physical health was another important correlate of lifetime depression. People with three or more chronic physical health conditions had 5 times the prevalence of lifetime depression compared to their peers without any chronic conditions. "The mind and body are deeply connected-especially as we age. These findings make the case for more holistic healthcare for older populations," says senior author Esme Fuller-Thomson, Director of University of Toronto's ILCA and a professor in the FIFSW and the Department of Family & Community Medicine. This was surprising, as the older group had a longer lifespan during which depression could have developed. Consistent with previous studies, women had much higher prevalence of lifetime depression than their male peers (11.6% vs 6.6%). The finding that one in 11 older adults has a lifetime history of depression underlines the importance of ensuring that individuals experiencing depression at any age receive timely and effective interventions. Although the study was not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention to address depression, "many previous studies indicate that a particularly promising intervention for depression is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)," said Dr. Fuller-Thomson. As was outlined in the article, CBT is a talk-based, goal-oriented therapy typically delivered over 8-12 one-hour weekly sessions. "CBT has demonstrated efficacy across age groups, equipping individuals with practical skills that extend beyond therapy and fostering lifelong coping strategies. Digital delivery of CBT via the internet or telephone can help reach underserved older communities by reducing transportation barriers and addressing mobility limitations and reducing costs," highlighted Fuller-Thomson. The study was based on a nationally representative sample of Canadians aged 55 and older who participated in the 2022 Canadian Mental Health Access to Care Survey. "Our research shows that the roots of depression in later life are complex and deeply interconnected," says Goel. "Early life experiences, ongoing physical health challenges, and even whether someone feels a sense of meaning in their day-to-day life all play a role. These findings underscore the importance of a holistic, lifelong approach to mental health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A healthy diet can slow down the accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults, while inflammatory diets accelerate it. This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Aging. Researchers have investigated how four different diets affect the accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults. Three of the diets studied were healthy and focused on the intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats and reduced intake of sweets, red meat, processed meat and butter/margarine. The researchers discovered that those who followed the healthy diets had a slower development of chronic diseases. Those who followed the pro-inflammatory diet, on the other hand, increased their risk of chronic diseases. Our results show how important diet is in influencing the development of multimorbidity in aging populations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian researchers have discovered a promising new strategy to suppress the growth of aggressive and hard-to-treat cancers by targeting a specialized molecular process known as 'minor splicing'. Published in EMBO Reports, the study shows that blocking minor splicing can markedly slow tumor growth in liver, lung and stomach cancers, while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed. The research in animal models and human cells, from Australian medical research institute WEHI, demonstrates the potential of this strategy to target cancers driven by mutations in common cancer-causing genes. Splicing is how cells turn long strands of RNA into shorter pieces called messenger RNA, which provide the template for the production of proteins. While major splicing carries out 99.5% of this work, minor splicing is an indispensable process for the remaining 0.05% of genes, affecting about 700 of the 20,000 genes in the human genome. The new research reveals that blocking minor splicing causes the accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells and activates a key tumor suppressor pathway that leads to cell death. Although it affects only a small sub-set of genes, minor splicing is crucial for the correct expression of genes that drive cell growth and division – making it a potential Achilles' heel for cancer cells. Importantly, many of these genes are commonly hijacked by cancers driven by KRAS mutations, which are among the most frequent genetic changes found in solid tumors. WEHI laboratory head Professor Joan Heath said scientists have long known that KRAS is central to many aggressive cancers but have struggled to turn that knowledge into broadly effective treatments. KRAS mutations come in a variety of flavours, making them extremely hard to treat, so even with decades of scientific effort there has been only limited progress so far. Instead of trying to target specific mutations that may only apply to a subset of patients, we're disrupting a fundamental process that these fast-growing cancers rely on. Using zebrafish and mouse models, as well as human lung cancer cells, the WEHI-led research is the first to demonstrate the impact of inhibiting minor splicing in in vivo models of solid tumors. "Just by halving the amount of this protein, we were able to significantly reduce tumor burden," said Dr Karen Doggett, first author of the study. "That's a striking result, especially given how resilient these cancers usually are." This well-known pathway is frequently mutated or disabled in many cancers, allowing these cells to grow unchecked. "Blocking minor splicing leads to DNA damage and activates this critical defensive response, which means cancers with a functional p53 pathway are likely to be especially vulnerable to this strategy," Dr Doggett said. "This opens the door to treatments that could be both more effective and less toxic, offering hope for patients with aggressive cancers that currently have limited options." To search for compounds that might inhibit minor splicing, the research team turned to the National Drug Discovery Centre headquartered at WEHI, with a screen of over 270,000 drug-like molecules identifying several promising hits. "We've validated minor splicing as a compelling therapeutic target – now the challenge is to develop a drug compound that can safely and effectively inhibit it," Prof Heath said. The research draws on WEHI's deep expertise in gene discovery and cancer biology, showcasing the power of collaboration across multiple labs and technologies. This diversity in our approach gives us confidence that our strategy could be relevant across many forms of cancer, and not just in a narrow set of conditions."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fortina Hernández is called "the one who knows it all." For more than two decades, the community health worker has supported hundreds of families throughout southeast Los Angeles by helping them sign up for food assistance, sharing information about affordable health coverage, and managing medications for their chronic illnesses. But she makes only around $20 an hour from a community health organization and must hold down a second job to make ends meet. "They pay us very little and expect too much," she said in Spanish. California looked to professionalize thousands of community health workers such as Hernández to improve the health of immigrant populations, particularly Hispanic residents, who often experience higher rates of chronic diseases, are more likely to be uninsured, and face more cultural and linguistic barriers when trying to access services. The state hewed closely to a series of expert recommendations put out in 2019 to standardize training and certification, integrate these workers into the health care workforce, and provide fair wages, including reimbursements through Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid health insurance program, to compensate for work that traditionally has been done on a volunteer basis or for low pay. The state has eliminated a certification program and rolled back nearly all funding to train and expand this workforce even though it set a goal of 25,000 workers by this year. Although Medi-Cal began covering their services, participating health plans set uneven billing requirements, making it difficult for workers to get reimbursed. And the state didn't follow through on a planned pay raise. With federal funding cuts just passed and President Donald Trump targeting immigrants for deportation — even sharing personal Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security — advocates fear California is abandoning its health equity initiative for immigrants, people of color, and people with low incomes when they say that effort is needed most. "We're in a very dire situation right now," said Cary Sanders, senior policy director for the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, a statewide health equity advocacy group. Gavin Newsom, Elana Ross, said "the state has taken difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability" and that the administration continues to have a dialogue with community health workers. There are more than 60,000 community health workers nationwide, including roughly 9,200 in California, and this workforce is projected to grow 13% over the next decade, three times as fast as for all occupations, according to 2024 data from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. But experts say these numbers are an undercount given the various titles community health workers hold and that many work outside of health care and governmental institutions. These workers, often known as promotores, tend to be women who work in clinics, hospitals, public health departments, and local nonprofits, places where they are trusted and have a grasp of their community's most pressing health needs. They can make people feel safe when reporting domestic violence and other abuses. They also connect people to housing and food assistance. “The community health worker is not sitting at a desk,” Hernández said. The agency sought to standardize training and certification, but some community groups feared that would create barriers to entry by not giving enough credit for lived experiences and cultural competency. But just as the agency offered more flexibility and allowed community-based training, the state slashed $250 million in funding last year due to budget constraints. Spokesperson Andrew DiLuccia said the agency is now considering a program to accredit community organizations rather than individual workers and plans to spend its remaining $12 million on technical assistance, workforce development, and salaries for those working with immigrant communities. Some community health advocates say California's missing an opportunity to carve a career path for this workforce. Lourdes Bernis, a dentist from Ecuador, is a model for how community health workers could be integrated into the health care system. She began as a volunteer promotora more than a decade ago and in 2019 received free training from Los Angeles County, allowing her to move into a full-time job with benefits for the county's Department of Mental Health to help Spanish-speaking women manage depression and anxiety as they recover from drug use. Bernis now plans to become a peer-to-peer support specialist inside hospitals and clinics. To pay community health workers, Medi-Cal began covering their services in July 2022, but California suspended a planned pay increase for them after voters approved Proposition 35, which hiked the pay of physicians, hospitals, community clinics, and other providers instead. Since then, the state has yet to establish a uniform system for how health plans should contract with organizations that employ community health workers. "We have to jump through hoops," said Maria Lemus, executive director at Visión y Compromiso, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit representing community health workers. "It just causes havoc, because each plan could have different requirements." Lemus said it took the organization nearly six months to establish payment with one health plan. And though Medi-Cal reimbursements are tied to individual tasks, ranging from $9.46 to $27.54 for 30 minutes of work, advocates say they aren't fully compensated for the time they spend building trust and following up with patients. Advocates say these workers should earn at least $30 a visit, with benefits, but many earn about $21 an hour, often without benefits. Advocates say they're surprised by how infrequently these services are used in a program with 15 million Californians. A proposal to assess whether Medi-Cal managed care plans are doing enough outreach and education to enrollees about community health services died this year. With health funding cuts from the Trump administration and passage of the GOP's tax and spending legislation, advocates fear there will be even less funding and support for community health worker positions, shrinking a workforce tackling health disparities. Already, Fresno County's Department of Public Health said it has cut its community health workers by more than half, from 49 positions to 20. As the Trump administration continues immigration raids, which appear to have targeted at least one health clinic in the state, advocates and policy researchers say community health workers could act as intermediaries for immigrant patients afraid to seek medical care in hospitals and clinics. Without a state certification program, no raises, and dwindling training funds, the path to professionalizing community health workers is unclear, leaving workers feeling left behind.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump rode to reelection last fall on voter concerns about prices. But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills. Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident. At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in. The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees. And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports. That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates. "For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope," said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration's health care policies will affect Americans' medical bills. But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans' financial security. "These changes will hit our communities hard," said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty. For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "People will not seek out the treatment they need," she said. Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to "make America affordable again" and "expand access to new Affordable Healthcare." And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt. Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block. Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C. Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers' credit scores in states that implemented the expansion. "We've seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people's financial well-being," Caswell said. Trump's tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don't renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces. This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills. Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn't pay their medical bills. The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Grief after the loss of a loved one is a natural response – an inevitable part of living and loving. But in a minority of the bereaved, grief is so overwhelming that it can lead to physical and mental illnes, even if they don't necessarily qualify for a diagnosis with the mental health condition 'prolonged grief disorder'. For example, studies have shown that people who recently lost a loved one use healthcare services more often, and have an increased mortality rate, over the short term. Now, researchers from Denmark have shown that bereaved people with persistent high levels of intense grief used more healthcare services and were more likely to die within 10 years. "This is the first study to investigate the long-term use of healthcare and patterns of mortality over a decade after bereavement in a large-scale cohort." Dr Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, Study Corresponding Author and Postdoctoral Researcher, Research Unit for General Practice, Aarhus University Starting in 2012, Nielsen and colleagues followed a cohort of 1,735 bereaved women and men living in Denmark with a mean age of 62 years on enrollment. Among them, 66% had recently lost their partner, 27% a parent, and 7% another kind of loved relation. Through the national register of drug prescriptions, the researchers knew which patients had recently been prescribed treatment for a terminal condition. Previously, Nielsen et al. had identified five common 'trajectories' among this cohort, based on changes in the intensity of grief symptoms over the first three years after losing a loved one. They measured this with the tried-and-tested 'Prolonged Grief-13' (PG-13) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms through 13 questions. People on the 'low' trajectory (38%) displayed persistently low levels of grief symptoms, while 6% followed a 'high' trajectory with persistently elevated levels. To do so, Nielsen et al. used data from the Danish National Health Service Register to assess how often each participant received 'talk therapy' from a GP or specialist, or were prescribed any psychotropic medication. The results showed that for participants on the 'high' trajectory, the hazard rate (ie, instantaneous event rate) of dying within 10 years was 88% higher than for participants on a 'low' trajectory. They also showed that participants on the 'high' trajectory were most likely to receive additional health care services beyond three years after bereavement. For example, these had 186% higher odds of receiving talk therapy or other mental health services, 463% higher odds of being prescribed antidepressants, and 160% higher odds of being prescribed sedatives or anxiety drugs. "We have previously found a connection between high grief symptom levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and even suicide. But the association with mortality should be further investigated," said Nielsen. The authors point out that people at risk for a 'high' grief trajectory may be recognizable for intervention early, since the data showed that these patients were prescribed psychotropic medication more often even before their loss. "The 'high grief' group had lower education on average, and their more frequent use of medication before bereavement suggested that they had signs of mental vulnerability, which may cause greater distress on bereavement," said Nielsen. "A GP could look for previous signs of depression and other severe mental health conditions. They can then offer these patients tailored follow-up in general practice, or refer them to a private-practice psychologist or secondary care. The GP may also suggest a bereavement follow-up appointment focusing on mental health," suggested Nielsen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People with dementia are diagnosed an average of 3.5 years after symptoms are first noticed, or even longer (4.1 years) for those with early-onset dementia, finds a new study led by UCL researchers. The researchers reviewed data from 13 previously published studies which took place in Europe, US, Australia and China, reporting data on 30,257 participants. "Timely diagnosis of dementia remains a major global challenge, shaped by a complex set of factors, and specific healthcare strategies are urgently needed to improve it. Other studies estimate that only 50-65% of cases are ever diagnosed in high-income countries, with many countries having even lower diagnostic rates." Dr Vasiliki Orgeta, Study Lead Author, Division of Psychiatry, University College London Dr. Orgeta added, "Timely diagnosis can improve access to treatments and for some people prolong the time living with mild dementia before symptoms worsen." In a pooled meta-analysis of 10 of the included studies, the researchers found that it typically takes 3.5 years from the first alert of symptoms to a patient receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or 4.1 years for those with early-onset dementia, with some groups more likely to experience longer delays. While data on racial disparities was limited, one of the studies reviewed found that black patients tended to experience a longer delay before diagnosis. Dr Orgeta said: "Our work highlights the need for a clear conceptual framework on time to diagnosis in dementia, developed in collaboration with people with dementia, their carers, and supporters." Dr Phuong Leung (UCL Division of Psychiatry) said: "Symptoms of dementia are often mistaken for normal ageing, while fear, stigma, and low public awareness can discourage people from seeking help." Professor Rafael Del-Pino-Casado, of the University of Jaén, Spain, said: "Within healthcare systems, inconsistent referral pathways, limited access to specialists, and under-resourced memory clinics can create further delays. For some, language differences or a lack of culturally appropriate assessment tools can make access to timely diagnosis even harder." Dr Orgeta added: "To speed up dementia diagnosis, we need action on multiple fronts. Public awareness campaigns can help improve understanding of early symptoms and reduce stigma, encouraging people to seek help sooner. Clinician training is critical to improve early recognition and referral, along with access to early intervention and individualised support so that people with dementia and their families can get the help they need."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The researchers' findings involving radial spoke 3 (RS3), reported in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, help answer some fundamental questions about how motile cilia work and could eventually lead to new treatments for ciliopathies, diseases in which cilia's structure and/or function are impaired. These include primary ciliary dyskinesia, a life-shortening genetic disorder that causes infertility, chronic respiratory problems, reversed organ placement, and excess brain fluid. "Our findings reveal RS3 as a unique hub connecting mechanical support with energy production and recycling in these highly conserved, motion-generating organelles." Daniela Nicastro, PhD, Professor, Cell Biology, UT Southwestern Dr. Nicastro co-led the study with Xuewu Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Pharmacology and Biophysics, and first author Yanhe Zhao, Ph.D., Research Scientist in the Nicastro Lab. Cilia are ubiquitous on cells, playing a variety of roles, Dr. Nicastro explained. While non-motile cilia serve as sensors for chemical and mechanical signals, motile cilia rhythmically beat to propel some types of cells through fluid or to move small objects and fluid in their environment and across tissues. Scientists have long known that the oscillatory beating of a motile cilium is generated by thousands of molecular motor proteins called dyneins. But how cells coordinate their actions to whip cilia back and forth and where the energy driving this motion comes from has been unclear. To help answer these questions, researchers at UTSW and elsewhere have investigated the structures of various protein complexes that make up motile cilia's inner workings. Most of these studies have used model organisms, such as the single-celled green algae Chlamydomonas, that move through their aquatic habitats with two motile cilia. Studies by the Nicastro Lab have shown patients carrying mutations that affect RS1 and RS2 but leave RS3 intact have less severe ciliopathies than those where RS3 is also affected, suggesting RS3 is uniquely important for cilia function. By matching these proteins to those in a comprehensive mouse protein database, the researchers identified them and their functions. Dr. Zhao said several of RS3's proteins are involved in placing or removing phosphate groups from other proteins – a regulatory function that he and his colleagues suspect plays a part in coordinating the activity of the dynein motors. Several other proteins in this complex are involved in generating ATP, a fuel that cells use for energy and that drives dynein motion. Together, he said, these findings suggest RS3's components are pivotal for both synchronizing dynein activity and powering the motors' motion in cilia. RS3's structure could act as a blueprint for designing drugs that modify its activity, Dr. Zhang said. The researchers plan to continue investigating the individual roles and interactions of proteins that make up RS3 and how this structure might differ among species. Dr. Nicastro played a pivotal role in establishing UTSW's Cryo-EM Facility, which she directed until December 2019. Dr. Zhang is a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The protein-DNA complexes are called nucleosomes, and they ensure that DNA is safely stored. But this packaging into nucleosomes also poses a challenge: important cellular machinery must still access the genetic code to keep cells healthy and prevent diseases like cancer. It helps control cell growth, triggers repair of damaged DNA, and can even order faulty cells to self-destruct. In many cancers, p53 is disabled or hijacked, so understanding how p53 works is vital for developing cancer therapies. But there's a problem: most of the DNA sequences that p53 targets are buried inside nucleosomes, making them difficult to reach. Scientists have long wondered how p53 can reach those "hidden" sequences to do its job, as well as how other proteins that interact with p53 manage to find it in this maze of chromatin. Now, researchers led by Nicolas Thomä, who holds the Paternot Chair in Cancer Research at EPFL, have found that nucleosomes act as a gatekeeper for p53's molecular partners. By studying how p53 interacts with different cofactors while attached to nucleosomal DNA, the team has revealed a new layer of control over this critical protein's activity. The researchers used a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemical assays, and genome-wide mapping. Using these tools, they reconstructed how p53 binds to its DNA targets when those targets are wrapped up in nucleosomes. They then tested whether two important "cofactor" proteins could still reach p53 when it is bound to nucleosomal DNA: USP7, which helps stabilize p53, and the viral E6-E6AP complex, which helps degrade p53. They found that p53 can still bind to DNA even when it is wrapped in nucleosomes, especially at the edges where DNA enters or exits the spool. But more surprisingly, the researchers discovered that USP7 could interact with p53 even while bound to the nucleosome, forming a stable complex that they could observe in detail using cryo-EM. In contrast, E6-E6AP couldn't access p53 when it was attached to nucleosomal DNA. This means that the structure of chromatin itself selectively allows or blocks certain proteins from reaching p53, adding an extra level of regulation beyond simple genetic sequences or protein-protein interactions. By revealing how nucleosomes can "gatekeep" access to p53, the research opens new possibilities in cancer research that could inform future therapies that aim to restore or control p53 function in disease.
