                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The growing popularity of cryptocurrency-based betting platforms has extended to UEFA football matches, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) becoming preferred payment methods for global sports enthusiasts. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to streamline transactions, bypass traditional banking intermediaries, and provide transparent, decentralized betting experiences [1]. Dexsport, ranked as the top choice, distinguishes itself through a fully decentralized infrastructure, no KYC requirements, and support for over 38 cryptocurrencies. Cloudbet, a long-established player in the crypto betting space, combines BTC/ETH compatibility with live UEFA match coverage and mobile-optimized interfaces. Stake.com, backed by major sports sponsorships, provides competitive odds and advanced betting tools but applies KYC rules regionally [1]. Fairspin, a blockchain-powered platform, emphasizes on-chain transaction transparency and smart contract-backed betting for UEFA events. BetFury integrates DeFi incentives, offering cashback in BFG tokens and hybrid features that blend sports betting with casino-style rewards [1]. The shift toward crypto betting for UEFA events reflects broader trends in decentralized finance (DeFi), where users seek faster, more transparent financial services. The absence of traditional banking friction—such as delays or currency conversion fees—enhances user experience, particularly for international audiences. However, the regulatory landscape remains fragmented, with platforms like Cloudbet and Stake.com adjusting KYC requirements based on regional compliance mandates [1]. Analysts note that while blockchain-based betting offers privacy and speed, users must remain vigilant about platform trustworthiness, as the lack of centralized oversight can introduce risks related to fraud or operational transparency. Responsible gambling remains a critical concern, with the guide emphasizing that users should never bet beyond their financial capacity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The move reflects rising institutional appetite for yield-generating crypto exposure, according to SOL Strategies. Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has named Canada-based SOL Strategies as its exclusive staking partner for the company's Digital Assets Revolutions Fund. “We serve a growing number of institutional and enterprise clients seeking compliant, reliable access to Solana through delegated staking and custom validator infrastructure,” SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald told Cointelegraph. BitGo, an institutional custody platform that partnered with SOL Strategies in April, will also be involved. Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrencies to help secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. “We currently operate five validators with over 3.59 million SOL (CAD $888 million) ($647.2 million) in assets under delegation and more than 5,700 unique wallets staked, with just 12% coming from our own treasury, the rest from third parties,” Wald said. If a validator were to misbehave, its staked tokens could be slashed, resulting in losses for investors. According to Solana Compass, roughly 403 million SOL tokens are being staked at this writing for a total of $73.5 billion. Other companies like DeFi Development Corp. and Upexi have also pivoted to Solana treasuries as the asset has gained more traction among traditional investors. Related: Canada's Sol Strategies files with SEC to list on the Nasdaq ARK Invest's move indicates increased interest from institutional investors, who may want to earn yield on crypto assets along with the potential appreciation in price. Over the past few months, several issuers of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have submitted formal requests with the SEC seeking approval for income-generating features. “We're seeing a clear surge in institutional interest in Solana exposure, not just to the asset, but to structured, investable vehicles that provide access with regulatory clarity,” Wald said. Recently, it scooped up shares in Circle's initial public offering before selling the first batch of shares for $52 million on June 17.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital payments giant PayPal (PYPL) said it is rolling out a service that lets U.S. merchants accept over 100 cryptocurrencies in payment for purchases as it aims to cut cross-border fees. Payments can be made with digital assets such as bitcoin BTC$118,000.61, ether (ETH), XRP XRP$3.1494 and stablecoins like USDC and USDT, covering 90% of the total crypto market cap. The company will charge a 0.99% service fee, some 90% less than international credit card processing, PayPal said. "Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations," President and CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement. "Using PayPal's open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal." Merchants can also earn yield on PYUSD balances held within PayPal accounts. Blockchain rails, especially stablecoins, are increasingly viewed as a cheaper and faster alternative for cross-border payments than traditional the banking system.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PayPal will allow smaller businesses in the U.S. to accept 100 cryptocurrencies on its platform, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana on its network, the payments services provider announced Monday. It will support transactions for a number of wallets, including Coinbase, Kraken and MetaMask. "Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations," Alex Chriss, PayPal's president and CEO, said in a statement. The service comes as PayPal continues to expand its crypto services. Last Wednesday, San Jose-based PayPal said that it was planning to introduce a new platform in the fall, PayPal World, that will link domestic digital wallets to its global network of billions of users. PayPal's PYUSD, which debuted in 2023, has a more than $901 market capitalization, and the firm subsequently allowed users to swap PYUSD for dollars to make international payments via payments platform Xoom. The firm said in a statement that Pay with Crypto would allow merchants to increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal." Noting last week's PayPal World announcement, which brings together five of the world's largest digital wallets on a single platform," Chriss said, adding that the firm was "breaking long-standing barriers in global commerce." "These innovations don't just simplify payments—they drive merchant growth, expand consumer choice, and reduce costs," he said. "This is the future of inclusive, borderless commerce, and we're proud to lead it." PayPal was up nearly 0.67% in early Monday trading, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin was trading at almost $118,400, flat over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Editor's note: This story was updated after publication with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, despite high-profile trials and substantial government support, the digital yuan hasn't yet caught on internationally as Beijing likely expected. Meanwhile, a quiet pivot is underway in Beijing, where blockchain startups are piloting yuan-backed stablecoins — a possible fallback for extending the currency's global footprint — just as Washington moves to clear the way for dollar-linked stablecoins to scale abroad. In mid-July, Chinese financial news outlet Sina Finance reported that Conflux Network, a Chinese Layer 1 blockchain backed by the Shanghai government, had teamed up with fintech company AnchorX and Shenzhen-based public firm Eastcompeace Technology to create stablecoins tied to the offshore yuan, known as CNH. The stablecoins are expected to circulate in countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive international development project spanning over 140 countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan. Conflux Network CTO Dr. Guang Yang told The Defiant that Conflux 3.0 aims to address the “security and auditing needs critical to stablecoin adoption by focusing on compatibility.” “As part of China's national key R&D program, Conflux is also piloting cross-border stablecoin payment applications across Belt and Road countries—paving the way for real-world Web3 utility,” Yang said. AnchorX's head of product, Jozey Zhou, explained that as part of the collaboration, AxCNH is designed to “streamline cross-border payments and trade within Belt and Road countries.” Independent audits are in progress and will be shared once finalized,” Zhou added. The move stands out given that China still bans crypto trading and mining, while Hong Kong is taking a more open approach with a stablecoin licensing system starting on August 1. Building anything blockchain-related in China has never been a straightforward task. KuCoin Ventures did not immediately respond to The Defiant's request for comment. While China continues to expand real-world use cases for its digital yuan, the U.S. appears to be charting a different course, placing greater emphasis on privately issued, dollar-backed stablecoins. In recent weeks, even state-linked Chinese media have begun nudging policymakers to take the stablecoin space more seriously. Experts cited in the article argued that supporting and regulating yuan-based stablecoins might prove to be a more practical path than relying solely on a central bank-issued digital currency. Taken together, these signals suggest a quiet recalibration in China's approach to digital currency. The digital yuan may still be the centerpiece of Beijing's ambitions, but yuan-backed stablecoins — especially those issued offshore — could represent a more nimble, globally palatable alternative.

Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo, famous for creating on-chain valuation metrics like the Network Value to Transactions ratio and the Supply Shock valuation model, says he has sold all his BTC. “I sold all of mine,” he said Monday on X, referring to his Bitcoin holdings. When asked why by an X user, Woo said, “because I can do just as well supporting the picks and shovels of the best emerging asset as it grows,” alluding to Bitcoin startups. In an interview with Cointelegraph last week, he said Bitcoin at best had a further 50x upside potential, assuming its market cap could surge to as high as $100 trillion. On the other hand, he said a good Bitcoin venture could yield “100 to 1000x” gains. “It just makes sense that smart money would go into Bitcoin infrastructure,” he said. However, venture investing is far from an easy business, especially compared to the simplicity of buying and holding or dollar cost-averaging into Bitcoin. Trending: Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account. Still, venture investing likely comes more naturally to Woo than the average Joe, as he told Cointelegraph that he was investing in early ventures before the emergence of Bitcoin. “I've been in the startup space since way before Bitcoin, and I like investing in the next generation of founders,” he said.

Meanwhile, Woo told Cointelegraph that it was not previously the case that investing in a Bitcoin venture outperformed investing in Bitcoin, citing Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). But today it's more reliable to outperform Bitcoin with a venture.” Among Woo's picks in this perceived new market phase is Debifi, a platform that allows Bitcoin holders to borrow fiat against their holdings without giving up self-custody. Debifi completed a second seed round in June 2024 but did not disclose how much was raised or its present valuation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>$BNB just smashed through its previous all-time high to hit $855, setting the stage for what some analysts are calling a full-on altcoin revival. Trading volume roared past $3B, while open interest surged above $1.71B, signaling serious conviction behind the breakout, and not just a weekend pump. BNB's push was powered by a mix of rising network activity, renewed institutional demand (including treasury buys from companies like Nano Labs), and growing belief in a $1,000–$2,000 target by Q4. Analysts say this could be just the start of a broader expansion phase. And here's the real signal: when a major altcoin breaks ATH with this kind of momentum, money rotates fast. Binance remains the most dominant exchange globally, and when its native token hits new highs, it suggests real trust in centralized exchange narratives, DeFi pipelines, and ecosystem expansion. Treasury allocations from companies like WindTree ($520M) and Nano Labs ($50M) show that institutions aren't just holding $BTC anymore; they're diversifying. And here's what usually happens next: liquidation-fueled rallies like this one tend to unlock sidelined capital. Once the dust settles, that money looks for fresher, more volatile opportunities – typically smaller-cap tokens with better risk-reward. With $BNB's move reigniting greed across Crypto Twitter, attention and smart money naturally shifted to early-stage plays that could ride the next wave. If you're eyeing asymmetric upside as $BNB flies into price discovery, here are three of the best altcoins that are worth some attention. If MetaMask feels like it hasn't evolved in years, you're not wrong, and that's exactly where Best Wallet steps in. From lower gas fees to staking perks, exclusive iGaming bonuses, and early access to top presales, Best Wallet gamifies the wallet experience in a way legacy apps simply don't. Its Upcoming Tokens tool has already helped raise over $2M for presales directly inside the app, cutting out scam sites and mirror links. $BEST is more than just another utility token. It powers an ecosystem designed to turn your everyday crypto usage into something more rewarding. The project's growing at 50% month-on-month, with a presale price of $0.025395 and over $14M already raised. If $BNB's ATH showed one thing, it's that infrastructure matters. Best Wallet is betting that crypto wallets (not DEXs) will be the next frontier. Check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction to see how successful we think this project could be. It's the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling sub-second transactions, smart contracts, and real DeFi, all secured by Bitcoin itself. This isn't just theoretical: memecoins, payments, staking, and composable dApps are already being built on top. Its Canonical Bridge allows seamless, trustless $BTC transfers minting between Layer 1 and Layer 2, where you lock in your $BTC and receive equivalent wrapped Bitcoin on the l2. If you think Bitcoin's next chapter is more than just hodling, $HYPER is where that future starts – fast, cheap, and meme-ready. What happens when nostalgia, Elon Musk, and whale wallets collide? You get Vine Coin ($VINE), a meme token riding the revival of one of the internet's most beloved platforms. But since then, Elon recently announced on X that Vine is coming back, in AI form. $VINE is still speculative, yes, but when a single wallet drops $3M on the token, it's hard not to pay attention. With a current market cap of $151M, 238% gains in the last week, and over $746M in trading volume, $VINE isn't just another viral token; it's becoming a serious player in the altcoin space. There's no official word on whether it'll be integrated into the AI-powered Vine comeback, but investor behavior suggests plenty are betting on exactly that. $BNB smashing through $850 isn't just bullish for Binance – it's a signal that risk appetite is back, and altcoin narratives are heating up fast. You don't have to go all-in on every trend. But catching just one of these early, before the next leg kicks off, can make all the difference in a cycle defined by asymmetric bets. Crypto markets are volatile, and presales carry risk. Never invest more than you're willing to lose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>100% of delegates approve renaming to Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Asset Association On October 22, 2024, the Prime Minister signed Decision No. 1236/QĐ-TTg to announce the National Blockchain Strategy, aiming for Vietnam to become a regional leader with international standing in blockchain by 2030. 1131/QĐ-TTg issued on June 12, 2025, blockchain is listed among 11 strategic technologies. Notably, the Digital Technology Industry Law, passed on June 14, 2025 and effective from January 1, 2026, officially recognizes digital assets as legally protected assets. According to Ms. Nguyễn Vân Hiền, Vice Chairwoman and Secretary General of VBA, “This name change not only reflects our alignment with global trends but also affirms our determination to promote the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into Vietnam's legal, financial, and public service systems, helping the country to participate in the global digital transformation actively.” Mr. Phan Đức Trung was reappointed as Chairman of VBA, alongside three Vice Chairwomen and Chairmen: Ms. Nguyễn Vân Hiền, Mr. Nguyễn Trọng Khang, and Mr. Phan Chiến Thắng. Looking ahead to the 2025–2030 period, VBA aims to support at least 50 domestic enterprises in deploying blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions on the VBSN platform. The Association will also pilot at least three public services using blockchain and develop two fintech initiatives applying blockchain in the financial and banking sectors. Chairman Phan Đức Trung emphasized, “With our new name, an expanded strategic direction, and a strengthened leadership team, VBA is entering a new phase of strategic development. In this stage, technology is no longer merely a goal, it is a driving force for innovation, enhancing national competitiveness and contributing to Vietnam's presence on the global digital economy map.” For more info about Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association:Website: https://blockchain.vn/X: https://x.com/VietnamVBADisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Esports-focused media company GameSquare has provided an update on its crypto asset treasury plan. GameSquare's board has also approved a yield strategy along with the updated budget framework. The company is now empowered to deploy capital into non-fungible tokens (NFT) yield programmes and other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The strategy targets annualised returns of 6-10% – a significant premium over traditional ETH staking yields. This strategic shift could position GameSquare ahead of most institutional investors, which typically limit crypto exposure to passive Ethereum accumulation. Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare, stated in the press release: “We are excited to be among the first public companies to include NFTs as part of a diversified digital asset strategy. This reflects the innovative approach to our treasury management initiatives. With deep experience building in-game and real-world creative environments, GameSquare is uniquely positioned to understand the cultural and economic value of these digital assets.” GameSquare's programme will be overseen by an in-house crypto committee that reports to the board. Meanwhile, the yield generation strategy would be executed on Dialectic's crypto platform Medici, which uses AI tools to identify high-yield opportunities. The esports company will execute this new strategy using an initial $10m (~£7.45 million) allocation. GameSquare recently acquired a CryptoPunk NFT for $5.15m (~£3.83 million) from DeFi pioneer Robert Leshner, along with $10m in Ethereum. Funding for these initiatives comes partly from a recent public offering of 8.4m shares, priced at $0.95 each, which raised approximately $8m (~£5.9 million). Beyond crypto acquisitions, GameSquare continues to lead in the esports scene.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I didn't grow up in a marble-columned building. I come from working-class Appalachian roots with folks who believed in hard work, local values, and keeping a close eye on those in power. I taught myself how to code, built a career in software and artificial intelligence, and now, as Indiana's state treasurer, I wear cowboy boots not for show but because they remind me where I come from. I may manage over $16 billion for the state of Indiana, but I've never forgotten who that money belongs to: the families, farmers, and small business owners of Indiana — especially in our rural towns, where folks wake up early, work hard, and still stop to check on neighbors. That's who I'm fighting for when I say this: We must not let Washington take control of the dollar through a central bank digital currency. A retail CBDC might sound convenient, but in practice, it could become a tool for federal surveillance, tracking every transaction in real time. I built my career in digital innovation. I know how code can be misused. A CBDC's underlying code could include restrictions such as expiration dates on funds or limits on certain purchases, enforced automatically without public oversight. Code can be written to monitor, restrict, or punish. Alex Gladstein reported in the Cato Journal that China's CBDC allows “fine-grained” control over finances and the CCP could “more easily confiscate funds from political opponents.” That's not science fiction. Look at Operation Choke Point, in which federal agencies pressured banks to cut off services to industries like firearm companies without due process. Not to mention when the IRS targeted conservative nonprofit groups. A CBDC would make that kind of political discrimination easier, faster, and quieter. CBDC supporters argue it could streamline payments or reduce crime. However, the private sector can offer those benefits through innovations like blockchain-based stablecoins, without compromising privacy or local control. Small towns don't have big national banks on every corner. They have local banks and credit unions, institutions that know your name, ask about your children, sponsor Little League, and lend when you're planting crops or opening a shop. A retail CBDC incentivizes people to hold funds directly with the Federal Reserve, bypassing local banks and draining deposits from the institutions that small communities need. That threatens family farms, small businesses, and homebuyers in towns like ours. As Indiana's chief banker, I see the pressure firsthand. When local banks need deposits, they call my office. But the more Washington centralizes our financial system, the fewer options we have to keep money flowing in our communities. The public deserves financial freedom without government overreach. It puts up guardrails, ensures congressional oversight, and protects the role of private banks. Hoosiers and all Americans deserve a dollar that respects privacy. As a conservative, I believe in liberty, not algorithmic control. The dollar should remain the world's reserve currency because it reflects freedom, trust, and competition, not centralized power. Now is the time for conservatives and all Americans who value freedom to unite behind policies that keep the dollar free from bureaucratic overreach. Let's build a digital future for the dollar the right way, rooted in free markets, accountability, and the values we hold dear in Indiana and across rural America. Daniel Elliott is the Indiana state treasurer.</p>

Crypto bull markets are often much like rush hour traffic, where everyone wants to get somewhere, but the cars in one lane often pull ahead in a given stretch of road. One question that's bugging investors is which of the pair is more likely to double in value the soonest. Both coins enjoy swelling liquidity and real world adoption, yet bull markets rarely rewards every contestant equally. Ethereum is priced at more than $3,700 right now, so a doubling lands at about $7,400 , which is territory it last visited in early 2022. New exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that enable institutional investors to pour their capital into the coin are already paving the road to new highs. U.S.-based funds had inflows of more than $2 billion during the week ended July 19, including a dramatic single-day haul of $727 million on July 16. Those flows constrain the coin's float available for public trading, so they support demand, and higher prices too. Another key factor is that at least one of the chain's most annoying bugbears, namely its unreasonably high gas (user) fees, is (finally) resolving. Since the Dencun upgrade to the chain 16 months ago, and the Pectra upgrade this year, average gas costs cratered by roughly 95%, dropping a typical swap to $0.39 from tens of dollars during high-traffic periods. That reduction has lured liquidity back to the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment, both via decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and Layer-2 (L2) rollups, helping to revive the chain's application revenue, and, more importantly, its narrative. That would give institutional buyers a 4% to 6% staking "dividend" on top of price exposure, which would likely attract a lot more capital and pump the coin's price. Importantly, momentum is already scorching with this coin. Ethereum has more than doubled since its late-April trough, rallying roughly 105% in just three months (as of July 25). That head start makes it the odds-on favorite in any doubling contest. Overall, the route to a quick two-bagger looks fairly clear here. As of July 25, XRP sells for about $3.20, so doubling means reaching $6.40,  a level it has never reached before. But, over the longer term, its position is quite bullish. Ripple's Payments suite now has access to more than 90 markets. It has cleared more than $70 billion in volume since its inception, all settled using XRP in the backend, and stablecoins hosted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Ripple's $1.25 billion purchase of the prime broker Hidden Road deepens XRP's claim to being a financial tool, as it gave 300 institutional clients a regulatory-compliant on-ramp that settles with XRP. As those clients tap the lending services that Ripple provides using XRP, and as they park more of their real-world assets (RWAs) on the chain to gain speed and efficiency, there will be an escalating demand for the coin, and the price is very likely to continue trending higher over time. Compliance checks and integrating back-end technology unfold over quarters, not weeks. Without an ETF to turn on a firehose of capital inflows, XRP's catalyst calendar isn't very precise. Assuming current macroeconomic and liquidity conditions persist, Ethereum looks to be more likely to reach the finish line first, though XRP could still beat it. But until that catalyst is realized, its timetable is hazier, and gains derived from institutional onboarding will be piecemeal rather than all at once. With all that said, both coins can be rewarding long-term holdings, so it could be a decent idea to buy and hold both.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We have fined Scottish charity Birthlink £18,000 after it destroyed approximately 4,800 personal records, up to ten percent of which may be irreplaceable. “This case highlights - perhaps more than most - that data protection is about people and how a data breach can have far-reaching ripple effects that continue to affect people's lives long after it occurs. “It is inconceivable to think, due to the very nature of its work, that Birthlink had such a poor understanding of both its data protection responsibilities and records management process. “Whilst we acknowledge the important work charities do, they are not above the law and by issuing and publicising this proportionate fine we aim to promote compliance, remind all organisations of the requirement to take data protection seriously and ultimately deter them from making similar mistakes.” In January 2021, Birthlink reviewed whether they could destroy ‘Linked Records' as space was running out in the charity's filing cabinets where they were stored. ‘Linked Records' are files of cases where people had already been linked with the person they sought and can include handwritten letters from birth parents, photographs, and copies of birth certificates. Following a February 2021 Board meeting, it was agreed no barriers to the destruction of records existed but that retention periods should apply to certain files and only replaceable records could be destroyed. In addition, poor record keeping meant Birthlink were unable to identify people affected by the breach. Since the breach occurred the charity has implemented improvements including digitally recording and storing all physical records, appointing a Data Protection Officer and initiating staff training. Last year we published our Ripple Effect campaign, detailing the far reaching effects and human impact data breaches can have on people. We called for all organisations to step up, do better and recognise the critical importance data protection has in protecting people's lives. Anyone who feels they may have been impacted by this incident should contact Birthlink, as the charity will be able to provide further information and access to support services. We publish detailed guidance on our website to help organisations understand and comply with data protection law.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will extend its BTC operations, allocating $300M for options trading. The media group behind Truth Social will use the funds to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities in a complex derivative strategy. The new investment follows previous direct purchases of BTC and other crypto assets. The details of the deal are still unclear, but may be related to a more complex strategy of tracking BTC price fluctuations. Trump's individual posting on social media has shown a clear effect on the price of BTC, with the added effect of World Liberty Fi. Options trading is seen as riskier, hinging on timing. TMTG already has its own treasury strategy, reporting $2B in BTC and related assets, but so far it has been rare for corporations to take up an active trading approach to crypto. Digital assets have become key to the TMTG performance and by proxy for Trump's net worth of $6.6B. Based on marker price estimates, Trump's wealth has expanded by up to $620M in crypto over the past few months. World Liberty Fi alone holds over $216M in its known public wallets, with additional potential from the holdings of TMTG. The actual type of BTC-related securities remains uncertain. Currently, BTC exposure is possible through ETF, crypto company shares and preferred stock or convertible notes, as in the case of Strategy (MSTR). Options contracts may be risky if the market shifts its direction, letting the contracts expire without value. MSTR currently has one of the more active options markets, with a predominance of call options signaling a relatively bullish expectation. WLFI tokens, the voting asset of World Liberty Fi, is preparing to start trading. Currently, the asset only has pre-market price discovery, while full trading is expected in about six weeks. The asset is most active on MEXC, trading at around $0.29 in its pre-market pair, with the occasional price anomaly due to low volumes.

U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded $1.85 billion in inflows last week, marking the second-largest weekly inflow since their launch. According to SoSoValue data, the spot Ethereum ETFs saw $1.85 billion in net inflows during the week from July 21 to July 25, following $2.18 billion in inflows the previous week. Meanwhile, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $72 million in net inflows last week, a sharp drop from the $2.39 billion reported the week before. Bitcoin traded up 0.8% over the past 24 hours to $119,077 as of 3:10 a.m. While the crypto market saw a brief correction last week, bitcoin reclaimed $119,000 early Monday morning during a "calm market period" as traders await investor reactions to tariffs, macroeconomic data releases, and regulatory changes, said Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research. "Altcoins surged higher as more traders find market stability amid weakened BTC volatility, giving a chance for ETH and others to race upward," Ruck added. "While some large holders of Bitcoin are taking profits, we continue to see new institutions integrate and purchase BTC and other altcoins as part of reserve strategies, often climbing into nine-figure ranges."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On July 26, 2025, something big happened in the tech world. Samsung Electronics made a $16.5 billion announcement regarding the supply of semiconductors to a major international firm, presumed to be Tesla, which could essentialize both their positions in the market. This deal wasn't just a minor discussion over coffee; it was significant enough to take us until December 31, 2033, to play out. It wasn't just the standard semiconductor supply; the announcement hinted at Tesla's innovative tech involvement—securing their futuristic aspirations. Could this affect the growing demand for cryptocurrency solutions? Samsung's partnership with Tesla could serve as an interesting blueprint. Fintech startups eyeing crypto payroll adaptations might find pointers. This deal reiterates just how crucial advanced semiconductor technology is in developing any platform. That would require an understanding of integrating AI into operational plans for compliance, fraud detection, and improved user interfaces. Lastly, the real killer attribute of Samsung Pay's integration with crypto virtual cards is the ease of spending via crypto assets. It's hard not to wonder how this will reshape cryptocurrency's role in supply chain financing. On the one hand, Samsung's deal with Tesla seems to enhance supply chain efficiency. On the other hand, those chips are infused with advanced technology, which may help usher in a more tech-savvy world of cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology has the potential to bolster supply chain transparency and creates a foundation for decentralized transactions. So as Tesla employs Samsung's chips, it may increase the propensity for sophisticated blockchain applications. Integrating crypto solutions into traditional semiconductor contracts holds both risks and rewards. This partnership sets a significant precedent for possible collaborations extending into crypto-friendly operations. Samsung and Tesla show how advanced technology can support those emerging services. Secure chips may become the norm for crypto-heavy operations. Interoperability can lead to Decentralized energy trading and tokenized assets. Coordinating hardware, software, and energy sectors may just become the norm of operations. The combined forces of advanced tech and strategic partnerships will push the industry, creating fruitful outcomes for forward-thinking fintech startups.

The perfume house on Monday announced its entry into the Aura Blockchain Consortium, established by ​​LVMH, Prada Group, OTB and Richemont's Cartier as an alliance to leverage blockchain technology for greater traceability and transparency in luxury goods. Since 2021, the group has logged more than 50 million products from dozens of brands on its private blockchain, creating digital identities — known as digital product passports, or DPPs — for each item which consumers and regulators can access for information such as the product's provenance. Amouage said its DPPs will be accessible via a QR code on the fragrance's packaging. As of this month, all new products from Amouage will be integrated into Aura's blockchain, and by the end of the month, it will have added existing items produced in or before this year as well, the company said. “​​This announcement represents several important milestones for Aura Blockchain Consortium, with a particular focus on venturing into a new vertical, and establishing a strong new footing in the Middle East luxury industry,” Lorenzo Bertelli, chairman of the Aura Blockchain Consortium and head of corporate social responsibility for Prada Group, said in a statement. Beauty brands have been slower to adopt DPPs than fashion, but much like fashion, the beauty industry is encountering increased scrutiny over issues like the sourcing, sustainability and authenticity of its products. Some brands are starting to look for blockchain-based solutions. Earlier this year, French beauty brand Ulé, part of the Shiseido group, partnered with technology provider Arianee to create DPPs for its C-Bright Serum. Marc Bain is Technology Correspondent at The Business of Fashion. Tech giants like Meta and Google are striking big deals and announcing new eyewear partnerships on smart glasses after a decade of failed attempts to make the devices fashionable. Meta's $3.5 billion investment in EssilorLuxottica is the clearest sign yet that some of the biggest names in tech and eyewear see smart glasses as a commercially viable category with a long-term future. The Chinese e-commerce giant could be facing up to 6 percent of global turnover for endangering consumers. The beloved brand's closure isn't just another cautionary tale. It's proof that even with an aspirational and credentialed Black founder, following a formulaic launch-and-scale playbook doesn't guarantee success. Following a challenging year for American Eagle, the retailer is betting on actress Sydney Sweeney's star power and girl-next-door appeal to drum up interest in its fall campaign. The luxury fragrance label will begin putting all new products on Aura's private blockchain, allowing customers to claim a digital certificate of ownership and other perks.
