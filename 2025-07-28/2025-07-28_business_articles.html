                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A U.S. District Court judge on Monday rejected a legal bid by an investment fund to force the Federal Reserve to open to the public a meeting on setting interest rates this week. The ruling found that the Federal Open Market Committee is not a government agency subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open meetings, despite claims to the contrary in a lawsuit filed by Azoria Capital. The FOMC is set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday. Azoria had asked Judge Beryl Howell in federal court in Washington, D.C., to issue a temporary restraining order that would have opened those sessions to the public. Howell's decision upholding the FOMC's half-century-old practice of meeting behind closed doors came shortly after she questioned whether the lawsuit is a publicity stunt by Azoria to generate interest in the new investment fund. Howell noted that a court filing last week by Azoria mentioned that CEO James Fishback — who is an ally of President Donald Trump — discussed the suit in an interview on a Fox Business show, "Mornings with Maria." "I do note it's very unusual," Howell said, referring to the mention of the interview. "I've never seen information like this in such a certification." "And it made me think: Are you filing the ... lawsuit to generate publicity for the launch of this new fund?" "I mean, the courts are very, very busy, and using the filing of a lawsuit as a business strategy to build publicity or generate interest in a new investment fund is not a particularly welcome development." Anne Mackin, a lawyer for Azoria, replied, saying, "Your honor, that is not the purpose." "So that was simply included in the certification to emphasize that we've emailed these folks, and we have not, you know, heard responses back," the attorney said. Fishback, like Trump, has been critical of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's refusal to cut interest rates. "Azoria is deeply concerned that the FOMC, under Chair Jerome Powell, is maintaining high interest rates to undermine President Donald J. Trump and his economic agenda, to the detriment of American citizens and the American economy," Azoria's suit said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The fast casual restaurant chain is also applying AI to the process of hiring workers, allowing managers to stay more focused on running their restaurants. Chipotle added an AI-powered platform to its hiring process that it dubbed "Ava Cado." The platform, created by AI HR firm Paradox, is essentially a conversational chatbot that interacts with job candidates, answers questions about the company and the job, collects information about them, and ultimately can schedule interviews with human hiring managers. It can also converse in English, Spanish, French, and German. With projections for about 300 new restaurants opening each year with an average of 30 employees per location, the company estimates it will have somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 new hires per year, on top of other positions opening up at existing Chipotles. Prior to rolling out Ava Cado, Chipotle managers were tasked with scheduling all of the interviews, both from people who applied online as well as during hiring events or when people came in seeking employment. That led to a lot of administrative work for managers. Since introducing the AI chatbot, Eskenazi said Chipotle's number of applicants "has increased dramatically" and the company is also seeing about an 85% application completion rate. "That has greatly increased our funnel so that we're serving up many more candidates for our managers to evaluate," Eskenazi said. "Maintaining our pipeline of candidates is always something that we're very focused on," she added. Ava Cado is also tasked with managing the interview schedules for managers, who are able to block out certain times during the week and candidates can then be scheduled based on their availability. That's helping Chipotle hire faster, reducing time to hire by up to 75%, CEO Scott Boatwright told CNBC's Jim Cramer earlier this year. "We leaned into an AI hiring assistant from Paradox about six months ago that has put us on better footing from a staffing perspective," Boatwright said. "And we've been, in the eight years I've been in the organization, pushing past numbers we thought were all-time highs just last year." Paradox has roughly 1,000 clients that use its conversational AI platform at some point in the hiring and recruiting process, including 7-Eleven, General Motors, Nestle, Marriott International and Lowe's. Still, much like how workers are concerned about AI taking their jobs, there are some concerns about how AI is increasingly being integrated in the hiring experience, whether that's through screening of resumes or even speaking directly to an AI powered recruiter. There are also potential concerns about the security of applicant data when interacting with AI recruiters — earlier this month, Paradox reported that a security vulnerability was detected by researchers, potentially exposing applicant names, email addresses and contact info. Paradox said none of the data was leaked or made public. Wired had previously reported the affected client was McDonald's. However, she said, the company is looking to expand Ava Cado's capabilities, whether that's sharing videos with candidates to give them a better view into what working at Chipotle is like, or giving applicants a prompt to also consider other locations where there may be openings nearby. There are ways AI can also be integrated into the company's learning and development programing. "We've gotten a lot of anecdotal feedback from both general managers and candidates, and it's been incredibly strong," Eskenazi said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spirit Airlines said Monday that it will furlough 270 pilots this fall as the carrier prepares for a smaller off-season schedule to try to find its financial footing. The airline will also downgrade 140 pilots from captain to first officer, according to a note to aviators from the Air Line Pilots Association, their union. "We know how hard this news hits, and there's no dressing that up. Spirit continues to shrink, and with it, the value of pilot seniority and Spirit careers continues to erode," said Captain Ryan Muller, chairman of Spirit's ALPA chapter. The furloughs take effect on Nov. 1 "to better align staffing with our flight schedule," the airline said. Spirit emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and has been trying to win over customers with more upscale travel options, which have fared better than the bare-bones coach tickets Spirit has been known for for years. Airlines across the industry have said demand has been softer this year, particularly in off-peak travel periods. "We recognize the weight of this decision and are committed to treating all affected Team Members with compassion and respect during this process," Spirit said. Spirit also announced hundreds of pilot furloughs last year as it approached its bankruptcy filing. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lawyers for President Donald Trump asked a judge on Monday to order Rupert Murdoch to sit for a deposition within 15 days for Trump's $10 billion lawsuit accusing the media mogul of defaming him in a Wall Street Journal article about a "bawdy" birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's lawyers cited Murdoch's advanced age to submit to questioning under oath as a chief argument in their motion to compel him to testify earlier than would be normal in such a lawsuit, suggesting that Murdoch will either be too ill or dead to testify by the time the case goes to trial. "Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their legal filing in Miami federal court. "Taken together, these factors weigh heavily in determining that Murdoch would be unavailable for in-person testimony at trial," the lawyers wrote. "Murdoch has an advantage over President Trump as Murdoch is able to defend himself because he has access to all the information and documents related to the below-defined malicious and defamatory Article, and the decision behind deciding to publish it," they wrote. "For these and other reasons that follow, Murdoch would not suffer any prejudice significant enough to outweigh the good cause that exists to grant this Motion," they wrote. Murdoch opposes the request that he sit for an expedited deposition, according to the filing. CNBC has requested comment from Murdoch's attorneys. Judge Darrin Gayles, who is presiding over the case, later Monday filed an order directing Murdoch's lawyers to respond to the motion by Aug. 4. The motion also seeks a number of documents from Murdoch. They include any documents exchanged between him and other defendants in the case. It also seeks "Any text messages, iMessages, WhatsApp messages, Slack messages, Signal messages, WeChat messages, or any other form of digital communication on any mobile device related to the Article that You have sent or received," and a log of his calls from July 10 through July 25. The Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp, earlier this month published an article saying that Trump sent Epstein a letter for his 50th birthday in 2003. The newspaper said that the letter "contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker." Trump has angrily denied writing the letter. His lawsuit against Murdoch also names as defendants News Corp, its CEO Robert Thomson, the Journal's publisher Dow Jones & Company, and the two reporters whose bylines are on the article, Khadeeja Safdar and Joseph Palazzolo. "Murdoch advised President Trump that 'he would take care of it,'" the motion said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday said he threw his longtime friend Jeffrey Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club and cut ties with him years ago because "he stole people who worked for me." Trump said Epstein poached at least one more employee from him after being warned not to do it again. "That's such old history, very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it," Trump said, after a reporter asked him to put to rest questions about what led to the rift between the two men and Epstein's exile from the president's Palm Beach, Florida, club. "But for years, I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn't talk because he did something that was inappropriate," the president said. "He hired help, and I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He stole people that work for me. I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' Epstein then became "persona non grata," Trump said. "I threw him out, and that was it. Virginia Giuffre, who was sexually abused by Epstein, has said British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her as a teenager to be exploited by Epstein when Giuffre was working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago. It has long been known that Trump and Epstein had been friends, and there have been various explanations for why they fell out several years before Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008. Questions about the men's relationship have been raised in recent weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi reneged on a promise she and other Trump administration officials made to release investigative files about Epstein. Prior reports have suggested that Trump and Epstein fell out after 2004, when Trump outbid Epstein for a French Regency-style estate in Palm Beach. Bondi earlier this month had the Department of Justice ask several federal judges to unseal transcripts of grand jury testimony about Epstein and Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for procuring underage girls for Epstein to abuse. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell and her attorney for hours last week at a Florida courthouse. Blanche has said he wants to ask Maxwell about other people who may have abused girls and women in Epstein's orbit. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even while these engines have long propelled economic and industrial development, they today endanger life on Earth by contaminating the air we breathe. SEE ALSO: IQAir real-time report ranks Africa's 5 most polluted cities This point was highlighted in a report by HouseFresh, an independent platform that focuses on air quality and its solutions. “Every day, the average adult inhales approximately 11,000 liters of air. But while getting outside and breathing in fresh air has numerous health benefits, the reality is that not all air is good for you,” the report states. "Airborne pollutants are one of the greatest sources of toxic exposure known to humankind, and according to one estimate from the World Health Organization, air pollution contributes to seven million premature deaths worldwide every year,” it adds. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is airborne particles smaller than 0.033 the diameter of a human hair and originating from engines and other sources, is of particular concern, the report further explains. A controlled investigation by Tobacco Control showed that cigarette smoke emits 10 times more PM2.5 matter than diesel vehicle exhaust. It is more difficult to avoid the poisons that contaminate the air both inside and outdoors, even if stopping smoking lowers exposure to toxins and enhances general health. But some global cities had average PM2.5 levels of up to 108.3 in 2024, the equivalent of smoking 1,797 cigarettes in a year,” the report states.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's war machine has become such an integral part of its economic engine that its military industry is likely to keep expanding even after the fighting in Ukraine ends, according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Now in its fourth year, Russia's war with Ukraine continues even as Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration weathers sweeping Western sanctions. They forecast that the Kremlin could maintain its war of attrition through at least 2027. The CSIS report comes amid renewed scrutiny of Russia's economy. Still, Russia has defied expectations thanks to its growing military-industrial complex. Crucially, the militarized economy has built a broad base of political and economic stakeholders — from elites to ordinary workers — who benefit from continued conflict. That makes any significant drawdown in military activity politically and economically unlikely. Even if a ceasefire is reached, Russia may still be able to rebuild and expand its armed forces over the next decade. CSIS suggests Russia is preparing for a long-term confrontation with NATO, using the war to modernize its forces and test Western resolve. Beyond conventional arms, Russia has ramped up hybrid warfare, including cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, political meddling, and strikes on critical infrastructure. These tools allow Moscow to operate aggressively across multiple fronts. "Despite being inferior to NATO in terms of its conventional capabilities, today's Russia represents a bigger challenge to European security than it did at the start of 2022," the CSIS analysts wrote. The Kremlin is learning from past failures, adapting quickly, and growing more confident in what it sees as a West unwilling to stop it. "Moscow's ongoing large-scale military reforms signal that Russia could be preparing for some kind of future confrontation with NATO within roughly the next decade—including even a large-scale conventional war," they wrote.</p>
