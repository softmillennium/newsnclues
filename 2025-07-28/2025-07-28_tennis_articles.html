                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Previously, the Canadian had won four WTA 250 events. I think she is a threat at the US Open. You are always going to play well where you have had success,” Vandeweghe, a former US Open women's doubles champion, analysed whilst speaking on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast. “I think she is going to be doing just fine up there, she has held the Canadian flag for a few years, making the US Open final that young. “She has dealt with all that pressure, her tennis is there. If her serve and her backhand is playing like it is today I think she is an absolute threat for the rest of the summer and leading up to the US Open.” Along the way, the Canadian defeated defending champion Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina, Angelique Kerber, and Aryna Sabalenka – losing out to Brit Emma Raducanu, 6-4, 6-3. Naomi Osaka announces split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou after a 10-month collaboration WTA Rankings: Leylah Fernandez, Anna Kalinskaya, Emma Raducanu, Maria Sakkari soar after Citi DC Open I was definitely very nervous in the beginning, but I got to play my game in the important points and kind of push through those nerves, so I was super happy about that. “I have gone through so many different challenges this week. “So I was just very happy that I got to not only push myself physically through the limits but also mentally. So that kind of will help me hopefully for future tournaments.” “My intention was actually to be more offensive than her, but I think at the same time, I like long rallies,” analysed the Canadian. “So that kind of helped me to settle in. You know, I knew she was going to be offensive from the get-go, so I had to counterattack as quickly as possible and then get it to the front foot once I had the opportunities. “So I was just glad I was able to take advantage of certain balls she gave me in certain moments. Fernandez will next participate in the Canadian Masters, opening against world No 45 Maya Joint.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cloudy skies early, followed by partial clearing. A local Coloradan is gearing up for her fourth and likely final run in the U.S. Open as a junior wheelchair tennis athlete. This year's U.S. Open Junior Wheelchair Championships are set for Sept. 3 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York. Living in Thornton with her family, Czauz trains at the University of Colorado tennis courts in Boulder. Though tennis has taken her farther than she imagined, it wasn't her first love. “I used to play wheelchair basketball, and when COVID hit, obviously we couldn't play anymore,” Czauz said. “But a teammate of mine started playing tennis, and he invited me down to play. And as soon as I came down for a practice, I just fell in love. And I just kept coming to practice. “I wasn't really prepared for it or anything,” she said. I didn't think it was anything but just a hobby; I wouldn't really go anywhere with it. I lost first in both singles and doubles. But it was a great experience that just kind of opened my eyes to what was possible with wheelchair tennis.” In year two, she ranked into the competition, determined to ruffle some feathers in her sophomore campaign. She began to study tennis more deeply to mentally prepare herself for the game, something she said was a big difference from her wheelchair basketball days. In tennis, you're relying mostly on yourself, with the help of your doubles teammate when you're in those specific competitions. Basketball is the epitome of a team sport, she explained, with several teammates coming together to make something happen. Plus, in a wheelchair, the basketball comes and goes, but you're always holding onto that racket in tennis, making pushing more difficult, she said. “It's a lot more mentally challenging because you don't have the support of like five other people on your side, helping you, playing with you,” Czauz said. You might have coaches and people in the stands, but ultimately, it's up to you. They can't really help you when you're on the court … (In year two) I improved. Chitambar is the co-founder and director of tennis at the Rocky Mountain Tennis Center in Boulder. Her competitiveness and grit have been contagious, especially for someone relatively new to the sport. “Working with Sabina has been one of the most rewarding experiences and privileges of my coaching career,” Chitambar said. “Her determination and love for the game are inspiring, and it's been incredible to watch her grow as both a player and a person. Thanks to the support from USTA Colorado, Colorado Wheelchair Tennis Foundation and the 5430 Kids Tennis Foundation, we've been able to create meaningful opportunities for athletes like Sabina to thrive on and off the court.” Last year (year three), Czauz said her doubles team made it to the finals before losing to the two top players on the other side. She's proud to keep inching closer, but said this year is likely the last dance. It's time to finish this journey with a trophy. After this year, I'm going to the University of Arizona in the fall, and I'm going to be playing on their wheelchair tennis team. Hopefully I'll still be participating in some U.S. and ITF tournaments and get my ranking up in women's and see how far that takes me.” Your browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:</p>

She was denied a repeat of the 2021 US Open final against Leylah Fernandez after losing to Anna Kalinskaya.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Speaking to Sky Sports News, Keothavong said: "I thought she had a pretty good grass-court season and has carried that confidence into the start of the North American hard-court swing. It's all positives and signs that she's moving in the right direction. She's had some fantastic wins over the likes of Maria Sakkari and also former Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka as well. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player After dropping to British No 3, Raducanu's run in Washington ensured she once again overtook Katie Boulter to become the top-ranked British player. Raducanu is currently ranked No 33 as she looks to secure a seeding for next month's US Open. Raducanu has been without a coach in North America amid uncertainty over the future of her partnership with Mark Petchey and has only hitting partner Alexis Canter in her corner, but there was no lack of direction in some of her performances. "Making sure that she's trying to apply herself and do the right things on the match court, which last week we saw her do, and most importantly remaining injury free. "I think that's the biggest challenge for her, becoming a more robust athlete and being able to compete at the highest level week in, week out."

"As captain of the Billie Jean King Cup team I'm in a privileged position that my best players have put themselves out there and are motivated to do well in this particular competition. There's still a fair bit of time and a lot more tennis that the players have to play until we get there but it's shaping up nicely."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thirteen years after her breakout as a junior champion, Taylor Townsend's path through criticism, setbacks, and reinvention has brought her to the top of the doubles rankings. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Taylor Townsend was never given the luxury of a quiet rise. 1, an Australian Open champion and a Wimbledon doubles winner. But the praise quickly gave way to judgment. Townsend, who didn't have the lean, sculpted look of so many other elite junior players, was barred from competing in the junior US Open and sent to its training center in Florida to focus on improving her fitness. Eventually, her USTA funding and support was revoked. What are professional athletes supposed to look like? Townsend was an early test case in the highly uncomfortable setting of harsh public scrutiny. “It's made me who I am, and it's made me appreciate every step of the way, and being able to have somebody say, externally, ‘You look so happy playing,' that's a win.” There was cause for joy on Friday when, 13 years after she reigned as the top junior, Townsend captured the No. On Saturday, Townsend and Zhang closed out the title with a 6-1, 6-1 win over Caroline Dolehide and Sofia Kenin in just 48 minutes. It marked Townsend's 10th career WTA doubles title and Zhang's 15th. The outcome ends Katerina Sinakova's 46-week reign at No. She and Townsend have been playing together since 2024, when they won titles at Wimbledon and the year-end WTA Tour championships. When Siniakova chose to play singles at the Prague Open, Townsend approached Zhang, and the two won their first two matches. Townsend's singles run ended Friday with a 6-4, 7-6 (4) loss to Leylah Fernandez. But earlier in the tournament, after beating No. 6 seed Sofia Kenin, Townsend presided over a sprawling, illuminating press conference. “There hasn't been anyone who has gone through what I went through since I went through it, so I think things have changed a little bit -- which is great, right?” Townsend said. Thirteen years after her breakout as a junior champion, Taylor Townsend's path through criticism, setbacks, and reinvention has brought her to the top of the doubles rankings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has reclaimed her spot as Britain's No. 1 following a stellar start to her hardcourt season, having just been told exactly what she needs to do after losing in the Washington heat. The British player made it to the semi-finals of the Citi Open in both singles and doubles, partnering with Elena Rybakina, who shared what she is really like, and her performance has catapulted her past Katie Boulter in the WTA rankings. Raducanu has chalked up 21 tour match victories in 2025, marking her highest single-season tally, and amassed the necessary 195 points to climb to world No. Perhaps most notably, if Raducanu can crack the top 32 before the U.S. Open, she'll be seeded, boosting her chances of a favorable draw as she seeks to emulate her 2021 title-winning run. Raducanu didn't participate in the Canadian Open last year and now has a chance to rack up some valuable ranking points, having been pitted against Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round. She could potentially face off against Wimbledon runner-up Amanda Anisimova in the third round. Citi Open finalists Leylah Fernandez and Anna Kalinskaya are among the major climbers in this week's rankings shake-up, with Fernandez demolishing her rival 6-1 6-2 in the Washington final to secure her fourth career crown. She started the tournament ranked 36th in the world and surged to 24th, while Kalinskaya jumped from 48th to 31st in substantial leaps ahead of the year's final Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows. British star Fran Jones exploded into the top 100 at 84th and now joins three other players representing the nation in triple digits, alongside Raducanu, Boulter and Sonay Kartal. She sailed through the entire tournament without dropping a set. The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wim Fissette, fresh from leading Iga Swiatek to Wimbledon glory earlier this month, has made some rather startling comments about his future within the sport. After all, he has only been partnered with the Polish superstar for nine months, with the success they have already achieved being really impressive. However, whilst speaking to the Tennis Insider Club, he made it clear that his plans, or hopes to transition into that area of the sport, are far from immediate. He began by denying any suggestion it would happen soon: “Not necessarily. I'm actually happy and proud to be a WTA coach. “I would like, maybe one day, to work with someone on the ATP, but I would not see it as an upgrade. “But as a challenge at some point it would be interesting. But I have never had any offers from the ATP. This comes many weeks after Fissette explained how coaching Swiatek is different from Naomi Osaka, with the former having just overtaken the latter on Grand Slam titles. Given the steady progress made under his guidance, culminating in that remarkable Wimbledon title earlier this month, there's no reason why Fissette would be looking for a chance anytime soon. And similarly, Iga Swiatek only now seems to have recaptured her motivation after going so uncharacteristically long without a trophy. With that in mind, it's not expected that these comments will have any bearing on what the future holds for this partnership. What Fissette and Swiatek could achieve together is limitless, and it's really exciting to imagine what the future holds for them both. The ATP may interest him, but it is definitely not in his immediate plans.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz – the top two players in the ATP rankings – both decided to skip the Toronto Masters 1000, which also had to suffer the forfeit of Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper. Their clash in Paris was one of the most electrifying of the modern era, considering that the 22-year-old from Murcia cancelled out three match points in a row to his top rival before winning in the fifth set after almost five and a half hours. 1 got his revenge in the final act of Wimbledon just over two weeks ago, coming back from a set down and preventing Carlitos from lifting his third trophy in a row at Church Road. Both allowed themselves a period of relaxation after the third Major of the season and resumed practicing a few days ago, respectively in Monte Carlo and Spain. Fans will have to wait until the Cincinnati Masters 1000 to see these young champions in action, who have already set the US Open as their main goal this summer. In a long interview with 'Il Corriere della Sera', former Italian ace Paolo Canè commented on Sinner and Alcaraz's choice to skip Toronto: "Although they are still very young, Jannik and Carlitos are already true champions. Not only do I agree with their decision to skip this tournament, but I am happy about it. It means that they have understood that they have to preserve their body and not just think about results, but about prolonging their careers. The secret in today's tennis is to play little and win often."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Americans have seen many tennis greats come and go during their esteemed history in the sport. The country boasts some of the most accomplished singles players of all time, including Serena Williams, Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi. Coco Gauff is a two-time Grand Slam champion, while Taylor Fritz reached the 2024 US Open final. Furthermore, Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe have both reached the Grand Slam semi-final stage. However, American male players are suffering from a drought. Learner Tien has enjoyed a breakout 2025 campaign after initially stunning tennis fans at the Australian Open. The 19-year-old beat former world number one Daniil Medvedev on his way to a fourth round appearance at the 2025 Australian Open. Fast forward to July, and Tien is competing in the Canadian Open. As per OptaAce, since the ATP format's introduction in 1990, Learner Tien is now the fifth American teenager to win ATP Masters 1000 matches on multiple surfaces, along with Jim Courier, Michael Chang, Pete Sampras and Andy Roddick. Tien's next opponent in Canada, Denis Shapovalov, has come into the tournament in red-hot form, having recently won the Los Cabos Open. An abundance of talent 💫Learner Tien moves past compatriot Smith 6-4 7-5 and will now face home hope Shapovalov in the second round. Tien can take some positives going into the match. He registered a strong serving performance against Colton Smith, winning 81 per cent of his first serve points and 71 per cent of his second serve points. However, the American will need to improve his overall consistency on serve, having struck six double faults against Smith.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday's (July 27) Washington Open women's singles final was a memorable outing for a former Grand Slam runner-up, as it secured the biggest title of her tennis career to date. Leylah Fernandez, defeated Anna Kalinskaya 6-1 6-2 in DC, to win her first WTA Tour 500 event. It is also the first tournament she has won in America as her previous wins came at 250 level events in Mexico and Hong Kong. The Canadian's commanding win came in just over an hour and was a much more straightforward affair than her semi-final contest with Elena Rybakina, which lasted over three hours as all three sets were decided by a tie-break. However, Kalinskaya failed to convert either and did not get another break opportunity for the remainder of the contest as Fernandez began to dominate proceedings from that moment onwards. Whilst Kalinskya failed to break her opponent at any time, Fernandez converted four out of her six break points during the final, with two each in both sets. The Canadian, who was a finalist at the 2021 US Open, was full of praise for those in her inner circle after winning in Washington. Fernandez will next be in action at the Canadian Open in Montreal, with her first match scheduled for Tuesday (July 29) against Australia's Maya Joint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is nobody in tennis quite like Corentin Moutet. Although he's far from a household name that transcends the sport like Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, hardcore tennis fans have all the time in the world for a player like Moutet. Not only is he a great underdog story as a 5-foot-11 grinder who has had to work his way up the professional tennis ladder, but he's also got a showman quality that is all too rare in the sport these days. Moutet took full advantage of being awarded a “lucky loser” spot in Washington by defeating Alexandre Muller, Dan Evans, and Daniil Medvedev before losing to Alex de Minaur in the semis. The 26-year-old now faces a quick turnaround for his showdown with Jenson Brooksby in Toronto on Monday. After taking all of 2024 off, Brooksby has been quite impressive this season. Brooksby's once promising career looks to be reignited. Moutet and Brooksby come into Monday's match in decent form, and the stylistic matchup – neither player is going to smash the other off the court – should lead to a long, winding match.

The left-handed Fernandez, a 22-year-old from Canada who is ranked 36th, wrapped up a big week of tight matches with a lopsided victory, defeating Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-2 in the final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aussie star Alex de Minaur miraculously saved three championship points and came back from 4-1 down in the deciding set to clinch his 10th ATP Tour title on Monday. The 26-year-old downed No.12 seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 5-7, 6-1, 7-6(3) in a thrilling final to win the tournament and secure about $640,000 in prize money. It is De Minaur's eighth career title on hard courts. He was runner-up at the same tournament in 2018. READ MORE: Aussie Piastri claims Belgian Grand Prix in major coup READ MORE: Saints pull off greatest final-quarter comeback ever It looked like he would fall at the final hurdle again when Fokina raced out to a big lead in the third set. But De Minaur fought back and saved three championship points, before winning the tiebreak to seal an epic victory. Alex De Minaur of Australia celebrates winning the Washington Open. Fokina dropped to 0-4 in tournament finals and he slumped to his chair in tears following the match. He remains the highest-ranked man without a title. In a show of pure class, De Minaur walked over to a crying Fokina and sat beside him on his chair and gave some words of encouragement. "I wanna start with Alejandro, as I told you and your team, you're way too good to not have one of these," De Minaur said. No one on the tour wants to play you. De Minaur is yet to win a major and will be eyeing the US Open, which begins August 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alex de Minaur has blown the tennis world away with a beautiful gesture for his devastated opponent after the Washington final. De Minaur saved three championship points to win the 10th ATP title of his career on Sunday, prevailing 5-7 6-1 7-6 (3) against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Fokina was a shattered man after letting three championship points slip at 5-3 in the third - the third of which came when de Minaur produced some insane scramble to survive. De Minaur noticed how distraught his opponent was and immediately went to console him. The Aussie was seen sitting next to Fikona before wrapping an arm around his opponent and offering some words of encouragement. Tennis fans and commentators were blown away by de Minaur's gesture, which came before he'd celebrated the victory properly. He also offered some kind words for Fokina in his victory speech, saying: "You're way too good to not have one of these (trophies). No one on the tour wants to play you. One person wrote on social media: "Hard not to feel for Alejandro Davidovich Fokina today and hard not to appreciate how kind this was of Alex De Minaur." Another commented: "I have a newfound respect for Alex De Minaur after he consoled Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Alex de Minaur walks over & sits with Alejandro Davidovich Fokina to console him after beating him in the Washington final. Heartbreaking match for Foki… he had 3 championship points to win his first title.This is class… one of the moments of the year. The others are Pat Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis. Before the tournament began, de Minaur said he was adamant he was at his “peak” and big wins had to start coming. Everything is just there for me to go out and perform,” he said. “I can really have a swing these next three or four years and really show that I'm at my peak and break through some barriers.” Jannik Sinner triumph could force Aussie coach to backflip on exit call Flood of support after tennis rocked by news about Wimbledon finalist With no rankings points to defend after Wimbledon because of a hip injury he suffered last year, the Aussie will only climb higher in the rankings before Flushing Meadows. The 26-year-old took a break after the French Open after feeling burnt out, and it appears to be working wonders.</p>
