“Republicans and any Democrats who vote for this should forever keep Mandela's name out of their mouths,” Tlaib said.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) has denounced a bill advancing through the House that threatens sanctions on South Africa over its genocide case against Israel in the Hague and other actions against Israel, calling it an “extremist disgrace.”

Last Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee overwhelmingly voted to advance a bill that requires the U.S. to reexamine its relationship with South Africa and proposes sanctions on South African officials, specifically naming leaders of the African National Congress party. The legislation advanced 34 to 13, with bipartisan support.

It's unclear if House or Senate leaders would put the bill to a full chamber vote. However, the advancing of the bill, introduced by Republican Rep. Ronny Jackson (Texas), is yet another show of U.S. lawmakers' willingness to bend over backwards to please Israel in a time when it is committing genocide in Gaza and ethnic cleansing in the occupied West Bank.

“Congress is threatening to sanction South Africa for their courageous leadership against the Israeli regime's genocide in Gaza,” said Tlaib in a statement on social media on Monday. “H.R. 2633 is an extremist disgrace. Republicans and any Democrats who vote for this should forever keep [Nelson] Mandela's name out of their mouths.”

The bill effectively says that the U.S. should punish South Africa for its criticism of Israel's genocide, including its genocide case against Israel in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and referral of Israeli officials to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for war crimes in Gaza. The bill also names cooperation with China and Russia as a reason to reexamine ties — though South Africa also maintains close ties with U.S. allies. 

Other Democrats have criticized the bill as counterproductive, saying that it would only push South Africa closer to adversaries by cutting ties with the U.S. They also criticized the Trump administration's decision to establish a supposed refugee program for white Afrikaners that was reportedly explicit in only welcoming white people who already experience privilege in the country compared to the majority Black population.

Israel was once close with South Africa, in the apartheid era. Since the fall of South Africa's apartheid regime, however, leaders have been critical of Israel and its apartheid against Palestinians.

Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers have taken numerous steps to retaliate against international figures and institutions in order to shield Israel from any shred of consequences for its genocide.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration sanctioned UN Special Rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese for her continued advocacy for Palestinian rights.

This follows the Trump administration's sanctions on ICC officials like chief prosecutor Karim Khan, after the House overwhelmingly passed a bill calling for the measure, over the ICC's issuing of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former military leader Yoav Gallant — warrants that the U.S. has openly flouted.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Delia Ramirez calls for investigation into federal funds paid to El Salvador to detain migrants at secretive Cecot site

Congresswoman Delia Ramirez is “urgently” requesting a congressional hearing regarding the use of federal funds to pay El Salvador to detain immigrants inside a secretive terrorism prison, according to a letter she sent to the US House's homeland security committee.

Ramirez, an Illinois representative and Democrat who sits on the committee, is requesting a hearing to address “human rights abuses” at the facility, where the US government sent nearly 300 immigrants after Donald Trump's second presidency began in January.

The Guardian viewed Friday's request letter, sent by Ramirez to the homeland security committee chair, Andrew Garbarino, a New York Republican. Details continue to emerge regarding the treatment of Venezuelans by Salvadorian prison officials.

On 18 July, the US, El Salvador and Venezuela engaged in a prisoner swap that released 252 Venezuelan men from the notorious Central American megaprison.

According to press reports, Venezuelan immigrants who were sent by the US to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot for its Spanish acronym, have said they were subjected to horrific abuse, including beatings, torture, denial of food and, in one case, sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the men said they endured “state-sanctioned torture”, the Guardian reported.

“I am concerned that, in paying the Salvadoran government to detain immigrants at Cecot, the administration funded human rights violations with taxpayer dollars,” Ramirez's letter says. “I urgently request that we hold a hearing on how US funds were used to enable these flagrant human rights abuses at Cecot.”

Garbarino did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment about Ramirez's letter.

The second Trump administration has designated a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, a foreign terrorist organization. In March, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act and claimed that the Venezuelan government had sent members of Tren de Aragua to “invade” the US.

Intelligence agencies reportedly contradicted the administration's claims linking the gang to the Venezuelan government. But in mid-March, immigration officers quietly filled planes with Venezuelan and Salvadorian immigrants who were detained by the US and quickly sent them to El Salvador to be detained in the Cecot prison.

A federal judge ordered the planes to return after they took off. Despite the court order, the flights arrived in El Salvador, setting the stage for a unresolved court battle between the Trump administration and the federal judiciary.

The Trump administration sent more people to El Salvador's Cecot prison later in March.

After the expulsions and deportations, news reports revealed that the US government relied on flimsy evidence to accuse the deported immigrants of gang membership.

One case that gained significant media attention was that of Andry Hernández Romero, a 32-year-old gay makeup artist whose crown tattoos near the words “Mom” and “Dad” in Spanish were cited as evidence that he was a gang member.

The Venezuelan men were detained in Cecot for months and released on 28 July in a prisoner swap. The Venezuelan men were sent back to Venezuela, while a number of US nationals detained in the country were returned to the US – among them a former US marine who had been convicted of a triple murder. The Salvadorian men sent to Cecot by the US government were not released as part of the swap.

After his release, Hernández Romero told journalists his time in Cecot was “an encounter with torture and death”, Reuters reported. “Many of our fellows have wounds from the nightsticks; they have fractured ribs, fractured fingers and toes, marks from the handcuffs, others have marks on their chests, on their face … from the projectiles.”

In another interview with Venezuelan media, Hernández Romero said he was sexually abused by guards.

The Venezuelan government has said it will investigate El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, a close Trump ally, over the alleged abuses.

Bukele's Cecot prison has been a defining centerpiece of his administration in recent years. In 2022, Bukele declared a state of exception, leading to a massive crackdown on gangs in the country and the construction of a network of secretive prisons, including Cecot. Bukele's government has invited US representatives, social media influencers and international media to tour the facility.

Details of the deal between the US government and El Salvador to detain the nearly 300 immigrants are still mired in secrecy. The US frequently invoked the “state secrets” privilege during court proceedings to avoid any disclosures regarding its deal with Bukele.

In recent months, more questions have arisen regarding the deal between the Trump administration and Bukele. During the Alien Enemies Act expulsions, the Trump administration expelled a top MS-13 leader to El Salvador and is currently trying to return a second one, leading to accusations that the US is trying to do a favor for Bukele.

Bukele reportedly requested the return of key MS-13 leaders from US custody, critics say, to allegedly prevent them from revealing further information about a controversial 2019 pact between his government and the gang.

Palestinians report that the aid was dropped in areas controlled by the Israeli military and was looted.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The “aid” airdrops that Israel authorized in Gaza did little to nothing to alleviate Israel's starvation catastrophe while also injuring roughly a dozen Palestinians, with reports that they even collapsed homes and landed on tents in the region.

The UN-backed Global Protection Cluster reported on Sunday, a day after the drops began, that Palestinians across the Strip were reporting “injuries, collapse of homes, full exclusion of vulnerable groups, and a sense of loss of dignity” amid the drops.

“According to one mother in Al Karama east of Gaza City, an airdropped pallet hit the roof of her home, causing the roof to collapse,” the group said in a report. “Immediately following the impact, a group of people armed with knives rushed towards the house, while the mother locked herself and her children in the remaining room to protect her family. They did not receive any assistance and are fearful for their safety.”

Health officials have said that they have recorded roughly 11 people being injured from the airdrops, which were sent from Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. 

There were roughly 25 tons of aid dropped into the region on Saturday — but Palestinians report that the aid is being dropped in Israeli military-controlled areas, and that the aid is being looted and stolen, potentially by groups armed by Israel in Gaza. 

Some of the aid, dropped close to the coast, fell into the sea, a Palestinian speaking on the humanitarian situation in Gaza told Truthout. The last time Israel authorized airdrops, at least a dozen Palestinians drowned while trying to retrieve parcels from the sea.

Meanwhile, Israel has touted “humanitarian pauses” in al-Mawasi and other parts of Gaza that Israel supposedly already designated as “safe zones” to allow for the entry of aid. But Palestinians say that these have made little difference as well.

For Israel, the true goal of the airdrops is “silencing the world” in the face of growing criticism and a recent spike in starvation deaths, the Palestinian told Truthout.

“What the world calls ‘humanitarian aid' is, in reality, a new tool of collective punishment. People are dying because they cannot access food, and these measures only deepen the crisis rather than alleviate it,” they said.

Humanitarian groups have condemned the airdrops, with UN Relief and Works Agency chief Philippe Lazzarini saying on Saturday that they are nothing more than “a distraction and screensmoke.”

“They are expensive, inefficient and can even kill starving civilians,” Lazzarini said. He previously said that the starvation catastrophe, which has killed over 120 Palestinians, is a “constructed and deliberate mass starvation” by Israel.

Lazzarini, too, said that the U.S.- and Israel-backed scheme for “aid,” under the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, only exists to serve “military and political objectives,” and “takes more lives than it saves lives.”

UN and other humanitarian aid groups have said that a return to the UN-led humanitarian aid system, as well as a ceasefire and full access to the Strip, is the only way to end Palestinians' starvation.

“Israel's announced ‘tactical pause' in Gaza is desperately insufficient while it commits genocide against Palestinians, who are facing the catastrophic conditions Israel deliberately engineered,” said Amnesty International in a statement on Monday.

Nonetheless, the airdrops and “pause” strategy have been touted by media as a solution to Israel's starvation crisis — despite the mountain of experts saying that Israel is not interested in alleviating the humanitarian catastrophe that it has deliberately and meticulously created.

Instead, Israel is dismantling the aid system piece by piece, announcing last week that it is no longer automatically renewing visas for UN humanitarians, and will only be granting access on a one-month basis.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Hospital reports receiving several patients with gunshot wounds after incident in Reno

A gunman opened fire at a Nevada casino on Monday morning, killing two people before being taken into custody, police said.

The conditions of the victims at the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno were not immediately known, said a Reno police spokesperson, Chris Johnson. The gunman was being treated at a hospital, Johnson said.

Caroline Ackerman, a spokesperson for Renown regional medical center, said the hospital's emergency department received several patients with gunshot wounds.

The local news outlet KRNV reported that Reno police responded to a report of an active shooter at the Grand Sierra Resort at about 7.25am. Within four or five minutes, officers found the suspect, who was then taken to a hospital after what police described as an officer-involved shooting.

The incident started outside near the resort's valet area and may have extended to other parts of the property, the Reno Gazette reported, citing law enforcement officials. Four people were hospitalized in the shooting, and three others were injured, the newspaper added.

In the US, the phrase “active shooter” frequently refers to someone firing at multiple victims at random, and an officer-involved shooting refers to an officer shooting someone.

“It could have been much, much worse,” said Reno's mayor, Hillary Schieve. “We don't know yet quite how it started or who was involved.

A delegation of sanctioned Russian officials, including the chair of the upper house of Russia's parliament, Valentina Matviyenko, arrived in Switzerland to attend the 6th World Conference of Speakers of Parliament, hosted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva, Russian state-controlled media reported on July 28.

The Russian delegation, which also includes Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev and Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Pyotr Tolstoy, all under EU and Swiss sanctions for supporting Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, was granted temporary entry permission by Swiss authorities, according to Swiss media outlet Blick.

Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) explained that under its host-state agreement with the IPU, it is obliged to facilitate the participation of official delegates in international events held on Swiss territory. 

According to the FDFA, exceptions to entry bans can be granted under Swiss law "particularly if the person is traveling to attend an international conference." 

According to a provisional list of attendees published by the conference organizers and cited by Blick, both Russian and Ukrainian delegations are registered for the event, which is taking place from July 29 to 31 at the United Nations Office at Geneva. 

Ukraine's delegation is reportedly led by Parliament Speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk and includes four members. Russia's delegation includes 13 officials.

Matviyenko, sanctioned by the U.S., EU, and Switzerland since 2014 for her role in the annexation of Crimea and her continued support for Russia's war against Ukraine, delivered a speech at the Women Speakers' Summit, a side event of the conference, on July 28. 

Speaking from the podium in Geneva, she repeated standard Kremlin propaganda narratives, accusing Ukraine of targeting civilians in Donetsk Oblast and justifying Russia's invasion as a necessary intervention to "stop the bloodshed." 

Matviyenko's remarks come as Russia continues to escalate its attacks on Ukrainian cities, striking civilian infrastructure and causing civilian casualties. The most recent attack on Kyiv, on July 28, left eight people injured — among them a 3-year-old child.

Matviyenko also claimed that the West was waging an "information war" against Russia and called for the lifting of international sanctions. Matviyenko invited leaders from other countries to visit Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.

The IPU, founded in 1889, brings together parliamentary leaders from almost all UN member states. Although the war in Ukraine is not officially on the agenda, the conference includes panels on "parliamentary cooperation and multilateralism for peace" and "a peaceful future in a turbulent world."

Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).





Videos and social media posts circulating online impersonate the Kyiv Independent's branding, falsely claiming that President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a list of American citizens, such as Steve Bannon, Donald Trump Jr., Elbridge Colby, Mike Flynn, and Senator Mike Lee. 



Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) explained that under its host-state agreement, it is obliged to facilitate the participation of official delegates in international events held on Swiss territory. 

"This is a serious and unacceptable incident," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. "That message has been clearly communicated to the Russian charge d'affaires."





"We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever," U.S. President Donald Trump said.



"Each system currently produced for Ukraine includes three medium-range SLM launchers, and two short-range SLS launchers, as part of a unified complex," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said.

By labeling missing soldiers as deserters, Russia not only conceals its true war losses but also avoids paying social benefits to the families of the deceased, IStories reported.

Another 555 people were freed separately from prisoner exchanges with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky added.

The statement follows President Volodymyr Zelensky's July 27 decree imposing sanctions on individuals and entities from Russia and its allies.

"According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT.

US president says he has told Israel ‘maybe they have to do it a different way' before bilateral talks with Keir Starmer



Donald Trump has said he believes there is a famine in Gaza and he has told Israel that “maybe they have to do it in a different way”.

Speaking outside his hotel in Turnberry, South Ayrshire, on Monday, the US president said people in Gaza needed “to get food and safety right now” and that he wanted to get ceasefire talks restarted.

Asked if he agreed with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who said earlier on Monday that there was no starvation in Gaza, Trump replied: “I don't know. Based on television, I would say not particularly, because those children look very hungry. We're giving a lot of money and a lot of food and other nations are now stepping up.”

Asked if Israel had done all it could to avoid civilian casualties, Trump said: “Nobody's done anything great over there. The whole place is a mess … I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way.”

Speaking alongside Trump, Keir Starmer said the events in Gaza were a “real humanitarian crisis” and “people in Britain are revolted at what they're seeing on their screens”.

The US president said he did not believe Hamas would release the remaining Israeli hostages it was holding and that the US had “given a lot of money to Gaza for food and everything else, a lot of that money is stolen by Hamas and a lot of that food is stolen”.

Asked about the UK government's commitment to recognising a Palestinian state, Trump said: “I'm not going to take a position, I don't mind him [the prime minister] taking a position. I'm looking for getting people fed right now.”

Trump and Starmer were speaking outside the Trump Turnberry hotel and golf resort where they were due to hold a bilateral meeting on Monday.

The crisis in Gaza is top of the prime minister's agenda in his talks with the US president. Downing Street indicated ahead of the meeting that Starmer would press Trump to take a tougher stance towards Israel and push for ceasefire talks to resume.

The prime minister will hold an emergency cabinet meeting later this week to discuss the crisis amid international horror at the images of starvation in Gaza. 
 Starmer is under pressure from senior members of his cabinet and over a third of his MPs to immediately recognise a Palestinian state. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, is expected to attend a UN conference in New York this week being held to discuss a pathway towards this. 
 Trump also suggested he would reduce the 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine before he imposed punishing tariffs, telling reporters he was “very disappointed” with Vladimir Putin.

He said: “We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever.

“You have bodies lying all over the street, and I say that's not the way to do it. So we'll see what happens with that.”

He added: “We're going to have to look and I'm going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number, because I think I already know the answer, what's going to happen.”

            US President Donald Trump has said he will slash the 50-day deadline he gave for Russia's Vladimir Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine by weeks, to just “10 or 12 days” from now. But does a shorter deadline make a difference at all, if, as Trump says, his Russian counterpart has already made up his mind to not make peace?
    


            Possibly. Ukraine is facing its most challenging moment on the front lines since the start of the war. By September 3 – when the original 50-day mark would have passed – many of the gains Moscow is in the midst of making would likely be realized.
    


             Given the pace and strategic nature of the advances Moscow has made in just the past fortnight, it is likely that in the coming weeks its forces will have gotten close to encircling the eastern hubs of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and Kupiansk in the north.
    


            That would massively change the dynamic of the front lines and bring Putin's goal of taking the Donetsk region within reach. It would also make the defense of the land between the east of Ukraine and Kyiv a much greater challenge for the winter ahead. Ukraine would have lost control of most of the towns it relies on now to hold the east, and be struggling to retain a grip on Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.
    


            Trump's words were welcomed in Kyiv, where Andriy Yermak, chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said he was “standing firm and delivering a clear message of peace through strength.”
    


            “(The US President) has already said he's shortening the timeline he gave Putin, because he believes the answer is obvious. Putin respects only power – and that message is loud and clear,” Yermak said on X.
    


            What comes in 10 to 12 days is key. Another empty threat or altered Trump deadline would play into the TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) sensitivities of his administration and be a gift to those who doubt that Trump is willing to really play hardball with the Kremlin.
    


            Imposing the secondary sanctions, or tariffs, that Trump has threatened would, however, have enormous global impact. These involve punishing India and China for buying Russian oil and gas.
    


            India is a US ally, hugely dependent on Russian energy and allowed to buy it through various complex mechanisms to prevent its demand on other energy markets causing oil prices to soar, damaging the American economy too. China is a Russian ally, even more dependent on Russian energy, and caught in a complex, at times symbiotic, economic relationship with the United States, which often teeters towards a trade war.
    


            If Trump sanctions either, it will damage the US and the global energy market, and mean his actions have likely been more pronounced and aggressive than any of the actions of his predecessor, US President Joe Biden.
    


            Chinese pressure could influence Moscow's behaviour, but Beijing has also told European diplomats it cannot afford for Russia to lose because the US would then turn its entire attention to China. China may bank on a weakened Trump rather than rejig its entire geopolitical approach.
    


            And so, we have a fortnight in which Moscow must persuade its allies and customers to hold fast in buying the energy they so badly need. Ukraine must try to hold whatever positions it can, in the face of a furious and successful Russian assault. And the Trump administration must decide whether its threats mean something.
    


            And if they are unwilling to impose and endure a vast economic earthquake, they must find a convincing off-ramp so their deadlines and threats continue to carry some weight.

TEHRAN, July 28. /TASS/. The Iranian Intelligence Ministry said its agents prevented assassinations of 23 high-ranking officials during the 12-day war with Israel.

"We were able to detect and neutralize terrorist plans of the regime (Israel - TASS) aimed at assassinating 23 of the country's high-ranking officials during the 12-day war, as well as 13 similar conspiracies in the months preceding the war, the uncovering of which, by God's grace, led to the prevention of assassinations of 35 high-ranking civilian and military officials," it said in a statement recapping the conflict.

Overnight into June 13, Israel started a military operation against Iran. Less than a day later, Iran carried out a retaliatory attack. Nine days later, the US entered the fray. In the small hours of June 22, US forces attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities: in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. The following evening, Tehran launched missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest US air force base in the Middle East. Trump then said Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which took effect on June 24.

Israeli strikes killed Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence General Gholam Reza Mehrabi, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations General Mehdi Rabbani, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Mohammad Bagheri, Commander of Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters Lieutenant General Gholam Ali Rashid, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp Commander Lieutenant General Hossein Salami, IRGC Aerospace Force Commander General Amir Ali Hajizadeh and at least seven other high-ranking officers at the IRGC Aerospace Force.

Plane maker expects over 3,200 union workers at three St Louis-area plants to strike after overwhelming no vote

Boeing Co expects more than 3,200 union workers at three St Louis-area plants that produce US fighter jets to strike after they rejected a proposed contract on Sunday that included a 20% wage increase over four years.

The International Machinists and Aerospace Workers union said the vote by District 837 members was overwhelmingly against the proposed contract. The existing contract was to expire at 11.59pm central time on Sunday, but the union said a “cooling off” period would keep a strike from beginning for another week, until 4 August.

Union leaders had recommended approving the offer, calling it a “landmark” agreement when it was announced last week. Organizers said then that the offer would improve medical, pension and overtime benefits in addition to pay.

The vote came two days before Boeing planned to announce its second quarter earnings, after saying earlier this month that it had delivered 150 commercial airliners and 36 military aircraft and helicopters during the quarter, up from 130 and 26, respectively, during the first quarter. Its stock closed on Friday at $233.06 a share, up $1.79.

The union did not say specifically why members rejected the contract, only that it “fell short of addressing the priorities and sacrifices” of the union's workers. Last fall, Boeing offered a general wage increase of 38% over four years to end a 53-day strike by 33,000 aircraft workers producing passenger aircraft.

“Our members are standing together to demand a contract that respects their work and ensures a secure future,” the union said in a statement.

Dan Gillan, general manager and senior Boeing executive in St Louis, Missouri, said in a statement that the company was “focused on preparing for a strike”. He described the proposal as “the richest contract offer” ever presented to the St Louis union.

“No talks are scheduled with the union,” said Gillan, who is also vice-president for Boeing Air Dominance, the division for the production of several military jets, including the US navy's Super Hornet, as well as the air force's Red Hawk training aircraft.

MOSCOW, July 28. /TASS/. Russia's Aeroflot airline has cancelled 49 round-trip flights to and from Moscow due to an IT system failure, the air carrier reported.

The press service of the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia said that the airline's information systems were brought down by a hacker attack.

TASS has collected the main information about the situation.

- Earlier in the day, the airline reported that 42 pairs of flights were cancelled due to system failure.

- Later, Aeroflot cancelled another seven round-trip flights to and from the Sheremetyevo airport.

- Flights to Astrakhan, Grozny, Yekaterinburg, Yerevan, Kazan, Kaliningrad, Krasnoyarsk, Makhachkala, Mineralnye Vody, Minsk, Sochi and other cities have been cancelled.

- To avoid overcrowding, the airline asked passengers to leave the Sheremetyevo airport.

- Ticket offices at the airport are temporarily not refunding or reissuing tickets, Aeroflot reported.

- Only tickets for special categories of passengers are currently being reissued at the Sheremetyevo Airport.

- Passengers of cancelled flights can obtain a refund or have their tickets reissued for another flight in the next ten days at the point of purchase, Aeroflot reported.

- The airline confirmed that the problems were the result of an IT failure.

- The carrier warned of adjustments to its flight schedule, including delays and cancellations.

- At present a team of specialists is currently working to quickly restore the normal operation of services.

- The cause of the failure in the Aeroflot information system was a hacker attack, the press service of the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia noted.

- The prosecutor's office has taken charge of the situation with the failure of Aeroflot systems at Sheremetyevo, the press service of the Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor's Office told TASS.

- A case has been initiated under Part 4 of Article 272 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (unauthorized access to computer information), the press service of the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia reported.

- The Moscow Interregional Transport Prosecutor's Office has established a hotline for passengers: +7 999 663 38 09.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. Speaking to reporters during a visit to Scotland Trump said "based on television... those children look very hungry."

The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump met on Monday at one of his Scottish golf courses with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who pressed him on the U.S. taking a larger role in helping quell a growing food crisis in Gaza amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in the territory.

Starmer and his wife, Victoria, arrived at Trump's Turnberry course on the southern coast, and the Republican president spent several minutes chatting with them and proudly pointing out key aspects of the property. But the prime minister didn't wait until they were inside to insist that Gaza would be a key topic in their meeting, calling what's occurring there “a desperate situation.”

Trump expressed concern about the humanitarian situation and urged Israel's leader to take action as images of emaciated children have emerged.

Trump was asked if he agreed with Netanyahu's remarks about concerns of mass starvation in Gaza being overstated and replied, “I don't know. I mean, based on television, I would say not particularly because those children look very hungry.”

Starmer was far more forceful: “I think people in Britain are revolted at seeing what they are seeing on their screens.”

Trump said Israel “has a lot of responsibility” for what's happening but said the country is hampered by considerations of the remaining hostages it wants to see kept alive and freed.

“I think Israel can do a lot,” Trump said, without offering more information.

The prime minister is meeting with Trump at Turnberry but also plans to travel north, to outside Aberdeen, where the president's family has a second golf course and is holding a ribbon-cutting for a third one on Tuesday.

The events allow Trump to try and make good on a post from his first term in 2019, when he wrote of his Turnberry property, “Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!”

Starmer is famously not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name – and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics.

Still, Monday's talks also covered far more serious issues.

The prime minister wants Washington's help in convincing Israel to allow more aid into Gaza and attempting to end what Downing Street called “the unspeakable suffering and starvation” while pushing for a ceasefire.

Witnessing starvation on the streets of Gaza

Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for “withholding essential humanitarian assistance” as hunger spreads in Gaza. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid after Israel temporarily eased restrictions.

But British Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds acknowledged Monday that only the U.S. has “the leverage” to make a real difference in the conflict. Trump spoke before the meeting with Starmer about wanting to help starving children, but he has also repeatedly complained about the U.S. not getting enough credit for organizing past food aid into Gaza.

“Nobody said even thank you,” he said. “Somebody should say thank you.”

Starmer is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move both Israel and the U.S. have condemned. The British leader says the U.K. supports statehood for the Palestinians but it must be “part of a wider plan” for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

Trump, however, said Monday of Starmer doing so, “I don't mind him taking a position.”

Also on Monday's agenda are efforts to promote a possible peace deal to end fighting in Russia's war with Ukraine, particularly trying to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table within a 50-day window Trump set earlier this month.

Trump said before the meeting with Starmer that he'd work to reduce the “50 days to a lesser number” and urged Russia to agree to a deal.

Trump said two weeks ago he would implement “severe tariffs” on Russia unless a peace deal is reached by early September, as he expressed exasperation with Putin over the bombardment of Ukrainian cities amid the Republican president's attempts to stop the fighting.

Trump said he would now give Putin 10 to 12 days from Monday, meaning he wants peace efforts to make progress by Aug. 7-9. The plan includes possible sanctions and secondary tariffs targeting Russia's trading partners. The formal announcement would come later Monday or on Tuesday, he said.

“No reason in waiting,” Trump said of the shorter timeline. “We just don't see any progress being made.”

Trump in the past sharply criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for also failing to express enough public gratitude toward U.S. support for his country, taking a similar tack he's now adopting when it comes to aid for Gaza. The president, though, has shifted away from that tone and more sharply criticized Putin and Russia in recent weeks.

Trump's new golf course near Aberdeen opens to the public on Aug. 13 and tee times are already for sale – with the course betting that a presidential visit can help boost sales. Protesters have planned a demonstration in Balmedie, near Trump's existing Aberdeen golf course. That follows protests across Scotland on Saturday decrying the president's visit as he was out golfing.

While China initially responded to Trump's tariff threats by retaliating with high import taxes of its own on U.S. goods, it has since begun negotiating to ease trade tensions. Starmer and his country have taken a far softer approach.

He's gone out of his way to work with Trump, flattering the president repeatedly during a February visit to the White House, and teaming up to announce a joint trade framework on tariffs for some key products in May.

Starmer and Trump then signed a trade agreement during the G7 summit in Canada that freed the U.K.'s aerospace sector from U.S. tariffs and used quotas to reduce them on auto-related industries from 25% to 10% while increasing the amount of U.S. beef it pledged to import.

“The U.K. is very well-protected. You know why? Because I like them – that's their ultimate protection,” Trump said of U.S. tariff policy during the G7.

Discussions with Starmer follow a Trump meeting Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen at his Turnberry course. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending.

The president has for months railed against yawning U.S. trade deficits around the globe and sees tariffs as a way to try and close them in a hurry. But the U.S. ran an $11.4 billion trade surplus with Britain last year, meaning it exported more to the U.K. than it imported. Census Bureau figures this year indicate that the surplus could grow.

There are still lingering U.S.-Britain trade issues that need fine-tuning. The deal framework from May said British steel would enter the U.S. duty-free, but it continues to face a 25% levy.

U.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said Monday that “negotiations have been going on on a daily basis” and “there's a few issues to push a little bit further today,” though he downplayed expectations of a resolution.

The leader of Scotland, meanwhile, has urged Trump to lift the current 10% tariff on Scotch whisky. First Minister John Swinney said the spirit's “uniqueness” justified an exemption.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday disagreed with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there was no starvation in Gaza. 

The Associated Press

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday used his luxury golf course on Scotland's southeastern coast to host British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, mixing critical discussions on the deepening food crisis in Gaza, Russia's war in Ukraine and tariff rates with boasts about the property's opulence.

The two increasingly close leaders seemed relaxed and happy together, with Trump often treating the sit-down as if he were back in the Oval Office, while also not missing the chance to talk up his Turnberry course – which enriches his family business.

When the prime minister and his wife, Victoria, arrived at Trump Turnberry, the Republican president spent several minutes chatting with them and proudly pointing out key sites around the property.

Starmer came determined to press the U.S. to take a larger role in helping quell what he called a “desperate situation” amid increasing reports of starvation in Gaza as the Israel-Hamas war rages.

Trump at first was focused on complaining about the U.S. not having gotten enough credit for previously providing food aid. But he shifted tone when reporters questioned him about images of emaciated children from Gaza.

Asked if he agreed with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks about concerns of mass starvation in Gaza being overstated, he replied, “I don't know. I mean, based on television, I would say not particularly because those children look very hungry.”

Starmer immediately was far more forceful: “I think people in Britain are revolted at seeing what they are seeing on their screens.”

The president later shifted his tone dramatically and suggested a major recalibration of U.S. policy toward the territory. He said Israel “has a lot of responsibility” for what's happening but is hampered by what its actions might mean for the prospects of Israeli hostages Hamas has been holding since it attacked Israel in 2023.

“I think Israel can do a lot,” Trump said. He added that when next speaking to Netanyahu, he'd insist, “I want them to make sure they get the food,” noting that the U.S. and others are giving money and food to Gaza and that Netanyahu has “got to, sort of, like, run it.”

“I want him to make sure they get the food,” Trump said.

The prime minister also plans to travel north, to outside Aberdeen, where the president's family has a second golf course and is holding a ribbon-cutting for a third one on Tuesday. Trump will be its first official player, though the new course opens to the public on Aug. 13 and could see a boost in sales because of the president's promoting it.

Demonstrations are planned near Trump's Aberdeen property. That follows protests across Scotland on Saturday decrying the president's visit as he was out golfing at Turnberry.

So much attention on his golf courses allows Trump to try to make good on a post from his first term in 2019, when he wrote of Turnberry, “Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship!”

Starmer is famously not a golfer, but toggling between Trump's Scottish courses shows the outsized influence the president puts on properties bearing his name – and on golf's ability to shape geopolitics.

The president talked at length Monday about how he spent money lavishly to upgrade the historic Turnberry course after he bought in 2014, declaring, “If you take a look at the windows in the various dining rooms, they're magnificent.”

Starmer said he was excited to “see this amazing golf course” while promising Trump, “I'll invite you to a football ground at some stage.”

Britain, along with France and Germany, has criticized Israel for “withholding essential humanitarian assistance” in Gaza as hunger spreads. Over the weekend, Starmer said Britain will take part in efforts led by Jordan to airdrop aid into Gaza after Israel temporarily eased restrictions.

Starmer also is under pressure from his Labour Party lawmakers to follow France in recognizing a Palestinian state, a move Israel and the U.S. have previously condemned.

But Trump said Monday of the prime minister potentially doing so, “I don't mind him taking a position.” Starmer has said the U.K. supports statehood for the Palestinians but it must be “part of a wider plan” for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

Trump and Starmer also talked about a possible peace deal to end fighting in Russia's war with Ukraine, particularly trying to force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table within a 50-day window Trump set earlier this month.

The president said he wants to announce a new window to halt the fighting of just 10 or 12 days, saying there is “no reason in waiting.”

As the leaders took more than an hour of reporters' questions, their sit-down at times played out like Trump's meetings with foreign leaders in the Oval Office. There, the president fields questions while his guest mostly sits quietly – even though this meeting took place in Starmer's U.K.

Trump batted away persistent inquiries about the Jeffrey Epstein case and recapped his push for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. He also repeated his longstanding grudge against wind farms – which he sued unsuccessfully to get removed from near his golf course in the Aberdeen area.

On Monday, Trump even resorted to calling windmills “ugly monsters.”

At another point, Trump criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan by saying “he's done a terrible job” and he's a “nasty person.”

Starmer jumped in with a chuckle: “He's a friend of mine, actually.”

As they have in the past, the two men also went out of their way to praise one another. Starmer gushed, “Because we focus on what's important for our two countries, we get along very well.”

They also talked about refining a bilateral trade agreement they announced last month, though there are still sticking points around steel imports.

The meeting followed Trump sitting down after golfing on Sunday with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. They announced a trade framework that will put 15% tariffs on most goods from both countries, though many major details remain pending.

The leader of Scotland, meanwhile, has urged Trump to lift the current 10% tariff on Scotch whisky. First Minister John Swinney said the spirit's “uniqueness” justified an exemption.

Trump was noncommittal, though, smiling as he said, “I'm not a big whiskey drinker. But maybe I should be when I'm over here.”

Spokesperson for the UN Agency OCHA which coordinates humanitarian aid in Gaza, Olga Cherevko, told CNN's Ben Hunte that she has 'no words' when she sees her friends in Gaza as they are in such a desperate state. Aid trucks have entered Gaza for the second day in a row on Monday after Israel eased restrictions. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied there is any starvation in Gaza.

Ukraine's fencing team claimed two bronze medals at the World Championships on July 27 in Tbilisi, a contest held amid protests over the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes.

Sabre fencer Alina Komashchuk, 32, and epee fencer Nikita Koshman, 23, each won bronze in the individual events, the first individual World Championship medals of their careers, according to Ukraine's National Fencing Federation (FFU).

In total, Ukraine has secured three medals at the championships, including a gold won by epee fencer Vlada Kharkova.

The same day when Komashchuk and Koshman earned their bronze medals, local activists held protests against the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under neutral status, without national symbols or colors.

On July 8, the International Fencing Federation (FIE) allowed 40 Russian and Belarusian athletes, including Russian Army Major Sofia Velikaya and Lieutenant Yana Yegoryan, to participate in the championships. Velikaya has also been a close confidante of President Vladimir Putin since 2024.

As a result, the FIE, which has been headed by Russian oligarch Alisher Usmanov from 2008 to 2022 and since 2024, disregarded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommendations to exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes linked to the military or supportive of the invasion of Ukraine.

Protests were held near the hotel housing the Russian fencers and outside the Sports Palace, the venue for the competition, Meduza reported on July 27.

Demonstrators lit firecrackers and displayed a banner reading: "Russian pigs, you are not welcome here! Today there will be fireworks, and tomorrow there will be the Grads (Soviet multiple rocket launcher)."

President of the Georgian Fencing Federation Merab Bazadze told journalists he was aware of the Russian athletes' military ranks, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reported.

Bazadze said Georgia was obligated to accept all competitors approved by the FIE, granting Russian athletes permission to participate.

"Sport should not interfere with politics," Bazadze added.

"This is a serious and unacceptable incident," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. "That message has been clearly communicated to the Russian charge d'affaires."





"We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever," U.S. President Donald Trump said.



"Each system currently produced for Ukraine includes three medium-range SLM launchers, and two short-range SLS launchers, as part of a unified complex," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said.

By labeling missing soldiers as deserters, Russia not only conceals its true war losses but also avoids paying social benefits to the families of the deceased, IStories reported.

Another 555 people were freed separately from prisoner exchanges with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky added.

The statement follows President Volodymyr Zelensky's July 27 decree imposing sanctions on individuals and entities from Russia and its allies.

"According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT.

The suspected agent was identified as a 24-year-old unemployed local resident who had sought quick money via Telegram.

Ukraine's state energy giant Naftogaz has signed its first agreement to import natural gas from Azerbaijan, the company said in a press release on July 28.

The deal comes as gas storage reserves have fallen to their lowest level in at least 11 years, driven by Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid. 

Protests were held near the hotel housing the Russian fencers and outside the Sports Palace, the venue for the competition.

A pro-Ukrainian hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed responsibility for a large-scale attack on Aeroflot's IT infrastructure, allegedly conducted in cooperation with the Belarusian opposition hacktivist group, Cyber Partisans BY.

The Pokrovsk direction remains the key vector of the Russian offensive, where Russia has concentrated most of its troops, said Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces.

Russian troops advanced between the towns of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast as the Russian summer offensive campaign continues, Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces, confirmed on July 27 in an interview with Suspilne.

Russian forces have tried to capture Pokrovsk, a strategic front-line town in the east, for many months. 

In mid-June, the Ukrainian monitoring group DeepState reported Russian advances near Kostiantynivka, about 47 kilometers (29 miles) southeast of the embattled town.

According to Tregubov, the Pokrovsk direction remains the key vector of the Russian offensive, where Russia has concentrated most of its troops.

"There has been some progress on their part in Pokrovsk, a partial wedge between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka. They are trying to develop it, while our troops are trying to destroy as much manpower and equipment as possible, slow down the offensive, and push them back," Tregubov said.

The spokesperson stressed that there is no immediate threat of a direct Russian assault on Pokrovsk, as such an attack would incur heavy losses for Russian forces, which are instead trying to bypass the town and encircle it.

"There is no particular point in entering the town at this time, except to complicate the situation for Ukrainian drone operators, forcing them to retreat slightly rather than engage in the destruction of Russian forces," Tregubov said.

"Despite all the forces they currently have, they still do not have enough people to repeat the human wave assaults that took place in Mariupol and Bakhmut. They would simply be completely wasted. That is why they are trying to take partial control of the city."

Russia has been escalating assaults in the Pokrovsk sector in recent weeks as it attempts to break through to the neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported in June that Russia had amassed 111,000 troops near the town.

On July 18, a Russian sabotage group attempted to break through to Pokrovsk but was repelled, according to Syrskyi. Four days later, DeepState and soldiers on the ground said that Russian forces entered the town, and that a "search and destruction" operation was ongoing.

Some 1,380 residents remain in Pokrovsk and 2,700 in the surrounding areas, Governor Vadym Filashkin reported on July 23. He added that the town is on the brink of a humanitarian disaster, as relentless Russian shelling has made it increasingly difficult to deliver water and food to residents.

Videos and social media posts circulating online impersonate the Kyiv Independent's branding, falsely claiming that President Volodymyr Zelensky has imposed sanctions on a list of American citizens, such as Steve Bannon, Donald Trump Jr., Elbridge Colby, Mike Flynn, and Senator Mike Lee. 



Switzerland's Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) explained that under its host-state agreement, it is obliged to facilitate the participation of official delegates in international events held on Swiss territory.

Ukrainian forces have retaken the village of Kindrativka in Sumy Oblast, pushing back Russian attempts to advance in the area, a spokesperson for the Kursk military group confirmed to Suspilne on July 27.

Stabilization measures in the village are currently underway, the spokesperson added.

The Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState reported the village's liberation two days earlier, noting it was the second settlement recaptured since Russia opened a new front in Sumy Oblast in early June.

Russian forces' push followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's May declaration that Moscow aimed to create a "security buffer zone" along Ukraine's northeastern border.

According to DeepState, Ukrainian forces inflicted "heavy losses" on Russia's 40th, 150th, and 30th battalions during the liberation, reportedly killing the commander of the 30th Battalion.

Ukrainian forces liberated the village of Andriivka on July 22, located just 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) from the border with Russia's Kursk Oblast.

Sumy Oblast has been a key target for Russian forces throughout the full-scale invasion due to its location on the northeastern frontier. It continues to face near-daily strikes, but Ukrainian forces have maintained control over most of the region.

"This is a serious and unacceptable incident," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said. "That message has been clearly communicated to the Russian charge d'affaires."





"We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever," U.S. President Donald Trump said.



"Each system currently produced for Ukraine includes three medium-range SLM launchers, and two short-range SLS launchers, as part of a unified complex," Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Oleksii Makeiev said.

By labeling missing soldiers as deserters, Russia not only conceals its true war losses but also avoids paying social benefits to the families of the deceased, IStories reported.

Another 555 people were freed separately from prisoner exchanges with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky added.

"According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT.

The suspected agent was identified as a 24-year-old unemployed local resident who had sought quick money via Telegram.

Ukraine's state energy giant Naftogaz has signed its first agreement to import natural gas from Azerbaijan, the company said in a press release on July 28.

The deal comes as gas storage reserves have fallen to their lowest level in at least 11 years, driven by Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy grid. 

Protests were held near the hotel housing the Russian fencers and outside the Sports Palace, the venue for the competition.

A pro-Ukrainian hacker group named Silent Crow has claimed responsibility for a large-scale attack on Aeroflot's IT infrastructure, allegedly conducted in cooperation with the Belarusian opposition hacktivist group, Cyber Partisans BY.

The Pokrovsk direction remains the key vector of the Russian offensive, where Russia has concentrated most of its troops, said Victor Tregubov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Khortytsia group of forces.

Editor's note: The article was expanded with additional comments by Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene.

An unidentified drone entered Lithuanian airspace on the morning of July 28, most likely from the direction of Belarus, the LRT public broadcaster reported.

"According to received reports, a drone was spotted at an altitude of about 200 meters, last seen near Vilnius," said Darius Buta, a representative of Lithuania's National Crisis Management Center, according to LRT.

"It is unclear what type of drone it is; we will update the information."

The news follows multiple instances of Russian Shahed-type attack drones veering off course toward NATO territory during aerial attacks on Ukraine.

Lithuanian authorities said that all relevant services are working to locate the drone's possible crash site and warned residents not to approach the unmanned aircraft under any circumstances.

"Today, the weather is favorable for weather balloons, which smugglers use to fly their goods. We cannot yet specify what type of object or objects it is," Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene stressed in comments for LRT Radio.

The minister also noted that the upcoming military exercises in Belarus increase the likelihood of incidents, even unintentional ones.

The Zapad-2025 drills, expected to take place in mid-September, will involve around 13,000 troops and are among the largest joint exercises held by Russia and Belarus.

Later in the day, Sakaliene suggested the drone may have strayed into Lithuanian airspace after being jammed by Ukrainian defenses. "There are no indications" that the incident was a result of a deliberate provocation, she added.

Russia launched 324 Shahed-type attack drones and decoys against Ukraine overnight on July 28, of which 309 were intercepted by Ukrainian defenses, Ukraine's Air Force said.

The Lithuanian military announced it would reinforce air defenses at the country's border with Belarus following the incident.

Belarus has been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war against Ukraine, allowing Russian forces to use Belarusian territory as a staging ground for military operations. Minsk has also recently escalated its hybrid operations against the EU by again funnelling illegal migrants to its borders, Ukrainian intelligence warned.

In a separate incident, a drone flew from Belarus into Lithuanian airspace on July 10. Though it was initially identified as a Shahed-type drone, Lithuanian border guards later clarified it was a homemade plywood drone that posed no danger.

Last September, a Russian drone with an armed warhead crashed in neighboring Latvia. Russian drones or missiles have also strayed into the territory of Poland, Moldova, and Romania during past attacks on Ukraine.

MONTEREY, Calif.—Three people were found unresponsive Sunday morning after a small airplane crashed in the Pacific Ocean off the central California coast, authorities said.

Emergency crews responded late Saturday following reports of a plane down about 300 yards (275 meters) off Point Pinos in Monterey County, the U.S. Coast Guard said.

            The United States blew through about a quarter of its supply of high-end THAAD missile interceptors during Israel's 12-day war with Iran in June, according to two sources familiar with the operation, thwarting attacks at a rate that vastly outpaces production.
    


            US forces countered Tehran's barrage of ballistic missiles by firing more than 100 THAADs (short for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) – and possibly as many as 150 – a significant portion of America's stockpile of the advanced air defense system, the sources said. The US has seven THAAD systems, and used two of them in Israel in the conflict.
    


            Using so many THAAD interceptors in such a short period exposed a gap in the US missile defense network and depleted a costly asset at a moment when American public ﻿support for Israeli defense has reached historic lows.
    


            Former US defense officials and missile experts told CNN that the rapid drawdown has also raised concerns about America's global security posture and ability to regenerate supplies at speed.
    


            Last year, the US procured only 11 new THAAD interceptors and is expected to receive just 12 more this fiscal year, according to the 2026 budget estimates from the Department of Defense.
    


            In response to questions regarding the US's THAAD stockpile and the expenditure of interceptors during the 12-day conflict, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson said the US military “is the strongest it has even been and has everything it needs to conduct any mission anywhere, anytime, all around the world. If you need further proof, look no further than Operation Midnight Hammer and the total obliteration of Iran's nuclear capabilities.”
    


            CNN reported that an early intelligence assessment determined the US' strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last month did not destroy the core components of the country's nuclear program and likely only set it back by months. The US administration dismissed the assessment, and the CIA later said it had evidence Iran's nuclear program was “severely damaged.”
    


            A defense official declined to provide information on the THAAD inventory due to operational security concerns, but said the Defense Department “remains postured to respond to any threat.”
    


            The number of THAADs spent in the 12-day war was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
    


            Despite the heavy use of THAADs during the 12-day war to help fend off Tehran's assault last month, dozens of Iranian missiles still struck Israel.
    


            THAAD is a mobile system that can engage and destroy short-, medium-, and intermediate-range ballistic missiles both inside and outside of the Earth's atmosphere during their final phase of flight. Each battery is operated by 95 American soldiers, armed with six launchers, and 48 interceptors. The interceptors are manufactured by Lockheed Martin and cost roughly $12.7 million, according to the 2025 Missile Defense Agency budget.
    


            The US plans to acquire 37 THAAD interceptors next year, according to the 2026 Department of defense budget estimates, financed partially by the latest addition to President Donald Trump's so-called “big, beautiful bill.” A defense official said the 2026 budget “prioritizes funding in the defense industrial base, a core strategic asset that provides and sustains our military's technology, equipment, and supplies.”
    


            “The budget includes an additional $1.3 billion for industrial based supply chain improvements, and an additional $2.5 billion for missiles and munitions production expansion,” the official said. “The Department's role is to ensure that the President is armed with the best possible military options for any scenario – and all options remain on the table.”
    


            But experts and former defense officials warn that supplies need to be ramped up significantly to deal with the shortfall.
    


            “It is important to recognize the level of commitment and the level of expenditure here in defense of Israel is significant,” said a missile defense expert who has been tracking the US government's expenditure.
    


            “The reports about THAAD expenditure are concerning. This is not the sort of thing that the US can afford to continue to do on and on,” he added. “It was a major commitment to our Israeli ally, but missile defense interceptor capacity is definitely a concern, and THAAD is a very scarce resource.”
    


            A senior retired US army officer who asked not to be named said around 25% of THAAD's total inventory was used by US forces in Israel participating in the war effort. “The (Department of Defense) is looking at wartime stockage levels of critical munitions and attempting to significantly increase annual production capacity, an effort that is long overdue,” the source said.
    


            US interceptor stockpile concerns preceded the 12-day war, according to four former senior US defense officials who say that the problem is most acute in inventories of high-end interceptors that are a key part of deterrence against China.
    


            “What I can say without giving any numbers is I was surprised at how low some of the levels of readiness were,” said one former defense official who left his post in the last year.
    


            “Stockpiles are dropping. We need more. We need them faster than they are being built,” said the same ex-official.
    


            “This is a concern. It was a concern during the Biden administration. I'm sure it's a concern now during the Trump administration,” one former senior Biden defense official said.
    


            “Air defense is relevant in all of the major theaters right now. And there's not enough systems. There's not enough interceptors. There's not enough production and there are not enough people working on it,” said Mara Karlin, former US Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities under Biden.
    


            “You have the challenge of something being both incredibly relevant and also there's a dearth of them,” she added.
    


            There are nine active THAAD batteries globally, according to manufacturer Lockheed Martin. The US military has seven of those and plans to have an eighth active by 2025, according to the Congressional Research Service. Data available in 2019 showed that five of the US' THAADs were stationed at bases in Texas, one in Guam and one in South Korea; by last year, the Pentagon had moved two of those batteries to the Middle East to protect Israel.
    


            Two others were delivered to the United Arab Emirates and have been used to intercept Houthi militant ballistic missiles.
    


            While most of Iran's missiles were downed by Israeli and US air defenses, experts, open-source data and video from the ground reviewed by CNN showed that dozens did manage to get through. Tehran's success rate rose as the war raged on, amounting to some of the worst damage Israel has seen in decades.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Iran fired over 500 long-range ballistic missiles, and it was able to intercept around 86% of those – with 36 Iranian missiles striking built-up areas.
    


            Major cities like Tel Aviv suffered extensive damage, whole apartment buildings were destroyed, sensitive military sites targeted, parts of the power grid were taken out and 29 people were killed. Israel's tax authority estimated in late June that the war would cost the country at least $1.8 billion in damage, but with claims still yet to be filed that number was expected to rise.
    


            Analysis conducted by DC-based think tank Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA) estimated that THAADs – alongside Israel's Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 interceptors – downed 201 of Iran's 574 missiles, with 57 hitting populated areas. The report estimated that the US' THAAD system accounted for almost half of all interceptions, indicating that Israel's Arrow interceptor stockpiles were insufficient. Israel's Iron Dome system was designed to deflect shorter-range rockets than those being fired by Iran.
    


            “After burning through a large portion of their available interceptors, the United States and Israel both face an urgent need to replenish stockpiles and sharply increase production rates,” Ari Cicurel, author of the report, wrote, estimating that it would take three to eight years to replenish at current production rates.
    


            According to data compiled by JINSA, interception rates lagged as the war wore on. Only 8% of Iranian missiles penetrated defenses in the first week of the war. That doubled to 16% in the second half of the conflict and eventually culminated at 25% on the final day of the war before the ceasefire.
    


            Analysts say there are several possible reasons for the trend, including an Iranian shift of focus from military targets to populated urban areas, where interception is less robust. Iran also fired more sophisticated missiles as the war progressed.
    


            “(Iran) increasingly employed more advanced systems,” said Mora Deitch, head of the data analytics center at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies (INSS). “These included newer missiles with multiple warheads or decoys, which may individually cause less damage but can overwhelm and saturate air defense systems.”
    


            Deitch also suggests that Israel may have deliberately relaxed its interception rate.
    


            “Israel's air defense policy may have evolved over time to accommodate a protracted engagement with Iran,” said Deitch. “What appears as a decline in interception effectiveness might instead reflect a deliberate shift in strategy rather than a technological shortfall.”
    


            Still missile defense analysts say they saw clear signs of air defense depletion. “The presence of the THAAD battery in the first place suggests that the Israelis don't have a super deep interceptor magazine,” said Sam Lair, research associate at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
    


            Lair published analysis of interceptors seen in a series of social media video taken by a Jordanian photographer, Zaid Abbadi, from his rooftop in an Amman suburb as the missiles flew overhead. Lair counted 39 THAAD among 82 advanced interceptors in the sample, which consisted of sporadically recorded night-time recording.
    


            CNN was able to verify the THAAD tally from the videos. Over half a dozen experts say the number represents a very conservative baseline. Drawing on calculations about publicly available data on batteries, interceptor reloads, and the number of Iranian ballistic missiles fired, experts believe that the US military fired at least 80 THAAD interceptors.
    


            “The 12-day war in June of this year essentially saw the first significant expenditure of THAAD interceptors,” said Timur Kadyshev, a senior researcher at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg.
    


            “Israel was relatively successful in defending (with the US assistance) against unsophisticated Iranian missiles – at the cost of depleting available arsenals of interceptors.”
    


            The problem for the US is especially acute in the Indo-Pacific where China has tried to keep the US navy at arm's length, experts say.
    


            “From a narrowly military standpoint, the Chinese are absolutely the winners in that these last almost two years in the Middle East have seen the US expend pretty substantial amounts of capabilities that the American defense industrial base will find pretty hard to replace,” said Sidharth Kaushal, senior research fellow at Royal United Services Institute.
    


            Ex-defense officials said dwindling defensive capabilities in the Indo-Pacific was a growing concern for the former administration of President Joe Biden as they used the US stockpile to battle Yemen's Houthi rebels.
    


            “God forbid there should be a conflict in the Pacific, for example, then it really will put a huge strain our missile capacity and the ability for our military to have the munitions necessary to keep up,” said one former senior Biden administration defense official with direct knowledge of the US campaign against the Houthis.
    


            “You have to make choices,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities. “The Biden administration also should have thought about these trade-offs, but they were able to shrug them off because it was early in these wars… stockpiles were still deep enough that they could turn a blind eye to it.”

The Middle East is in crisis, and Israel is at the center of the storm. Since Hamas's surprise attack on October 7, 2023, that killed around 1,200 Israelis, the Israeli military has assailed and occupied much of the Gaza Strip, ramped up operations in the West Bank, struck Houthi targets in Yemen, devastated Hezbollah in Lebanon, hit nuclear and military sites in Iran, and bombed parts of Syria. All these adversaries have links to terrorism: in the decades before October 7, Hamas and Hezbollah used terrorism against Israel, killing over 1,000 civilians as well as many soldiers. Through its proxies and on its own, Iran has attacked Israeli and Jewish targets around the world. The Trump administration recently redesignated the Houthis as a terrorist group, while the new ruler of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, led a group once affiliated with al-Qaeda.

In the circumstances, Israel appears to be courting a new wave of terrorist attacks, maybe even a wider uprising. The war in Gaza has caused tremendous civilian suffering. At the same time, Israel is squeezing the West Bank with raids on suspected terrorist hideouts. Those operations have caused approximately 1,000 deaths and displaced tens of thousands more Palestinians. Along with the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and numerous Jewish settler depredations there, Palestinians and Arab citizens of Israel have many reasons to be outraged at Israel.

Despite that anger and despite Israel's long slate of adversaries, the number of terrorist attacks within Israel since October 7 has been surprisingly low. Israel has not seen high-casualty terrorist attacks or even a sustained series of low-level incidents. A third intifada, in which Palestinians would rise up against the Israeli occupation as they did between 1987 and 1993 and between 2000 and 2005, remains a distant prospect. That is in large part attributable to the success of Israel's campaigns against its enemies, the disarray of its foes, its vice-like grip on the Palestinian territories, and its stiffened internal defenses. And yet that success comes with deep costs. In addition to killing many civilians, Israel's aggressive approach threatens to foreclose potential political resolutions to the many conflicts it is embroiled in. By trying to stave off its adversaries and protect itself from terrorist attacks, Israel will in fact be entering a state of permanent war.

Israeli civilians, of course, remain under threat. Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis have used rockets, missiles, and drones to strike Israel in the last two years. But these incidents have more in common with the evolving nature of conventional warfare, as seen in Ukraine, for example, than they do with the suicide bombings, shootings, stabbings, and car rammings that formed the familiar repertoire of terrorists against Israelis in recent decades. The single worst episode of that kind in the last two years occurred in October 2024 when two Hamas-linked militants killed seven people in a shooting and stabbing spree on a light-rail train in Jaffa. According to media reports, terrorists have killed an estimated 20 Israeli civilians within Israel itself since October 2023 and another 14 in the West Bank. The Israeli military has also lost approximately 17 soldiers in Israel and the West Bank. And those numbers are falling: the first three months of 2025 saw only 18 attacks in the West Bank, while the same time period in 2024 saw 72 attacks. Terrorists have also not successfully targeted Israeli facilities or Israelis overseas, as they did famously in the twentieth century.

Given Israel's constant state of war in the last two years, this death toll from terrorism seems like a relatively small number. Indeed, Israel has not suffered anything on the scale of what it endured during past periods of heightened violence. In the 1990s, car bombs, suicide attacks, and kidnappings, such as the 1996 suicide bombing at a bus station in Jerusalem that killed 26 people and another a week later that killed 19, helped derail peace talks. In the second intifada, Israel endured a staggering 138 suicide bombings, including 53 just in 2002, in addition to thousands of shootings and other less lethal forms of attack. Over 1,000 Israelis died during that period.

In addition to substate groups, such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Iran regularly used terrorism against Israel, often working with Hezbollah, its closest proxy. Among other attacks, in 1992, Iran and Hezbollah bombed the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires, killing 29 people. In 1994, they killed 84 people when they bombed a Jewish community center in Argentina (Iran and Hezbollah regularly claim that Jewish and Israeli targets are identical). A suspected Hezbollah-linked suicide bomber blew up a bus full of Israeli tourists in Bulgaria in 2012, killing five Israelis and the Bulgarian bus driver. All these attacks, Iran and Hezbollah claimed, were revenge for Israeli offenses, including the killing of Iranian nuclear scientists and the targeting of Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon.

And yet now, amid the ongoing devastation of Gaza and after Israel has acted aggressively and provocatively throughout the Middle East, Israelis both at home and abroad have not faced the same level of threat. Israel's adversaries certainly should not be short of motivation. In June, Israel conducted a sustained bombing campaign that destroyed much of Iran's nuclear program. It assassinated numerous Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. In addition to the human and technical losses, the Israeli offensive was a humiliation for the Iranian regime, which had defined itself in large part by its dogged defiance of Israel. In September and October 2024, following a sustained low-level war, Israel defanged Hezbollah through a slew of assassinations, including the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the group's revered longtime leader. Israeli intelligence targeted thousands of Hezbollah operatives in a stunning, bloody bombing spree that rigged pagers and walkie-talkies to explode, and the Israeli military launched a devastating bombing campaign against the group's leadership and military infrastructure (in the process killing and maiming many civilians). Hezbollah, like Iran, had derived its legitimacy and popular appeal from its fight against Israel. With Hezbollah's vulnerabilities profoundly exposed, the one-sided conflict in 2024 was an abject humiliation for the once much-vaunted group.

Hamas, of course, has faced an all-out assault from Israel, losing almost its entire leadership and thousands of fighters. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly vowed to destroy the group. Hamas, in contrast to Iran and Hezbollah, has little incentive to refrain from attacks: Israel's campaign is relentless, and old forms of terrorism may be the best way to get revenge and demonstrate Hamas's continued relevance. Israel has also greatly expanded operations in the West Bank, targeting Hamas and other Palestinian militants there, as well as allowing Israeli settlers to run amok and harass, assault, and even kill Palestinians. Settler attacks in the first few months of 2025 increased 30 percent over the previous year.

These attacks on Palestinians could easily engender large-scale retaliatory violence. And yet they have not, despite all the anger and horror that Israeli behavior has inspired among Palestinians and in the wider region in recent years.

Several factors explain why Israel has not suffered a spate of more traditional terrorist attacks. Israel has devastated, and then devastated again, the leadership of Hamas, Hezbollah, and now Iran. As Israeli campaigns against Hamas in the past have demonstrated, killing terrorist group leaders, especially at a rapid pace, can undermine the overall effectiveness and capacity of these outfits. The constant churn of senior figures creates confusion among the rank-and-file and makes it difficult to stage operations. Guarding against Israeli strikes also creates its own logistical problems. Leaders must avoid phones, email, and other forms of communication for fear of having their locations revealed. They must trust few people and meet with fewer. In short, they cannot perform the functions of leadership if they want to stay alive.

To be sure, disrupting the leadership of terrorist groups does not stop all terrorism. Moreover, uncoordinated attacks, often by motivated individuals acting on their own, can still occur, as has happened in Israel since 2023. But without structures of coordination and direction, terrorists will struggle to pull off more complex operations that have a better chance of success and can kill large numbers of people.

Israel's military and intelligence activities in the West Bank have also constrained Hamas and other militant groups even as they have hurt Palestinians. Israeli forces have flooded into the West Bank, arresting suspected terrorists and killing others. Operation Iron Wall, for instance, conducted in January right after the announcement of a cease-fire in Gaza, saw Israeli troops and tanks swarm into Jenin as well as over 100 air and drone strikes on Palestinian targets. Israeli officials insist that they are simply seeking to snuff out launch points for attacks into Israel, but the Israeli military appears to be preparing for a long-term presence in Jenin, Tulkarm, and other areas in the West Bank that it considers hot spots of Palestinian militancy.

Israel has also greatly expanded its use of administrative detention in the West Bank and cut off some parts of the territory from others, hindering militants—and ordinary Palestinians—from moving back and forth. Such a heavy-handed approach has, at least according to Israeli official statistics, yielded positive results: compared with 2024, terrorist plots originating in the West Bank are down significantly.

Israel has also blocked many Palestinians from entering Israel itself. In addition to cutting off Gaza, Israel suspended around 150,000 work permits for Palestinians in the West Bank, preventing them from crossing into Israel. These movement restrictions, both within the West Bank and between the West Bank and Israel, will no doubt have made it harder for militants to stage operations in Israel proper. Israeli authorities have claimed that it foiled over 1,000 significant plots in 2024 in the West Bank.



In addition, Israel has hardened its internal defenses and borders. After the October 7 attacks, Israel quickly repaired the breached security barrier along its border with Gaza. The Israeli military has also established buffer zones inside Gaza itself and maintained forces at several posts inside Lebanon. It has deployed troops along Egypt's border with Gaza and Jordan's border with the West Bank to clamp down on weapons smuggling into Palestinian territories. And it has bolstered its forces along its borders with Lebanon and Syria. These steps make it harder for Hamas, Hezbollah, and other militant groups to infiltrate operatives into Israel.

Israeli authorities have stepped up monitoring of Palestinian citizens of Israel; Arabs constitute roughly a fifth of the total Israeli population (excluding the West Bank and Gaza Strip). Members of this community were among the victims of October 7, but the scale of Israel's retaliation in Gaza and the West Bank has no doubt radicalized some Israeli Arabs against the country. The Shin Bet, Israel's internal security and counterintelligence service, has increased its surveillance of neighborhoods with high proportions of Arabs and has arrested hundreds.

With Israel on the front foot in military campaigns in Gaza and the West Bank and with settlers on the rampage, Palestinian militants are focusing on operations in these areas rather than finding targets within Israel. Palestinian militants, for instance, frequently use roadside bombs against Israeli forces in the West Bank. But the vast majority of militant attacks on Israeli troops have not resulted in casualties.

Fatigue and disillusionment may be setting in among the Palestinians. Polling in May indicated that 75 percent of West Bank Palestinians fear the war will spread into the West Bank, leading to the kind of destruction seen in Gaza. Although approximately half of Palestinians across Gaza and the West Bank still support Hamas's decision to attack on October 7, this support has fallen from a high of 72 percent in December 2023. Many Palestinians still believe that fighting Israel is appropriate, but the devastation of Gaza is causing many to think twice about the costs of violence.

For Hezbollah and perhaps Iran, another factor is in play—deterrence. Both before and after the 2024 Israeli campaigns, Hezbollah did not want to escalate the war, worried that it would lose, as indeed happened. Iran, too, sought to walk a fine line before the 12-day war in June, using missiles and drones to attack Israel but signaling that it sought to avoid escalation, even alerting Israeli officials in advance so that civilians could reach shelters and that Israel could ready its defenses.

It is probable that, today, Israel has succeeded in deterring both Iran and Hezbollah from attacking it, at least for a little while. Iran has little interest in renewing an all-out war with Israel. Iranian-supported terrorist attacks would disrupt the fragile cease-fire and any negotiations toward a peace deal, leading to a resumption in fighting, possibly with further American involvement. Hezbollah, reeling from the blows it received last year, was unable to support Iran militarily in its ill-fated war with Israel.

Israel's devastating campaigns against a wide range of groups and its efforts to subdue Palestinians have, so far, been effective, but sustaining these efforts requires a high operational tempo that is draining the country. Its military, which relies heavily on reserves, is not designed for long, grinding campaigns, such as what it is conducting in Gaza. Israel has had to raise taxes to finance the war, and constant fighting has created labor shortages as well as an uncertain environment for investors. Weary Israeli reservists are exhausted by repeated deployments and increasingly bitter toward ultra-Orthodox Israelis, who are exempt from mandatory service in the armed forces, an exception that is fostering social and political divisions.

The Israeli military's death toll is also considerable. Over 400 Israeli soldiers have died fighting in Gaza, and another 80 have died on the northern front fighting Hezbollah. Twenty-eight Israelis died from missile attacks in the latest exchanges with Iran. These numbers pale in comparison with the military losses suffered by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, but they are still large numbers for a small, casualty-sensitive state.

The number of Israeli dead is dwarfed by the number of people killed by Israel across the region in the last two years. Some estimates place the casualties Iran suffered during the 12-day war close to 1,000, with hundreds of civilians slain. Israeli strikes in Lebanon left almost 4,000 dead, many of whom were civilians, while Israel has killed dozens of Yemenis and approximately 1,000 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7. Civilian deaths in Gaza are far higher, with tens of thousands dying (in total, close to 60,000 Gazans have perished, a figure that includes Hamas fighters).

Beyond the carnage, Israeli authorities also appear to be pursuing an expansionist ideological agenda long harbored by the country's far right. Actions in Gaza and the West Bank have led to the mass displacement of Palestinians. In the West Bank, counterterrorism operations in refugee camps dovetail with the goal of extreme right-wing politicians to dislodge their residents and to divide the West Bank into isolated enclaves, preventing Palestinians from establishing a contiguous state. Many Israelis may not care or may see their country's conduct as a necessary evil in a fundamentally just campaign against terrorist groups and the governments that support them. Israel's reputation, however, has plummeted around the world, including in the United States. That fall does not hinder Israeli operations today, but it may shape them tomorrow.

Nor is the threat of international terrorism necessarily diminished. Hamas has not hit Israeli targets outside Israel or the Palestinian territories, but the risk of attacks from Iran and Hezbollah remains high. A suspected Iranian operative wasarrested this year in Denmark for scouting Jewish sites in Berlin, including the German-Israeli Society.

Israel's military-heavy approach also reduces the feasibility of other options. Although the October 7 terrorist attacks raised some hopes that a two-state solution or other negotiated settlement might be the final outcome of Israel's destruction of Hamas, Israeli leaders and the public have little faith that peace talks could work. On the other side, Israel's demolition and occupation of much of Gaza has made Palestinians all the less willing to reconcile with and forgive Israel. Israel's actions in the West Bank have further undermined the officials of the Palestinian Authority and others who have sought to negotiate with Israel.

With no political solution in sight, Israel will likely continue its “mow the grass” approach to Gaza and the wider region. It will focus on reducing the capacities of its enemies, acknowledging that any military campaign will have only temporary effects and that Israel will eventually need to do it again and again to keep the threat from growing back. Such a strategy may succeed in protecting Israelis from terrorist violence. But it will invariably harm civilians and reduce the chances of a political settlement in the long term. In seeking to protect itself from terrorism, Israel will be creating costly occupations and forever wars that will drain its economy, worsen social divisions, and deepen the country's international isolation.

The liberal international order is dying, and its transatlantic backers are grieving. During the first Trump administration, many were in denial, but few are now. Some are angry, denouncing a villain—usually U.S. President Donald Trump—for having unnecessarily destroyed what they hold dear and vowing to step forward to bolster global institutions: in March, for instance, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock declared that “a ruthless time has begun in which we must defend the rules-based international order and the strength of law more than ever against the power of the strongest.” Others, such as NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, hope they can bargain—that by coming on bended knee to the White House and flattering Trump, they can persuade the United States to reinvest in its historic alliances and defend key principles such as territorial sovereignty. Still others are depressed, resigned to the order's demise but unable to imagine an alternative future.

Few of these mourners seem truly ready to accept the order's passing. But they should. Praying for its resurrection is not just naive; it is counterproductive. All of these responses misdiagnose the order's deepest illness and thus prescribe the wrong remedy. The liberal international order's crisis cannot be blamed on Trump's peculiar brand of nihilistic politics, nor on the hard neoliberal turn that the order took in the 1990s, nor on the rise of revisionist, illiberal powers such as China and Russia.

These factors did play a role, but the postwar order ultimately decayed because what many saw as its greatest strength—how its institutions, norms, and rules were grounded in liberal principles—was actually a source of weakness. By providing universally acknowledged public goods, creating inclusive institutions, and committing to the rule of law, its backers believed that the order would prove particularly hardy.

The unexpected consequence, however, was an order that was rigid and unresponsive, which only encouraged the forces clamoring for its demise. Paradoxically, if a multilateral, cooperative international order that facilitates peace and prosperity and allows liberal democracies to thrive is to be revived, its structure and procedures cannot be too rigidly pinned to liberal principles. Instead, it should be resurrected in a much more pragmatic and pluralistic form that replaces liberal proceduralism with greater political contestation.

There are many narratives about the postwar international order's demise, but they typically share a common origin point and their first chapters overlap. In the late 1940s, Western leaders were gripped by a sincere desire to avoid the self-interested and shortsighted mistakes that had given rise to fascism and World War II. Led by the United States, they created institutions such the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to protect state borders; encourage the freer flow of goods, money, and ideas; promote economic development and monetary stability; and beat back communism and other illiberal political forces. These norms and institutions established an international order that defined legitimate state behavior in line with liberal commitments. For a time, according to the dominant accounts of its demise, the postwar international order largely succeeded, especially in the West. And its acknowledged leader, the United States, was a remarkably benevolent hegemon.

The narratives then diverge. One story line traces the order's fall to its underlying, often hidden hypocrisy. In this telling, the order never fully delivered the public goods it had pledged because the United States and other powerful actors rigged it to ensure they would seize a disproportionate share of the gains. They never permitted truly free flows of trade, investment, ideas, and people because they feared a world of real equality. As a result, those on the periphery were always running but never catching up. The solution: fully eliminate power and privilege from the international order so it finally lives up to its claimed liberal ideals.

A second, more tragic narrative blames the order's decline on post–Cold War triumphalism. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the overweening power the United States and its allies possessed allowed them to try to perfect the world of “liberty under law” about which they had long fantasized. They imposed excessively high standards of liberal governance in too many policy domains too quickly. They granted authority to a swelling array of international bureaucracies and tribunals that lacked the legitimacy conferred by democratic elections and that seemed, and often were, distant and unaccountable. The solution: restore the kind of order that had thrived in the decades immediately following World War II, when the network of international institutions was less dense and those institutions operated with a lighter touch.

A third story line attributes the order's collapse to sabotage. In this account, after the Cold War, the United States and its allies selectively welcomed illiberal states such as China and Russia into the order's institutions in the hope their inclusion in the order would encourage their liberalization. But this strategy of engagement failed. China's rise and Russia's return weakened the order from within. Meanwhile, the more the order succeeded in producing prosperity, the more it provoked a backlash from aggrieved people in Europe, North America, and Australia, who believed that “the rise of the rest,” in the journalist's Fareed Zakaria's phrase, had come at their expense. The solution: evict those states that are not true believers.

What all three narratives share is a nostalgic desire to return to a moment when the international order worked. They envision traveling back in time to just before things went awry. Yet all three narratives fall short because they fail to see that the order's death was foreordained. The disease that ultimately proved fatal to the postwar international order was encoded into its liberal DNA.

American power built and sustained the international order that took shape after World War II, but liberal rhetoric defined its purpose, underpinned its design, and gave the order legitimacy. Its defenders argued that an international order would advance the universal interests for which all rational individuals yearn. Because all people crave the freedom to pursue their interests as they see fit, the order would remove the economic and political impediments to that freedom.

The order's founders and backers also maintained that its institutions were necessary because the public goods they ensured would otherwise be in short supply. Consistent with individualistic liberal premises, supporters maintained that even if everyone wants common goods, such as collective security and free trade, they would prefer that others pay the costs of providing those goods. This appeared to be the clear lesson of interwar international politics, when beggar-thy-neighbor trade policies led to self-defeating protectionism, and shortsighted self-interest undermined the League of Nations.

Finally, the postwar international order would, like liberal national constitutions, invoke the rule of law to tame power politics. Its institutions would be transparent and its rules binding, even for those who wrote the rules. Decision-making and enforcement would be shielded from countries' naked exercise of power. According to the historian Mark Mazower, the postwar order envisioned “the possibility of carving out a politics-free zone.”



These arguments, derived from liberal premises and framed in liberal language, cropped up across policy domains. A rules-bound international trading regime, U.S. President Harry Truman declared in 1949, would mean that “all countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural resources.” Collective security organizations, such as the United Nations and NATO, were founded because of the universal truth that, as Carlo Sforza, Italy's minister of foreign affairs, put it at the 1949 North Atlantic Treaty signing ceremony, “no nation in the world can feel secure in its prosperity and peace if all its neighbors are not as safely marching towards the same goals of prosperity and security.” Because NATO advanced the good of all, Belgian Prime Minister Paul-Henri Spaak declared, all “the peoples of the world have . . . the right to rejoice over it.”

A generation later, the text of the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty stated that its aim was to avoid “the devastation that would be visited upon all mankind by a nuclear war.” Despite the inequality the NPT formalized between nuclear haves and have-nots, it purported to be legitimate because it had rules to which its signatories had freely consented and that technocrats at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would impartially enforce. When he signed the NPT, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson promised that “the United States is not asking any country to accept any safeguards that we are not willing to accept ourselves.”

Many of these claims were aspirational, and some were hypocritical. Empires—both liberal and communist—dominated huge swaths of the globe, pervasive poverty and inequality belied the promise of economic prosperity for all, and protectionist carve-outs were built into the emerging trading regime. At times, the Anglo-American architects of the postwar order embraced power politics even as they cloaked their exercise of might in a rhetoric of liberal rights.

But it would be a mistake to dismiss the liberal language that legitimized the postwar order as mere rhetoric. Liberal principles dictated how the order's defenders reacted to and channeled demands for reform—and ended up undermining the order's ability to adapt to the changing tectonics of world politics. The international order's liberalism became its undoing.

All international orders are contested; even the most inclusive order distributes costs and benefits unevenly. In the 1970s, critics from what was then known as the Third World saw the global trading system as skewed in favor of the wealthy and advocated for what they called a New International Economic Order, which would address economic inequality by improving the terms of trade, allowing poorer countries greater access to the markets of richer ones, and promoting development aid and technology transfer. Later, as China became an economic powerhouse, it demanded more say in the World Trade Organization (WTO). More recently, India's leaders have asked why their country's growing wealth has not resulted in a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. After globalization transferred manufacturing jobs out of wealthy, industrialized economies, populists in those countries promised to use state power to rein in markets.

But the postwar liberal international order was supposed to be uniquely capable of channeling this kind of discontent into reforms that sustained the order's principles and its basic shape. Because the order provided public goods, everyone should have a stake in its survival. Because its institutions were open to all, everyone could lodge complaints and seek redress through existing processes. And if those processes failed, because institutional rules and procedures were open to debate, challenges could result in deeper institutional reforms. Grievances could be accommodated and revolution avoided.

That was the theory. But in practice, the liberal rhetoric that underpinned the order set off processes that eventually led to the suppression of contestation. Justifying the order in terms of universal interests and public goods meant that those charging it with systemic injustice could be—and often were—dismissed. If all rational, moral individuals wanted what the order provided, then critics were either irrational and uninformed or immoral and disingenuous. When critics from the global South advanced a competing vision of trade centered on developing countries' national interests, defenders such as Peter Thomas Bauer, a prominent British economist, sneered at them as “intellectual barbarians” who failed to grasp the “basic tenets of economics.” When the entrepreneur Ross Perot assailed the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement in his 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, predicting in a debate that year that it would result in “a giant sucking sound going south,” mainstream economists such as Paul Krugman accused him of “telling malicious whoppers.” Democratic vice-presidential candidate Al Gore alleged that Perot was merely selling a “politics of negativism and fear” for his own benefit. Twenty-five years later, Trump's protectionism was part of what made him and his backers “deplorables.” Countries that sought nuclear weapons, regardless of their very real security concerns, were frequently stigmatized as “rogues,” “outlaws,” “mavericks,” “renegades,” or even “demons.”



Even when the order's defenders acknowledged that critics had a point, they responded in ways that left those critics thwarted and discouraged. Rather than directly addressing substantive complaints, the defenders implemented procedural reforms consistent with the order's liberal legitimizing logic. If critics accused wealthy Western countries of not abiding by the rules, then the liberal answer was straightforward: eliminate loopholes, make laws more binding, and grant more authority to international courts and organizations.

As a result, in response to waves of challenges, the order's rational-legal architecture flowered. Faced with persistent debates in the WTO over agriculture and intellectual property—often pitting wealthy countries in the global North against poorer nations in the global South—international trade officials did not adjust the rules to reflect diverse national interests but instead tried to better specify the law and eliminate imprecision. Consequently, countries had less flexibility to accommodate their domestic interests as they strove to adhere to the WTO's laws. To attempt to insulate rule enforcement from power politics, the WTO was outfitted with trade courts, armed with the power to adjudicate disputes and interpret and discharge the law.

The International Criminal Court was set up to hold individuals, including state officials, accountable for particularly grievous crimes. Binding arbitration through the World Bank became the heart of the international investment regime. The IAEA extended its inspection authority to undeclared facilities, authorized its inspectors to employ more intrusive methods, and required states to submit more comprehensive reports. International bureaucrats came to govern matters large and small, from crimes against humanity to safety standards for cruise ships. According to the Yearbook of International Organizations, between 1990 and 2020, the global cohort of international organizations (including nongovernmental organizations) ballooned from around 6,000 to 72,500.

For liberals, arbitrariness is the enemy of legitimacy in political orders and legal systems, and uncertainty is a wellspring of conflict. Transparent processes that are grounded in clear rules and that yield predictable outcomes are the foundation of both order and justice. Eliminating exceptions and stamping out imprecision are, from a liberal vantage point, necessary steps to perfect the order's congenital flaws.

The postwar order had once been more tolerant of ambiguity in international rules and institutions. The order's creators understood that ambiguity is often the grease that turns the wheels of international agreement. The GATT, which was signed in 1947 after the prospects for an International Trade Organization dimmed, allowed states to breach some of their obligations for reasons of “national security” and largely permitted states to define national security for themselves. GATT-sponsored multilateral negotiations gradually reduced tariffs and quotas around the world, paved the way for growing global prosperity, and made the WTO's founding possible. If free-trade purists had been in charge, the GATT would have failed as badly as the ITO.

Broad support never would have coalesced around the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights if it had outlined rights in detail and insisted on binding domestic or international enforcement. Instead, its signatories agreed, “every individual and every organ of society”—not member states—“shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms”—not by coercion—and “by progressive measures, national and international”—over some indeterminate period of time—“to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance”—but not punishment for their violation.

The 1968 NPT, meanwhile, passed muster only because its ambiguous text left both nuclear and nonnuclear states some wiggle room. Existing nuclear powers committed “to pursue negotiations in good faith . . . on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,” but not on an explicit or enforceable timeline. Non-nuclear states accepted the inequality enshrined in the NPT but only because the treaty itself was subject to review and renewal every five years. Had nonnuclear states insisted on a binding process by which the nuclear powers had to rid themselves of their weapons, the NPT would never have been signed, and many more states may well have acquired nuclear weapons by now.

Such ambiguous provisions and loopholes, however, were always in tension with the liberal conceptual architecture and language that the postwar international order's most ardent supporters believed gave the order legitimacy. When complaints arose, internationalists could not easily defend the status quo without contradicting the order's founding principles. So it came to seem that the only consistent way forward was to tighten up the rules, eradicate ambiguities, and make enforcement more binding. In contrast with the GATT, for instance, the WTO made the national security exceptions that countries sought to attain reviewable and subject to reversal. A litany of new human rights treaties and protocols subjected the domestic conduct of states to judicial review. In 1995, the NPT was extended indefinitely, further legalizing the nuclear nonproliferation regime.



Yet these very steps, taken to preserve the order, ultimately made it more brittle and fragile. Conflicts of interest do not simply disappear. If the aggrieved are denied the opportunity to express their discontent within institutions, they will seek solutions elsewhere. To distance international institutions from the pitfalls of power politics is also to divorce them from the rejuvenating spring of national politics. Politics, as the democratic tradition rightly stresses, is a critical source of legitimacy. It connects policy outputs to the interests of individuals and countries. As that connection withered, decisions made by international judges and technocrats seemed arbitrary despite their expertise and despite the supposed fairness of their procedures. Increasingly precise laws and regulations shone a bright light on the persistent, unpunished hypocrisy of the privileged. Flagrant violations across diverse policy realms suggested that the order's commitment to the rule of law was rhetorical window dressing. Absent a steady stream of feedback from national politics, absent forums and procedures that permitted adjustments on that basis, international institutions became rigid sites of rules application.

Critics of the international trade regime had long charged that inequity was baked into the order's rules, but these allegations resonated more widely as the rules became more elaborate and legalistic with the WTO's founding. Protectionist U.S. and EU agricultural policies were, for instance, increasingly called out as evidence of systemic rot. As India's Minister of Commerce and Industry Arun Jaitley put it in 2003, these rules stood “against equity, justice and fair play.” The scholar Matthew Stephen's analysis of speeches made by representatives of global South countries at WTO meetings confirms that, between 2001 and 2013, officials not only objected to Western hypocrisy on trade but raised growing doubts about the core values of reciprocity and open trade on which the postwar regime was based.

As new rules piled up in the nuclear domain, non-nuclear states began to question more openly the definition of the public good that the order's institutions claimed to uphold. After the NPT was made permanent, nuclear powers showed little interest in taking meaningful steps toward nuclear abolition, and the broader nuclear regime rested on the premise that nuclear deterrence remained a vital pillar of global stability. India's foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, wrote in Foreign Affairs in 1998 that the world's nuclear powers were propping up a system of “nuclear apartheid,” suggesting that the system was intrinsically corrupt and beyond reform. Critics charged the nuclear powers with hypocrisy, for example by turning a blind eye to Israel's hidden nuclear deterrent and by granting India a waiver from the nuclear export control regime, which prompted one diplomat to quip to Reuters: “NPT RIP?” Thanks to the NPT's legitimacy deficit, the “Humanitarian Initiative,” which denied the value of nuclear deterrence to national and human security, swiftly gathered steam. In 2017 a large majority of UN member states—but not a single nuclear weapons power—fundamentally challenged the existing nuclear regime by approving the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, more commonly known as the Nuclear Ban Treaty.

Doubts about the trading order's legitimacy also gave rise to increasingly existential challenges. Critics in the global South, such as Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, began to invoke the language of “commercial apartheid” to delegitimize the WTO. In the wealthy global North, people who perceived that giant multinational corporations had excessive influence also called for the order's radical reconstruction. Famously, over 50,000 protesters converged on Seattle in 1999 to disrupt the WTO's Third Ministerial conference.

Rhetorically grounding the postwar international order in the provision of global public goods also created space for narratives of victimhood to arise in the order's core. If a cooperative global order served the global good, and if constructing it was an act of global generosity, could it really be in core countries' national interest? Critics of multilateralism, detractors of foreign aid, and skeptics of free trade had long advanced this claim. As liberal order morphed into global governance, and as international law became more elaborate and enforceable—in domains as diverse as trade, investment, human rights, and nuclear materials—this line of argument found greater support in wealthy countries. The costs of providing a growing array of public goods seemed endless, and the benefits to the country appeared more amorphous. Populist nationalists such as Trump, the United Kingdom's Brexiteers, and Hungary's Viktor Orban found the political terrain increasingly fertile.

The liberal international order's authority was already fragile before Trump returned to the Oval Office. Gazing mournfully at the wreckage, some of its supporters are, understandably, calling on its most ardent defenders to rebuild and shore up liberal international institutions. That was the strategy liberals pursued during the Cold War, when they excluded the Soviet Union and its allies from key international institutions. But this approach is no longer feasible, thanks in large measure to the successes the liberal international order produced. Despite the rise in near-shoring and “friend shoring,” despite increased protectionism and tariffs, the world's economic interdependence remains impressive by historical standards. Processes of globalization have brought prosperity. But they have also created new challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, and forced migration, that demand international collaboration. And there are more nuclear powers arranged in less tightly integrated alliance blocs, so curbing proliferation is a more complicated task.

Some kind of global order is not optional. It is a necessity. States must agree to some rules of the road to prevent escalation in contested zones such as the South China Sea and to regulate artificial intelligence. Nuclear states need forums to limit their arsenals, construct mechanisms to manage crises, and curtail further proliferation. Collective action at the global level is necessary to blunt the worst effects of climate change and nip future pandemics in the bud.

A multilateral, cooperative, and durable international order can rise from the ashes. But not if world leaders cling to legalism, technocratic governance, and the language of universal public goods. This new order must exchange proceduralism for pragmatism, universalism for pluralism, and technocracy for politics. A pragmatic order must limit itself to issues that most countries agree are significant threats to peace and prosperity. To take just one example, there is little disagreement that the spread of nuclear weapons is dangerous. Yet the NPT review conference has failed to produce a consensus document since 2010. The 2020 NPT review conference (held in 2022 because of the COVID-19 pandemic) failed to produce agreement after ancillary matters derailed it. Sticking points included Russia's objections to phrasing about the war in Ukraine, contention over a proposed zone in the Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction, and disputes about the Nuclear Ban Treaty. A pragmatic approach would focus more narrowly on advancing shared commitments to nuclear safety and arms limitations. With the next review conference a year away, nuclear states should seek to agree on this pragmatic agenda and to grow the circle of like-minded pragmatists.



Establishing a new, more resilient global order also requires a shift from universalism to pluralism. The liberal order envisioned eliminating difference: inspired by its allegedly universal values, it denied legitimacy to non-liberal political communities and sought to transform them into good liberals, whether through coercion or engagement. A more durable order must acknowledge, embrace, and even celebrate the reality of a world marked by deep differences in values. One means toward such a pluralistic end would be to encourage the strengthening of regional institutions—not as an alternative to current global institutions but as a complement. Regional bodies are less likely than their global counterparts to face an irresolvable variety of political commitments, economic circumstances, and cultural values. Historically, when thorny international problems were addressed in smaller regional blocs, this smoothed over differences and promoted regional trust; countries gained experience in negotiating difference. The political scientist Katherine Beall has shown, for instance, that Latin American countries that resisted international efforts to secure human rights proved willing to create regional organizations to enforce these norms. 

Going forward, regional institutions should facilitate local arrangements on issues such as trade, pollution, and migration. Regional development banks, which are closer to the ground than the World Bank, should set investment priorities, and regional security institutions such as the African Union's Peace and Security Architecture should be empowered to engage in more diplomacy and peacebuilding. Regional agreements may serve as a platform to establish the cross-regional and global deals that have, until now, been impossible to achieve.

Encouraging regional institutions also advances pluralism through the familiar mechanism of the balance of power. The postwar liberal order's answer to preventing great powers from trampling smaller ones was to strengthen laws and procedures. The WTO could level the playing field somewhat between, say, the EU and Ecuador on an issue such as banana imports. Wealthy and powerful states and blocs, however, continued to wield disproportionate influence through such legalized processes, which undermined those processes' legitimacy. In a more pragmatic and pluralistic order in which regional coalitions were empowered, smaller states could more effectively balance individual great powers through collective action.

Pluralism does not mean that either liberal states or regional institutions must abandon their liberal commitments. They could still vocally advocate for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. When possible, they could partner with existing rights-oriented regional institutions such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, whose efforts to call out violations of human rights may seem less self-righteous than when liberal outsiders take the lead. In an international order that acknowledges difference, however, liberal actors must recognize that a variety of morally defensible formulas exist for balancing competing rights and responsibilities.

Finally, a more durable, cooperative global order would ground its legitimacy not in supposedly neutral technocratic governance but in expressly political exchanges. Inclusive, representative political bodies sometimes end up representing such a broad range of views and interests that they cannot make headway toward concrete goals: consider how few tangible results the NPT's consensus-oriented review conferences have managed to produce in recent years. To correct this, smaller, selective multilateral groupings should be convened under the NPT's aegis and seek agreement on concrete questions of proliferation, escalation, and safety. The existing nuclear powers would likely still exert significant sway at these bargaining tables, but formally bringing in specialized bodies, such as the current Nuclear Suppliers Group, would give nonnuclear weapons states and activists more influence over selective subgroups' agendas, procedures, and deliberations.

Multilateral organizations must also reconnect their decision-making processes with national politics. Although international institutions should set broad goals—such as reducing carbon dioxide emissions—much of the enforcement should be left to national governments rather than supranational bureaucratic mechanisms. This was the approach taken by the Paris climate accord, which generated a useful collective financial infrastructure to support climate-related policies. With good reason, critics doubt that countries can or will effectively implement or enforce international programs, but unresponsive global governing bodies lose legitimacy and effectiveness anyway. International agreements are durable to the extent that they are backed by, not shielded from, national politics. National leaders need to persuade their citizens of the value of collective action, not hide behind distant international judges and bureaucrats.

Improving the links between international order and national political legitimacy will also require all states, and especially liberal democracies, to renew their commitment to nonintervention in other countries' domestic affairs. Nationalist critics of the liberal international order have gotten enormous traction from the claim that they are the order's victims and that its institutions have subverted national interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin, for example, points to the influx of pro-democracy nongovernmental organizations into the post-Soviet space as the reason for Russian insecurity, the so-called color revolutions, and ultimately the war in Ukraine. Populists in Europe and the United States assail the WTO for undercutting their manufacturing sectors.

A pragmatic and pluralistic international order need not legitimize political repression. It would not require its members to keep their mouths shut in the face of massive violations of human rights. It would, however, place clear bounds on the policies that liberals adopt in such circumstances: they should not use coercive material instruments—military or economic—to effect change or support liberal forces in other countries by covert means. Liberals must turn to more humble but still powerful instruments: persuasion and demonstration.

A pluralistic, multilateral global order might not quite live up to liberal aspirations, but it would foster transnational cooperation and would be more adaptable, responsive, and resilient. By decreasing the chances of catastrophic conflict between major powers and tackling a key set of global challenges, such an order would help maintain a world in which liberal democracy could flourish. It is the best we can hope for—and it would be quite enough.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump in Turnberry, Scotland, on Sunday.Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters

The United States struck a framework trade deal with the European Union Sunday that imposes a 15-per-cent U.S. import tariff on most EU goods, including autos, and leaves 50-per-cent levies on steel and aluminum shipments from the continent.

The announcement came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled to western Scotland for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at his golf course there.

Ms. von der Leyen said the agreed-upon 15-per-cent tariff applies “across the board” to U.S.-bound shipments from the EU.

The deal, while short on details, also includes a commitment by the EU to make US$600-billion of investments in the United States, and to make significant purchases of U.S. energy and military equipment.

“It's a huge deal. It will bring stability. It will bring predictability,” she said.

The U.S. struck a framework trade agreement with the European Union on Sunday, imposing a 15% import tariff on most EU goods - half the threatened rate - and averting a bigger trade war between the two allies that account for almost a third of global trade.

Reuters

The agreement largely mirrors a framework deal that the U.S. clinched with Japan last week, under which Japanese automobiles will face a 15-per-cent U.S. tariff but U.S. steel and aluminum levies of 50 per cent remain in place.

And it arrives at a critical moment in Canada's own trade negotiations with the Trump administration.

Prime Minister Mark Carney faces an Aug. 1 deadline to strike a deal before the White House raises an existing tariff on Canadian goods. Mr. Carney and Mr. Trump have both signalled that a deal by the beginning of next month may not happen, with Mr. Carney saying he will accept only the best deal for Canada.

The Editorial Board: Trump's tariff shakedown takes shape

On the U.S.-EU deal, Mr. Trump said: “We are agreeing that the tariff ... for automobiles and everything else will be a straight across tariff of 15 per cent.”

“Steel is staying the way it is – that's a worldwide thing,” the U.S. President said of his tariffs on foreign steel.

Mr. Trump, who is seeking to reorder the global economy and reduce decades-old U.S. trade deficits with trading partners, has so far also signed agreements with Britain, Indonesia and Vietnam.

By comparison, the trade deal the President struck with Britain in May would see British cars subject to a 10-per-cent tariff up to 100,000 vehicles and on shipments above, a 25-per-cent rate.

Mr. Trump talked up the new agreement as “the biggest of all the deals,” with total trade between the U.S. and the EU totalling US$976-billion in 2024, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Given the size of this relationship, the agreement could set a precedent for future U.S. deals, including with Canada.

Since returning to office earlier this year, Mr. Trump has hit Canada with a string of tariffs: 50 per cent on steel and aluminum; 25 per cent on autos; and 25 per cent on any goods traded outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, with the exception of oil, gas and potash, at 10 per cent. 

He has threatened to increase the non-USMCA tariff to 35 per cent if there is no deal by Aug. 1.

William Pellerin, a partner with McMillan LLP's international trade group, said the fact that Mr. Trump doesn't appear to be cutting steel and aluminum tariffs, or agreeing to lower baseline tariffs with key trading partners, is not a good sign for Canada.

The details of recent deals “show that the tariffs are stickier than we might have anticipated, even for developed economies and close U.S. allies, which is certainly a bit of a bad omen in some ways for Canada,” Mr. Pellerin said.

Opinion: Canada, we've already got Trump's best trade deal

He said the silver lining for Canada is it “doesn't look like anyone's going to get better market access to the United States than Canada, even if we do get stuck with a baseline tariff.”

Goldy Hyder, president of the Business Council of Canada, said Canada and Mexico are in a different position from other countries. This is both because of the White House rationale for the 25-per-cent tariff on most Canadian and Mexican goods – Mr. Trump cited illegal fentanyl smuggling as one reason – and because of the exemption for products traded in compliance with the USMCA. 

Japan and the European Union did not qualify for a USMCA-style exemption and therefore had to “buy down” tariffs with major commitments to purchase U.S. goods or make investments in the United States, he noted.

Mr. Hyder said Canada needs to preserve its special access under the USMCA, which is up for renegotiation in 2026, or possibly sooner.

“Our goal has to be keeping the exemption, and that means preserving and extending the USMCA must be our top priority.”

Campbell Clark: Mark Carney faces the politics of concession

There are some significant trade differences between Canada and the EU – and they work in Canada's favour. For one, Canada is the top destination for U.S. goods exports, according to the USTR, bringing in US$349-billion worth of American goods in 2024. 

Canada also has a much smaller trade surplus with the U.S. than the EU. Mr. Trump has taken particular issue with such imbalances, which he considers unfair − even when they benefit American consumers.

Canada also has an intricately linked supply chain with the U.S. in multiple industries, including automobiles and energy, with many products shipped back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border many times before they are sold to end users. The two countries also have an existing trade agreement, the USMCA, which Mr. Trump negotiated during his first term. 

Throughout months of talks, European officials threatened reciprocal tariffs on the U.S. and prepared a retaliatory package of tariffs of up to 30 per cent against €92-billion worth of U.S. exports. In the end, however, the EU will not retaliate, despite now facing 15-per-cent tariffs across most goods.

Explaining her rationale, the EU's Ms. von der Leyen told reporters that the deal will bring “stability” and “predictability.” Yet many key elements of the trade relationship between the U.S. and the EU remain uncertain. For now, Mr. Trump is maintaining his 50-per-cent tariff on steel. And while pharmaceuticals will initially fall under Sunday's 15-per-cent agreement, that is subject to change.

More details are also needed on the purchase and investment promises. The EU agreed to purchase US$750-billion worth of American energy products and to also invest US$600-billion in the United States on top of existing expenditures, but it is not clear who will make these investments or how they will be enforced.

A similar investment agreement was made by Japan when it announced its own trade deal with the U.S. last week. But within days, Japanese officials started pouring cold water on some of the terms. 

Mr. Trump had claimed that the U.S. would make 90 per cent of profits on Japanese investments into the U.S., but Japan later pushed back and said its understanding was that profits would be based on the contribution made, and the risk taken, by each party. 

Tony Keller: As Trump's tariff walls rise, Canada's negotiating leverage is shrinking

While Mr. Trump remains far from his initial goal of signing 90 trade deals in 90 days, stock-market investors have been reassured that agreements with major developed countries and regions are finally coming in and that the 15-per-cent tariff rates with major economies are lower than the levels Mr. Trump had threatened during the negotiations.

However, 15-per-cent tariffs are much higher than the equivalent rates at the start of the year, and it isn't clear yet who will absorb them − companies or American consumers − because so far, price increases have been muted after companies piled up inventory early in the year.

There are signs, however, that some pain is coming − particularly in sectors that Mr. Trump has singled out, including automobiles and steel. 

Volkswagen reported earnings on Friday and said tariffs cost the company €1.3-billion over the first six months of the year, and that going forward, the German car maker is lowering its operating profit to a range of 4 per cent to 5 per cent for 2025, down from 5.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a sweeping trade deal that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1. 

The tariffs, or import taxes, paid when Americans buy European products could raise prices for U.S. consumers and dent profits for European companies and their partners who bring goods into the country. 

Here are some things to know about the deal:

Trump and von der Leyen's announcement, made during Trump's visit to one of his golf courses in Scotland, leaves many crucial details to be filled in. 

The headline figure is a 15% tariff rate on about 70% of European goods brought into the U.S., including cars, computer chips and pharmaceuticals. It's lower than the 20% that Trump initially proposed, and lower than his threats of 50% and then 30%.

The remaining 30% is still open to further decisions and negotiations.

Von der Leyen said that the two sides agreed on zero tariffs on both sides for a range of “strategic” goods: Aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, semiconductor equipment, certain agricultural products and some natural resources and critical raw materials. Specifics were lacking.

She said that the two sides “would keep working” to add more products to the list. 

Additionally, companies in the European Union would purchase what Trump said was $750 billion (638 billion euros) worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel over three years to replace Russian energy supplies that Europe is seeking to exit in any case.

Meanwhile, European companies would invest an additional $600 billion (511 billion euros) in the U.S. under a political commitment that isn't legally binding, officials said.

Brussels and Washington will shortly issue a joint statement that frames the deal but isn't yet legally binding, according to senior officials who weren't authorized to be publicly named according to European Commission policy. 

The joint statement will have “some very precise commitments and others which will need to be spelled out in different ways,” a senior European Commission official said.

EU officials said that the zero tariff list could include nuts, pet food, dairy products and seafood. 

Trump said that the 50% U.S. tariff on imported steel would remain. Von der Leyen said that the two sides agreed to further negotiations to fight a global steel glut, reduce tariffs and establish import quotas — that is, set amounts that can be imported, often at a lower rate or tariff-free.

Trump said that pharmaceuticals, a major import from the EU to the US, weren't included in the deal. Von der Leyen said that the pharmaceuticals issue was “on a separate sheet of paper” from Sunday's deal. 

And von der Leyen said that when it came to farm products, the EU side made clear that “there were tariffs that could not be lowered,” without specifying which products.

The 15% rate removes Trump's threat of a 30% tariff. But it effectively raises the tariff on EU goods from 1.2% last year to 17% and would reduce the 27-nation bloc's gross domestic product by 0.5%, said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics. 

Higher tariffs, or import taxes, on European goods mean sellers in the U.S. would have to either increase prices for consumers — risking loss of market share — or swallow the added cost in terms of lower profits. The higher tariffs are expected to hurt export earnings for European firms and slow the economy.

Von der Leyen said that the 15% rate was “the best we could do” and credited the deal with maintaining access to the U.S. market, and providing “stability and predictability for companies on both sides.”

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal which avoided “an unnecessary escalation in trans-Atlantic trade relations” and said that “we were able to preserve our core interests,” while adding that “I would have very much wished for further relief in trans-Atlantic trade.”

Senior French officials on Monday criticized the accord. Strategy Commissioner Clément Beaune said that the deal failed to reflect the bloc's economic strength.

“This is an unequal and unbalanced agreement,” he said. “Europe didn't wield its strength. We are the world's leading trading power.”

While the rate is lower than threatened, “the big caveat to today's deal is that there is nothing on paper, yet,” said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank. 

“With this disclaimer in mind and at face value, the agreement would clearly bring an end to the uncertainty of recent months. An escalation of the U.S.-EU trade tensions would have been a severe risk for the global economy,” Brzeski said.

“This risk seems to have been avoided.”

Asked if European carmakers could still profitably sell cars at 15%, von der Leyen said the rate was much lower than the current 27.5%. That has been the rate under Trump's 25% tariff on cars from all countries, plus the preexisting U.S. car tariff of 2.5%.

The impact is likely to be substantial on some companies, given that automaker Volkswagen said that it suffered a 1.3 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) hit to profits in the first half of the year from the higher tariffs.

Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they were holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield, because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said that it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years.

The EU also agreed to lower its tariff on cars imported from the U.S. to 2.5% from 10%.

Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained generally low tariff levels in what is the largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, with around 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in annual trade.

Together the U.S. and the EU have 44% of the global economy. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU has averaged 1.35% for American products, according to the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. 

Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($232.5 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more from European businesses than the other way around, and has said that the European market isn't open enough for U.S.-made cars. 

However, American companies fill some of the trade gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings and legal and financial services. And about 30% of European imports are from American-owned companies, according to the European Central Bank.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is getting his way with the world economy.

Trading partners from the European Union to Japan to Vietnam appear to be acceding to the president's demands to accept higher costs — in the form of high tariffs — for the privilege of selling their wares to the United States. For Trump, the agreements driven by a mix of threats and cajoling, are a fulfillment of a decades-long belief in protectionism and a massive gamble that it will pay off politically and economically with American consumers.

On Sunday, the United States and the 27-member state European Union announced that they had reached a trade framework agreement: The EU agreed to accept 15% U.S. tariffs on most its goods, easing fears of a catastrophic trans-Atlantic trade war. There were also commitments by the EU to buy $750 billion in U.S. energy products and make $600 billion in new investments through 2028, according to the White House.

“We just signed a very big trade deal, the biggest of them all,” Trump said Monday. 

But there's no guarantee that Trump's radical overhaul of U.S. trade policy will deliver the happy ending he's promised. The framework agreement was exceedingly spare on details. Most trade deals require months and even years of painstaking negotiation that rise and fall on granular details.




Financial markets, at first panicked by the president's protectionist agenda, seem to have acquiesced to a world in which U.S. import taxes — tariffs — are at the highest rates they've been in roughly 90 years. Several billion in new revenues from his levies on foreign goods are pouring into the U.S. Treasury and could somewhat offset the massive tax cuts he signed into law on July 4.

Outside economists say that high tariffs are still likely to raise prices for American consumers, dampen the Federal Reserve's ability to lower interest rates and make the U.S. economy less efficient over time. Democrats say the middle class and poor will ultimately pay for the tariffs.

“It's pretty striking that it's seen as a sigh of relief moment,” said Daniel Hornung, a former Biden White House economic official who now holds fellowships at Housing Finance Policy Center and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if the new baseline across all trading partners is 15%, that is a meaningful drag on growth that increases recession risks, while simultaneously making it harder for the Fed to cut.”

The EU agreement came just four days after Japan also agreed to 15% U.S. tariffs and to invest in the United States. Earlier, the United States reached deals that raised tariffs on imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom considerably from where they'd been before Trump returned to the White House. 

More one-sided trade deals are likely as countries try to beat a Friday deadline after which Trump will impose even higher tariffs on countries that refuse to make concessions.

The U.S. president has long claimed that America erred by not taking advantage of its clout as the world's biggest economy and erecting a wall of tariffs, in effect making other countries ante up for access to America's massive consumer market.

To his closest aides, Trump's use of tariffs has validated their trust in his skills as a negotiator and their belief that the economists who warned of downturns and inflation were wrong. Stocks dipped slightly in Monday afternoon trading, but they've more than recovered from the tariff-induced selloff in April.

“Where are the ‘experts' now?” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick posted on X.

But the story is not over. For one thing, many of the details of Trump's trade deals remain somewhat hazy and have not been captured in writing. The U.S. and Japan, for instance, have offered differing descriptions of Japan's agreement to invest $550 billion in the United States. 

“The trade deals do seem to count as a qualified win for Trump, with other countries giving the U.S. favorable trade terms while accepting U.S. tariffs,” said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist. “However, certain terms of the deals, such as other countries' investments in the U.S., seem more promising in the abstract than they might prove in reality over time.''

Trump is also facing a court challenge from states and businesses arguing that the president overstepped his authority by declaring national emergencies to justify the tariffs on most of the world's economies. In May, a federal court struck down those tariffs. And an appeals court, which agreed to let the government continue collecting the tariffs for now, will hear oral arguments in the case Thursday. 

And he's yet to reach an accord with China — which has deftly used the threat of retaliatory tariffs and withholding exports of rare earth minerals that are desperately needed for electric vehicles, computer chips and wind turbines to avoid caving in to Trump's demands. The U.S. and China are talking this week in Stockholm, Sweden. 

There is also skepticism that tariffs will produce the economic boom claimed by Trump.

Analysts at Morgan Stanley said “the most likely outcome is slow growth and firm inflation,” but not a recession. After all, the 15% tariffs on the EU and Japan are a slight increase from the 10% rate that Trump began charging in April during a negotiation period.

While autos made in the EU and Japan will no longer face the 25% tariffs Trump had imposed, they will still face a 15% tax that has yet to appear in prices at U.S. dealerships. The administration has said the lack of auto price increases suggests that foreign producers are absorbing the costs, but it might ultimately just reflect the buildup of auto inventories to front-run the import taxes.

“Dealers built stocks ahead of tariff implementation, damping the immediate impact on retail prices. That cushion is starting to wear thin,” Morgan Stanley said in a separate note. “Our Japan auto analyst notes that as pre-tariff inventory clears, replacement vehicles will likely carry higher price tags.”

Economist Mary Lovely of the Peterson Institute for International Economics warned of a “slow-burn efficiency loss'' as U.S. companies scramble to adjust to Trump's new world. For decades, American companies have mostly paid the same tariffs – and often none at all – on imported machinery and raw materials from all over the world. 

Now, as a result of Trump's trade deals, tariffs vary by country. “U.S. firms have to change their designs and get inputs from different places based on these variable tariff rates,'' she said. “It's an incredible administrative burden. There's all these things that are acting as longer-term drags on economy, but their effect will show up only slowly.''

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said that the United States' effective tariff rate has risen to 17.5% from around 2.5% at the start of the year. 

“I wouldn't take a victory lap,'' Zandi said. ”The economic damage caused by the higher tariffs will mount in the coming months.''

CIA Director John Ratcliffe speaks on the alleged origins of the Russia collusion narrative and whether the statute of limitations applies in this instance.

EXCLUSIVE: U.S. intelligence had credible foreign sources indicating that the FBI would play a role in spreading the salacious Trump-Russia collusion narrative—before the bureau ever launched its controversial Crossfire Hurricane probe, sources familiar with the intel told Fox News Digital.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe is expected to declassify the underlying intelligence, including a classified annex, related to former Special Counsel John Durham's investigation into the origins of the Trump-Russia probe.

A source familiar with the contents of the classified annex told Fox News Digital that while it may not have been exactly clear in the moment what the intelligence collection meant, with the benefit of hindsight, it predicted the FBI's next move "with alarming specificity."

"Ultimately, the release of the classified annex will lend more credibility to the assertion that there was a coordinated plan inside the U.S. government to help the Clinton campaign stir up controversy connecting Trump to Russia," the source, who was granted anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters that have not yet been made public, told Fox News Digital.

"Mere days after this intelligence was collected, the FBI launched Crossfire Hurricane," the source said. "It's really hard to see how Brennan, Clapper and Comey are going to be able to explain this away."

In 2020, Fox News Digital exclusively reported that former CIA Director John Brennan, in the summer of 2016, briefed former President Barack Obama and administration officials on intelligence that then-Democratic nominee former Secretary of State Clinton was stirring up a plan to tie Trump to Russia.

Ratcliffe, as director of national intelligence, declassified Brennan's handwritten notes memorializing that meeting, which were exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital in October 2020.

EXCLUSIVE: OBAMA OFFICIALS ADMITTED THEY HAD NO 'EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE' OF TRUMP-RUSSIA COLLUSION: HOUSE INTEL TRANSCRIPTS

On July 28, 2016, Brennan briefed Obama on a plan from one of Clinton's campaign foreign policy advisors "to vilify Donald Trump by stirring up a scandal claiming interference by the Russian security service." 

Comey, then-Vice President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, were at the Brennan-Obama briefing.

After that briefing, the CIA properly forwarded that information through a Counterintelligence Operational Lead (CIOL) to Comey and then-Deputy Assistant Director of Counterintelligence Peter Strzok, with the subject line: "Crossfire Hurricane."

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained and reported on the CIOL in October 2020, which stated: "The following information is provided for the exclusive use of your bureau for background investigative action or lead purposes as appropriate."

"Per FBI verbal request, CIA provides the below examples of information the CROSSFIRE HURRICANE fusion cell has gleaned to date," the memo continued. "An exchange (REDACTED) discussing US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's approval of a plan concerning US presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian hackers hampering US elections as a means of distracting the public from her use of a private email server."

The FBI on July 31, 2016, opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether candidate Trump and members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Russia to influence the 2016 campaign. That investigation was referred to inside the bureau as "Crossfire Hurricane."

The source told Fox News Digital on Monday that the declassification and release of the classified annex is being done with close coordination between Ratcliffe, FBI Director Kash Patel, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and acting National Security Agency Director William Hartman— along with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who will ultimately release the document to the public.

A source familiar told Fox News Digital that the CIA and NSA have signed off on declassifying their sensitive intelligence that serves as the basis for the classified annex's findings.

Meanwhile, while Ratcliffe was director of National Intelligence in 2020, he provided intelligence to Durham as part of a larger trove of more than 1,000 documents.

A former senior Trump official told Fox News Digital that Ratcliffe advocated for releasing the intelligence publicly then, but that Durham, who, at the time, was expected to release an interim report prior to the 2020 election, declined on the basis that it could negatively impact his investigation, which had not yet reached a determination on potential prosecutions.

"Durham said he wanted to preserve his investigation but was going to release an interim report," the former official told Fox News Digital. "Then he said he was afraid he'd get accused of politicization and disappeared." 

The source added: "Thankfully the real politicization is all coming to light now."

Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to take over the FBI's original "Crossfire Hurricane" investigation. After nearly two years, Mueller's investigation, which concluded in March 2019, yielded no evidence of criminal conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 presidential election.

Shortly after, John Durham was appointed as special counsel to investigate the origins of the "Crossfire Hurricane" probe.

Durham found that the FBI "failed to act" on a "clear warning sign" that the bureau was the "target" of a Clinton-led effort to "manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes" ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

"The aforementioned facts reflect a rather startling and inexplicable failure to adequately consider and incorporate the Clinton Plan intelligence into the FBI's investigative decision-making in the Crossfire Hurricane investigation," Durham's report states.

"Indeed, had the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation as an assessment and, in turn, gathered and analyzed data in concert with the information from the Clinton Plan intelligence, it is likely that the information received would have been examined, at a minimum, with a more critical eye," the report continued.

Durham, in his report, said the FBI "failed to act on what should have been—when combined with other incontrovertible facts— a clear warning sign that the FBI might then be the target of an effort to manipulate or influence the law enforcement process for political purposes during the 2016 presidential election."

EXCLUSIVE: DURHAM FINDS DOJ, FBI 'FAILED TO UPHOLD' MISSION OF 'STRICT FIDELITY TO THE LAW' IN TRUMP-RUSSIA PROBE

On Sunday, during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures," Ratcliffe previewed the declassification and the release of the "classified annex" to the Durham report. Ratcliffe said it would be an overview of Durham's findings.

"What the intelligence shows..is that part of this was a Hillary Clinton plan, but part of it was an FBI plan to be an accelerant to the fake Steele dossier, to those fake Russia collusion claims by pouring oil on the fire, by amplifying the lie and burying the truth of what Hillary Clinton was up to," Ratcliffe said.

The expected release of the declassified annex comes after Ratcliffe and Gabbard released declassified records revealing that Obama administration officials "manufactured" intelligence to push the Trump-Russia collusion narrative.

FBI Director Kash Patel has opened criminal investigations into Brennan and Comey, and Gabbard sent criminal referrals to additional Obama-era officials.

Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina tells Fox News Digital that if she launches a Republican campaign for governor, ‘we're starting out front, in the lead'

Republican Rep. Nancy Mace is moving closer to launching a campaign for governor in her home state of South Carolina.

"I will be making a decision in the coming days," Mace said this past weekend in a Fox News Digital interview. "We're definitely leaning towards running for statewide office in South Carolina for governor."

And Mace gave a similar response in a Fox News Channel interview Sunday, telling host Jon Scott that "I will be making a decision over the next couple of days about my future."

Mace, a three-term congresswoman who represents a coastal district in the state's Lowcountry, gave what appeared to be a big hint of her next political steps as she delivered a speech Friday at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics.

Delivering an address at the Politics and Eggs speaking series, which for a quarter-century has been a must-stop for White House hopefuls, Mace told the crowd that "not only do you pick presidents, maybe you can pick the next South Carolina governor too while were here today, because we're going to be announcing a run very shortly potentially for that as well."

Mace told Fox News Digital that there were a number of reasons why she would bid for South Carolina governor.

"We have the highest state income tax in the southeast, making us not competitive with other neighboring states, and a growing, booming economy under Donald Trump," Mace said.

"But also law and order. My state has been run over by illegals and our leaders have turned a blind eye. And I want to protect women and kids. We've got this gender bending ideology in colleges and universities across South Carolina, and we've got to end it," she argued.

Mace would be entering a crowded GOP primary field in the 2026 race to succeed term-limited Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, who is the Palmetto State's longest-serving governor.

South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, and state Sen. Josh Kimbrell are all seeking the GOP nomination in the reliably red state. They were joined on Sunday by Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who declared his candidacy.

SOUTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL ALAN WILSON LAUNCHES BID FOR GOVERNOR

Mace said that if she launches a gubernatorial campaign, "we're starting out front, in the lead, and it's a two-man race" between her and Wilson.

And she pledged that "if I get in, I will fight to the finish, and I will take out South Carolina's Attorney General, because he's turned a blind eye on women and on children and on the state for a lot of reasons. He might force me to do this."

Mace, in a bombshell speech on the U.S. House floor in February, alleged that Wilson ignored evidence of sexual assault against her and other women. In her hour-long speech, Mace accused four men, including her ex-fiance, of sexual crimes and said she was among the victims.

Wilson vehemently denied Mace's accusations, saying at the time "that allegation was never made to me — no one in my office."

Wilson, in a statement to Fox News on Monday, argued that "Nancy Mace is a liar who will do anything to get attention to distract from her liberal voting record. I've served our country and dedicated my civilian career to protecting children."

"Her attacks are, again, categorically false and are just a distraction from her liberal agenda," he added. "South Carolina families need a Governor who will fight for our values, not someone who will compromise them for political gain and social media clicks."

And Wilson's campaign highlighted that every sheriff in Mace's congressional district has endorsed his campaign for governor.

Mace, who dropped out of high school at age 17, and worked at a Waffle House before eventually becoming the first female graduate of the Citadel's Corps of Cadets, won election to Congress in 2020. She defeated Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham, to become the state's first Republican woman elected to the House.

Mace, who worked on President Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, strongly criticized his actions surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, when Trump supporters attempted to upend congressional certification of now-former President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election.

Trump backed a primary challenger against Mace when she was up for re-election in 2022, but she successfully won re-nomination and re-election.

Mace later came to Trump's defense after the then-former president was indicted for mishandling classified documents. And she endorsed Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primaries.

Trump's grip over the GOP, thanks to his 2024 victory to win back the White House, is stronger than ever, and his endorsements in GOP nomination races are extremely influential.

Asked if she could land the president's endorsement if she ran for governor, Mace told Fox News Digital, "I'll be working very hard if I get in to earn his support."

Mace, who has leaned hard into cultural issues in recent years, didn't disappoint in her speech in New Hampshire.

"I love being here in the Granite State, because this is where real men protect women," Mace said in her opening remarks.

"I've learned in my fight in Congress that we, as women, still have a war to wage with the far left, who want men in women's spaces. They want men in our locker rooms. They want men showering next to our 12-year-old daughters," she argued. "And they think men can get pregnant. I'm just here to say the biological truth is not that."

ISLAMABAD (AP) — The Taliban's top environment official on Monday called for Afghanistan's inclusion in U.N. climate talks, saying extreme weather and water scarcity are having a “profound impact” on people's lives and the economy.

A Taliban delegation attended last year's COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan, but as observers. 

Matiul Haq Khalis, the head of the National Environmental Protection Agency, said the suspension of environmental protection projects after the Taliban takeover in 2021 had resulted in widespread harm to Afghans. Khalis said he wanted inclusion at COP30, which is being held in Brazil later this year. 

Russia is the only country to recognize the Taliban's government.

“Afghanistan is severely affected by climate change,” Khalis told a conference in Kabul. “ Drought, water shortages, declining arable land, flash floods, and threats to food security are having a profound impact on people's lives and the economy.

“Although Afghanistan's contribution to global climate change is almost nonexistent, it suffers greatly from its consequences.. As a victim of climate change, Afghanistan has the right to be present at global platforms, especially at COP30, to voice the damages it has endured.”

Earlier this month, the U.N. published a report that said June was marked by below-average precipitation and higher-than-average temperatures across Afghanistan.




By the end of May, the significant decline in soil moisture had already negatively affected the yield and productivity of rainfed wheat, according to the report from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

“The current monsoon season has started earlier than usual, beginning in May instead of the typical June or July, and is more intense than in recent years. Forecasts indicate above-average rainfall in many regions.”

In Baku last November, Khalis told The Associated Press that authorities had prepared national action plans to deal with climate change and would be updating their climate goals. 

He said the country had great potential for wind and solar power, but needed international support to develop it.

Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper launched his campaign for U.S. Senate on Monday, setting up a high-stakes battle in one of the nation's most competitive states and giving Democrats a marquee contender in their push to retake the majority.

Cooper, a two-term governor who left office in January, enters the race to succeed retiring Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) with strong name recognition, statewide infrastructure, and a record of winning tough races in a state that has trended red at the federal level. His candidacy immediately reshapes the 2026 Senate map, offering Democrats a rare pickup opportunity in a cycle in which they are largely on defense.

“I've thought on it and prayed about it, and I've decided I want to serve as your next United States senator, because even now, I still believe our best days are ahead of us,” Cooper said in a campaign launch video. “I love North Carolina, and I know you do, too.”

During his time in office, Cooper earned a reputation as a pragmatic, steady-handed leader. He focused on expanding Medicaid, boosting education funding, and blocking GOP-led legislation, often clashing with the Republican legislature. Despite the state's conservative tilt, Cooper remained popular and won reelection in 2020 even as Trump carried North Carolina.

The race is expected to pit Cooper against Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, who has secured President Donald Trump's “complete and total endorsement.” Whatley is preparing his own campaign and is widely viewed as the GOP front-runner following the president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump's decision not to run.

National Democrats praised Cooper's entry, calling him one of the party's strongest recruits of the cycle. Republicans, however, were quick to criticize Cooper. 

“Roy Cooper is a Democrat lapdog who spent his time as Governor sabotaging President Trump, doing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' bidding, releasing violent illegal aliens into North Carolina streets, and championing radical transgender ideology,” said National Republican Senatorial Committee Communications Director Joanna Rodriguez.

Cooper is expected to face a primary challenge from former Rep. Wiley Nickel, but Democratic operatives anticipate the party will quickly consolidate around the former governor.

The contest is expected to be one of the most expensive and closely watched of 2026, with control of the Senate possibly hinging on the outcome. Democrats see Cooper's candidacy as a chance to break Republicans' recent winning streak in North Carolina Senate races, in which the GOP has prevailed in seven of the last eight contests.

First elected in 2014, Tillis delivered a fiery floor speech last month denouncing Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, warning that its deep Medicaid cuts would “betray the promise Donald Trump made” to voters. He was one of just two Republicans to vote against the bill, a defiant stand that drew an immediate backlash from Trump, who threatened to back a primary opponent. Less than 24 hours later, Tillis announced he would not run for reelection.

NORTH CAROLINA SENATE SHOWDOWN ‘A TRUE TOSS-UP' AS ROY COOPER AND MICHAEL WHATLEY INCH CLOSER TO 2026 BIDS

North Carolina has consistently ranked among the nation's most competitive states. In 2024, Trump won it by just over 3 points, continuing a streak of razor-thin margins. The Senate races have been no different: Tillis edged out Democrat Cal Cunningham by fewer than 2 points in 2020, while Ted Budd defeated Cheri Beasley by about 3 points in 2022.

With unaffiliated voters surpassing Democrats and Republicans in registration, the state remains one of the most politically balanced and pivotal battlegrounds.

US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital on the US-Israel relationship, Iran, prospects for a hostage deal, and enlarging the Abraham Accords. (Video: Yoav Dudkevitch/TPS-IL for Fox News Digital.)

The Trump administration is set to boycott a high-level summit on Palestinian statehood, co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, scheduled to take place at United Nations headquarters in New York City on Monday.

The event was originally planned for June with French President Emmanuel Macron in attendance but was postponed due to the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. Representatives from more than 50 nations are expected to speak at the High-level International Conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine, with dozens of additional countries listed as participants.

Reuters reported last month that a U.S. diplomatic cable had urged governments to skip the "counterproductive" U.N. event, which Washington described as an obstacle to efforts to end the war in Gaza.

"The fact that the French and the Saudis could not be dissuaded from manufacturing this latest stumbling block to peace is a finger in the eye to President Trump," Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices and director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, told Fox News Digital.

"American taxpayers are paying a quarter of the costs of this U.N. monstrosity, warmongers dressed up as peaceniks. Why are we still footing U.N. bills?"

Bayefsky added, "This latest U.N. confab embodies the rejectionist culture: shove a Palestinian state down Israel's throat, without negotiations, and without Palestinian acceptance of the Jewish state. It arrogantly appropriates the right to decide land ownership and who, what, where is legal and illegal.

"After October 7, and the reality that the Palestinian Authority serves as Hamas's wingman on the international stage, it is painfully clear that an armed Palestinian state means more war, not peace," she said.

In an interview with La Tribune Dimanche on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that "the prospect of a Palestinian state has never been so threatened—nor so necessary."

"[It is] threatened by the destruction of the Gaza Strip, rampant Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank that undermines the very idea of territorial continuity, and the resignation of the international community," he said.

"[It is] necessary, because expecting to achieve a lasting ceasefire, the release of hostages held by Hamas, and its surrender without first outlining a political horizon is an illusion," he added.

Monday's event comes on the backdrop of Macron's decision to recognize a Palestinian state. The formal declaration would be made at the U.N. General Assembly in September. 

President Donald Trump immediately dismissed the move, arguing that Macron's statement "doesn't matter."

U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee mocked Paris' decision in a series of social media posts. "How clever! If Macron can just ‘declare' the existence of a state perhaps the U.K. can ‘declare' France a British colony!" Huckabee wrote.

In May, Huckabee told Fox News Digital, "If France is really so determined to see a Palestinian state, I have a suggestion for them—carve out a piece of the French Riviera."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement condemning Paris' move "to recognize a Palestinian state next to Tel Aviv in the wake of the Oct. 7 massacre."

Key European nations have not yet backed Macron's initiative, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stating on Saturday that recognizing a Palestinian state was premature.

"I am very much in favor of the State of Palestine, but I am not in favor of recognizing it prior to establishing it," Meloni said. "If something that doesn't exist is recognized on paper, the problem could appear to be solved when it isn't."

A German government spokesperson said on Friday, "Israel's security is of paramount importance," and therefore Berlin "has no plans to recognize a Palestinian state in the short term."

In a video statement on Friday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is "working on a pathway to peace in the region focused on the practical solutions that will make a real difference to the lives of those who are suffering in this war."

By contrast, NATO member and U.S. ally Turkey welcomed the French move, with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan congratulating Macron during a phone call between the two leaders.

Avi Pazner, former Israeli ambassador to France and Italy, told Fox News Digital that there is "no rational explanation" for Macron's decision, as everyone understands that it is "not feasible."

Pazner suggested that Macron may be attempting to gain credibility with France's significant Muslim and Arab minorities, which some estimate to be between 8%- 10% of the country.

Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former negotiator at the State Department under both Democratic and Republican administrations, told Fox News Digital that Trump has his own set of objectives and sensibilities regarding the issue of Palestinian statehood.

"It was the view of successive administrations that unilateral statehood would prejudge and undermine the conditions necessary for negotiations," he added. "If France is recognizing a Palestinian state, within what borders? What happens to Jerusalem? What about the Jordan Valley? Would land swaps compensate for territory deemed essential by Israel for security? Declaring statehood prematurely prejudges the outcome of negotiations, and that was the position taken by these administrations."

The French and Saudi-sponsored conference is expected to run through Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The phone rings. It's the secretary of state calling. Or is it?

For Washington insiders, seeing and hearing is no longer believing, thanks to a spate of recent incidents involving deepfakes impersonating top officials in President Donald Trump's administration. 

Digital fakes are coming for corporate America, too, as criminal gangs and hackers associated with adversaries including North Korea use synthetic video and audio to impersonate CEOs and low-level job candidates to gain access to critical systems or business secrets. 

Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, creating realistic deepfakes is easier than ever, causing security problems for governments, businesses and private individuals and making trust the most valuable currency of the digital age.

Responding to the challenge will require laws, better digital literacy and technical solutions that fight AI with more AI. 

“As humans, we are remarkably susceptible to deception,” said Vijay Balasubramaniyan, CEO and founder of the tech firm Pindrop Security. But he believes solutions to the challenge of deepfakes may be within reach: “We are going to fight back.”

This summer, someone used AI to create a deepfake of Secretary of State Marco Rubio in an attempt to reach out to foreign ministers, a U.S. senator and a governor over text, voice mail and the Signal messaging app. 

In May someone impersonated Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles.

Another phony Rubio had popped up in a deepfake earlier this year, saying he wanted to cut off Ukraine's access to Elon Musk's Starlink internet service. Ukraine's government later rebutted the false claim.

The national security implications are huge: People who think they're chatting with Rubio or Wiles, for instance, might discuss sensitive information about diplomatic negotiations or military strategy.

“You're either trying to extract sensitive secrets or competitive information or you're going after access, to an email server or other sensitive network,” Kinny Chan, CEO of the cybersecurity firm QiD, said of the possible motivations.

Synthetic media can also aim to alter behavior. Last year, Democratic voters in New Hampshire received a robocall urging them not to vote in the state's upcoming primary. The voice on the call sounded suspiciously like then-President Joe Biden but was actually created using AI.

Their ability to deceive makes AI deepfakes a potent weapon for foreign actors. Both Russia and China have used disinformation and propaganda directed at Americans as a way of undermining trust in democratic alliances and institutions.

Steven Kramer, the political consultant who admitted sending the fake Biden robocalls, said he wanted to send a message of the dangers deepfakes pose to the American political system. Kramer was acquitted last month of charges of voter suppression and impersonating a candidate.

“I did what I did for $500,” Kramer said. “Can you imagine what would happen if the Chinese government decided to do this?”

The greater availability and sophistication of the programs mean deepfakes are increasingly used for corporate espionage and garden variety fraud.

“The financial industry is right in the crosshairs,” said Jennifer Ewbank, a former deputy director of the CIA who worked on cybersecurity and digital threats. “Even individuals who know each other have been convinced to transfer vast sums of money.”

In the context of corporate espionage, they can be used to impersonate CEOs asking employees to hand over passwords or routing numbers.

Deepfakes can also allow scammers to apply for jobs — and even do them — under an assumed or fake identity. For some this is a way to access sensitive networks, to steal secrets or to install ransomware. Others just want the work and may be working a few similar jobs at different companies at the same time.

Authorities in the U.S. have said that thousands of North Koreans with information technology skills have been dispatched to live abroad, using stolen identities to obtain jobs at tech firms in the U.S. and elsewhere. The workers get access to company networks as well as a paycheck. In some cases, the workers install ransomware that can be later used to extort even more money.

The schemes have generated billions of dollars for the North Korean government.

Within three years, as many as 1 in 4 job applications is expected to be fake, according to research from Adaptive Security, a cybersecurity company.

“We've entered an era where anyone with a laptop and access to an open-source model can convincingly impersonate a real person,” said Brian Long, Adaptive's CEO. “It's no longer about hacking systems — it's about hacking trust.”

Researchers, public policy experts and technology companies are now investigating the best ways of addressing the economic, political and social challenges posed by deepfakes.

New regulations could require tech companies to do more to identify, label and potentially remove deepfakes on their platforms. Lawmakers could also impose greater penalties on those who use digital technology to deceive others — if they can be caught.

Greater investments in digital literacy could also boost people's immunity to online deception by teaching them ways to spot fake media and avoid falling prey to scammers.

The best tool for catching AI may be another AI program, one trained to sniff out the tiny flaws in deepfakes that would go unnoticed by a person.

Systems like Pindrop's analyze millions of datapoints in any person's speech to quickly identify irregularities. The system can be used during job interviews or other video conferences to detect if the person is using voice cloning software, for instance.

Similar programs may one day be commonplace, running in the background as people chat with colleagues and loved ones online. Someday, deepfakes may go the way of email spam, a technological challenge that once threatened to upend the usefulness of email, said Balasubramaniyan, Pindrop's CEO.

“You can take the defeatist view and say we're going to be subservient to disinformation,” he said. “But that's not going to happen.”

Former Israeli Amb. to the U.S. Michael Oren discusses Iran's nuclear capabilities and negotiations with Hamas to release more hostages on ‘Fox Report.'

The idea that Middle East peace cannot and should not advance without a formal agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority is outdated and demonstrably untrue. Indeed, it has done little but exacerbate conflict over the last 30 years and undermine U.S. interests in the region.

The Abraham Accords, brokered by President Trump in 2020, offer a far more reliable solution. They provide a new paradigm for peace between Israel and all of its neighbors, including the Palestinians.

President Donald Trump obviously deserves the Nobel Peace Prize for breaking with the failed Oslo peace process paradigm still sanctified by legacy media and a bipartisan community of foreign policy elites, and for building new bridges of mutually-beneficial cooperation between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Those truly interested in Middle East peace should work to expand the circle of regional normalization and integration. Doing so will not only advance tolerance, understanding and growth in the Middle East, but also provide a pathway towards a lasting solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

TRUMP PRESSURES ISRAEL TO END GAZA CONFLICT AS HE EYES ABRAHAM ACCORDS EXPANSION

This would certainly surprise former Secretary of State John Kerry, who in 2016 declared that peace between Israel and the Arab world would be impossible in the absence of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. "There will be no separate peace between Israel and the Arab world," he declared. "No, no, no, and no."

The Abraham Accords revealed the fallacy of Kerry's claim.

The Accords between Israel, UAE, Bahrain and Morocco led to a surge of people-to-people cooperation in countless areas, from green hydrogen to advanced medicine, from wildlife preservation to water recycling, and from youth sports to interfaith dialogue. Trade, tourism and innovation cooperation quickly grew.

Even in the outbreak of war begun by Hamas's October 7, 2023 terror attack, trade continued to rise. Trade between Israel and the UAE grew by 10% in 2024 as compared to 2023, between Israel and Bahrain by 843%, and between Israel and Morocco by 40%.

Unfortunately, despite the historic processes led by President Trump, which led to four Arab countries joining the Abraham Accords in a matter of months, the Biden administration failed to expand the Accords, due in part to President Biden's continued adherence to the failed Kerry fallacy.

Nevertheless, despite the Biden administration's inability to add any additional countries, the prospect of expanded peace and cooperation was still seen as a grave threat to the Iranian regime and its terror proxies, including Hamas. This fear of Abraham Accords expansion was one of the motives behind Hamas decision to launch its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Twenty-one months since this terrorist massacre and the subsequent war, the Abraham Accords have endured. Diplomatic, strategic and trade ties between Israel and its Accords partners remain stable. 2025 saw the continuation of high-level diplomatic meetings, such as the repeated visits by Israel's foreign minister to Abu Dhabi, and the ratification of important bilateral agreements between Israel and its Accords partners.

In addition, the Abraham Accords have had a direct positive impact on the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israel has worked closely with the UAE and Morocco on the delivery of such aid, coordination made possible due to the trust built between Israel and its Accords partners since 2020.

The return of President Trump to the White House has created renewed momentum towards regional cooperation and integration. The potential for regional peace is obvious to many of America's allies in the region. The benefits of such a peace could include not only those to be derived from bilateral relations with Israel and expanded ties with the United States, but those connected to groundbreaking multilateral initiatives such as the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor, and a Middle East Security Alliance.

The Palestinian Authority, for its part, stands at a crossroads. Its leader, Abbas, now in the 20th year of his first four-year term, oversees an Authority that continues to promote incitement, while failing to combat corruption or advance meaningful economic growth. In the coming post-Abbas era, the PA will need to decide: Does it embrace the Abraham Accords spirit of cooperation, dialogue and people-to-people peace? Or does it continue the rejectionism that has led it nowhere for the last 30 years, while keeping the radicalized Palestinian people dependent on international largesse?

Rather than attempting to delegitimize President Trump's achievement in advancing the Abraham Accords, all who claim to care about the Palestinians or Middle East peace should seek to strengthen these historic agreements, and encourage the Palestinians to reject the failures of the past. This is the path toward lasting peace and prosperity in the Middle East, in line with the vital interests of the United States.

Passengers slid down an emergency slide of a smoking jet at Denver International Airport due to a possible problem with the plane's landing gear, authorities said.

American Airlines Flight 3023 reported a “possible landing gear incident” during its departure from Denver on Saturday afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The problem involved an aircraft tire, the Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said in a statement.

The Boeing 737 MAX 8 carrying 173 passengers and six crew members was on its way to Miami International Airport, American said.

Video showed people sliding down the inflatable chute near the front of the plane while clutching luggage and small children. Some passengers, including at least one adult carrying a young child, tripped at the end of the slide and fell onto the concrete runway. Passengers were then taken to the terminal by bus.

Shay Armistead, a 17-year-old from Minturn, Colorado, described a chaotic scene.

After hearing a loud “boom,” the plane “started to violently shake and we were drifting to the left side of the runway,” Armistead told The Associated Press in an interview.

Armistead and her teammates on a ski racing team were on their way from Colorado to Chile when it happened.

“I started grabbing my friend's hands, I was like ‘Oh my God,' and then they slammed on the brakes, and we all like went forward and they finally brought the plane to a stop,” she said. “It was just terrifying.”




One of the passengers was taken to a hospital with a minor injury, American Airlines said in its statement. Five people were evaluated for injuries at the scene but did not require hospitalization, airport officials said.

“About halfway to takeoff speed, we hear a big bang and a pop,” passenger Shaun Williams told KUSA-TV. “The pilot immediately started abort procedures for taking off. You could feel him start to hit the brakes.”

Firefighters extinguished a fire on the aircraft, the Denver Fire Department said.

“All customers and crew deplaned safely, and the aircraft was taken out of service to be inspected by our maintenance team,” American said.

In a statement, the FAA said it's investigating.

Armistead said she's thankful for everyone who helped her and the other passengers, and grateful that she's safe.

“You've just got to appreciate what you're given, and I'm so grateful that it wasn't worse,” Armistead said. ___

This story corrects the spelling of a passenger's name. She is Shay Armistead, not Armisteaz.

            Cambodia and Thailand have agreed to an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire” beginning at midnight local time (1 p.m. ET Monday),﻿ following days of clashes across the two countries' disputed border.
    


            The ceasefire was announced by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), who mediated talks between Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai at his official residence near the capital Kuala Lumpur.
    


            Both sides have accused the other of starting the latest border flare-up and traded blame for the ongoing fighting, which has killed at least ﻿38 people and injured more than 200, according to figures from Thai and Cambodian officials. The dispute over their border goes back decades.
    


            The leaders indicated in a joint news conference that fighting will stop immediately, even as clashes continued on Monday morning in the hours before the peace talks. Cambodian authorities accused Thailand of striking at least two locations in the early hours, while the Thai army said clashes were taking place in three provinces.
    


            Reports of fighting dragged on even after the ceasefire was announced. The head of an evacuation shelter on the Cambodian side, Dr. Moun Nara, told CNN hours after the announcement: “I still hear the sound of the shooting… It's not yet ended yet. Let's wait and see until midnight.”
    


            The United States and China also participated in the ceasefire negotiations. ﻿



            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio applauded the ceasefire on Monday and said the Trump administration expects the two governments “to fully honor their commitments to end this conflict.” Rubio said earlier that State Department officials were on the ground in Malaysia to assist with the negotiations.
    


            US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that the Southeast Asian nations had agreed to ceasefire talks, but localized fighting continued throughout the weekend. Trump said he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that he would not make trade deals with either country if the deadly border conflict continued.
    


            “This is an important step towards reducing tensions and restoring peace and security,” Hun Manet said in a statement confirming the ceasefire, in which he thanked the Malaysian prime minister, the Chinese government and Donald Trump specifically for their support in the negotiation process.
    


Violence is flaring again on the Thai-Cambodian border. Why is it so contentious?



            He also announced that the two countries will establish a Cambodian-Thai General Boundary Committee, which will hold an initial meeting on August 4, hosted by Cambodia.
    


            “Today's outcome reflects Thailand's desire for a peaceful resolution, while continuing to protect our sovereignty and the lives of our people,” Phumtham said in the news conference. “We agreed to a ceasefire that will be carried out in good faith by both sides.”
    


            Malaysia is prepared to deploy a team to “ensure implementation and observation” of the ceasefire, Ibrahim said, adding that both Thailand and Cambodia will resume direct communication at the level of prime ministers, foreign ministers and defense ministers.
    


            In recent decades, Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry. The two countries share a 500-mile (800-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French when they controlled Cambodia as a colony – that has periodically seen military clashes.
    


            Recent tension had been simmering since an encounter in May, in which a Cambodian soldier was killed.
    


            Relations soured further following the release of a leaked phone call between Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and Cambodia's Hun Sen, the father of the current prime minister. In the call, Paetongtarn could be heard calling Hun Sen “uncle” and appeared to criticize her own army's actions in the border dispute, which led to her suspension after opponents accusing her of compromising the country's interests.
    


            The most recent flare-up came after five Thai soldiers were injured in a landmine explosion last week, with the incident prompting Thailand to downgrade diplomatic relations with its neighbor.
    


            That was followed by days of deadly clashes and heavy weapons fire across their disputed border, displacing more than 139,000 people from seven provinces in Thailand, and at least 80,000 people in Cambodia.
    


            Thailand on Monday said 25 people have been killed since hostilities began, 14 of whom are civilians.
    


            Cambodian authorities previously said that in Oddar Meanchey province, which borders Thailand's Surin, 13 people had been killed, including eight civilians, and 50 wounded.

This story has been updated to correct the time when the ceasefire comes into effect.

Country music legend Dolly Parton discusses her book and her Dollywood resort that focuses on entertaining families, on 'America Reports.'

For Dolly Parton, spirituality is nothing to take lightly.

The country music superstar has often spoken out about her faith over the years, but in a conversation with famed celebrity interviewer Lawrence Grobel, Parton revealed just how intensely she feels about the topic.

Grobel, who has interviewed and written about a number of celebrities over his decades-long career, recently shared some diary entries with Vanity Fair – many of them describe conversations he's had with Parton, who he first met in 1978.

DOLLY PARTON LEANS ON FAITH TO NAVIGATE LOSS OF HUSBAND CARL DEAN

The two became friends, and in 1981, after he was presented with an opportunity to interview notorious serial killer Charles Manson, he asked Parton for her thoughts on the matter, since he'd been having trouble deciding whether he wanted to go through with it.

"I think he'd steal your soul," she told him, per Grobel's diary entry. "I can't even look at a picture of him."

She told him that if he were to interview Manson, "I know I wouldn't want to have much to do with you."

The "Jolene" singer told Grobel that he "wouldn't make a difference" by interviewing Manson because any attention the story got would go to the infamous killer, who was convicted in 1971 of the murders of seven people.

"I know it's an amazing story," she said, "but being the way we are, you and me, with the wonderful, pure force in you, just one minute with him could destroy all that we can be about. That's how spirits work. You'd have to be brave to deal with him, and I know you are, but it's something you don't tempt God with. I'd be afraid it would get to me."

Grobel wrote that Parton had told him that "this devil has come up between us," referring to Manson, and that she said that if he did choose to do the interview, "You and me would be more like in a battle and I'd be looking at you differently, because it would change you and you may not even know it. The darkness is something not to get involved with."

The author ultimately declined the interview, and in his diary, he wrote that Parton "pretty much made my decision for me."

"No candy if I play with the devil," he remarked.

While the cult leader wasn't known to worship Satan as some people believed, he did invoke some Satanic imagery in public statements he made.

At one point during his trial, Manson arrived to court with a shaved head, declaring, "I am the devil, and the devil always has a bald head." At a 1986 parole hearing, he said, "From behind the time locks of courtrooms and from the worlds of darkness, I did let loose devils and demons with the power of scorpions to torment."

Grobel previously recounted the story of Parton's concerns about Manson on his website in 2017. There, he wrote that Parton was surprised that he had even needed to think about whether he wanted to do the interview, calling Manson "evil incarnate."

He remembered her saying, "And to tell you the truth, that you even have to think about this concerns me."

He also said that following the conversation, the country legend "kept her distance" from him.

Parton has long been open about her beliefs, telling Fox News Digital in 2023 that she asks God to keep "the right people" in her life and to take "the wrong ones" out of it.

"My faith impacts everything that I do because I do believe that, through God, all things are possible," she said at the time. "And so I always ask God to bless everything that I do and the people that I work with and to bring all the right things and right people into my life and to take the wrong ones out.

"So, I try to just live through love as much as I can. And so I just think that my spirituality has been a guiding light in my life and my strength, really, in my creative energy. And my spiritual energy has really been a great force to keep me going all these years and still being productive."

Earlier this month, Parton appeared on Khloé Kardashian's "Khloe in Wonder Land" podcast, where she admitted that people have told her that she shouldn't speak so much about her faith.

"I said, 'Well, yes I should,'" she told Kardashian. "I'm not telling you what to do. I'm just telling you what makes me work, what I believe."

She said that if God can "shine through" her to other people, that's good enough for her.

Universities across America are brazenly defying President Donald Trump's executive orders that banned diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, and Congress needs to hold them accountable.

This week, undercover videos showed administrators at the University of Tennessee admitting that they are merely changing the name of their race- and gender-based programs to skirt Trump's orders.

“It's a chess game,” Will Eakin, a coordinator for UT's “Access and Engagement” office, said in one video.

“We had to take our current programming and our future programming and make sure that it aligns so that we can do the work that we're trying to do, while also catering to the Department of Education, the federal,” he said in the video, adding, “The biggest thing is using language as a tool for protection.”

In June, Accuracy In Media released a video depicting a University of North Carolina at Charlotte employee saying, “We've renamed, we've reorganized, we've recalibrated, so to speak.” She added that “if you're looking for, like, an outward DEI position — not going to happen. But if you are interested in doing work that is covert, there are opportunities.”

Some members of Congress and the administration are on to them.

On Wednesday, during a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution meeting on DEI, Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, observed, “This is not unusual compared to what we saw in the Brown v. Board of Education era,” referring to the Supreme Court case outlawing “separate but equal” policies.

“We saw government officials openly defying those orders by rebranding, using different methods, and it took decades to root that out,” Dhillon said. “Hopefully, it doesn't take decades to root this out, but we've seen similar defiance.”

Dhillon suggested the subcommittee subpoena leaders of institutions that are offenders of the Trump civil rights policy.

University administrators try to downplay the revelations, claiming they're rogue employees — one-offs who aren't authorized to speak to the media. But the middle managers are merely enacting the directives from the top.

At Belmont University, an administrator in the office of Hope, Unity, and Belonging acknowledged that it's just a word game.

“We're always going to keep doing what we're doing,” the staffer said in the video. “The work never stops. We just change how we talk about it.”

“We're doing the work,” he said in the video. “We just may not be as loud as other people are about it.”

“If you're navigating in the shadows, nobody's paying attention to Belmont.”

But even students know the school is just trying to be clever.

“Every student at Belmont knows that it's the DEI program or the DEI office,” Belmont senior Mya Goodmanson said. “It's no secret.”

The Trump administration is on to the arrogant defiance.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Belmont of “obstruction” of immigration law after the person in the video admitted the university was protecting students who are illegal immigrants.

GOP SENATE HOPEFUL SCOTT BROWN ONCE CALLED DEI A ‘CORE VALUE.' NOW HE SAYS IT'S ‘WOKE'

“President Trump campaigned on immigration enforcement,” Noem said during a visit to Nashville. “The American people voted for immigration enforcement.”

Congress must hold these universities accountable. Subpoena leadership, expose the truth. We taxpayers elected Trump to clean up this rotten ideology. Don't let bureaucrats and ideologues undermine the Trump agenda.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rebuffed overtures by South Korea's new liberal government, saying Monday that its “blind trust” in the country's alliance with the U.S. and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor. 

Kim Yo Jong's comments imply that North Korea — now preoccupied with its expanding cooperation with Russia — sees no need to resume diplomacy with South Korea and the U.S. anytime soon. Experts say she likely hopes to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.

“We clarify once again the official stand that no matter what policy is adopted and whatever proposal is made in Seoul, we have no interest in it and there is neither a reason to meet nor an issue to be discussed,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by state media. 

It's North Korea's first official statement on the government of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, which took office in early June with a promise to improve badly frayed ties with North Korea. 

Lee's government has halted anti-Pyongyang frontline loudspeaker broadcasts, taken steps to ban activists from flying balloons with propaganda leaflets across the border and repatriated North Koreans who were drifted south in wooden boats months earlier.




North Korea has shunned talks with South Korea and the U.S. since leader Kim Jong Un's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019 due to wrangling over international sanctions. North Korea has since focused on building more powerful nuclear weapons targeting its rivals and declared a hostile “two-state” system on the Korean Peninsula to terminate relations with South Korea.

Kim Yo Jong called Lee's steps “sincere efforts” to develop ties, but said the new government still plots to “stand in confrontation” with North Korea. She mentioned the upcoming summertime South Korea-U.S. military drills, which North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal. 

Lee said it's important to restore trust between the Koreas as he met Unification Minister Chung Dong-young and asked about his thought on the latest North Korean statement. Chung, whose job makes him the top South Korean official on North Korea, later told reporters that he intends to propose to Lee that South Korea and the U.S. “adjust” their military exercises.

Chung's remarks, which could mean scaling back South Korea-U.S. training as a way to get North Korea to return to talks, will likely invite strong criticism from conservatives, who support expanded South Korea-U.S. training to cope with North Korea's advancing nuclear program. 

Moon Seong Mook, an analyst for the Seoul-based Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, said Kim Yo Jong's statement shows North Korea is holding out for South Korea to abandon the U.S. alliance. 

Moon said that Kim likely sees little upside in engaging with the South since it cannot restart economic projects that previously benefited the North as long as international sanctions remain in place. 

North Korea built cooperation with Russia, sending troops and conventional weapons to support its war in Ukraine, and likely receiving economic and economic assistance in return. 

Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has repeatedly boasted of his personal ties with Kim Jong Un and expressed intent to resume diplomacy with him. But North Korea hasn't publicly responded to Trump's overture.

Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said that Kim Yo Jong's statement had a domestic audience.

“Kim Yo Jong's comments are an effort to advance national pride by portraying North Korea in a superior position, despite its economic struggles and international pariah status,” Easley said. “She also seeks to justify Pyongyang's weapons programs and divide Seoul and Washington by criticizing upcoming military exercises.”

Still, there is a limit on what North Korea can get from Russia, and Pyongyang could change course at a major upcoming meeting of the ruling Workers' Party, likely to be held in January, said Kwak Gil Sup, the head of One Korea Center, a website specializing in North Korea affairs. 

“I think North Korea may formulate a Plan B and Plan C in relations for South Korea and the U.S.,” Kwak said.

DroneUp CEO Tom Walker speaks with Fox News Digital about his Congressional testimony calling for a nationalized database of drone pilots and flights amid changing technology, while warning the country's airspace regulations are unprepared.

As drone technology rapidly advances, industry experts are warning Congress about potential airspace lapses creating the next national security threat if left unregulated.

In a U.S. House Homeland Security Subcommittee hearing held last week, drone industry experts testified about the looming threats to airspace safety posed by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). 

"More than half of all near misses with commercial and general aviation are with drones," Tom Walker, CEO of DroneUp, told Fox News Digital.

Walker leads the world's largest drone services network while working closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Departments of Transportation (DOT), Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS) to implement changes on national airspace policy. 

While on Capitol Hill, Walker implored lawmakers to build a nationalized system that has the ability to identify each drone, pilot and mission throughout the country. 

"We don't have awareness of our airspace," Walker said. "We don't have a common operating picture. We can't look at a picture, and see all of the drones and manned aircraft and say, ‘Here's who this is and here's what they're doing.'"

Drones have been responsible for several incidents involving rescue aircraft being struck during lifesaving efforts, including a firefighting airplane in California and a helicopter in Texas. (iStock)

Currently, the federal government does not have a centralized database that identifies a drone and its pilot in real-time, creating security lapses around critical infrastructure throughout the country and a lack of accountability surrounding rules and regulations of airspace. 

The implementation of Remote ID – a "digital license plate" for drones – was rolled out in an attempt to identify UAS systems, but can easily be overridden to conceal a pilot's identity, according to Walker.  

"The problem right now is everything is about policy," Walker said. "We have a policy that says you can't go above 400 feet. We have a policy that says you can't fly during Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). We have a policy that says you can't fly in restricted airspace. And those policies have been violated over a million times."

Walker pointed to several high-profile incidents in recent months involving drones interfering with law enforcement efforts. 

Earlier this year, a California man pleaded guilty to federal charges after his drone struck a Canadian Super Scooper firefighting aircraft while authorities raced to battle the devastating Palisades Fire. As a result, the potentially lifesaving plane was grounded for approximately five days. 

Another instance that grounded a first responders' aircraft occurred after authorities announced a helicopter aiding in search efforts for victims of the Texas floods was struck by a drone.

"The helicopter was forced to make an emergency landing, and a critical piece of response equipment is now out of service until further notice," the City of Kerrville said in a statement. 

While officials have insisted these instances were completely preventable, Walker points to a lack of a centralized system to identify and locate unlawful drones. 

"I would argue we have no awareness of the airspace whatsoever," Walker told Fox News Digital. "If you don't have awareness, you cannot have control of your airspace. And if you don't have control of your airspace, you can't defend your airspace – which means you have no sovereignty of your airspace."

Although the vast majority of regulations have been implemented through policy changes, Walker believes officials are focusing their efforts on counter-UAS systems in a misguided attempt to regain control of the country's airspace. 

"I get a little discouraged when I hear that the first step we need is counter-UAS," Walker said. "You don't own and control your airspace just by having defensive postures. You have to own it, you have to control it, you have to manage it – and then you use those types of measures only when you lose the ability to control a particular risk scenario." 

Walker's solution would initially be rolled out in areas that are at a high risk for drone incursions in what he calls a "phased approach," with agencies having access on an as-needed basis.  

"Let's start with protecting critical infrastructure," Walker said, before pointing to the United States' recent airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities. 

DEADLY DRONE WARS ARE ALREADY HERE AND THE US IS HORRIBLY UNPREPARED

"Think about the recent operation where we launched the B-2 [bombers]," Walker told Fox News Digital. "All it would've taken is a kid with a [drone] flying over that airbase and they wouldn't have been able to launch."  

As government officials look to integrate drone policies during a time when technology is changing at a rapid rate, Walker encourages collaboration between UAS experts and authorities to aim for long-standing regulations that benefit Americans while stressing that the current guidelines do not adequately address airspace concerns. 

"What systems do we have in place that are tested, tabletop exercised and in place to prevent that today?" Walker said. "The answer is nothing." 

BORDER STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHOOT DOWN 'WEAPONIZED' DRUG-SMUGGLING DRONES

The airspace database would then include areas such as the southern border and prisons throughout the country, in an attempt to cut down on criminals' smuggling attempts. 

"If you look at the number of things that are being smuggled into prisons, it's not just drugs, cellphones and SIM cards," Walker said. "It's knives, guns and explosives. The problem is already a crisis, and it's already costing lives. And we, as a country, have done very little up to this point, other than policy." 

Steven Willoughby, DHS director of counter-UAS program management, testified in a Senate Judicial Committee hearing on Tuesday about cartels using drones to carry out illegal operations at the border, echoing Walker's sentiment. 

FLORIDA PROPERTY OWNERS PESTERED BY SPYING DRONES COULD SOON BE ALLOWED TO FIGHT BACK WITH 'FORCE'

"U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and officers have seized thousands of pounds of narcotics, including enough fentanyl, to kill tens of thousands of Americans across the globe," Willoughby said. "Drones have also been used increasingly to conduct kinetic attacks or warring cartel functions have attacked one another using drone delivered explosives, and it's only a matter of time before Americans or law enforcement are targeted in the border region." 

The FAA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The implementation of a nationwide, real-time database of UAS flights could ultimately allow drones to exist alongside manned aircraft, further cementing the United States' ability to protect both its domestic and international assets while aiding its citizens. 

"We should have both manned and unmanned aircraft working together harmoniously in a symbiotic environment and creating a force multiplier that allows us to save more lives," Walker said. " It allows us to protect our borders, and allows us to provide services to the general public at a level we've never comprehended."

• Hunger in Gaza: A growing starvation crisis has stalked Gaza for weeks under Israel's strict controls of all supplies sparking growing international outrage over people dying from hunger in the territory.
    


• Israel eases some restrictions: Israeli troops began a daily “tactical pause in military activity” for three parts of Gaza on Sunday. It's one in a series of moves somewhat easing Israel's grip on the enclave, after global outrage mounted over the growing number of Palestinians starving to death.
    


• Controversial airdrops resume: Jordan and the UAE dropped more aid into Gaza on Sunday following Israel's airdrops the day prior. Palestinians raced through the streets to reach supplies from the aid drops, which have been sharply criticized by some humanitarian groups as expensive, inefficient and dangerous. 



• Aid corridors: Israel says it is also designating “secure routes” for aid convoys to deliver food and medicine. Over 100 trucks delivered supplies to the enclave Sunday, the UN said, but navigating Gaza is difficult even during pauses in fighting, and medical workers fear the trickle of aid may be too late to save starving children.
    


Our live coverage of Israel's war in Gaza has ended for the day. Read the latest here.
    


            Hamas' Qatar-based leader Khalil Al-Hayya blamed Israel and the US for stalling the Gaza ceasefire talks in a televised speech Sunday, saying that the starvation crisis in Gaza meant there is “no point in continuing negotiations” under current conditions.
    


            Al-Hayya, a key Hamas political figure and the movement's lead negotiator, claimed that during the latest round of negotiations, Hamas had demonstrated “every possible flexibility” and achieved “clear progress,” largely agreeing with mediator proposals concerning Israeli troop withdrawal, hostage and prisoner exchanges, and aid delivery.
    


                    They (mediators) conveyed to us positive responses,” from Israel, “but we were surprised to find that the occupation withdrew from the negotiations, and that the US President's envoy to the Middle East, (Steve) Witkoff, was in league with it,” Al-Hayya said.
                





            Al-Hayya stated there is “no point in continuing negotiations” while Gaza faces an ongoing siege and “starvation.” He demanded the “immediate and dignified entry of food and medicine” as a prerequisite for any further talks, refusing to let Palestinian suffering be used for “occupation's negotiating tricks.”
    


            He also accused the US and Israel of “wasting time” to intentionally delay progress to facilitate the continued devastation of Palestinians in Gaza.
    


            Two of the remaining sticking points in negotiations over a potential ceasefire deal in Gaza are the exchange of prisoners for hostages and the schedule for Israel's withdrawal, a senior Hamas official told CNN on Friday.
    


            The official said Hamas had submitted two proposals on those topics shortly before the US and Israel pulled their delegates out of talks Thursday, accusing the militant group of acting in bad faith.
    


            Israel began its “tactical pauses” in military operations for parts of Gaza on Sunday, and more than 100 trucks delivered humanitarian aid to the enclave. Jordan and the United Arab Emirates dropped additional supplies from aircraft.
    


            The trickle of aid came after Israel made a series of moves to somewhat ease its blockade on Gaza, as it faces mounting global outrage over the growing number of Palestinians starving to death.
    


Here are the latest developments:



Finally, here's a closer look at the Israel Defense Forces' “tactical pauses”:



            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again denied that Palestinians in Gaza face starvation as he delivered remarks at an event in Jerusalem with Paula White, the leader of the White House Faith Office.
    


            “Israel is presented as though we are applying a campaign of starvation in Gaza. What a bold-faced lie. There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza,” Netanyahu claimed.
    


            The World Health Organization has reported that at least 63 malnutrition-related deaths occurred in Gaza this month, and the WHO and other aid organizations have said Israel's blockade on supplies entering the enclave has precipitated the crisis.
    


            Netanyahu also repeated the unproven claim that Hamas steals humanitarian aid in Gaza. “Hamas robs, steals this humanitarian aid and then accuses Israel of not supplying it,” he said.
    


            Netanyahu said that there are safe corridors for aid delivery and that the United Nations should “stop finding excuses.”
    


            His remarks come after Israel lifted some restrictions on aid entering Gaza in the face of growing global outrage about starvation in the enclave. CNN has been reporting on the dire conditions, including children dying of hunger and doctors fainting from lack of food while treating their malnourished patients.
    


            Over 100 truckloads of aid were delivered to Gaza on Sunday as Israel eased some restrictions on the entry of aid into the enclave, the leader of the United Nations' humanitarian agency said.
    


            Tom Fletcher, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OHCA) chief, said the organization welcomes Israel's decision to increase the entry of aid into Gaza but underscored the need for more action to address the hunger crisis after months of Israel throttling deliveries.
    


                    “This is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis,” Fletcher said in a statement.
                





            The UN's agencies and other humanitarian organizations are mobilized to respond to the crisis and save lives but need “sustained action” to allow more aid to be delivered, Fletcher said. This includes quicker clearances for convoys going to Gaza, establishing safe travel routes and refraining from attacking people gathering for food.
    


                    “Ultimately of course we don't just need a pause — we need a permanent ceasefire. The world is calling for this lifesaving aid to get through. We won't stop working for that,” Fletcher said.
                





            Global outrage over starvation deaths in Gaza reached fever pitch this weekend, and after ceasefire talks crumbled on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was left with mounting international pressure.
    


            His new aid distribution plan — including “tactical pauses” in military activity for parts of Gaza, the establishment of aid corridors, and renewed airdrops — resulted in public criticism at home.
    


            The slap-down was unsurprising coming from hard-right ministers like Itamar Ben-Gvir, but many other Israelis also cannot fathom Netanyahu's apparent climbdown, hinting more strongly at a political bind for the prime minister.
    


            The timing of Netanyahu's announcements may also be because he thinks that bind will soon loosen. The Knesset, Israel's parliament, goes on vacation for several months on Monday, and Ben-Gvir and others won't be able to collapse his government once it does.
    


            If the prime minister has, as he often does, outfoxed his critics, he has bought time to get the Gaza talks back to the table. But it remains to be seen if Hamas will feel emboldened to use the global anger about starving Palestinians to seek better terms in any renewed negotiations.
    


            Hamas decried the Israeli government's move to resume air-dropping aid and establish corridors for humanitarian deliveries in Gaza as “nothing more than a formal and deceptive step aimed at whitewashing its image before the world.”
    


            Israel has been facing intensified global pressure over starvation in Gaza while its blockade throttles the entry of aid to the enclave.
    


            In a statement on Sunday, the militant group criticized Israel's initiatives as insufficient and humiliating to Gazans.
    


                    “The occupation's plan for airdrops and control of so-called humanitarian corridors represents a blatant policy to manage starvation, not end it,” Hamas' statement reads. “It endangers the lives of civilians and humiliates their dignity, instead of providing them with protection and comprehensive relief.”
                





            Eyewitnesses have spoken of the horror of trying to get aid in western Gaza on Sunday.A Palestinian man in western Gaza City described one area where desperate people gathered to grab what they could from trucks carrying flour and air drops as a “death area.”
    


            The young man, who was carrying a bag of flour, said he saw at least one person killed and several injured when Israeli forces opened fire at close range on Sunday.
    


                    “The soldiers came face-to-face with us, locking eyes,” he said, adding: “people were shot in front of us.” 
                





            The Israel Defense Forces told CNN it was “not aware of any incident at that time and location”.Another eyewitness, who was at the site, said he managed to get a bag of flour from “under death,” saying several people were killed without providing further details.
    


            A Palestinian woman who was in the area said she risked her life to bring food for her two kids, claiming she was surrounded by (Israeli) tanks while there.
    


            “There are deaths over there, there are martyrs,” she said referring to the aid site, “for what? for flour and water?” She is, however, happy to get some food for her kids. “They kept saying 'Mama, we miss bread.”
    


Bodies brought to hospital: In a separate incident earlier in the day, Al-Awda Hospital said it had received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point in the central Gaza Strip operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Sunday it was “not aware of any casualties” after its troops fired warning shots near the aid distribution site in central Gaza.
    


            Earlier on Sunday, Al-Awda Hospital said it had received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point in the central Gaza Strip operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
    


            “Earlier today (Sunday), a gathering of suspects was identified adjacent to IDF troops operating in central Gaza, endangering them,” the IDF said in a statement in response to CNN's query regarding the incident.
    


                    “The troops operated to prevent the suspects from approaching them and fired warning shots. The IDF is not aware of any casualties as a result of the warning shots,” the IDF added. 
                





            The IDF emphasized that “the warning shots were not fired at the aid distribution site, but at a distance of hundreds of meters away from it, prior to its opening hours.”
    


Correction: A previous version of this alert misidentified the location of where this alleged incident took place. It did not take place at a GHF site in central Gaza where a separate incident occurred earlier in the day. It was in western Gaza.



            Malnutrition-related deaths in the Gaza Strip have spiked in July, the latest sign of a hunger crisis that continues to worsen, the World Health Organization warned Sunday.
    


            Of the 74 malnutrition-related deaths recorded in 2025 in Gaza, 63 occurred in July, according to the WHO. In July alone, 24 children under five years old died of malnutrition-related causes.
    


            Gaza has been gripped by an escalating hunger crisis as Israel imposed a blockade on the enclave, slowing the entry of aid to a trickle. The WHO has repeatedly expressed concern over the extreme risks to Palestinians there.
    


                    “The crisis remains entirely preventable. Deliberate blocking and delay of large-scale food, health, and humanitarian aid has cost many lives,” the WHO said.
                





            The global health body said the enclave's malnutrition rates reached “alarming levels” this month. Over 5,000 children under 5 were admitted for outpatient treatment of malnutrition in just the first two weeks of July, the WHO said.
    


            The percentage of children aged 6 months to 4-years-old suffering from acute malnutrition in Gaza City — the most severely impacted part of the Strip — has tripled since June, the WHO said.
    


            The WHO also acknowledged that their figures are likely an underestimation due to the difficulties many families face while trying to reach health facilities.
    


            The organization issued a plea for “urgent, sustained efforts to flood the Gaza Strip with diverse, nutritious food, and to expedite the delivery of therapeutic supplies for children and vulnerable groups, as well as essential medicines and supplies.”
    


            CNN footage shows dozens of Palestinians in Gaza rushing toward boxes of humanitarian aid packages dropped by the Jordanian military in the Zikim area of western Gaza City on Sunday.
    


            Jordan and the United Arab Emirates carried out their first airdrops into the enclave in months today, the Jordanian Armed Forces confirmed in a statement.
    


            The airdrops contained “25 tonnes of food and basic necessities,” the military said.
    


            The operation comes after international pressure on Israel to ease its blockade reached a fever pitch, with stark images of the starvation crisis gripping Gaza causing widespread outrage.
    


            Israel appears to be reversing its highly contentious Gaza aid policy that led to international outrage over needless deaths and starvation of Palestinians.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that the new aid distribution plan is not a climbdown only fuels speculation that it is.
    


            He is ensnared in a breakdown of his own creation. Ceasefire talks crumbled Friday when he pulled the Israeli delegation back to Jerusalem, just as international criticism over malnutrition deaths in Gaza reached fever pitch.
    


            A balancing act that could have seen improved aid distribution in Gaza alongside a deal to get Israel's hostages out of Hamas captivity, concessions on a Gaza border buffer zone, or even a path to durable ceasefire slipped from his grasp.
    


            What Netanyahu was left with was mounting international pressure to fix the Gaza food shortage. The scrutiny was crushing his hopes of wrenching concessions from Hamas, which, from Israel's perspective, is reveling as they squirm and would exploit the starvation narrative.
    


            The only way to solve it, move the dial on the story, push starvation out of the headlines and regain control of the narrative was an about-face on months of blockade and to lift the siege a little.
    


            But no amount of aid will stop those close to death from dying of starvation and international anger is unlikely to abate quickly. Hamas may feel emboldened use that pressure to seek better terms in ceasefire negotiations.
    


            Before Netanyahu's apparent climbdown, it seemed he was on the verge of getting Hamas to revise down their demands again. With the carrot of improved aid now effectively off the talks table, Netanyahu may not be able to get the balance back in his favor quickly.
    


            In the midst of a dire hunger crisis in Gaza, Israel and other countries have begun dropping aid by plane into the Palestinian enclave.

            As the Israeli military began what it called a “tactical pause” in operations in three parts of Gaza, a dozen people were reported to have been killed while trying to get food aid from a distribution point in central Gaza on Sunday.
    


            Al-Awda Hospital said it received 12 bodies, including those of four children and one woman, and treated more than 100 people who had been injured after Israeli forces opened fire near an aid point operated by the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
    


            It's unclear whether the incident occurred before the tactical pause came into effect at 10 a.m. local time, nor whether it was inside the area covered by the pause.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Sunday that it was “not aware of any casualties” after its troops fired what it described as “warning shots” near an aid distribution site. The military claimed a “gathering of suspects” had endangered its troops in the area.
    


            “The warning shots were not fired at the aid distribution site, but at a distance of hundreds of meters away from it, prior to its opening hours,” the IDF said.
    


More victims arrive at hospitals: There have also been further casualties among people seeking aid in northern Gaza, according to hospital officials.
    


            At least 11 bodies have been brought into Al-Shifa Hospital since Saturday afternoon from the area used by aid convoys coming in from the Zikim crossing, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the hospital's director.
    


            Abu Salmiya told CNN that 120 injured people had also arrived at the hospital.
    


            The Palestinian Red Crescent said its field hospital in the north had received two bodies and 54 wounded people after “the targeting of civilians waiting for aid in the Zikim area” in the north-west of Gaza Strip and an airstrike in Gaza City.
    


This post has been updated with a response from the IDF.



            US President Donald Trump on Sunday blamed Hamas for the breakdown in Gaza ceasefire talks last week, echoing his administration's claim that the militant group had not been “acting in good faith” during the negotiations.
    


            “They had a routine discussion the other day, and all of a sudden they hardened up,” Trump said of Hamas, in response to questions from reporters during his trip to Scotland.
    


            The president criticized Hamas for its use of hostages as leverage in negotiations, saying the group doesn't want to give back its remaining captives because then it will “be the end” of the group.
    


                    “I said, when you get it down to a certain number, you're not going to be able to make a deal with Hamas, because once they give (the hostages) up, then they feel that that's going to be the end of them,” Trump said.
                





            “They don't want to give them back,” he added. “And so Israel is going to have to make a decision. I know what I'd do, but I don't think it's appropriate that I say.”
    


More background: The US recalled its negotiating team from Doha last week, where talks on a ceasefire to end the war in Gaza had been taking place. US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff said at the time that the latest response from Hamas “clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire.”
    


            Officials in Hamas' political bureau said the group was “surprised” by the US description of events and have claimed a breakthrough was “close.”
    


CNN's Jennifer Hansler and Kylie Atwood contributed reporting to this post.



             President Donald Trump said Sunday that the US will provide more humanitarian assistance to Gaza while reiterating his claims that Hamas is stealing aid.
    


                    Asked by reporters in Scotland whether Israel should be doing more to allow food into Gaza, Trump said, “Well, you know, we gave $60 million two weeks ago and nobody even acknowledged it, for food. And it's terrible. You know, you really at least want to have somebody say, ‘Thank you.'”
                





            “We're giving a lot of money and a lot of food, and a lot of everything. If we weren't there I think people would have starved, frankly. They would have starved, and it's not like they're eating well, but a lot of that food is getting stolen by Hamas,” Trump claimed. “You ship it in and they steal it. Then they sell it.”
    


Some key context: An internal US government review found no evidence of widespread theft by Hamas of US-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza, contradicting the State Department's claims that were used to justify backing a controversial private organization that took over aid distribution in the enclave. “There was no indication that there was a systemic loss due to Hamas interference or theft or diversion,” a source familiar with the report told CNN. 



            There is a starvation crisis in Gaza, and Israel tightly controls the flow of aid to the enclave. Six more Palestinians died from starvation in the last 24 hours, Gaza's health ministry says, bringing the total to at least 133 since October 2023.
    


More from Trump: Trump, who was sitting alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, said the US will provide additional aid to Gaza.
    


                    “Will I do more aid? Yeah,” Trump said. “The US is going to do more aid for Gaza, but we'd like to have other countries participate,” adding that he's going to mention that to the European Union today. “It's an international problem. It's not a US problem,” he said. 
                





            Israel's far-right national security minister has called for more bombing of Gaza instead of humanitarian aid.
    


                    “This is a moral bankruptcy. While our hostages are in Gaza, our prime minister is sending humanitarian aid to Gaza,” Itamar Ben-Gvir said Sunday in a statement on video. “I think at this stage, what should have been sent to Gaza is one thing: bombs to blow up, to conquer, to encourage emigration, and to win the war.”
                





            On Saturday, Ben-Gvir denounced the government's decision to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza, calling it “a surrender to Hamas” and saying he was excluded from the deliberations. He has been vocal about pressing on with the war in Gaza and has consistently opposed any negotiated ceasefire with Hamas.
    


            Ben-Gvir is a deeply controversial figure who has promoted the idea of moving Palestinians out of Gaza en masse.
    


            As controversial airdrops resumed in parts of Gaza on Sunday, some Palestinians spoke of their struggle to access the humanitarian aid once it had fallen to the ground.
    


            Massad Ghaban — who was looking for aid in Beit Lahia, a city in northern Gaza where some aid parcels were dropped — told the Reuters news agency that airdrops are “insulting.”
    


                    “From 6 a.m. until now we didn't eat or drink. We didn't get aid from the trucks. After that, they said that planes will airdrop aid, so we waited for that as well,” he said. “The planes are insulting for us. We are a people who deserve dignity.”
                





            Another Palestinian in the same area of Gaza, Mahmoud Soukar, said he followed the planes in search of aid but returned empty-handed.
    


                    “They dropped (the aid) around 3 kilometers from where people were gathered, and we didn't get aid,” Soukar said, according to Reuters. “This is a very difficult situation.”
                





Why airdrops are controversial: Aid airdrops have been sharply criticized in recent days by some humanitarian groups, who say they are expensive, inefficient and dangerous for those on the ground, with pallets of supplies having crushed Palestinians in the past.
    


            The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees called the drops a “distraction” Saturday, saying they will do little to alleviate suffering in the enclave.
    


            Proponents say the method can act as an additional means to deliver aid to hard-to-reach areas and within a short period of time.
    


            Democratic US Rep. Madeleine Dean says there is “tremendous pressure” on President Donald Trump over the ongoing starvation crisis in Gaza.
    


                    “I think there's tremendous pressure, and I'm glad, finally, there is pressure. And I'm very glad that CNN and others are covering the starvation in Gaza, the suffering that is going on and the truth about it — what's actually happening with the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation so ineptly bringing food in, and of course the blockade of the aid coming in,” Dean told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday.
                





            Israel imposed a blockade on the enclave in March, before partially lifting restrictions in May. Since then, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — which has been positioned to replace the efforts of an embattled United Nations agency — has been criticized by the UN for its inability to provide ample support and safe aid checkpoints for people in Gaza.
    


            “You see now, what is going on is that my constituents are calling me about Gaza, are calling me about the other issues that the president is not dealing with as he's off in Scotland promoting his golf courses,” Dean said, referring to Trump's ongoing trip to the United Kingdom.
    


            The Pennsylvania lawmaker previously voted against a bill including security funding for Israel in February of 2024 and then in favor of one in April of 2024.
    


            Humanitarian groups delivering aid in Gaza face a risky path through the war-torn Strip — even during pauses in fighting, according to the United Nations.
    


            Aid convoys are headed toward the Palestinian enclave Sunday after Israel announced it would establish corridors for humanitarian deliveries and implement “tactical pauses” in fighting for some densely populated areas.
    


            The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has outlined the potentially dangerous obstacles groups face in a document online, including:
    


            OCHA proposed allowing more basic commodities from the private sector to enter Gaza, saying, “Humanitarian aid cannot sustain a population of over 2 million people.”
    


            The UN also said visas into Gaza for aid workers need to be issued more expeditiously to increase staffing.
    


            Six more Palestinians in Gaza have died from starvation in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to at least 133 since October 2023, according to Gaza's health ministry.
    


            Medical workers in the enclave tell CNN that cases of malnutrition are “pouring in” to already overcrowded hospitals.

President Donald Trump was firm on Sunday that he would not allow any more wind turbines to be built in the United States, calling them “very destructive.”

Trump made the comments during a four-day trip to Scotland, where he just announced a trade deal with the European Union. As he took questions from reporters alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, he directed his ire at wind turbines, some of which he saw while playing golf at his course in Turnberry.

“We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They're killing us. They're killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains,” Trump said, before describing what he saw in Scotland.

“Today I'm playing the best course, I think, in the world, Turnberry. Even though I own it, it's probably the best course in the world, right? And I look over the horizon, and I see nine windmills. I said, ‘Isn't that a shame?' What a shame you have the same thing all over, all over Europe, in particular, you have windmills all over the place.”

Trump also criticized wind energy more broadly, calling it a “con job.”

“The whole thing is a con job. It's very expensive, and in all fairness, Germany tried it, and wind doesn't work. You need subsidy for wind, and energy should not need subsidy. With energy, you make money, you don't lose money,” Trump said.

While seated next to von der Leyen, Trump gave some advice to European leaders who have embraced wind energy.

“I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You're ruining your countries. I really mean it. It's so sad,” he said.

TRUMP TRIES TO MOVE ON FROM EPSTEIN FILES DRAMA WITH SCOTLAND TRIP

The trade deal struck with the EU earlier on Sunday includes large investments in the energy sector. 

Under the current framework, the EU will purchase $750 billion worth of American energy and increase its investment in the U.S. by more than $600 billion above its current levels.

A U.S. District Court judge on Monday rejected a legal bid by an investment fund to force the Federal Reserve to open to the public a meeting on setting interest rates this week.

The ruling found that the Federal Open Market Committee is not a government agency subject to the federal "Sunshine Act" requiring open meetings, despite claims to the contrary in a lawsuit filed by Azoria Capital.

The FOMC is set to meet Tuesday and Wednesday.

Azoria had asked Judge Beryl Howell in federal court in Washington, D.C., to issue a temporary restraining order that would have opened those sessions to the public.

Howell's decision upholding the FOMC's half-century-old practice of meeting behind closed doors came shortly after she questioned whether the lawsuit is a publicity stunt by Azoria to generate interest in the new investment fund.

Howell noted that a court filing last week by Azoria mentioned that CEO James Fishback — who is an ally of President Donald Trump — discussed the suit in an interview on a Fox Business show, "Mornings with Maria."

"I do note it's very unusual," Howell said, referring to the mention of the interview. "I've never seen information like this in such a certification."

"And it made me think: Are you filing the ... lawsuit to generate publicity for the launch of this new fund?" Howell said.

"I mean, the courts are very, very busy, and using the filing of a lawsuit as a business strategy to build publicity or generate interest in a new investment fund is not a particularly welcome development."

Anne Mackin, a lawyer for Azoria, replied, saying, "Your honor, that is not the purpose."

"The purpose of including that in the certificate of service is because local rule 65.1 requires us to list all of the efforts, everything that has happened to try to advise the other side about the lawsuit," Mackin said.. 

"So that was simply included in the certification to emphasize that we've emailed these folks, and we have not, you know, heard responses back," the attorney said.

Fishback, like Trump, has been critical of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's refusal to cut interest rates.

"Azoria is deeply concerned that the FOMC, under Chair Jerome Powell, is maintaining high interest rates to undermine President Donald J. Trump and his economic agenda, to the detriment of American citizens and the American economy," Azoria's suit said.

From robots that help make chips to those that prepare avocados for guacamole, Chipotle is using AI to make its restaurants more efficient while allowing workers to focus on other tasks. The fast casual restaurant chain is also applying AI to the process of hiring workers, allowing managers to stay more focused on running their restaurants.

Chipotle added an AI-powered platform to its hiring process that it dubbed "Ava Cado." The platform, created by AI HR firm Paradox, is essentially a conversational chatbot that interacts with job candidates, answers questions about the company and the job, collects information about them, and ultimately can schedule interviews with human hiring managers. It can also converse in English, Spanish, French, and German.

Chipotle chief human resources officer Ilene Eskenazi said the company's growth plan was a factor in the decision to use the AI hiring technology. With projections for about 300 new restaurants opening each year with an average of 30 employees per location, the company estimates it will have somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 new hires per year, on top of other positions opening up at existing Chipotles.

Making sure there is no friction in that process is key. Prior to rolling out Ava Cado, Chipotle managers were tasked with scheduling all of the interviews, both from people who applied online as well as during hiring events or when people came in seeking employment. That led to a lot of administrative work for managers.

Since introducing the AI chatbot, Eskenazi said Chipotle's number of applicants "has increased dramatically" and the company is also seeing about an 85% application completion rate. Ava Cado helps the job candidate by populating the application with the information they provide, cutting down the average time it takes to complete at application to around eight minutes.

"That has greatly increased our funnel so that we're serving up many more candidates for our managers to evaluate," Eskenazi said. "Maintaining our pipeline of candidates is always something that we're very focused on," she added.

Ava Cado is also tasked with managing the interview schedules for managers, who are able to block out certain times during the week and candidates can then be scheduled based on their availability.

Perhaps most importantly, Eskenazi said, is that while Ava Cado walks candidates through the application process, it also shares information about Chipotle and the job with them, so that "they're much more informed about what the job really is, and so then we know that the applicants are that much more interested in the job by the time they're meeting a hiring manager in person."

That's helping Chipotle hire faster, reducing time to hire by up to 75%, CEO Scott Boatwright told CNBC's Jim Cramer earlier this year. "We leaned into an AI hiring assistant from Paradox about six months ago that has put us on better footing from a staffing perspective," Boatwright said. "And we've been, in the eight years I've been in the organization, pushing past numbers we thought were all-time highs just last year."

Paradox has roughly 1,000 clients that use its conversational AI platform at some point in the hiring and recruiting process, including 7-Eleven, General Motors, Nestle, Marriott International and Lowe's.

Eskenazi said that Chipotle has been seeing candidates go from application to ready to hire within three and a half days thanks to Ava Cado, which previously could have been up to 12 days.

Still, much like how workers are concerned about AI taking their jobs, there are some concerns about how AI is increasingly being integrated in the hiring experience, whether that's through screening of resumes or even speaking directly to an AI powered recruiter. There are also potential concerns about the security of applicant data when interacting with AI recruiters — earlier this month, Paradox reported that a security vulnerability was detected by researchers, potentially exposing applicant names, email addresses and contact info. Paradox said none of the data was leaked or made public. Wired had previously reported the affected client was McDonald's.

Chipotle's Ava Cado AI does not screen resumes and does not make employment decisions, and Eskenazi said the company has a strong interview and training process that its managers will continue to lead and make the decisions for.

However, she said, the company is looking to expand Ava Cado's capabilities, whether that's sharing videos with candidates to give them a better view into what working at Chipotle is like, or giving applicants a prompt to also consider other locations where there may be openings nearby. There are ways AI can also be integrated into the company's learning and development programing.

"We've gotten a lot of anecdotal feedback from both general managers and candidates, and it's been incredibly strong," Eskenazi said. "I personally have been pleasantly surprised by how much candidates have enjoyed interacting with Ava."

Spirit Airlines said Monday that it will furlough 270 pilots this fall as the carrier prepares for a smaller off-season schedule to try to find its financial footing.

The airline will also downgrade 140 pilots from captain to first officer, according to a note to aviators from the Air Line Pilots Association, their union. Those downgrades take effect on Oct. 1.

"We know how hard this news hits, and there's no dressing that up. Spirit continues to shrink, and with it, the value of pilot seniority and Spirit careers continues to erode," said Captain Ryan Muller, chairman of Spirit's ALPA chapter.

The furloughs take effect on Nov. 1 "to better align staffing with our flight schedule," the airline said.

Spirit emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March and has been trying to win over customers with more upscale travel options, which have fared better than the bare-bones coach tickets Spirit has been known for for years.

"We are taking necessary steps to ensure we operate as efficiently as possible as part of our efforts to return to profitability," Spirit said in a statement to CNBC.

Airlines across the industry have said demand has been softer this year, particularly in off-peak travel periods.

"We recognize the weight of this decision and are committed to treating all affected Team Members with compassion and respect during this process," Spirit said.

Spirit also announced hundreds of pilot furloughs last year as it approached its bankruptcy filing.

Lawyers for President Donald Trump asked a judge on Monday to order Rupert Murdoch to sit for a deposition within 15 days for Trump's $10 billion lawsuit accusing the media mogul of defaming him in a Wall Street Journal article about a "bawdy" birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump's lawyers cited Murdoch's advanced age to submit to questioning under oath as a chief argument in their motion to compel him to testify earlier than would be normal in such a lawsuit, suggesting that Murdoch will either be too ill or dead to testify by the time the case goes to trial.

"Murdoch is 94 years old, has suffered from multiple health issues throughout his life, is believed to have suffered recent significant health scares, and is presumed to live in New York, New York," Trump's lawyers said in their legal filing in Miami federal court.

"Taken together, these factors weigh heavily in determining that Murdoch would be unavailable for in-person testimony at trial," the lawyers wrote.

The attorneys also cited the fact that there is, as yet, no order scheduling the exchange of evidence and testimony in the case.

"Murdoch has an advantage over President Trump as Murdoch is able to defend himself because he has access to all the information and documents related to the below-defined malicious and defamatory Article, and the decision behind deciding to publish it," they wrote.

"On the other hand, President Trump has very limited information related to the Article."

"For these and other reasons that follow, Murdoch would not suffer any prejudice significant enough to outweigh the good cause that exists to grant this Motion," they wrote.

Murdoch opposes the request that he sit for an expedited deposition, according to the filing.

CNBC has requested comment from Murdoch's attorneys.

Judge Darrin Gayles, who is presiding over the case, later Monday filed an order directing Murdoch's lawyers to respond to the motion by Aug. 4.

The motion also seeks a number of documents from Murdoch.

They include any documents exchanged between him and other defendants in the case.

It also seeks "Any text messages, iMessages, WhatsApp messages, Slack messages, Signal messages, WeChat messages, or any other form of digital communication on any mobile device related to the Article that You have sent or received," and a log of his calls from July 10 through July 25.

The Journal, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp, earlier this month published an article saying that Trump sent Epstein a letter for his 50th birthday in 2003.

The newspaper said that the letter "contains several lines of typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker."

"The letter concludes: 'Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret,'" the paper reported.

Trump has angrily denied writing the letter.

His lawsuit against Murdoch also names as defendants News Corp, its CEO Robert Thomson, the Journal's publisher Dow Jones & Company, and the two reporters whose bylines are on the article, Khadeeja Safdar and Joseph Palazzolo.

The motion filed Monday by Trump's lawyers also said that when one of the reporters reached out to the White House to ask about the letter, "President Trump reached out to, and spoke directly with, Murdoch and advised him that the letter referenced in the Article was fake."

"Murdoch advised President Trump that 'he would take care of it,'" the motion said.

"Because Defendants published the Article after President Trump spoke directly with Murdoch and advised him that the letter referenced in the Article was fake, Murdoch's direct involvement further underscores Defendants' actual malice and intent behind the decision to publish the false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements about President Trump identified in the Complaint," the motion said.

President Donald Trump on Monday said he threw his longtime friend Jeffrey Epstein out of his Mar-a-Lago club and cut ties with him years ago because "he stole people who worked for me."

Trump said Epstein poached at least one more employee from him after being warned not to do it again.

The president, speaking in Scotland, provided no other details of the dispute with Epstein, who killed himself in a federal jail in New York weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges in July 2019.

"That's such old history, very easy to explain, but I don't want to waste your time by explaining it," Trump said, after a reporter asked him to put to rest questions about what led to the rift between the two men and Epstein's exile from the president's Palm Beach, Florida, club.

"But for years, I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. I wouldn't talk because he did something that was inappropriate," the president said.

"He hired help, and I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He stole people that work for me. I said, 'Don't ever do that again.' He did it again," Trump said.

Epstein then became "persona non grata," Trump said.

"I threw him out, and that was it. I'm glad I did, if you want to know the truth," he said.

Virginia Giuffre, who was sexually abused by Epstein, has said British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell recruited her as a teenager to be exploited by Epstein when Giuffre was working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago.

Giuffre died by suicide in April.

It has long been known that Trump and Epstein had been friends, and there have been various explanations for why they fell out several years before Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution in 2008.

Questions about the men's relationship have been raised in recent weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi reneged on a promise she and other Trump administration officials made to release investigative files about Epstein.

Prior reports have suggested that Trump and Epstein fell out after 2004, when Trump outbid Epstein for a French Regency-style estate in Palm Beach.

A White House spokesman last week said Trump expelled Epstein from Mar-a-Lago for "being a creep."

Bondi earlier this month had the Department of Justice ask several federal judges to unseal transcripts of grand jury testimony about Epstein and Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for procuring underage girls for Epstein to abuse.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Maxwell and her attorney for hours last week at a Florida courthouse. Blanche has said he wants to ask Maxwell about other people who may have abused girls and women in Epstein's orbit.

BEIJING — Chinese companies are making smarter artificial intelligence models that are increasingly cheaper to use, echoing key aspects of DeepSeek's market-shaking breakthrough.

Startup Z.ai, formerly known as Zhipu, announced Monday that its new GLM-4.5 AI model would cost less than DeepSeek to use. In contrast to the logic underlying existing AI models, Z.ai said its new GLM-4.5 is built on what's known as "agentic" AI, meaning that the model automatically breaks down a task into sub-tasks in order to complete it more accurately.

The new model is also open sourced, meaning it is free for developers to download and use.

At about half the size of DeepSeek's model, GLM-4.5 only needs eight Nvidia H20 chips to operate, Z.ai CEO Zhang Peng told CNBC on Monday.

That's the chip Nvidia customized for China in order to comply with U.S. export controls. The chipmaker said this month that the U.S. will allow it to resume those China sales after a three-month pause, but it's unclear when those shipments will begin.

Zhang said the company doesn't need to buy more of the chips as it has enough computing power for now, but declined to share how much Z.ai spent on training the AI model. Details will be released later, he said.

Back in January, DeepSeek had rattled global investors with its apparent ability to defy U.S. chip restrictions and create an AI model that not only rivaled U.S.-based OpenAI's ChatGPT, but also undercut it in training and operating costs.

DeepSeek claimed training costs for its V3 model were less than $6 million, although some analysts said that figure was based on the company's hardware spend of more than $500 million over time.

Z.ai said that for its new GLM-4.5 model, it would charge 11 cents per million input tokens versus 14 for DeepSeek R1; and 28 cents per million output tokens versus $2.19 for DeepSeek. Tokens are a way of measuring data for AI model processing.

Earlier this month, Alibaba-backed Moonshot released Kimi K2, which claimed to beat OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude on certain coding capabilities. Kimi K2 charges 15 cents for every 1 million input tokens, and $2.50 per 1 million output tokens, according to its website.

In late June, OpenAI named Zhipu in a warning about Chinese AI progress. The U.S. has also added the startup to its entity list that restricts American companies from doing business with it.

Z.ai launched in 2019 and is reportedly planning an initial public offering in Greater China.

The startup has raised more than $1.5 billion from investors including Alibaba, Tencent and Qiming Venture Partners, according to PitchBook. Aramco-backed Prosperity7 Ventures as well as municipal funds from the cities of Hangzhou and Chengdu are also among Z.ai's backers, the database showed.

In the last few weeks, several other Chinese companies have announced new, open-source AI models. During the World AI Conference in Shanghai, Tencent released the HunyuanWorld-1.0 model for generating three-dimensional scenes for game development. Last week, Alibaba announced its Qwen3-Coder model for writing computer code.

The engines that run our cars, industries, and generators are among the most damaging sources of air pollution, which is currently one of the biggest risks to both human health and the environment, including within African cities.


        Even while these engines have long propelled economic and industrial development, they today endanger life on Earth by contaminating the air we breathe.
    


        The presence of dangerous substances in the air, both indoors and outdoors, that can have an impact on ecosystems, human health, and the climate constitutes air pollution.

        Although dust storms and wildfires are examples of natural sources of air pollution, human activity is mostly to blame.
    


        Fossil fuel-powered engines in automobiles, factories, building sites, power generators, and, in certain areas, even home cooking systems are the main offenders.
    


        This point was highlighted in a report by HouseFresh, an independent platform that focuses on air quality and its solutions.
    


        “Every day, the average adult inhales approximately 11,000 liters of air. But while getting outside and breathing in fresh air has numerous health benefits, the reality is that not all air is good for you,” the report states.
    


        "Airborne pollutants are one of the greatest sources of toxic exposure known to humankind, and according to one estimate from the World Health Organization, air pollution contributes to seven million premature deaths worldwide every year,” it adds.
    


        Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is airborne particles smaller than 0.033 the diameter of a human hair and originating from engines and other sources, is of particular concern, the report further explains.

        A controlled investigation by Tobacco Control showed that cigarette smoke emits 10 times more PM2.5 matter than diesel vehicle exhaust.
    


        It is more difficult to avoid the poisons that contaminate the air both inside and outdoors, even if stopping smoking lowers exposure to toxins and enhances general health.
    


        “Breathing air pollution of 22 μg/m3 for one day is the equivalent of smoking one cigarette, according to Berkeley Earth. 
    


        But some global cities had average PM2.5 levels of up to 108.3 in 2024, the equivalent of smoking 1,797 cigarettes in a year,” the report states.

Huawei reclaimed the top spot in China's smartphone market in the second quarter of the year, while Apple returned to growth in the country — one of its most critical markets — data released by technology market analyst firm Canalys showed on Monday.

Huawei shipped 12.2 million smartphones in China in the three months ended June, a rise of 15% year on year — equating to 18% market share. It's the first time Huawei has been the biggest player by market share in China since the first quarter of 2024, according to Canalys.

Apple, meanwhile, shipped 10.1 million smartphones in the quarter in China, up 4% year on year and ranking fifth. It is the first time Apple has recorded growth in China since the fourth quarter of 2023, Canalys said.

Shipments represent the number of devices sent to retailers. They do no equate directly to sales but are a gauge of demand.

The numbers come ahead of Apple's quarterly earnings release this week, with investors watching the company's performance in China, a market where the Cupertino giant has faced significant challenges, including intense competition from Huawei and other local players such as Xiaomi.

Huawei, which made a comeback at the end of 2023 after its smartphone business was crippled by U.S. sanctions, has eaten away at Apple's share.

Apple's return to growth in China will be a welcome sign for investors. The U.S. tech giant "strategically adjusted its pricing" for the iPhone 16 series in China, which helped it grow, Canalys said. Chinese e-commerce firms discounted Apple's iPhone 16 models during the quarter. And Apple itself also increased trade-in prices for some iPhone models.

Canalys' numbers back up figures released by Counterpoint Research earlier this month showing Apple's return to growth in China.

Shares of Apple have fallen around 14.5% this year, partly on concerns over China and geopolitical headwinds.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened Apple with tariffs and urged CEO Tim Cook to manufacture iPhones in America, a move experts have said would be near impossible.

Meanwhile, competition in China has intensified. Huawei has aggressively launched various smartphones in the past year and has started to roll out HarmonyOS 5, its self-developed operating system, across various devices. It is a rival to Google's Android and Apple's iOS.

"This move is expected to accelerate the expansion of its independent ecosystem's user base, while also placing greater demands on system compatibility and user experience," Lucas Zhong, analyst at Canalys, said in a press release.

European wine and spirit makers are viewing their exclusion from the newly-etched U.S.-EU trade deal with caution as industry bodies call for a sector specific carve-out.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Sunday that a framework deal imposing 15% tariffs on EU goods imported to the U.S. did not contain any decision regarding the wine and spirits industry, adding that an agreement for the sector would be examined in the coming weeks.

For wine and spirits, provenance is key, making it near impossible for many firms to move production. Meantime, an industry-wide reprieve would provide welcome relief for the sector, which has been under pressure amid waning consumer spending and shifting consumption habits.

Spirits stocks Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau, Diageo and Davide Campari ticked moderately higher early Monday on hopes of a carve-out, before uncertainty seeped in, paring gains.

Brewers — which are typically less impacted by tariffs given their localized production — traded lower, after Heineken posted better-than-expected first half results but pointed to softening U.S. consumer sentiment.

The Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins (CEEV), which represents Europe's wine industry, called for the sector to be included in the final list of products covered in a proposed zero-for-zero tariff arrangement.

"[We] are watching with great anticipation the outcome of the upcoming negotiations regarding the list of products that will be included under the 0-for-0 tariff arrangement, among them some agricultural products" said Marzia Varvaglione, president of CEEV, in a Sunday statement.

"We truly believe the trade of wine is of great benefit for both EU and U.S. companies," she added.

Under the new U.S.-EU trade deal, a mutual zero tariff rate has been agreed for certain strategic products, including "all aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generics [drugs], semiconductor equipment." Discussions around other exclusions, meanwhile, remain underway.

Chris Swonger, CEO and president of the U.S.'s Distilled Spirits Council, similarly said that he was hopeful for an industry-wide reprieve.

"We are optimistic that in the days ahead this positive meeting and agreement will lead to a return to zero-for-zero tariffs for U.S. and EU spirits products," Swonger said in a statement.

Alcohol is one of the EU's leading exports to the U.S., accounting for around 9 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in 2024, according to Eurostat data. The U.S., for its part, exported 1.2 billion worth of spirits alone to the 27-country bloc in 2024, Distilled Spirits Council data shows.

European spirit makers have posted several consecutive quarters of weak sales as the sector has been caught in the crosshairs of trade tensions, while a post-Covid slowdown has suppressed spending.

Verushka Shetty, equity analyst at Morningstar, said uncertainty around tariffs would weigh further on drinks makers in the near-term, even as firms plan mitigating measures such as price hikes.

"We expect a negative impact on margins across our spirits coverage, however we expect the impact to be limited with pricing actions," he wrote in a note.

CEEV, meanwhile, forecast that any move to impose tariffs would force European wine makers to increase prices and could "eject" some EU companies from the U.S. market entirely.

According to CEEV, the U.S.' previous 10% broad-based tariffs on EU imports, imposed during President Donald Trump's 90-day tariff pause, led to an approximate 12% decline in turnover for wine producers.

"While producers may absorb part of the increase to lessen the impact on consumers, this approach is not always feasible or effective," CEEV Secretary General Dr Ignacio Sanchez Recarte told CNBC via email.

Those concerns were echoed by individual producers, too, including Yiannis Paraskevopoulos, co-founder of Greece's Gaia Wines.

"The logic suggests that there will be a negative impact, since I don't really know any consumers —Europeans or Americans — that would welcome a raise to the price," Paraskevopoulos said via email.

Still, others including LVMH-owed champagne brand Moet & Chandon said they were opting to take a pragmatic approach to tariffs until more clarity arrives.

"We stay agile. That's what we do since 280 years," Moet & Chandon's president and CEO Sibylle Scherer told CNBC's Charlotte Reed.

U.S. President Donald Trump has hailed the framework trade agreement with the European Union as the biggest trade deal ever made and one that promises to be "great for cars."

An agreement brokered on Sunday between the U.S. and the EU means the Trump administration will impose a blanket tariff of 15% on most EU goods.

It represents a significant reduction from Trump's threat to impose charges of 30% from Aug. 1 and almost halves the existing tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.

Industry groups, while welcoming the trade deal, have expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the new tariff reality.

Sitting alongside the U.S. president in Scotland on Sunday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen described the agreement as a "good deal" following tough negotiations.

The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) said Monday it is "fundamentally positive" that the U.S. and EU have managed to secure a deal that averts a transatlantic trade dispute.

"The decisive factor now will be how the agreement is structured in concrete terms and how reliable it is," VDA President Hildegard Müller said in a statement.

"However, it is also clear that the US tariff of 15 per cent on automotive products will cost German automotive companies billions annually and place a burden on them in the midst of their transformation," Müller said.

Alongside a call to ensure automotive supply chains receive the necessary support, the VDA also pushed for the EU to make the framework conditions internationally competitive for investors and companies "in order to become more attractive and relevant as an investment location again."

The European Automobile Manufacturers Association, an industry lobby group, said Monday that the U.S.-EU trade agreement represents an important step toward easing "intense uncertainty," welcoming the development in principle.

"Nevertheless, the US will retain higher tariffs on automobiles and automotive parts, and this will continue to have a negative impact not just for industry in the EU but also in the US," ACEA Director-General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.

ACEA said it would closely examine the details of the agreement that still need to be clarified.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said Monday that the new tariff rate of 15% on cars exported from the EU to the U.S. is clearly much better than 27.5% — but it still reflects "a significant burden" for automakers.

"Margins are under pressure in a multi-challenge market and the bill can't be fully passed on to customers without volume losses," Luman told CNBC by email.

Second-quarter earnings season showed that carmakers were already struggling with the tariff impact, Luman said, noting there's more to come over the coming months.

"The weakened dollar also makes US car imports more expensive and complicate things. That's why global car makers are all looking for ways to adjust manufacturing footprints within current facilities," he added.

The Stoxx Europe autos index led gains during early morning deals, up as much as 1.6%, before reversing course to dip into negative territory.

French car parts supplier Valeo traded 4.3% higher at 12:33 p.m. London time (7:33 a.m. ET), with luxury Italian carmaker Ferrari up around 0.9%. Germany's BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz Group, however, were all down more than 1.3%.

Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar, said the U.S.-EU trade deal is likely to benefit EU automakers that have a greater reliance on imports from Europe.

"We estimate that Porsche, Mercedes, BMW, and Volkswagen, in that order, are the most significant beneficiaries of this trade deal, with a greater share of imports from Europe into the US versus Mexico and/ or Canada," Suskin said.

"Stellantis imports a single-digit share of its volumes from the EU for sale in the US, and thus should not see meaningful upside," she added.

Milan-listed shares of Jeep maker Stellantis were last seen 0.6% lower on Monday.

BEIJING — Less than two weeks after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's high-profile visit to Beijing, the U.S. chipmaker was conspicuous by its absence at China's biggest AI event of the year.

Despite renewed hopes this month of selling its less advanced H20 chips to China again, Nvidia didn't have a booth at the World AI Conference that opened Saturday in Shanghai. The company declined CNBC's request for comment.

In contrast, Nvidia's China rival, Huawei, had a large display — focused on its Ascend AI chips — near the venue entrance. Huang has called Huawei "one of the most formidable technology companies in the world," while warning that it could replace Nvidia in China if U.S. sticks with its export curbs on Beijing.

The telecoms giant showed off for the first time the hardware for its computing system that links 384 Ascend chips together to power AI model training and use. Huawei is marketing the product as "Atlas 900 A3 SuperPoD."

Earlier this year, research firm SemiAnalysis pointed out that even though one Ascend chip may be less powerful than Nvidia's most advanced Blackwell chip, an early look at a Huawei system similar to the one unveiled in Shanghai more than offsets the disparity by piling in five times more chips than Nvidia does in its GB200 computing system. But there's an efficiency cost as Huawei's systems require far more power than Nvidia's to operate, the report said.

Huawei is far from being the only Chinese player in the complex supply chain for advanced chips. For example, semiconductor designer Moore Threads and startup Yunsilicon both had booths at the AI expo center in Shanghai.

Many of the exhibitors from startups to giants such as Tencent and Alibaba showed off AI applications in robotics, smart glasses and translation apps. Overall, there was less talk at the expo about needing Nvidia to power their products.

Internet tech company NetEase's Youdao business displayed a handheld bar device that uses AI to help students study material including that for college entrance exams.

The device currently uses both AI based in the cloud and "edge" AI that runs on the device, said Gao Huituan, product manager of educational learning hardware at Youdao.

Looking ahead, he said that new AI chips are becoming more power efficient and are able to support different types of products.

While Nvidia's chips focus more on cloud computing power, "many domestically made, very excellent chip manufacturers are working on some edge devices," he said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. "Now everyone has relatively good computing power."

Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company, riding on the demand for its chips that have been heled drive the latest generative AI breakthroughs.

The company had to stop sales to China in April due to new U.S. restrictions, following tougher export controls over the last three years aimed at reducing China's AI capabilities and which have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to the country. The company tailored the H20 for China, which Huang has said is a $50 billion market.

Tesla, Google, Amazon Web Services and Siemens were among the U.S. and European companies with booths at the AI conference in Shanghai.

Nvidia had a booth in Beijing earlier this month at an annual supply chain conference, which coincided with Huang's third visit to China this year and news that the U.S. will allow the chipmaker to resume sales of the H20 chips to China.

But the company has not shared when shipments would begin or how many orders it had received from Chinese customers.

"Nvidia is the model in (AI) GPU development for the short to medium term not just because of H20, but also because of flagship products like the GB300," Phelix Lee, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in an emailed statement. "The return of H20 could help Nvidia to remain as the de facto standard in AI datacenter systems, especially when domestic alternatives are lurking."

Beijing has been striving to boost tech self-sufficiency as it has faced U.S. restrictions accessing high-end tech. The country over the weekend also took another step toward promoting its AI standards globally. 

Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced plans for a global AI cooperation organization during a speech at Saturday's opening ceremony. The initial headquarters will likely be in Shanghai, state media said.

The plans come just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced an American action plan for AI that included calls to reduce alleged "woke" bias in AI models and support the deployment of U.S. tech overseas.

U.S. Treasury yields were slightly higher on Monday as investors anticipated the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later on Wednesday at the end of a two-day policy meeting, as well as a key inflation reading that will shed light on the effect of tariffs on the economy.

The 10-year Treasury yield was up three basis point to 4.416%. The 2-year yield was 1.7 basis points higher at 3.934%, while the 30-year bond yield climbed about two basis point to 4.948%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01%. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Trade tensions appeared to ease Sunday, with the U.S. and European Union announcing a tentative trade agreement that includes 15% tariffs on EU goods imported into the U.S., down from a previously proposed 30% levy that the EU would have been hit with on Friday.

Meanwhile, bond traders face a busy week ahead, with the Fed set to meet for two days starting Tuesday. After that, the central bank won't meet again for more than seven weeks, until Sept. 16-17.

Wall Street sees virtually no chance of a change in the Fed's benchmark lending rate, currently 4.25% to 4.50%. Interest rate futures traded at the CME Group show a 97% likelihood that rates will stay unchanged, FedWatch Tool.

Instead, traders will focus their attention on remarks scheduled to be made after this week's meeting by Fed chair Jerome Powell, who will explain policymakers' latest thinking on whether there's enough slack in the economy to bring rates down later in the year.

"The bond market is likely to respond subsequently to whether it approves of the Fed's actions and statements; any perception that the FOMC is behind the curve on inflation may put pressure on the longer end of the US Treasury curve," said Naomi Fink, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management. "Conversely, softer data releases on both growth and inflation may invite expectations for the FOMC to converge upon future rate cuts."

One day later, the personal consumption expenditures index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — is due on Thursday and will reveal the effects of tariffs on inflation. The June report is forecast to show inflation increasing to 2.4% from 2.3% year over year, according to FactSet, and to 0.31% from 0.14%, on a monthly basis. 

Other economic data due out this week includes the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for June on Tuesday, ADP's private payrolls report on Wednesday, weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday and July's nonfarm payrolls report on Friday.

Alibaba on Monday unveiled a pair of smart glasses powered by its artificial intelligence models, marking the Chinese firm's first foray into the product category.

The e-commerce giant said the Quark AI Glasses will be launched in China by the end of 2025 with hardware powered by the firm's Qwen large language model and its advanced AI assistant called Quark.

The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, aggressively launching new models with capabilities that compete with Western counterparts like OpenAI.

Many tech companies see wearables, specifically glasses, as the next frontier in computing alongside the smartphone. Quark, which was updated this year, is currently available as an app in China. Alibaba is stepping into the hardware game as a way to distribute the app more widely.

The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's answer to Meta's smart glasses that were designed in collaboration with Ray-Ban. The Chinese tech giant will also now compete with Chinese consumer electronics player Xiaomi who this year released its own AI glasses.

Alibaba said its glasses will support hands-free calling, music streaming, real-time language translation, and meeting transcription. The glasses also feature a built-in camera.

Alibaba owns a range of different services in China from mapping to an online travel agent. Its affiliate company Ant Group also runs the widely-used Alipay mobile service. Alibaba said users will be able to use a navigation service via the glasses, pay with Alipay and compare prices on Taobao, its China e-commerce platform.

The firm has yet to release other details such as the price and technical specifications.

Russia's war machine has become such an integral part of its economic engine that its military industry is likely to keep expanding even after the fighting in Ukraine ends, according to a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"The end of hostilities will not lead to a radical cut-off of military investment," wrote CSIS analysts in a report published on Thursday.

Now in its fourth year, Russia's war with Ukraine continues even as Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration weathers sweeping Western sanctions. And while cracks are starting to show, the Russian economy may still be able to sustain the war effort for several more years, the report said.

Defense spending is set to hit a post-Soviet record of 6.3% of GDP in 2025 and could climb even higher despite mounting signs of economic slowdown or recession.

"Russia's economy appears sustainable for the next few years," the CSIS analysts wrote. They forecast that the Kremlin could maintain its war of attrition through at least 2027.

The CSIS report comes amid renewed scrutiny of Russia's economy.

Manufacturing activity contracted last month, and employment has suffered. GDP growth slowed to 1.4% in the first quarter, down sharply from 4.5% in the previous quarter.

Still, Russia has defied expectations thanks to its growing military-industrial complex.

"Having become the most sanctioned country in the world, it has managed to maneuver around many economic constraints, keeping revenues from energy sales high and its budget balanced, investing in the military and defense industry, ramping up domestic production of weapons and equipment, and boosting economic growth," wrote the think tank analysts.

Crucially, the militarized economy has built a broad base of political and economic stakeholders — from elites to ordinary workers — who benefit from continued conflict. That makes any significant drawdown in military activity politically and economically unlikely.

Even if a ceasefire is reached, Russia may still be able to rebuild and expand its armed forces over the next decade.

"Russia's war-induced socioeconomic changes have been so significant that the process of societal militarization is unlikely to stop even if the war in Ukraine were to end," wrote the CSIS analysts.

The Kremlin's strategic posture hasn't softened either. CSIS suggests Russia is preparing for a long-term confrontation with NATO, using the war to modernize its forces and test Western resolve.

Beyond conventional arms, Russia has ramped up hybrid warfare, including cyberattacks, disinformation, sabotage, political meddling, and strikes on critical infrastructure. These tools allow Moscow to operate aggressively across multiple fronts.

"Despite being inferior to NATO in terms of its conventional capabilities, today's Russia represents a bigger challenge to European security than it did at the start of 2022," the CSIS analysts wrote.

The Kremlin is learning from past failures, adapting quickly, and growing more confident in what it sees as a West unwilling to stop it.

"Moscow's ongoing large-scale military reforms signal that Russia could be preparing for some kind of future confrontation with NATO within roughly the next decade—including even a large-scale conventional war," they wrote.

Japanese automakers may have sidestepped crushing U.S. tariffs, but the reprieve is offering little comfort as Chinese automakers erode their long-held global edge, complicated by persistent structural challenges at home.

On July 22, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that auto tariffs on Japan-made vehicle imports to the U.S. were lowered to 15% from the current 25%.

However, the light isn't at the end of the tunnel just yet, industry experts cautioned.

"The trade deal struck with the U.S. is certainly a relief in that it offers some certainty that U.S. tariffs on Japan-made cars won't rise to punitive levels," said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan and Frontier market economics at Moody's Analytics. 

"But I'd hesitate to call it good news. A 15% U.S. import tariff is still significantly higher than where Japan started. And a 15% tariff is certainly a higher rate than most had expected."

The larger challenge, analysts say, comes from China's meteoric rise in the global automotive industry. Once an important growth market for Japanese brands, China has transformed into a dominant competitor.

A key challenge for Japanese producers is the intensifying competition from China, Angrick said. China's push into advanced manufacturing has transformed it into a formidable competitor just as domestic demand for Japan-made cars began to soften, he added.

Seconding his view is Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars, who noted that lower-cost Chinese vehicles remain the "single biggest threat" to Japan's auto industry and economic outlook.

China is the world's largest car producer and exporter, particularly of electric vehicles.  The country's growing dominance in critical components and EV innovation is increasingly squeezing foreign automakers. 

Chinese automakers have also been making significant inroads into Southeast Asia — a region long dominated by Japanese brands like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan — making it an uphill battle for Japanese automakers to maintain their once-unassailable global market share.

According to a 2025 report by PwC, the market share of Japanese auto manufacturers in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Singapore, commonly referred to as ASEAN-6, fell from 68.2% in 2023 to 63.9% in 2024. 

"[China autos] are expanding into markets where Japanese firms used to have a strong foothold. Thailand is one example," said the Moody's Analytics' expert.

Beyond Southeast Asia, Japan's second-largest car export market is also being contested by China: Australia.

A recent study commissioned by the Australian Automotive Dealer Association predicts that China is poised to surpass other countries as Australia's leading source of vehicle imports within the next decade. 

By 2035, 43% of all imported vehicles in Australia are expected to be manufactured in China, up from the expected 17% in 2025, the report suggested. By contrast, Japanese imports are expected to fall from 32% in 2025 to 22% by 2035.

Besides external competition, Japan's automotive sector is contending with domestic economic challenges, including high inflation and weak consumer spending — similar to other developed economies.While large automakers like Toyota continue to find success domestically, Nissan is especially vulnerable due to the growing threat from China's automotive industry, Brauer explained.

Earlier missteps by the management and planned plant closures are compounding its woes. Nissan plans to shut down seven of its 17 plants by fiscal 2027 and reduce its global workforce by around 15% as part of a restructuring plan.

"All in all, the outlook for Japan's car industry is very challenging," Moody's Angrick said.

While Toyota's global scale and diversified manufacturing footprint give it a relative advantage in maneuvering said challenges, smaller automakers such as Subaru and Mazda are under more pressure, noted Mio Kato, founder of Lightstream Research.

While Subaru and Mazda do face a "significantly higher burden," they do have an advantage in having strong ties to Toyota, said Kato.

Mazada, for one, shares a joint plant with Toyota, while Subaru is teaming up with Toyota to manufacture a co-developed electric vehicle slated for a 2026 debut.

In the long term, Kato believes that these partnerships could deepen, potentially leading to a more formal consolidation under Toyota's umbrella. 

"I wouldn't expect [a consolidation] to happen on a short-term timeframe. However, it is certainly something for them to consider when you start looking towards the end of the decade, perhaps," he said.

Still, analysts acknowledge that Trump's finalized tariff rate brings at least one benefit: some predictability.

While it is still too soon to fully infer the long-term impact of the new trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan, having a confirmed tariff agreement will allow Japanese automakers to know their pricing and cost structures going forward, experts echoed.

However, it remains unclear what tariff rates other automakers will face.

"I think the absolute case for Japan is now understood relatively well, but in terms of how their competitiveness shifts, versus say, autos manufactured in Korea and exported or from Mexico and Canada, that could still impact the profit outlook for Japanese auto companies," Kato said.

A 2025 guide highlights seven crypto sportsbooks offering real-time odds, instant payouts, and privacy-focused betting options for UEFA tournaments such as the Champions League and Europa League. These platforms leverage blockchain technology to streamline transactions, bypass traditional banking intermediaries, and provide transparent, decentralized betting experiences [1].  

Dexsport, ranked as the top choice, distinguishes itself through a fully decentralized infrastructure, no KYC requirements, and support for over 38 cryptocurrencies. Users can access in-play betting, real-time cashouts, and audited smart contracts verified by CertiK and Pessimistic [1]. Cloudbet, a long-established player in the crypto betting space, combines BTC/ETH compatibility with live UEFA match coverage and mobile-optimized interfaces. While it requires KYC verification for large withdrawals, its reputation for reliability appeals to high-volume bettors [1]. BC.Game emphasizes rewards, offering crypto-friendly betting with live and pre-match markets alongside promotions like rain events and rakeback. Stake.com, backed by major sports sponsorships, provides competitive odds and advanced betting tools but applies KYC rules regionally [1].  

Thunderpick bridges esports and football betting, catering to users who prioritize data-rich interfaces and partial KYC requirements. Fairspin, a blockchain-powered platform, emphasizes on-chain transaction transparency and smart contract-backed betting for UEFA events. BetFury integrates DeFi incentives, offering cashback in BFG tokens and hybrid features that blend sports betting with casino-style rewards [1]. A comparative analysis of the platforms reveals varying degrees of privacy controls, with Dexsport and Fairspin prioritizing no-KYC access, while Stake.com and Cloudbet adopt stricter verification protocols for larger transactions.  

The shift toward crypto betting for UEFA events reflects broader trends in decentralized finance (DeFi), where users seek faster, more transparent financial services. The absence of traditional banking friction—such as delays or currency conversion fees—enhances user experience, particularly for international audiences. However, the regulatory landscape remains fragmented, with platforms like Cloudbet and Stake.com adjusting KYC requirements based on regional compliance mandates [1]. Analysts note that while blockchain-based betting offers privacy and speed, users must remain vigilant about platform trustworthiness, as the lack of centralized oversight can introduce risks related to fraud or operational transparency.  

Responsible gambling remains a critical concern, with the guide emphasizing that users should never bet beyond their financial capacity. The integration of blockchain technology in sports betting is still evolving, and its long-term success will depend on regulatory clarity, user education, and continued innovation in secure, decentralized platforms [1].

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Ethereum's 10th anniversary on July 30, 2025, will be marked by a global livestream and the distribution of a free commemorative NFT, the “Torch NFT.” The event, centered on the exact timestamp of Ethereum's Genesis Block launch (3:26:13 PM UTC), will feature panels, reflections from core developers, and co-founders such as Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin, and Mihai Alisie [1]. Participants can mint the NFT for 24 hours following the livestream, which begins at 2:30 UTC. The Ethereum Foundation emphasizes that the campaign prioritizes community engagement over regulatory announcements, aligning with its broader strategy to reinforce the network's role in decentralized finance (DeFi), tokenization, and digital ownership [2].  

Global participation in the anniversary includes in-person meetups in cities like Shenzhen and China Hong Kong, supported by the Foundation's Ecosystem Support Program through microgrants of up to $500. These initiatives aim to strengthen community bonds and highlight Ethereum's decade-long impact on blockchain innovation. Collaborative projects such as the Protocol Guild and Shutter Network are documenting the network's history through the Ethereum Time Capsule, blending past achievements with speculative future directions [1].  

The livestream and NFT campaign are expected to temporarily boost network activity, a pattern observed during prior Ethereum milestones that coincided with surges in NFT transactions and Layer 2 adoption. Institutional recognition, including NASDAQ's acknowledgment of the anniversary, underscores growing interest in Ethereum's technological influence. Analysts note that while the free NFT distribution could drive short-term on-chain engagement, the Ethereum Foundation has not tied the event to price forecasts. Historical data from similar milestones shows increased participation but no sustained market movements [2].  

The decentralized nature of the anniversary campaign reflects Ethereum's commitment to community-driven growth. By fostering global collaboration through on-chain activities and grassroots events, the network aims to highlight its contributions to decentralized innovation over the past decade. The inclusion of core contributors and ecosystem partners in the livestream further emphasizes Ethereum's collaborative ethos, ensuring the celebration resonates across diverse regions.

 The move reflects rising institutional appetite for yield-generating crypto exposure, according to SOL Strategies. 

Cathie Wood's ARK Invest has named Canada-based SOL Strategies as its exclusive staking partner for the company's Digital Assets Revolutions Fund.

Under the partnership, ARK Invest will move its validator operations to the SOL Strategies staking infrastructure. Created in 2020, the Fund typically invests in 10 to 12 cryptocurrencies aiming to generate returns over a full market cycle of four to five years.

“We serve a growing number of institutional and enterprise clients seeking compliant, reliable access to Solana through delegated staking and custom validator infrastructure,” SOL Strategies CEO Leah Wald told Cointelegraph. BitGo, an institutional custody platform that partnered with SOL Strategies in April, will also be involved.

Staking is the process of locking up cryptocurrencies to help secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. Solana epochs last about two to three days, after which Solana (SOL) stakers receive a certain amount of the native coin.

“We currently operate five validators with over 3.59 million SOL (CAD $888 million) ($647.2 million) in assets under delegation and more than 5,700 unique wallets staked, with just 12% coming from our own treasury, the rest from third parties,” Wald said.

However, staking has risks. If a validator were to misbehave, its staked tokens could be slashed, resulting in losses for investors. According to Solana Compass, roughly 403 million SOL tokens are being staked at this writing for a total of $73.5 billion.

SOL Strategies posted a loss of $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2025, although its staking and validating revenue grew significantly. Other companies like DeFi Development Corp. and Upexi have also pivoted to Solana treasuries as the asset has gained more traction among traditional investors.

ARK Invest's move indicates increased interest from institutional investors, who may want to earn yield on crypto assets along with the potential appreciation in price. Asset managers are also seeking to get exposure to Ether (ETH) staking.

Over the past few months, several issuers of Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have submitted formal requests with the SEC seeking approval for income-generating features.

“We're seeing a clear surge in institutional interest in Solana exposure, not just to the asset, but to structured, investable vehicles that provide access with regulatory clarity,” Wald said. 

ARK Invest is well-known in crypto circles, making a plethora of investments with significant amounts of capital. Recently, it scooped up shares in Circle's initial public offering before selling the first batch of shares for $52 million on June 17. It is an active participant in Bitcoin ETFs and has invested in crypto companies' stocks in the past.

Digital payments giant PayPal (PYPL) said it is rolling out a service that lets U.S. merchants accept over 100 cryptocurrencies in payment for purchases as it aims to cut cross-border fees.

The feature, dubbed Pay with Crypto and available in the coming weeks, enables shoppers to use crypto wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase at checkout. Payments can be made with digital assets such as bitcoin BTC$118,000.61, ether (ETH), XRP XRP$3.1494 and stablecoins like USDC and USDT, covering 90% of the total crypto market cap. The merchants receive U.S. dollars, settling the transaction almost instantaneously, a spokesperson said Monday.

The company will charge a 0.99% service fee, some 90% less than international credit card processing, PayPal said.

"Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations," President and CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement. 

"Imagine a shopper in Guatemala buying a special gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City," he cited as an example. "Using PayPal's open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal."

The rollout extends PayPal's push into digital assets, which includes its U.S. dollar stablecoin (PYUSD) and recent partnerships to expand stablecoin use globally. Merchants can also earn yield on PYUSD balances held within PayPal accounts.

Blockchain rails, especially stablecoins, are increasingly viewed as a cheaper and faster alternative for cross-border payments than traditional the banking system.

PayPal will allow smaller businesses in the U.S. to accept 100 cryptocurrencies on its platform, including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Solana on its network, the payments services provider announced Monday.

Pay with Crypto will enable users to convert crypto to stablecoins or to other fiat currencies, the firm said. It will support transactions for a number of wallets, including Coinbase, Kraken and MetaMask.

"Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations," Alex Chriss, PayPal's president and CEO, said in a statement. "Today, we're removing these barriers and helping every business of every size achieve their goals,"

The service comes as PayPal continues to expand its crypto services.

Last Wednesday, San Jose-based PayPal said that it was planning to introduce a new platform in the fall, PayPal World, that will link domestic digital wallets to its global network of billions of users.

PayPal's PYUSD, which debuted in 2023, has a more than $901 market capitalization, and the firm subsequently allowed users to swap PYUSD for dollars to make international payments via payments platform Xoom.

PayPal users have been able to access crypto since late 2020, after a feature allowed users to buy, sell, and hold four cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin—but not to move the funds to external destinations. PayPal customers are now able to transfer such digital coins elsewhere. 

The firm said in a statement that Pay with Crypto would allow merchants to increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal." The initiative will cover 90% of the crypto market, which according to crypto data provider CoinGecko has a market value approaching $4 trillion.

Decrypt reached out to PayPal for additional comment. 

Noting last week's PayPal World announcement, which brings together five of the world's largest digital wallets on a single platform," Chriss said, adding that the firm was "breaking long-standing barriers in global commerce."

"These innovations don't just simplify payments—they drive merchant growth, expand consumer choice, and reduce costs," he said. "This is the future of inclusive, borderless commerce, and we're proud to lead it."

PayPal was up nearly 0.67% in early Monday trading, according to Yahoo Finance. The stock is up nearly 5% over the past week.

Bitcoin was trading at almost $118,400, flat over the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko.

                            Vietnam's NDAChain Explained: Privacy, Trust, and Blockchain at Scale.                        


Key Takeaways

In a bold leap toward digital sovereignty and technological leadership, Vietnam has launched NDAChain, its first national blockchain platform. 

Positioned as a secure and scalable foundation for digital identity, e-government, and supply chain systems, NDAChain is set to transform how Vietnam handles trust, privacy, and verification in the digital age.

But what makes NDAChain unique? And how does it compare to blockchain infrastructures in countries like China and the European Union?

Let's dive in.

NDAChain is Vietnam's official, permissioned layer‑1 blockchain, developed by the National Data Association and operated by the Ministry of Public Security. 

Launched in July 2025, it is built to serve as a national trust infrastructure, a decentralized layer that secures digital identities, government records, and traceable supply chains.

NDAChain's technical architecture is designed for high performance, privacy, and institutional-grade governance, combining the following key features:

Key components driving NDAChain's real-world adoption include:

NDAChain is more than just a blockchain, it's Vietnam's digital trust backbone. By late 2025, NDAChain is set to become a core component of Vietnam's National Data Center, with plans to extend its reach to provincial authorities and academic institutions by 2026.

The following phase will prioritize talent development, global partnerships, and the rollout of layer-2 solutions customized for key industries.

As Vietnam accelerates its digital transformation, real-world blockchain use cases are emerging at national scale. From secure identity verification to transparent supply chains and privacy-first data systems, these innovations are laying the groundwork for a more efficient, trusted, and globally integrated digital economy.

As countries race to build digital infrastructure, how does Vietnam's NDAChain compare?

NDAChain is engineered to bridge public oversight with private-sector innovation while meeting global standards. Here's why it stands out:

Vietnam is no longer just catching up in the digital race, it's setting a new standard. With NDAChain, the country is building a trusted, privacy-respecting, and globally connected digital infrastructure that rivals even the most established blockchain ecosystems.

As other countries grapple with balancing control and decentralization, Vietnam may have just found the sweet spot.

A popular pseudonymous crypto analyst on X known as "Wolf" has outlined a bullish roadmap for ether, predicting the second-largest cryptocurrency could hit $13,000 as early as the fourth quarter. While $13,000 is his optimistic scenario, Wolf's conservative target still places ETH above $8,000 — more than double its current level.

In a chart-based post shared Friday, Wolf said he expects ether to continue rising sharply after reaching new all-time highs, though he warned of a 20%–25% correction following that breakout. He characterized this pullback as a “final shakeout” before a longer-term rally resumes.

Supporting the bullish outlook, institutional activity appears to be picking up. On-chain analysis service "Lookonchain" reported Monday that SharpLink Gaming (SBET), the Nasdaq-listed company that launched its ETH treasury strategy on June 2, had purchased another 77,210 ETH for roughly $295 million. The company now holds 438,017 ETH — worth approximately $1.69 billion — making it the largest publicly traded corporate holder of ether.

The purchase follows SharpLink's appointment of former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom as its new co-CEO last week, and came just three days after the company disclosed 567 ETH earned in staking rewards since it started accumulating ether.

Meanwhile, Placeholder Ventures partner Chris Burniske noted that sentiment around ether has shifted dramatically over the past month. “ETH went from most hated coin to darling of CT in ~5 weeks,” he wrote, referring to the crypto community on X. The token has gained roughly 73% since June 23.

Ether is currently trading at $3,884, up 2% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.

For years, the world has been watching China's efforts to establish the digital yuan as a major player on the global stage. However, despite high-profile trials and substantial government support, the digital yuan hasn't yet caught on internationally as Beijing likely expected.

Meanwhile, a quiet pivot is underway in Beijing, where blockchain startups are piloting yuan-backed stablecoins — a possible fallback for extending the currency's global footprint — just as Washington moves to clear the way for dollar-linked stablecoins to scale abroad.

In mid-July, Chinese financial news outlet Sina Finance reported that Conflux Network, a Chinese Layer 1 blockchain backed by the Shanghai government, had teamed up with fintech company AnchorX and Shenzhen-based public firm Eastcompeace Technology to create stablecoins tied to the offshore yuan, known as CNH.

The stablecoins are expected to circulate in countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive international development project spanning over 140 countries, including Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Conflux Network CTO Dr. Guang Yang told The Defiant that Conflux 3.0 aims to address the “security and auditing needs critical to stablecoin adoption by focusing on compatibility.”

“As part of China's national key R&D program, Conflux is also piloting cross-border stablecoin payment applications across Belt and Road countries—paving the way for real-world Web3 utility,” Yang said.

AnchorX's head of product, Jozey Zhou, explained that as part of the collaboration, AxCNH is designed to “streamline cross-border payments and trade within Belt and Road countries.” 

“While not yield-bearing, AxCNH prioritizes stability and transparency. Independent audits are in progress and will be shared once finalized,” Zhou added.

The move stands out given that China still bans crypto trading and mining, while Hong Kong is taking a more open approach with a stablecoin licensing system starting on August 1. Big tech firms like JD.com and Ant Group are also said to be pushing Beijing to allow offshore yuan-based stablecoins as global competition intensifies.

Building anything blockchain-related in China has never been a straightforward task. In May 2023, Shanghai authorities detained the team behind CNHC Group — later rebranded as Trust Reserve — the issuer of the offshore yuan-pegged CNHC and Hong Kong dollar-pegged HKDC stablecoins, backed by KuCoin Ventures and launched on Conflux.

The group was suspected of unlicensed stablecoin issuance and potential financial misconduct, and their Pudong office was sealed under a judicial order. No formal charges or resolution have been made public since. KuCoin Ventures did not immediately respond to The Defiant's request for comment.

While China continues to expand real-world use cases for its digital yuan, the U.S. appears to be charting a different course, placing greater emphasis on privately issued, dollar-backed stablecoins.

In late July, the House of Representatives passed a trio of crypto-related bills aimed at bringing regulatory clarity to the space. Chief among them is the GENIUS Act, which laid out federal rules for stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar.

The shift in Washington hasn't necessarily gone unnoticed in Beijing. In recent weeks, even state-linked Chinese media have begun nudging policymakers to take the stablecoin space more seriously.

For instance, an article published in Securities Times — a publication under the umbrella of the People's Daily Group, the media arm of the Chinese Communist Party — urged authorities to “adapt to the trend of stablecoins” before the moment passes. Waiting too long, the piece warned, could mean missing a “golden opportunity” to expand the yuan's global footprint.

Experts cited in the article argued that supporting and regulating yuan-based stablecoins might prove to be a more practical path than relying solely on a central bank-issued digital currency.

Taken together, these signals suggest a quiet recalibration in China's approach to digital currency. The digital yuan may still be the centerpiece of Beijing's ambitions, but yuan-backed stablecoins — especially those issued offshore — could represent a more nimble, globally palatable alternative.

Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo, famous for creating on-chain valuation metrics like the Network Value to Transactions ratio and the Supply Shock valuation model, says he has sold all his BTC.

“I sold all of mine,” he said Monday on X, referring to his Bitcoin holdings.

When asked why by an X user, Woo said, “because I can do just as well supporting the picks and shovels of the best emerging asset as it grows,” alluding to Bitcoin startups.

Don't Miss:

7,000+ investors have joined Timeplast's mission to eliminate microplastics—now it's your turn to invest in the future of sustainable plastic before time runs out. 

Trade crypto futures on Plus500 with up to $200 in bonuses — no wallets, just price speculation and free paper trading to practice different strategies.

It is not the first time Woo has discussed this strategic pivot, though it is the first time he has revealed that he has dumped all his coins. In an interview with Cointelegraph last week, he said Bitcoin at best had a further 50x upside potential, assuming its market cap could surge to as high as $100 trillion. On the other hand, he said a good Bitcoin venture could yield “100 to 1000x” gains.

Woo added that these Bitcoin ventures could also offer downside protection by holding Bitcoin in their treasuries.

“It just makes sense that smart money would go into Bitcoin infrastructure,” he said. “It is now the picks and shovels series.”

However, venture investing is far from an easy business, especially compared to the simplicity of buying and holding or dollar cost-averaging into Bitcoin.

“You have to be strategic for the startup to bring you onto the investment cap table,” Woo said. “The valuations are very low, typically between four and 20 million for the whole value, and hopefully it becomes a unicorn.”

Trending: Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto – unlock the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account.

Still, venture investing likely comes more naturally to Woo than the average Joe, as he told Cointelegraph that he was investing in early ventures before the emergence of Bitcoin.

“I've been in the startup space since way before Bitcoin, and I like investing in the next generation of founders,” he said.

Highlighting what is possible in the space, Woo pointed to Exodus wallet parent Exodus Movement (NYSE:EXOD).

“In 2016, they did a crowdfunding,” he told Cointelegraph. “I had a seed round in there, and it was the only wallet that had a really good UX at the time, and it had a good business model as well.”

The firm had raised $4 million in the seed round and was listed on the NYSE American in December for nearly $1 billion.

Meanwhile, Woo told Cointelegraph that it was not previously the case that investing in a Bitcoin venture outperformed investing in Bitcoin, citing Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN). He said if one had invested in the leading cryptocurrency exchange during its 2012 funding round, one would have yielded underwhelming returns by the 2021 IPO compared to holding Bitcoin over the same period.

“You would underperform Bitcoin by 50%, like you would have lost half your Bitcoin,” he said. “Bitcoin was growing so strong in those early days. But today it's more reliable to outperform Bitcoin with a venture.”

Among Woo's picks in this perceived new market phase is Debifi, a platform that allows Bitcoin holders to borrow fiat against their holdings without giving up self-custody.

“The big core part of their technology is a multi-key hardware sort of escrow for all the parties,” he said. “I like it, because it very much promotes self-custody.”

Debifi completed a second seed round in June 2024 but did not disclose how much was raised or its present valuation.

$BNB just smashed through its previous all-time high to hit $855, setting the stage for what some analysts are calling a full-on altcoin revival.

The rally didn't just move charts. It vaporized nearly $180M in leveraged positions in under 24 hours, mostly shorts, as traders scrambled to unwind. Trading volume roared past $3B, while open interest surged above $1.71B, signaling serious conviction behind the breakout, and not just a weekend pump.



BNB's push was powered by a mix of rising network activity, renewed institutional demand (including treasury buys from companies like Nano Labs), and growing belief in a $1,000–$2,000 target by Q4. Analysts say this could be just the start of a broader expansion phase.

And here's the real signal: when a major altcoin breaks ATH with this kind of momentum, money rotates fast.

$BNB's breakout isn't just a Binance flex… It's a broader signal that altcoin infrastructure is back in the spotlight.



Binance remains the most dominant exchange globally, and when its native token hits new highs, it suggests real trust in centralized exchange narratives, DeFi pipelines, and ecosystem expansion.

Treasury allocations from companies like WindTree ($520M) and Nano Labs ($50M) show that institutions aren't just holding $BTC anymore; they're diversifying.

And here's what usually happens next: liquidation-fueled rallies like this one tend to unlock sidelined capital. Once the dust settles, that money looks for fresher, more volatile opportunities – typically smaller-cap tokens with better risk-reward.

Retail sentiment has flipped, too. With $BNB's move reigniting greed across Crypto Twitter, attention and smart money naturally shifted to early-stage plays that could ride the next wave.

If you're eyeing asymmetric upside as $BNB flies into price discovery, here are three of the best altcoins that are worth some attention.

If MetaMask feels like it hasn't evolved in years, you're not wrong, and that's exactly where Best Wallet steps in.

From lower gas fees to staking perks, exclusive iGaming bonuses, and early access to top presales, Best Wallet gamifies the wallet experience in a way legacy apps simply don't.



Its Upcoming Tokens tool has already helped raise over $2M for presales directly inside the app, cutting out scam sites and mirror links. Security-wise, it's backed by Fireblocks' MPC-CMP tech, making it one of the safest retail wallets out there.

And the wallet's official token, Best Wallet Token ($BEST), improves on every single aspect in the noncustodial ecosystem.

$BEST is more than just another utility token. It powers an ecosystem designed to turn your everyday crypto usage into something more rewarding.

The project's growing at 50% month-on-month, with a presale price of $0.025395 and over $14M already raised. And it's still early.

If $BNB's ATH showed one thing, it's that infrastructure matters. Best Wallet is betting that crypto wallets (not DEXs) will be the next frontier.

Check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction to see how successful we think this project could be.

What if Bitcoin could actually scale? Not with sidechains or half-measures, but with a real execution layer.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) delivers just that. It's the first true Layer-2 for Bitcoin powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), enabling sub-second transactions, smart contracts, and real DeFi, all secured by Bitcoin itself.

This isn't just theoretical: memecoins, payments, staking, and composable dApps are already being built on top.



Its Canonical Bridge allows seamless, trustless $BTC transfers minting between Layer 1 and Layer 2, where you lock in your $BTC and receive equivalent wrapped Bitcoin on the l2.

And unlike most Ethereum scaling solutions, it works cross-chain, compatible with ERC-20 and BEP-20 wallets out of the box.

The public presale has already raised over $5.39M, with the token currently priced at $0.012425. And yes, staking is live, currently at 188%.

If you think Bitcoin's next chapter is more than just hodling, $HYPER is where that future starts – fast, cheap, and meme-ready.

To get involved in the presale, read our how to buy Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) guide for a step-by-step walkthrough.

What happens when nostalgia, Elon Musk, and whale wallets collide? You get Vine Coin ($VINE), a meme token riding the revival of one of the internet's most beloved platforms.

Elon teased the return of Vine in AI form earlier this year, and Rus Yusupov (@rus), the platform's former CEO, then launched $VINE, blurring the line between meme and ecosystem.

But since then, Elon recently announced on X that Vine is coming back, in AI form. $VINE is still speculative, yes, but when a single wallet drops $3M on the token, it's hard not to pay attention.



With a current market cap of $151M, 238% gains in the last week, and over $746M in trading volume, $VINE isn't just another viral token; it's becoming a serious player in the altcoin space.

There's no official word on whether it'll be integrated into the AI-powered Vine comeback, but investor behavior suggests plenty are betting on exactly that.

$BNB smashing through $850 isn't just bullish for Binance – it's a signal that risk appetite is back, and altcoin narratives are heating up fast.

You don't have to go all-in on every trend. But catching just one of these early, before the next leg kicks off, can make all the difference in a cycle defined by asymmetric bets.

As always, please do your own research (DYOR). This is not financial advice. Crypto markets are volatile, and presales carry risk. Never invest more than you're willing to lose.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, July  28, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The renaming marks a strategic turning point in the journey to redefine the role, mission, and vision of the Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association (VBA), reaffirming its commitment to promoting the development of the Vietnam Blockchain Service Network (VBSN) toward a comprehensive, sustainable national-scale blockchain ecosystem.

On July 25, 2025, the Vietnam Blockchain Association officially announced its new name: Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association (VBA). The new name reflects the Association's shift in direction, from promoting blockchain technology to becoming a central force in shaping and leading the development of Vietnam's digital assets market and blockchain ecosystem, starting with the VBSN.

   

100% of delegates approve renaming to Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Asset Association 

A representative from the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that the new name demonstrates VBA's progressive vision and timely adaptation to the emerging digital assets market. The renaming decision was unanimously approved by 100% of the Executive Committee, members, and representatives from government agencies including the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Science and Technology during the Association's Extraordinary General Meeting in 2025. 

This event took place in the context of Vietnam issuing a series of strategic policies guiding the development of blockchain and digital assets. On October 22, 2024, the Prime Minister signed Decision No. 1236/QĐ-TTg to announce the National Blockchain Strategy, aiming for Vietnam to become a regional leader with international standing in blockchain by 2030. 

According to Decision No. 1131/QĐ-TTg issued on June 12, 2025, blockchain is listed among 11 strategic technologies. Notably, the Digital Technology Industry Law, passed on June 14, 2025 and effective from January 1, 2026, officially recognizes digital assets as legally protected assets.  According to Ms. Nguyễn Vân Hiền, Vice Chairwoman and Secretary General of VBA, “This name change not only reflects our alignment with global trends but also affirms our determination to promote the integration of blockchain technology and digital assets into Vietnam's legal, financial, and public service systems, helping the country to participate in the global digital transformation actively.” 

The General Meeting also approved the addition of eight new Executive Committee members, expanding the leadership body to 28 members. Mr. Phan Đức Trung was reappointed as Chairman of VBA, alongside three Vice Chairwomen and Chairmen: Ms. Nguyễn Vân Hiền, Mr. Nguyễn Trọng Khang, and Mr. Phan Chiến Thắng.

  

Chairman Phan Đức Trung outlines 5-year strategic plan (2025–2030)

Looking ahead to the 2025–2030 period, VBA aims to support at least 50 domestic enterprises in deploying blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) solutions on the VBSN platform. The Association will also pilot at least three public services using blockchain and develop two fintech initiatives applying blockchain in the financial and banking sectors. 

 Chairman Phan Đức Trung emphasized, “With our new name, an expanded strategic direction, and a strengthened leadership team, VBA is entering a new phase of strategic development. In this stage, technology is no longer merely a goal, it is a driving force for innovation, enhancing national competitiveness and contributing to Vietnam's presence on the global digital economy map.” For more info about Vietnam Blockchain and Digital Assets Association:Website: https://blockchain.vn/X: https://x.com/VietnamVBADisclaimer: The information provided in this press release is not a solicitation for investment, nor is it intended as investment advice, financial advice, or trading advice.

Esports-focused media company GameSquare has provided an update on its crypto asset treasury plan. 

In a recently published press release, GameSquare announced that its board approved a 150% increase to its Ethereum treasury programme, boosting its investment capacity from $100m (~ £74,512,832.16) to $250 million (~£186.2 million).

GameSquare's board has also approved a yield strategy along with the updated budget framework. 

The company is now empowered to deploy capital into non-fungible tokens (NFT) yield programmes and other decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The strategy targets annualised returns of 6-10% – a significant premium over traditional ETH staking yields.

This strategic shift could position GameSquare ahead of most institutional investors, which typically limit crypto exposure to passive Ethereum accumulation. 

Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare, stated in the press release: “We are excited to be among the first public companies to include NFTs as part of a diversified digital asset strategy. This reflects the innovative approach to our treasury management initiatives. With deep experience building in-game and real-world creative environments, GameSquare is uniquely positioned to understand the cultural and economic value of these digital assets.”

GameSquare's programme will be overseen by an in-house crypto committee that reports to the board. Meanwhile, the yield generation strategy would be executed on Dialectic's crypto platform Medici, which uses AI tools to identify high-yield opportunities.

The esports company will execute this new strategy using an initial $10m (~£7.45 million) allocation. Once fully implemented, the company plans to use the income generated from this strategy to fund further ETH purchases.

GameSquare recently acquired a CryptoPunk NFT for $5.15m (~£3.83 million) from DeFi pioneer Robert Leshner, along with $10m in Ethereum. Combined with its earlier $30m (~£22.3 million) ETH purchase, the company has now deployed $52m of its $250 million treasury programme.

Funding for these initiatives comes partly from a recent public offering of 8.4m shares, priced at $0.95 each, which raised approximately $8m (~£5.9 million). The company plans to use the yield generated from its DeFi strategies to fund additional ETH purchases, creating a self-reinforcing investment cycle.

The company is hosting a livestream on July 29th to discuss its ETH-focused strategy and how it complements the company's broader vision.

Beyond crypto acquisitions, GameSquare continues to lead in the esports scene. Recently, the media company announced it will design and create the 100 Thieves Summer Block Party for the year in conjunction with Lexus, AT&T and others.

I didn't grow up in a marble-columned building. I come from working-class Appalachian roots with folks who believed in hard work, local values, and keeping a close eye on those in power. I was the first in my family to go to college. I taught myself how to code, built a career in software and artificial intelligence, and now, as Indiana's state treasurer, I wear cowboy boots not for show but because they remind me where I come from. 

I may manage over $16 billion for the state of Indiana, but I've never forgotten who that money belongs to: the families, farmers, and small business owners of Indiana — especially in our rural towns, where folks wake up early, work hard, and still stop to check on neighbors. That's who I serve. That's who I'm fighting for when I say this: We must not let Washington take control of the dollar through a central bank digital currency. 

In today's digital age, the public deserves a currency that protects freedom, not one that threatens it. A retail CBDC might sound convenient, but in practice, it could become a tool for federal surveillance, tracking every transaction in real time. 

I built my career in digital innovation. I know how code can be misused. A CBDC's underlying code could include restrictions such as expiration dates on funds or limits on certain purchases, enforced automatically without public oversight. These risks aren't hypothetical. They're real. Code can be written to monitor, restrict, or punish. A CBDC could track every purchase you make: when and where you buy it, and even limit how fast you spend your money. 

Alex Gladstein reported in the Cato Journal that China's CBDC allows “fine-grained” control over finances and the CCP could “more easily confiscate funds from political opponents.” That's not science fiction. It's reality. 

Think it couldn't happen here? Look at Operation Choke Point, in which federal agencies pressured banks to cut off services to industries like firearm companies without due process. Not to mention when the IRS targeted conservative nonprofit groups. A CBDC would make that kind of political discrimination easier, faster, and quieter. 

Imagine giving the federal government a real-time view into your financial life, down to paying your babysitter or the teenager mowing your lawn. They'll call it modernization. It's micromanagement, plain and simple. 

CBDC supporters argue it could streamline payments or reduce crime. However, the private sector can offer those benefits through innovations like blockchain-based stablecoins, without compromising privacy or local control. The risk of centralizing financial power far outweighs the conveniences. 

Rural America gets hit the hardest. Small towns don't have big national banks on every corner. They have local banks and credit unions, institutions that know your name, ask about your children, sponsor Little League, and lend when you're planting crops or opening a shop. These banks are already under pressure. A retail CBDC incentivizes people to hold funds directly with the Federal Reserve, bypassing local banks and draining deposits from the institutions that small communities need. That threatens family farms, small businesses, and homebuyers in towns like ours. 

As Indiana's chief banker, I see the pressure firsthand. When local banks need deposits, they call my office. I prioritize them whenever I can. But the more Washington centralizes our financial system, the fewer options we have to keep money flowing in our communities. That's bad for Hoosiers and for America.  

This is why I support the principles of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The public deserves financial freedom without government overreach. It puts up guardrails, ensures congressional oversight, and protects the role of private banks. While it recently passed in the House, the fight now continues in the Senate. Hoosiers and all Americans deserve a dollar that respects privacy. I'll keep fighting for laws that defend that principle. 

TRUMP TOURS FED CONSTRUCTION WITH POWELL IN AWKWARD ENCOUNTER

As a conservative, I believe in liberty, not algorithmic control. Innovation should happen in the marketplace, not in the marble halls of the Federal Reserve. The dollar should remain the world's reserve currency because it reflects freedom, trust, and competition, not centralized power. 

Now is the time for conservatives and all Americans who value freedom to unite behind policies that keep the dollar free from bureaucratic overreach. Let's build a digital future for the dollar the right way, rooted in free markets, accountability, and the values we hold dear in Indiana and across rural America. 

Daniel Elliott is the Indiana state treasurer.

Key Points

Crypto bull markets are often much like rush hour traffic, where everyone wants to get somewhere, but the cars in one lane often pull ahead in a given stretch of road.

Right now, two of the faster lanes belong to Ethereum (ETH -0.43%) and XRP (XRP -0.44%). One question that's bugging investors is which of the pair is more likely to double in value the soonest. Both coins enjoy swelling liquidity and real world adoption, yet bull markets rarely rewards every contestant equally. Let's examine their prospects.

Ethereum is priced at more than $3,700 right now, so a doubling lands at about $7,400 , which is territory it last visited in early 2022.

New exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that enable institutional investors to pour their capital into the coin are already paving the road to new highs. U.S.-based funds had inflows of more than $2 billion during the week ended July 19, including a dramatic single-day haul of $727 million on July 16. Those flows constrain the coin's float available for public trading, so they support demand, and higher prices too.

Another key factor is that at least one of the chain's most annoying bugbears, namely its unreasonably high gas (user) fees, is (finally) resolving.

Image source: Getty Images.

Since the Dencun upgrade to the chain 16 months ago, and the Pectra upgrade this year, average gas costs cratered by roughly 95%, dropping a typical swap to $0.39 from tens of dollars during high-traffic periods. That reduction has lured liquidity back to the decentralized finance (DeFi) segment, both via decentralized exchanges (DEXes) and Layer-2 (L2) rollups, helping to revive the chain's application revenue, and, more importantly, its narrative.

Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could give the OK to staking rewards for spot Ethereum ETFs before the end of the year. That would give institutional buyers a 4% to 6% staking "dividend" on top of price exposure, which would likely attract a lot more capital and pump the coin's price.

Importantly, momentum is already scorching with this coin. Ethereum has more than doubled since its late-April trough, rallying roughly 105% in just three months (as of July 25). That head start makes it the odds-on favorite in any doubling contest.

Overall, the route to a quick two-bagger looks fairly clear here.

As of July 25, XRP sells for about $3.20, so doubling means reaching $6.40,  a level it has never reached before.

While a spot XRP ETF could indeed trigger a torrent of buying, the SEC delayed a filing seeking to issue such an asset again this week, leaving timing uncertain. Therefore, it can't count on the same scale of inflows in the near term as Ethereum.

But, over the longer term, its position is quite bullish.

Where XRP shines is acting as financial plumbing with the help of Ripple, the company that issues it. Ripple's Payments suite now has access to more than 90 markets. It has cleared more than $70 billion in volume since its inception, all settled using XRP in the backend, and stablecoins hosted on the XRP Ledger (XRPL).

Ripple's $1.25 billion purchase of the prime broker Hidden Road deepens XRP's claim to being a financial tool, as it gave 300 institutional clients a regulatory-compliant on-ramp that settles with XRP. As those clients tap the lending services that Ripple provides using XRP, and as they park more of their real-world assets (RWAs) on the chain to gain speed and efficiency, there will be an escalating demand for the coin, and the price is very likely to continue trending higher over time.

However, institutions lay track slowly. Compliance checks and integrating back-end technology unfold over quarters, not weeks. Without an ETF to turn on a firehose of capital inflows, XRP's catalyst calendar isn't very precise.

Assuming current macroeconomic and liquidity conditions persist, Ethereum looks to be more likely to reach the finish line first, though XRP could still beat it.

Record ETF inflows, a fresh staking-yield narrative, and a hot three-month streak all considerably shorten Ethereum's path to a 100% gain. XRP's institutional strategy is compelling, and a future ETF approval could unleash a similar wave of buying power. But until that catalyst is realized, its timetable is hazier, and gains derived from institutional onboarding will be piecemeal rather than all at once.

With all that said, both coins can be rewarding long-term holdings, so it could be a decent idea to buy and hold both.

We have fined Scottish charity Birthlink £18,000 after it destroyed approximately 4,800 personal records, up to ten percent of which may be irreplaceable. 

Our investigation found the charity had limited knowledge of data protection obligations and lacked cost effective and easy-to-implement policies and procedures, which would likely have prevented the destruction.

Sally Anne Poole, Head of Investigations, said:

“This case highlights - perhaps more than most - that data protection is about people and how a data breach can have far-reaching ripple effects that continue to affect people's lives long after it occurs. 

“The destroyed records had the potential to be an unknown memory, an identity, a sense of belonging, answers – all deeply personal pieces in the jigsaw of a person's history -  some now lost for eternity. 

“It is inconceivable to think, due to the very nature of its work, that Birthlink had such a poor understanding of both its data protection responsibilities and records management process. We do however welcome the improvements the charity has subsequently put in place, not least by appointing a data protection officer to monitor compliance and raise awareness of data protection throughout the organisation. 

“Whilst we acknowledge the important work charities do, they are not above the law and by issuing and publicising this proportionate fine we aim to promote compliance, remind all organisations of the requirement to take data protection seriously and ultimately deter them from making similar mistakes.”

In January 2021, Birthlink reviewed whether they could destroy ‘Linked Records' as space was running out in the charity's filing cabinets where they were stored. ‘Linked Records' are files of cases where people had already been linked with the person they sought and can include handwritten letters from birth parents, photographs, and copies of birth certificates. 

Following a February 2021 Board meeting, it was agreed no barriers to the destruction of records existed but that retention periods should apply to certain files and only replaceable records could be destroyed. Due to poor record keeping, it is estimated some records were destroyed on 15 April 2021 with a further 40 bags destroyed on 27 May 2021. 

In August 2023, following an inspection by the Care Inspectorate, the Birthlink Board became aware that irreplaceable items had in fact been destroyed as part of the overall record destruction and reported the incident to us.

Our subsequent investigation found at the time of the breach there was a limited understanding of data protection law at the charity, which had not implemented relevant policies and procedures or appropriately trained its staff. We also found that despite concerns being raised about shredding people's photographs and cards at the time of destruction the task continued. In addition, poor record keeping meant Birthlink were unable to identify people affected by the breach.

Due to the serious nature of the breach we concluded a fine was appropriate and after considering representations from the charity reduced the amount from £45,000 to £18,000. Since the breach occurred the charity has implemented improvements including digitally recording and storing all physical records, appointing a Data Protection Officer and initiating staff training.

Last year we published our Ripple Effect campaign, detailing the far reaching effects and human impact data breaches can have on people. We called for all organisations to step up, do better and recognise the critical importance data protection has in protecting people's lives. 

Anyone who feels they may have been impacted by this incident should contact Birthlink, as the charity will be able to provide further information and access to support services. 

We publish detailed guidance on our website to help organisations understand and comply with data protection law. This includes easy to use self-service tools, helpful bitesize guidance and tips aimed at small charities and detailed records management and security guidance setting out what our expects from organisations.

Birthlink is a charity specialising in post-adoption support and advice, for people who have been affected by adoption with a Scottish connection. Since 1984 the charity has owned and maintained the Adoption Contact Register for Scotland. The Register allows adopted people, birth parents, birth relatives and relatives of an adopted person to register their details with the aim of being linked to and potentially reunited with family members.

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will extend its BTC operations, allocating $300M for options trading. The media group behind Truth Social will use the funds to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities in a complex derivative strategy. 

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will allocate $300M to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities. The new investment follows previous direct purchases of BTC and other crypto assets. 

The details of the deal are still unclear, but may be related to a more complex strategy of tracking BTC price fluctuations. Trump's individual posting on social media has shown a clear effect on the price of BTC, with the added effect of World Liberty Fi. Options trading may tap the price fluctuations, though exposing the company to other types of risk. 

TMTG also benefitted from the past month's crypto performance, as the share price rose by over 6% net. TMTG traded at $19.15 following the news.

Options trading is seen as riskier, hinging on timing. However, Trump's effect on the industry and general ties with other projects raise the issue of insider information and the potential for conflicts of interest. 

The announcement by Trump Media and Technology Group follows the more liberal crypto regulation by the Trump administration. TMTG already has its own treasury strategy, reporting $2B in BTC and related assets, but so far it has been rare for corporations to take up an active trading approach to crypto.

Digital assets have become key to the TMTG performance and by proxy for Trump's net worth of $6.6B. Based on marker price estimates, Trump's wealth has expanded by up to $620M in crypto over the past few months. World Liberty Fi alone holds over $216M in its known public wallets, with additional potential from the holdings of TMTG. 

The actual type of BTC-related securities remains uncertain. Currently, BTC exposure is possible through ETF, crypto company shares and preferred stock or convertible notes, as in the case of Strategy (MSTR). Options contracts may be risky if the market shifts its direction, letting the contracts expire without value. 

MSTR currently has one of the more active options markets, with a predominance of call options signaling a relatively bullish expectation. BTC options rely on direct bets on the price, with volumes growing to new records in 2025. 

WLFI tokens, the voting asset of World Liberty Fi, is preparing to start trading. Currently, the asset only has pre-market price discovery, while full trading is expected in about six weeks. 

Pre-market trading has reached volumes up to $7M, giving the token a valuation of up to $79.4B. The asset is most active on MEXC, trading at around $0.29 in its pre-market pair, with the occasional price anomaly due to low volumes. 

Official Trump (TRUMP) has also recovered to $10.92 following the general crypto enthusiasm. Additionally, World Liberty Fi can rely on $2.2B of USD1 tokens, most active on BNB Smart Chain.

U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds recorded $1.85 billion in inflows last week, marking the second-largest weekly inflow since their launch. 

According to SoSoValue data, the spot Ethereum ETFs saw $1.85 billion in net inflows during the week from July 21 to July 25, following $2.18 billion in inflows the previous week. The weekly trading volume totaled $10.39 billion last week, slightly down from $10.57 billion the week before.

Meanwhile, spot bitcoin ETFs recorded $72 million in net inflows last week, a sharp drop from the $2.39 billion reported the week before.

Bitcoin traded up 0.8% over the past 24 hours to $119,077 as of 3:10 a.m. ET on Monday, while Ethereum rose 3.4% to $3,901, according to The Block's price page. XRP added 2.5%, BNB jumped 6.6%, and Solana climbed 3.3%. 

While the crypto market saw a brief correction last week, bitcoin reclaimed $119,000 early Monday morning during a "calm market period" as traders await investor reactions to tariffs, macroeconomic data releases, and regulatory changes, said Nick Ruck, director of LVRG Research.

"Altcoins surged higher as more traders find market stability amid weakened BTC volatility, giving a chance for ETH and others to race upward," Ruck added. "While some large holders of Bitcoin are taking profits, we continue to see new institutions integrate and purchase BTC and other altcoins as part of reserve strategies, often climbing into nine-figure ranges."

 A group of Senate Democrats has probed Federal Housing Finance Agency director William Pulte over his order to propose how to consider crypto in mortgage applications. 

Five US Senate Democrats have probed the head of the country's housing finance agency over his plan to consider how crypto can be counted in the approval process for certain mortgages.

The senators, led by Jeff Merkley, sent a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director William Pulte on Friday asking him to explain his plan “to fully assess the potential risks and benefits of your order and its implications for the U.S. housing market and financial system.”

Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Mazie Hirono and Bernie Sanders also co-signed the letter, which asks Pulte for a response by Aug. 7. 

Last month, Pulte ordered home mortgage purchasers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal on how they can consider crypto holdings in their risk assessments for single-family mortgage loans, without converting the crypto to US dollars.

The FHFA has overseen Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, since 2008. Both were placed under the government's watch after the 2008 financial crisis, caused by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.

The senators said Pulte's plan “could introduce unnecessary risks to consumers and pose serious safety and soundness concerns for the U.S. housing and financial markets.”

Under current policy, they said that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or any other issuer for federally-backed mortgages does not permit lenders to consider crypto in mortgage determinations unless it's first been converted to US dollars.

The senators added that crypto has historically seen high volatility and liquidity crunches, airing concern that borrowers who use crypto face “an increased risk that they may not be able to exit a crypto position and convert to cash at a price that would allow them to buffer against risk of mortgage default.”

“Crypto is also subject to heightened risks of loss due to scams, cyber hacks, or physical theft, which could leave homeowners vulnerable to losing their crypto assets with little hope of recovery,” the senators said.

The senators added they're also concerned about how the FHFA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will prevent conflicts of interest for those with ties to crypto “that could unduly influence their proposals,” including President Donald Trump and his family.

The Trumps are deeply involved in the crypto industry, having ties to a trading platform with a token, a stablecoin, a crypto mining business and various memecoins and non-fungible tokens.

The senators also took aim at Pulte, saying financial disclosures show his spouse holds up to $2 million in crypto, which “raises additional concerns about your potential conflicts.”

They added that there is “a serious conflict” as Pulte's order said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must get approval from their respective boards before moving ahead with changes, but Pulte is the chair of each organization's board, which they also accused him of stacking with “industry allies.”

The senators also claimed Pulte's order was vague and included no information on how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would develop a proposal, the FHFA's assessment of risks and benefits, or how the agency would gather feedback.

“Clarity on this order is especially critical given FHFA's previous failures to adequately oversee crypto-related activity,” they added, noting the 2023 banking crisis, where three banks collapsed “in part due to run risks posed by growing lines of cryptocurrency-based business.”

The group also noted that Fannie Mae found in 2021 that the use of crypto and stablecoins for deposits, payments, or collateral was the “least appealing application” of blockchain in the industry.

They asked Pulte to respond to a series of questions, including sharing communications on crypto, the process for approving the order and how he will recuse from conflicts of interest, among others.

On July 26, 2025, something big happened in the tech world. Samsung Electronics made a $16.5 billion announcement regarding the supply of semiconductors to a major international firm, presumed to be Tesla, which could essentialize both their positions in the market. This deal wasn't just a minor discussion over coffee; it was significant enough to take us until December 31, 2033, to play out. It wasn't just the standard semiconductor supply; the announcement hinted at Tesla's innovative tech involvement—securing their futuristic aspirations. Could this affect the growing demand for cryptocurrency solutions? There are interesting angles to ponder.

Samsung's partnership with Tesla could serve as an interesting blueprint. Fintech startups eyeing crypto payroll adaptations might find pointers.

First of all, technology is king. This deal reiterates just how crucial advanced semiconductor technology is in developing any platform. Look for those secure chip technologies.

Strategic partnerships? These are obviously the next best thing. If you are a startup, a combination like Samsung and a tech giant might become your operating motto. The video Payments accepted via Samsung Pay indicates the possibilities of integrating crypto-to-fiat transaction options. 

Then there's AI to consider, vital to all things fintech right now. That would require an understanding of integrating AI into operational plans for compliance, fraud detection, and improved user interfaces.

Lastly, the real killer attribute of Samsung Pay's integration with crypto virtual cards is the ease of spending via crypto assets. Startups should prioritize this multi-platform operation.

It's hard not to wonder how this will reshape cryptocurrency's role in supply chain financing. 

On the one hand, Samsung's deal with Tesla seems to enhance supply chain efficiency. On the other hand, those chips are infused with advanced technology, which may help usher in a more tech-savvy world of cryptocurrency.

Blockchain technology has the potential to bolster supply chain transparency and creates a foundation for decentralized transactions. So as Tesla employs Samsung's chips, it may increase the propensity for sophisticated blockchain applications.

Integrating crypto solutions into traditional semiconductor contracts holds both risks and rewards.

This partnership sets a significant precedent for possible collaborations extending into crypto-friendly operations.

Samsung and Tesla show how advanced technology can support those emerging services.  

Aiming Supply chain Integration? Secure chips may become the norm for crypto-heavy operations.  

Smart Energy and IoT Connectivity? Interoperability can lead to Decentralized energy trading and tokenized assets.

And finally, materializing Realized collaborate eclectic multi-industry? Coordinating hardware, software, and energy sectors may just become the norm of operations.

Cutting edge tech can bolster security and efficiency, and could just be what they need to compete.  

Samsung's $16.5 billion deal with Tesla is the future of both companies in the cryptocurrency world. The combined forces of advanced tech and strategic partnerships will push the industry, creating fruitful outcomes for forward-thinking fintech startups.

Amouage is looking to blockchain to provide traceability for its luxury fragrances.

The perfume house on Monday announced its entry into the Aura Blockchain Consortium, established by ​​LVMH, Prada Group, OTB and Richemont's Cartier as an alliance to leverage blockchain technology for greater traceability and transparency in luxury goods. Since 2021, the group has logged more than 50 million products from dozens of brands on its private blockchain, creating digital identities — known as digital product passports, or DPPs — for each item which consumers and regulators can access for information such as the product's provenance.

Amouage said its DPPs will be accessible via a QR code on the fragrance's packaging. Customers will get a unique certificate of ownership, as well as access to exclusive benefits such as personalised beauty routines and invites to community events. The brand, which has introduced refillable bottles, is also planning a programme to encourage refills, where the QR code could be scanned at a boutique or refill point and the DPP would be updated with details such as when, where and how the refill took place.

Founded in Oman in 1983, Amouage is the first beauty player to join the consortium, as well as the first brand from the Middle East. In February, L'Oréal took a long-term minority stake in the fragrance house. As of this month, all new products from Amouage will be integrated into Aura's blockchain, and by the end of the month, it will have added existing items produced in or before this year as well, the company said.

“​​This announcement represents several important milestones for Aura Blockchain Consortium, with a particular focus on venturing into a new vertical, and establishing a strong new footing in the Middle East luxury industry,” Lorenzo Bertelli, chairman of the Aura Blockchain Consortium and head of corporate social responsibility for Prada Group, said in a statement.

Beauty brands have been slower to adopt DPPs than fashion, but much like fashion, the beauty industry is encountering increased scrutiny over issues like the sourcing, sustainability and authenticity of its products. Some brands are starting to look for blockchain-based solutions. Earlier this year, French beauty brand Ulé, part of the Shiseido group, partnered with technology provider Arianee to create DPPs for its C-Bright Serum.

Starting in 2027, the EU will also begin to require many products to be enabled with a DPP as part of a broader push towards sustainability and corporate transparency, prompting companies to begin preparations.

Tech giants like Meta and Google are striking big deals and announcing new eyewear partnerships on smart glasses after a decade of failed attempts to make the devices fashionable.

Meta's $3.5 billion investment in EssilorLuxottica is the clearest sign yet that some of the biggest names in tech and eyewear see smart glasses as a commercially viable category with a long-term future.

The move could open the door to resolving years of debate over whether the company would share what is considered the crown jewel of the ByteDance-owned short video-sharing platform.

AI doesn't see the internet the same way human shoppers do, meaning retailers need to adapt as more consumers turn to AI to find products or even make purchases.

The beloved brand's closure isn't just another cautionary tale. It's proof that even with an aspirational and credentialed Black founder, following a formulaic launch-and-scale playbook doesn't guarantee success.

Following a challenging year for American Eagle, the retailer is betting on actress Sydney Sweeney's star power and girl-next-door appeal to drum up interest in its fall campaign.

Tampa Breaks 100 Degrees F for First Time on Record as Heat Wave Bakes Eastern U.S.

Records are starting to fall to the continuing heat dome that is covering much of the eastern U.S.

By Meghan Bartels edited by Andrea Thompson

HeatRisk forecast for July 29, 2025. The NWS HeatRisk is an experimental color-numeric-based index that provides a forecast risk of heat-related impacts to occur over a 24-hour period.

More than 250 million people in the U.S.—nearly three quarters of the population—are experiencing moderate, major or extreme risk of heat effects on July 28, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service. The warnings come as a heat dome continues to smother the eastern U.S.—and records are starting to fall under the oppressive heat.

Perhaps most surprisingly is that, on July 27, the current heat dome pushed Tampa, Fla., into triple digits Fahrenheit for the first time since monitoring began during the 1890s, according to the Tampa Bay Times. “We're frequently over 90—for three, four months a year, almost every day it gets above 90,” says Tyler Fleming, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Tampa Bay office. “But getting to 100 takes a lot of heat, so it's never happened in the recorded history of Tampa.”

Surrounded by water, Tampa—and Florida at large—is usually cursed with enough humidity to keep the overall air temperature, as a thermometer measures it, a bit lower. It takes a lot of energy to heat up water (think about how long it takes to bring water to a boil on the stove), so it takes more energy to heat up humid air to a given temperature than it takes to heat up dry air to the same point, Fleming explains.

He says there wasn't any special factor that caused Tampa's heat record to occur on Sunday beyond the extremity of the current situation. “We've been close many times; we've been to 99 several times before,” Fleming says. “It was just a strong heat wave—that was just enough to push us over the edge.”

Tampa is the highest-profile city to see a heat record fall. But the current bout of extreme heat has tied record temperatures in several other cities, including Jacksonville, Fla., and Charlotte, N.C.

Climate change is increasing the odds of breaking heat records everywhere because the global temperature is now higher overall and extreme heat events are becoming more frequent and hotter and lasting longer.

A brutal heat dome has smothered much of the eastern U.S. since last week, with the worst conditions beginning in the Midwest, traveling to the East Coast and then settling over the Southeast. The heat dome is the result of a remarkably large ridge of high pressure that has been stalling over the region. “When that high pressure is overhead, it pushes the air down,” Fleming says. “As the air sinks, it compresses and heats up.”

The current heat dome is expected to linger for several more days until the high-pressure system migrates westward, which, Fleming says, should return the region to what he calls “a more typical summer pattern.”

But for now, huge portions of the country remain at risk from the sweltering heat. The NWS HeatRisk map calculates the number of people exposed to different categories of heat risk. On July 28, 16 million people are at extreme risk, which NWS describes as “rare and/or long-duration extreme heat with no overnight relief”; another 135.9 million are at major risk. The map estimates that by July 29, more than 12 million people will remain at extreme risk, and nearly 150 million will be at major risk. And as of July 30, nearly 115 million people are expected to be at major or extreme risk. The widespread high risk will not begin to abate until July 31.

Once contact with a pathogen has occurred, it might be too late for the immune system to react. Here, we asked whether anticipatory neural responses might sense potential infections and signal to the immune system, priming it for a response. We show that potential contact with approaching infectious avatars, entering the peripersonal space in virtual reality, are anticipated by multisensory–motor areas and activate the salience network, as measured with psychophysics, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. This proactive neural anticipation instigates changes in both the frequency and activation of innate lymphoid cells, mirroring responses seen in actual infections. Alterations in connectivity patterns between infection-sensing brain regions and the hypothalamus, along with modulation of neural mediators, connect these effects to the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Neural network modeling recapitulates this neuro–immune cross-talk. These findings suggest an integrated neuro–immune reaction in humans toward infection threats, not solely following physical contact but already after breaching the functional boundary of body–environment interaction represented by the peripersonal space.

A vital function of an organism is to anticipate contact with threats to promptly activate a proper ‘fight-or-flight' response. Mechanisms of predator detection and processing of threat imminence have been widely explored1,2. Pathogens represent special forms of threats that must be detected and avoided. Through evolution, social species developed a series of behavioral responses, such as social distancing, aimed at preventing contacts and thus infections that have been termed the ‘behavioral immune system'3,4,5,6. In primates, a mechanism that might be functional to predict contact with potential harm has been described within a network of fronto–parietal neurons, which integrate tactile stimuli on the body with external sensory information close to the body, that is, the peripersonal space (PPS) system7,8.

Once an external stimulus comes in contact with the body, another system reacts, that is, the immune system, composed of early- and late-acting arms (innate and adaptive immunity, respectively)9. A concerted effort of these two arms secures efficient pathogen clearance while preserving host tissue integrity10. Although reciprocal regulation of the neural and immune systems during actual disease is a research field in development11,12,13,14, there is no evidence of mutual interaction between the behavioral and biological immune systems that anticipates a concerted response to a potential infection before physical pathogen encounters.

Here, we asked whether the human brain is equipped with a mechanism of early sensing and anticipation of contact with virtual infections that is able to trigger a reaction of early players of the immune system, that is, innate lymphocytes (for example, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and natural killer (NK) cells) similar to when responding to contact with a physical pathogen. We exposed healthy participants to potential infection threats using virtual reality (VR) in the form of human faces displaying clear signs of infection (infectious avatars) and entering participants' PPS. By using psychophysics, electroencephalography (EEG), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), mass spectrometry (MS) and flow cytometry, we measured behavioral, neural and immune responses to infectious avatars compared to responses evoked by control stimuli or actual contact with pathogens (that is, injection of a flu vaccine). Our results show that potential contact with virtual infection threats is predicted by fronto–parietal areas of the PPS system, activates the salience network and triggers a cascade of neuro–immune mediators, ultimately inducing changes in ILC frequency and activation.

To trigger specific responses associated with virtual infection threats, we created a set of avatars showing clear signs of infection (infectious avatars) and two control conditions, namely neutral and fearful avatars (that is, an arousing but not pathogenic threatening stimulus; Fig. 1a). Results from explicit ratings, a seating distance scale15 and the Implicit Association Task16 demonstrated that infectious avatars were perceived as sick and contagious and evoked implicit avoidance responses compared to neutral and fearful avatars (Supplementary Table 1).

a, VR setup. Participants were first exposed to a neutral avatar (baseline) and then assigned to one of three cohorts encountering neutral, infectious or fearful avatars in a second session. b, PPS task. Participants responded to tactile stimuli on their face, delivered either in empty space (unisensory) or combined with an avatar approaching (multisensory). Tactile stimuli (flash icon) were presented at five delays, with the avatar located at one of five distances (D5 = far, D1 = near). c, PPS representation across cohorts. Reaction times (RTs) to multisensory stimuli were normalized by unisensory RTs (dotted line) and plotted by avatar distance. Shaded areas illustrate the PPS gradient, defined by significantly faster multisensory RTs (P < 0.05, corrected; paired-sample t-tests); N = 15 per cohort. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. (see Supplementary Table 3 for full statistics). d–h, EEG responses recorded from the central electrode (Cz) as an example (N = 16 per cohort). Black segments denote statistically significant time windows (cluster-based, nonparametric statistical tests; P < 0.01, corrected; solid lines = mean EEG response; dotted lines = 95% confidence interval). d, Evoked responses comparing unisensory (T) and multisensory (VT) stimulation as an index of multisensory processing. e, GFP analysis of PPS-related processing, that is, VT response differences for near versus far avatars. Insets show near–far current distribution differences at peak GFP effects. f, Significant GFP difference for near versus far stimulation between infectious and neutral avatars in the infection cohort. g, No GFP differences were found between two neutral avatars in the control cohort. h, Significant GFP differences between infectious and neutral avatars at the far location in the infection cohort, with the inset showing peak current distribution difference.

We then tested whether infectious avatars induced a specific response from the PPS system by applying a validated multisensory paradigm measuring the spatial extent of PPS at the behavioral level6,17. Participants were asked to respond as fast as possible to a tactile stimulation on their face while an avatar face was shown as approaching in immersive VR (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2). Reaction times (RTs) to touch18,19 were measured when the approaching avatar was at five possible distances (D5–D1; multisensory RT) and normalized for RT when no avatar was presented (unisensory tactile (T) RT). The PPS extent was then indexed as the distance of the visual stimulus inducing a multisensory facilitation effect, that is, faster RT to multisensory than unisensory stimuli (hereafter the PPS effect).

To define a baseline for VR exposure, in the first session, all participants were exposed to neutral avatars, and in a second session, participants were divided into three cohorts and exposed to one of the three specific avatars, namely infection, neutral and fearful cohorts (Fig. 1a; the different cohorts were matched for participant sensitivity to disgust and anxiety; Supplementary Table 3). The results showed that the PPS effect varied between the baseline session and the second session as a function of the presented avatar (Fig. 1c). In the infection cohort, the PPS effect extended in the second session to cover the whole space between D1 and D4, whereas it was limited to D1 and D2 in the baseline session. The PPS effect did not vary between the two sessions in the neutral cohort and differed only at the closest position (D1) in the fearful cohort. Thus, infectious avatars specifically elicited a PPS effect at farther distances, indicating that the PPS system anticipates potential contacts with a virtual pathogenic threat when it is still far from the body.

We next searched for a neurophysiological marker of early detection of virtual infection compared to neutral stimuli entering the PPS. The visuo–tactile (VT) PPS paradigm was thus adapted to high-density EEG (128-channel EEG), in which participants were presented with either neutral or infectious avatars (infection cohort) or two different sets of neutral avatars (control cohort) and randomized in an event-related design. First, a cluster-based nonparametric statistical procedure was applied to determine a time window associated with VT multisensory processing (that is, in the presence of an avatar) compared to T processing only (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Within this time window, we computed the Global Field Power (GFP20) as an index of evoked potential and compared GFP multisensory responses when a near or far avatar was presented as an index of PPS processing21,22. Results from both cohorts demonstrated a near–far difference arising from parietal and premotor areas, in line with previous neuroimaging studies23,24 (Fig. 1e), showing that the presence of an approaching avatar activates PPS-related brain areas.

We then tested whether this PPS effect differed when an infectious or neutral avatar was presented. In the infection cohort, the contrast [near (neutral – infectious) – far (neutral – infectious)] showed a significant GFP difference between 129 and 150 ms (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). To understand the origin of this effect, we compared GFP responses within this time window in the presence of an infectious or neutral avatar in the near or far space. We found a significant difference for far stimuli between the infectious and neutral avatars, whereas no difference was observed for near stimuli. In the control cohort, no difference was found between the two sets of neutral avatars (Fig. 1g). Thus, a virtual infection threat evoked a different neural response than a neutral stimulation, already when presented at a far location, in line with and extending the behavioral results presented earlier (Fig. 1c). Inverse solution analyses illustrated that the source of this difference was localized to parietal areas, which are part of the PPS system (Fig. 1h and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). These electrophysiology findings demonstrate an anticipatory detection of virtual infections entering the PPS by multisensory–motor areas. To further localize these responses and clarify their directionality (see ‘Limitations of the study' section), we conducted an fMRI experiment (see below).

We then tested whether virtual infections trigger an actual immune response. A new sample of participants was first exposed to neutral avatars, and then blood samples were taken immediately after the neutral VR stimulation to define an equivalent baseline. The participants were then divided into three cohorts (matched for sensitivity to disgust and anxiety; Supplementary Table 3), which were exposed to infectious, neutral or fearful avatars, and blood samples were taken after VR stimulation. To compare the immune response to virtual infection threats to that of a real pathogen, we tested a fourth cohort of participants who were not stimulated with VR but received an influenza vaccine (vaccine cohort), an ethically acceptable surrogate model for pathogen inoculation in humans (Fig. 2a). We assessed the early/antigen-independent phase of the lymphoid response by measuring the peripheral blood frequency and activation of innate lymphocytes, that is, ILCs and NK cells (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4)25,26,27,28. To study a global index of the immune response, principal component analysis (PCA) was used on ILCs and NK cells (Supplementary Figs. 5–7 and Supplementary Table 6). Results revealed that virtual and real infections induced a similar stronger modulation of ILC frequency and activation indexes (evaluated as the differential expression of the activation markers CD25, CD27, CD69, NKp30, NKp44, NKp46, KLRG1, PD1 and HLA-DR) than neutral and fearful avatars (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 8). The main finding (that is, virtual avatars induce a stronger modulation of ILC frequency and activation indexes than neutral avatars) was further confirmed in an independent experiment (Fig. 2e,f).

a, Study design for immunomonitoring. Participants were first exposed to neutral avatars (baseline). Blood samples were collected immediately after the baseline. Participants were then assigned to the neutral, infection or fearful cohort and exposed to the corresponding avatar condition (second session consisted of a 20-min cohort-specific VR stimulation, a 90-min break and a 10-min same cohort-specific VR stimulation). Blood samples were collected immediately at the end of the second VR session. In the vaccine cohort, blood samples were collected before and after flu vaccination (at the same time delay as for the VR cohorts, that is, with a 120-min time break between the first and second blood sampling). b, Scheme showing ILC identification from blood sampling. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated, stained, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Figure created with BioRender.com. ILCs were identified as FCSlowSSClow lymphocytes that were negative for lineage markers and positive for CD127. c, ILC frequency was measured at the baseline and after the second session. The synthetic index of ILC frequency changes (first PCA component) in the four experimental cohorts is shown (analysis of variance (ANOVA): F3,56 = 4.71, P = 0.0053). d, Synthetic index of ILC activation changes (first PCA component) in the four cohorts (see Supplementary Fig. 8 for activation marker expression in each ILC subset; ANOVA: F3,56 = 5.45, P = 0.0023). e,f, Synthetic index of ILC frequency changes (e) and ILC activation changes (f) in two different independent cohorts (only neutral and infectious avatars were tested); N = 16 distinct participants per cohort (P values were derived from two-tailed t-tests). g, Correlation between synthetic ILC frequency and activation indexes, with different colors denoting the different cohorts (R = 0.85, P < 0.0001); shaded ellipses indicate the 66% confidence interval for the mean of each cohort. The black segmented line represents the linear regression. In c–e and f, data are presented as the difference between the values after the second VR exposure and the values at baseline. Black dots and lines represent the mean (dot) ± s.e.m. (line). N = 15 distinct participants per cohort (c, d and g).

ILC frequency and activation indexes showed a strong correlation and were both enhanced by virtual and real infections compared to the neutral cohort (Fig. 2g). No change was found in NK cell subset distribution and activation in response to real and virtual infections (Supplementary Figs. 9–13).

Because the ILC family comprises three main subsets (excluding NK cells), namely ILC1s, ILC2s and ILC precursors (ILCPs), we analyzed the frequency and activation variations of each subset individually to understand which one contributed to the difference observed in the global ILC analysis. Virtual and real infections induced a similar strong decrease in ILC1s and increase in ILC2s and ILCPs (Fig. 3a), suggesting that all three subsets are responsible for the global changes observed. The reduction in ILC1 frequency was associated with a higher activation index in the virtual and real infection cohorts than in the neutral cohort (Fig. 3b). These results suggest that heightened ILC1 activation, concomitant with decreased ILC1 frequency (Supplementary Fig. 14), is likely a consequence of their activation-induced migration from the blood to tissues, consistent with their involvement in early antiviral tissue responses29. Together, these data show that ILCs react to infections not only when they are detected in the body but also when they are processed as a potential threat approaching the body.

a, ILC subset distribution. Left, representative dot plots of ILC1s identified as CRTH2−cKit−, ILC2s as CRTH2+cKit+/− and ILCPs as CRTH2−cKit+ among total ILCs (that is, living lineage−CD127+ lymphocytes; see Fig. 2b) at baseline and after the second VR session. Right, changes in ILC1, ILC2 and ILCP frequencies among the different cohorts (ANOVA ILC1s: F3,56 = 4.69, P = 0.0054; ILC2s: F3,56 = 4.81, P = 0.0048; ILCPs: F3,56 = 3.65, P = 0.018). b, ILC activation by flow cytometry. Left, representative histograms of the percentage of CD25+ ILCs at baseline and after the second VR session as an illustrative example of ILC activation. Right, synthetic index of ILC1, ILC2 and ILCP activation changes (first PCA component) in the different cohorts (ANOVA ILC1s: F3,56 = 3.68, P = 0.017; ILC2s: F3,56 = 2.49, P = 0.07; ILCPs: F3,56 = 2.67, P = 0.056). In a and b, N = 15 distinct participants per cohort. Mean (dot) ± s.e.m. (line) is shown in black. Data are presented as the difference between the values after the second VR exposure and values at baseline.

To gather deeper insight into the localization and response pattern of the brain network detecting infectious avatars, we conducted an fMRI experiment by adapting the PPS paradigm to an fMRI-compatible VR setup. Within the same participants, we compared brain activation induced by tactile stimuli associated with either infectious or neutral avatars, presented in far space (that is, where infectious avatars evoked specific behavioral and electrophysiological effects) or in the near space. To disentangle specific brain processing responsible for the detection of infection threats from responses to a generic environmental threat, another group of participants was presented with either fearful or neutral avatars, with the same design. We first identified multisensory processing from a distributed bilateral fronto–parieto–occipital network (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary Fig. 15), including key nodes of the PPS system24 in the two groups. To test whether the activation of the PPS system, when participants faced a far infectious avatar, reflected anticipatory processing, we contrasted the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to tactile stimuli coupled with infectious versus neutral avatars in the far and near spaces. Activations (infectious > neutral) in the intraparietal sulcus and visual areas were common to both far and near conditions. In turn, activations in the right primary somatosensory cortex (S1), right anterior insula (aINS), bilateral premotor cortex, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG) were specific for the far conditions (Fig. 4c). The direct contrast between responses to infectious versus neutral avatars in the far compared to the near space highlighted additional specific activations in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and left aINS (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Table 7). These regions are part of the so-called salience network, that is, an ensemble of interconnected brain regions whose major role is detecting and filtering salient stimuli, including threats30, to recruit relevant functional networks implementing proper reactions. Some of the areas activated in our task (intraparietal sulcus, ACC and MFG) have been reported to be triggered during a cognitive task performed under an inflammatory state induced by a vaccine31. Here, we show that the PPS network and the salience network respond to virtual infections to implement fast responses. Importantly, this pattern of brain activations was specific to detection of virtual infection, as they also emerged when we directly compared activity induced by infection and fearful avatars (after subtracting the response to neutral avatars; Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table 8). We then studied how this brain mechanism of infection threat detection might project to the immune system to trigger an immune response, as the ILC reaction shown above.

a, In the infection cohort, contrasts (red: VTFi + VTNi; blue: VTFn + VTNn) revealed VT activations specific to each face type. Activated regions included the bilateral superior/inferior parietal lobules (SPL and IPL, respectively), S1, supplementary motor area (SMA), middle cingulate cortex (MCC), temporo–parietal junction (TPJ), face-sensitive visual areas (occipital, fusiform and lingual gyri), cerebellum and insula. b, Similar activation patterns were observed for the fearful cohort using equivalent contrasts (N = 20). c, Infection-specific activations (infectious > neutral) varied by avatar proximity as shown for far space (red), near space (blue) and their direct contrast (green). d, Comparison between infectious and fearful avatars (versus neutral) for far (red) and near (blue) space and their direct contrast (green); N = 38. e, DCM revealed modulated hypothalamic connectivity during exposure to infectious avatars. Increased input: from mPFC and aINS. Decreased input: from MFG and ACC. Significant connections (posterior probability > 0.95) to/from the hypothalamus are shown in the connectivity matrix. fMRI activations were thresholded at cluster-level family-wise error correction, P < 0.05; i, infection; n, neutral; F, far; N, near; VISv, ventral visual areas; VISd, dorsal visual areas; OPJ, occipito–parietal junction; IPS, intraparietal sulcus; PMC, premotor cortex; MTG, middle temporal gyrus; HYP, hypothalamus. In a, c and e, N = 18 participants.

Behavioral responses to threats are described in terms of ‘fight-or-flight', and their neural implementation has been characterized in rodents within a network of areas including the frontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray32. The lateral hypothalamus is also a key area in the regulation of innate immune responses by the central nervous system, which could mainly occur by direct release of catecholamines via the sympathetic nervous system and by corticosteroids via the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal cortex (HPA) axis11,33. These responses might be further modulated by a number of signaling factors, including eicosanoids and neuroinflammatory mediators34,35.

Thus, we first searched for involvement of the HPA axis in responding to virtual infection. We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analyses to reveal stimuli-specific changes in connectivity between the hypothalamus and key areas of the PPS system and the salience network being activated by infectious avatars compared to neutral or fearful avatars. Results showed different modulation of hypothalamic connectivity when infectious avatars were presented in the far space compared to neutral avatars. In particular, far infectious avatars were associated with connectivity upregulation between the hypothalamus and the aINS, MFG, mPFC in the left hemisphere and S1 in the right hemisphere (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 16). No modulation was found from the same analyses for conditions with avatars in the near space nor in the fearful avatar group. Thus, fMRI connectivity results point to a modulation of hypothalamus activity via the salience network in response to virtual infections anticipated by the PPS system that might be the upstream node of the neuro–immune pathway triggering the systemic innate immune response.

Previous data showed that ILC functions are modulated by HPA-related hormones in models of endotoxin-induced systemic inflammation36. In line with these observations, ILC modulation by infectious avatars might be detected on a cascade of effects along the HPA axis. Thus, we performed MS quantification of a set of HPA-related hormones in the serum of individuals in the infection and neutral cohorts (Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 17)37,38,39,40. In addition to these hormones, other factors may intervene in neuro–immune cross-talk. Brain- and systemic-derived molecules, such as catecholamines and nonsteroidal metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, are largely involved in inflammatory responses, leukocyte chemotaxis, temperature and blood pressure regulation during infection34,35,41. The half-life of catecholamines in the blood is extremely short (1–2 min), rendering their measurement impossible in the current setting. Thus, we quantified eicosanoids as arachidonic acid metabolites (Supplementary Table 10) and neuroinflammatory factors (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19) to study the cross-talk between neural signaling and immune responses triggered by infectious compared to neutral avatars. We first applied a data reduction approach to neural mediators by running three independent PCAs on HPA-related hormones, eicosanoids and neuroinflammatory factors (Fig. 5a). We extracted the first component of each PCA (explaining 39, 36 and 33% of the variance, respectively; Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21) as a synthetic index of each pathway, and we used it to predict the pattern of elicited immune response as captured from the ILC activation index. Univariate or multivariate linear regressions between neural signals and immune activation revealed no conclusive pattern, suggesting that the neuro–immune cross-talk could not be explained by simple relationships. Thus, we applied a machine learning-based approach, whereby the three synthetic indices of neuro–immune signaling were used to predict ILC activation in a single hidden layer neural network (Fig. 5a).

a, Network architecture and testing. We trained a single hidden layer neural network using the first PCA component of eicosanoids (neutral versus infectious; t(28) = 1.25, P = 0.23), HPA-related hormones (neutral versus infectious; t(28) = 2.04, P = 0.051) and neuroinflammatory factors (neutral versus infectious; t(28) = 2.06, P = 0.049) as input and the ILC activation index as an output on all participants from the neutral and infection cohorts. To compare network predictions with actual ILC activation, we used leave-one-out cross-validation; N = 15 distinct participants per cohort. Data are shown as mean ± s.e.m. P values of two-sided two-sample t-tests (neutral versus infectious) are reported. b,c, Comparison between predicted (x axis) and measured (y axis) ILC activation indexes in all participants (P = 0.000011; b) and differentiation between the infection and neutral cohorts in red (P = 0.000604) and gray (P = 0.215002; c), respectively. Linear regressions were performed (shaded area = 95% confidence interval); N = 15 distinct participants per cohort. d, Predicted ILC activation as a function of HPA-related hormones and eicosanoids. The network's input–output relation in two dimensions is shown from training a network on the whole population, while the neuroinflammation level was fixed at its mean value. The red line denotes the activation hot spot, defined as the region in which the predicted immune response is larger than the average. e, Measured eicosanoids and HPA-related hormones in participants from the infection (red dots) and neutral (gray dots) cohorts (with neuroinflammation input fixed at its average); N = 15 distinct participants per cohort. Most participants in the infection cohort fall within the predicted activation hot spot (P = 0.008, two-sided χ2 test) indicated by the red line.

We tested the relationship between the predicted activation index and the empirical data by using leave-one-out cross-validation. The neural network was able to explain 71% of the variance in the empirical data by uncovering multivariate, nonlinear relationships between neural signaling and immune activation, with a stronger prediction power for the infection cohort, even if information about the cohort was not used for training (Fig. 5b,c). To interpret such complex, multidimensional relationships in the neuro–immune cross-talk, we mapped the predicted immune response as a function of the level of HPA-related hormones, eicosanoids and neuroinflammatory factors. We found that ILC activation increased almost linearly with HPA-related hormone levels and decreased almost linearly with neuroinflammatory factor levels. ILC activation was facilitated when eicosanoid levels were within a specific level, resulting in a nonlinear, Gaussian-shaped response profile. As a result, the highest predicted immune response was found in a ‘hot spot' of high HPA-related hormones, low neuroinflammatory factors and intermediate eicosanoid levels (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Figs. 25–28). As an empirical confirmation of such predicted effects, we found that actual data from participants from the infection cohort had a significantly higher probability than participants from the neutral cohort to fall into the hot spot predicted by the neural network (Fig. 5e). The same neural network trained on the neutral and fearful groups did not reveal significant relationships between neuro–immune signaling and ILC response (Supplementary Fig. 22). The network also failed when any of its three inputs was removed, suggesting that all three families of signaling factors are essential to drive the immune response. Together, these analyses suggest that a virtual infection threat (and not a generic threat) induces a specific pattern of neuro–immune signaling, which is sufficient to drive ILC activation.

Our integrated behavioral, neurophysiological, immunological and computational analyses provide a direct demonstration that potential infection threats (even when presented in VR) are processed by the PPS system and the salience network in an anticipatory way and preactivate the immune system by triggering ILC responses, likely via a nonlinear neuro–immune cross-talk involving the HPA axis. An important line of work describes the neural mechanisms allowing animals to detect threats and select appropriate behaviors1,7,8,42. Our results extend this framework to the response of the immune system to virtual infection threats. One key mechanism to defend oneself from infection is by early detection of potential threatening encounters to promptly decide whether to engage in ‘fight-or-flight'. Therefore, anticipation can result in a pathogen avoidance strategy, for example, by adopting social distancing behaviors as for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic6,43,44,45, or in a pathogen defense approach, by activating immune cells to destroy the infection threat. Thus, in the absence of a consolidated avoidance policy, the findings from the infection cohort suggest that our immune system adopts fight anticipatory strategies, allowing our organism to react to immune threats not only once they are in the body but also when they overcome the primary functional boundary of self-environment interaction represented by the PPS. These results extend the spectrum of responses of the behavioral immune system from adapting social behavior4 to driving innate immune responses of effectors and counter-regulatory loops. Although surprising, our finding that immune responses can be triggered by simulated infections presented in VR is consistent with the principle of the smoke detector in biological systems46. Accordingly, the behavioral immune system evolved to minimize false-negative responses and is exquisitely sensitive to cues that superficially resemble the symptoms and signs of pathogen infections. In this study, VR proved to efficiently deliver such cues, demonstrating its potential as a valuable approach to further dissect the vital and complex link between the central nervous system and the immune system.

First, given the lack of prior research on immune responses to virtual brain stimulation in humans, this study is exploratory. Second, the selection of immune markers, timing of virtual and real (vaccine) pathogen exposures, neuroinflammatory factors and use of machine learning were guided by current scientific knowledge and available tools. Third, the generalizability of the results requires further studies because ILC changes were only compared to one vaccine (FluarixTetra 2018–2019, used in the 2018 Swiss anti-influenza campaign). Additionally, as immune and PPS systems vary with age47,48,49, our focus on young adults limits the applicability to other age groups. Furthermore, we used a well-established paradigm with looming stimuli to probe PPS responses18,19, but whether static images elicit similar immune effects remain unknown and requires future research. Finally, the EEG results show different responses to infectious and neutral avatars from PPS-related areas, especially in the far space, that is, at the PPS boundary for infection stimuli. However, the direction of the GFP modulation is not fully consistent with the electrophysiology literature on PPS representation (normally showing higher responses for PPS-related stimuli). This might depend on the use of looming stimuli, compared to static stimuli used in previous studies21,22,23, of VT stimuli rather than audio–tactile stimuli and on the sampled spatial distances. These factors might affect the temporal dynamics of the electrophysiological response. Future studies should better clarify this point. In the present study, the fMRI results better allowed us to interpret the directionality of brain responses to infectious avatars.

A theoretical limitation in the field is the potential confound between perceived infectiousness and disgust. Disgust is central to the behavioral immune system and helps avoid infectious threats50. Infectious-looking avatars may trigger more disgust than neutral ones, but this factor cannot be fully separated from contamination-avoidance mechanisms. We addressed this by (1) ensuring that our cohorts were matched for disgust sensitivity (Supplementary Table 3) and (2) showing that including disgust as a covariate in fMRI analyses did not affect the key results (Supplementary Fig. 23).

This research complies with all relevant ethical regulations. The experiments were conducted in accordance with the principles of the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the ethical committee ‘Commission cantonale d‘éthique de la recherche sur l‘être humain' of the Vaud and Geneva cantons, Switzerland (201701588).

A total of 248 individuals participated in the study across the following five different experiments: (1) attitude and arousal toward avatars (n = 41), (2) behavior (n = 45), (3) EEG (n = 32), (4) immune response (n = 60 + 32) and (5) fMRI (n = 38). The different experimental cohorts were age and sex matched (total of 132 women; mean age = 26.8 years, range 18–49). Within each experiment, the different experimental cohorts (infectious, fearful and neutral) were tested for differences in sensitivity to disgust and anxiety, and no difference was found (Supplementary Table 1). All participants were recruited for a single experiment through the participant management software ‘Sona-Systems'.

Participants were right-handed, reported no history of neurological, psychiatric or immune disorders, had no somatosensory impairments and had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. None reported specific diseases making the acquisition of blood samples unsafe (for example, hemophilia and anemia). The vaccine cohort was vaccinated with FluarixTetra 2018–2019.

For all participants, the experiment was run at the same time in the morning (from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.). Participants were financially reimbursed for their time (20 Swiss Francs per h), and all provided written informed consent before participating.

Visual stimuli were presented stereoscopically with a head-mounted display (Oculus Rift CV1, 110° field of view, resolution 2,160 × 1,200, refresh rate of 90 Hz). All visual stimuli consisted of female or male virtual faces with different facial features that were sex matched to the participants. Avatar faces could present a neutral expression, a fearful expression or signs of infectious disease and sickness. All avatars were created with ‘Poser 10 Pro' software (posersoftware.com) and were postprocessed using Blender (www.blender.org). Neutral and fearful avatars were selected from previous validated literature51. For infectious avatars, a validation procedure consisted of an initial database of 22 virtual faces (11 men and 11 women), each showing signs of sickness (Supplementary Methods 1 and 2).

Tactile stimulation was delivered using a pair of cylindrical mechanical vibrators (Precision Microdrives, Pico Vibe Vibration Motor, diameter of 10 mm, stimulation frequency of 100 Hz, stimulation duration of 200 ms) taped to the cheeks of the participants and interfaced using a custom-made programmable microcontroller, which also sampled at 10 kHz the response times provided by a hand-held press button. For the fMRI experiment, a magnetic resonance-compatible pneumatic stimulator was used instead of non-magnetic resonance-compatible mechanical vibrators.

To measure whether infectious avatars affected PPS representation, we adapted a well-validated multisensory interaction task previously used to measure the extent of the PPS behaviorally17,18,19. In this task, participants are required to press a button as fast as possible after receiving an automatized mild touch to their face, while concurrently observing a task-irrelevant visual stimulus looming toward their face. In different trials, touch is delivered when the visual stimulus is perceived at a different distance from the participant, and RT is measured to derive a proxy of the extent of PPS (Supplementary Method 3). Custom Python (v3.7) code was used to present the VR stimuli, based on the ExpyVR toolbox (v1.0; https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lnco/research/expyvr/)

EEG data were acquired using a 128-channel system (ActiveTwo, Biosemi V.O.F.). The EEG paradigm, acquisition and preprocessing (EEGLAB v14 with MATLAB v2017a and Cartool v3.12) are described in Supplementary Method 4 and Supplementary Fig. 24. Statistical analyses were performed in two steps. First, we identified time windows responding to multisensory (VT) stimuli (versus T). Then, within these time windows, we characterized distinct PPS responses for neutral and infectious avatars. In the first step, we compared multisensory (VT near and VT far) to unisensory (T) responses (Fig. 1d). To increase the power of this analysis, for each distance (near and far), we combined EEG data of condition 1 (neutral avatars) and condition 2 (neutral avatars in the control cohort and infectious avatars in the infection cohort) of both cohorts (control and infection). Significant differences between T and VT (near and far) were determined with a cluster-based, nonparametric statistical procedure as implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox (v20171231 with MATLAB v2017a)52,53. This data-driven approach controls for the false-positive error rate in a situation of multiple comparisons (multiple time points and electrodes). Significant time windows (between −100 ms and 400 ms) in the contrast between VT and T were considered as multisensory responses and were selected for the second step of the analyses. In the second step, we conducted analyses based on the classic approach to study PPS22,23,54, in which PPS is defined as a multisensory modulation of tactile stimulation due to an external stimulus (here visual presentation of avatars), as a function of the distance of these stimuli from the body in space. We first estimated the PPS distance effect (VT near versus VT far) with EEG data from both cohorts together (Fig. 1e). We then tested whether the PPS response was distinct when a neutral or infectious avatar was presented by using the contrast [near (neutral – infectious) – far (neutral – infectious)] in the infectious cohort and [near (neutral – neutral 2) – far (neutral – neutral 2)] in the control cohort (Fig. 1f–h). All statistical analyses in the second step were performed on GFP. GFP has the advantage of representing a measure of the neural strength of evoked responses while reducing the inherent high dimensionality of EEG data (false positive).

To localize neural activity in key contrasts, we performed a current density analysis in three-dimensional Tailarach/MNI space of scalp-recorded electrical activity using the sLORETA/eLORETA software package55. sLORETA estimates the distribution of electrical neural activity in three-dimensional space based on the measurements of a dense grid of 6,239 voxels at 5-mm spatial resolution, which are placed on the entire scalp surface covering the brain. This inverse solution algorithm assumes related orientations and strengths of neighboring neuronal sources (represented by adjacent voxels). Figure 1e,h shows the difference in estimated current distribution at the time point showing the strongest statistical difference in GFP within each significant time window.

Venous blood was drawn from 60 healthy donors immediately after the baseline session (consisting of a 20-min VR stimulation with neutral avatars or following arrival of the participants assigned to the vaccine cohort) and after the second session (consisting of two VR stimulations accordingly to the assigned cohort). The second session consisted of a 20-min VR exposure, 90-min break and another 10-min VR exposure. Thirty individuals were randomly assigned to the neutral and infection cohorts (n = 15 per cohort), with an equal number of tested participants per condition per day. Two independent cohorts were further enrolled and assigned to the fearful or vaccine cohort. Participants assigned to the vaccine cohort waited for the same time delay as participants exposed to VR. Therefore, the time interval between the blood samplings was 120 min in all cohorts.

To replicate the main findings, a new independent sample of participants (n = 16 per cohort, see Statistics for the sample size calculation) was recruited and randomly assigned to the neutral or infection cohort. For comparisons between the neutral and infection conditions, participant cohort assignment was not communicated to the immunologists analyzing blood samples to ensure blindness in the analysis.

PBMCs were isolated by Lymphoprep centrifugation (600g, 20-min centrifugation without break, room temperature) and washed twice with PBS. Platelets were removed by centrifugation (200g, 10-min centrifugation with break, room temperature), and red blood cells were eliminated by incubating the cell pellets with 1 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. For serum collection, whole blood was centrifuged (1,800g, 10 min, room temperature). Following centrifugation, the serum was collected and immediately cryopreserved at −80 °C.

Isolated PBMCs were immediately stained for 20 min at room temperature in sorting buffer (PBS, 50 μM EDTA and 0.2% bovine serum albumin) with the following FITC-conjugated lineage markers: anti-human CD3 (UCHT1, Beckman Coulter (BC), 1:200), anti-human CD4 (SFCI12T4D11, BC, 1:200), anti-human CD8 (MEM-31, Immunotools, 1:100), anti-human CD14 (RMO52, BC, 1:200), anti-human CD15 (80H5, BC, 1:50), anti-human CD19 (J3-119, BC, 1:100), anti-human CD20 (2H7, Biolegend, 1:400), anti-human CD33 (HIM3-4, Biolegend, 1:400), anti-human CD34 (561, Biolegend, 1:100), anti-human CD203c (E-NPP3, Biolegend, 1:25) and anti-human FcεRIα (AER-37, Biolegend, 1:200). Additionally, we used APC/Cy7 anti-human CD27 (M-T271, Biolegend, 1:50), Brilliant Violet 605 anti-human CD117 (cKit) (104D2, Biolegend, 1:200), Brilliant Violet 421 anti-human CRTH2 (CD294; BM16, Biolegend, 1:200), PerCP/Cy5.5 anti-human CD335 (NKp46; 9E2, Biolegend, 1:50), PE anti-human CD337 (NKp30; P30-15, Biolegend, 1:100), PE/Dazzle 594 anti-human HLA-DR (L243, Biolegend, 1:200), PE/Cy7 anti-human KLRG1 (14C2A07, Biolegend, 1:200), APC anti-human CD336 (NKp44; P44-8, Biolegend, 1:100), Alexa Fluor 700 anti-human CD16 (3G8, Biolegend, 1:100), Brilliant Violet 510 anti-human CD25 (BC96, Biolegend, 1:100), Brilliant Violet 650 anti-human CD69 (FN50, Biolegend, 1:200), Brilliant Violet 711 anti-human CD279 (PD1; NAT105, Biolegend, 1:50), Brilliant Violet 785 anti-human CD127 (IL-7Rα; A019D5, Biolegend, 1:200) and BUV737 anti-human CD56 (NCAM16.2, BD, 1:100). Dead cells were excluded using the viability dye DAPI (Invitrogen, 1:10,000). Samples were acquired on an LSR SORP flow cytometer (BD using the BD FACSDiva software v8.0.2), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.7.1. For the replication experiment, samples were acquired on an LSR Fortessa flow cytometer (BD using the BD FACSDiva software v8.0.2), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software v10.8.1 (TreeStar). This combination of markers allowed us to identify NKbright cells as living lineage−CD16−CD56bright lymphocytes, NKdim cells as living lineage−CD16+CD56dim lymphocytes and total ILCs as living lineage−CD16−CD56−CD127+ lymphocytes. ILCs were further divided into CRTH2−cKit− ILC1s, CRTH2+cKit+/− ILC2s and CRTH2−cKit+ ILCPs. The other markers were used to assess the activation status of NK cells and ILCs and were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 10.4.1 (Supplementary Figs. 8, 11 and 13).

All data were acquired on a Siemens Prisma 3T magnetic resonance scanner with a 32-channel receiver/transmitter head coil (see Supplementary Method 5 for fMRI adaptation of the PPS task). Functional volumes were acquired using a gradient echo planar imaging sequence over the whole brain (TR: 1,000 ms; TE: 32 ms; slice thickness: 2 mm; 66 axial slices; in-plane resolution: 2 × 2 mm2; multislice acceleration factor: 6). Four functional runs were acquired with the presentation of the experimental conditions, each with 380 volumes. Furthermore, T1-weighted structural images (mprage sequence, sagittal orientation, resolution: 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, TR: 2,000 ms, TE: 2.25 ms, flip angle: 8°) were recorded after the acquisition of functional images.

All images were preprocessed using SPM12 software (with MATLAB v2021a) (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology). Preprocessing steps included slice timing correction, realignment, minimal smoothing (full-width at half-maximum = 3 mm) and normalization to MNI space. A generalized linear model analysis, including the four experimental runs, was performed to estimate the BOLD responses (beta estimates) associated with the different experimental conditions. The model included seven regressors, one for each experimental condition, convoluted with the hemodynamic response, as well as the six rigid-body motion parameters and the frame-wise displacement as nuisance regressors56 (total of seven nuisance regressors). The software mricroGL (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/) was used for visualization of the results. At the single-participant level, the following contrasts were computed in each cohort:

contrasts 1 and 2 to highlight the multisensory activations common to infectious/fearful and neutral conditions:

contrast 1 (VTFinfectious/VTFfearful + VTNinfectious/VTNfearful)

contrast 2 (VTFneutral + VTNneutral)

contrast 3 to highlight the activations specific to infectious avatars in the far space compared to neutral avatars:

contrast 3 (VTFinfectious/VTFfearful > VTFneutral)

contrast 4 to highlight the activations specific to infectious avatars in the near space compared to neutral avatars:

contrast 4 (VTNinfectious/VTNfearful > VTNneutral)

contrast 5 to highlight the difference between contrasts 3 and 4:

contrast 5 (VTFinfectious/VTFfearful – VTFneutral > VTNinfectious/VTNfearful – VTNneutral)

These single-participant contrasts were then used to compute the following group-level statistical tests: (1) one-sample t-test with contrast 1 in the infectious cohort (VTinfectious), (2) one-sample t-test with contrast 2 in the infectious cohort (VTneutral), (3) one-sample t-test with contrast 1 in the fearful cohort (VTfearful), (4) one-sample t-test with contrast 2 in the fearful cohort (VTneutral), (5) one-sample t-test with contrast 3 in the infectious cohort (dVTFi: VTFi > VTFn), (6) one-sample t-test with contrast 4 in the infectious cohort (dVTNi: VTNi > VTNn), (7) one-sample t-test with contrast 5 in the infectious cohort (dVTFi > dVTNi), (8) two-sample t-test (infectious versus fearful) with contrast 3 (dVTFi > dVTFf), (9) two-sample t-test (infectious versus fearful) with contrast 4 (dVTNi > dVTNf) and (10) two-sample t-test (infectious versus fearful) with contrast 5 (dVTFi > dVTNi) > (dVTFf > dVTNf).

Finally, to control that our results cannot be explained by a simple effect of disgust during exposure to infectious avatars (for example, an increase in brain activity when disgust is experienced), we computed an additional one-sample t-test at the group level with contrast 3 by including as a covariate an assessment of sensitivity to disgusting stimuli using the germ aversion questionnaire57.

Whole-brain results were corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error cluster-level correction at P < 0.05 (with a primary threshold of P < 0.005; Supplementary Fig. 23).

DCM (SPM12) analyses were performed to investigate the connectivity between the hypothalamus (central node of the HPA axis) and the cortical regions that were associated with infectious avatars presented in far space. The hypothalamus was delineated using the parcellation pipeline of the Connectome Mapper 3 software (v3.1.0; https://connectome-mapper-3.readthedocs.io/). The cortical regions activated by infectious avatars presented in the far space were selected from group comparisons 5 and 7. To extract the time series from each selected region, a generalized linear model with the four functional runs concatenated was computed. We directly modeled BOLD fluctuations associated with the difference between infectious and neutral conditions by defining a ‘task' condition (for example, VTF for both type of faces) and an ‘avatar' parametric modulation (1 for infectious trials and −1 for neutral trials). Next, we computed two DCM analyses (neural model options: bilinear neural model, one state per region, no stochastic effects, with input centering), one for each hemisphere (cortical regions selected from contrasts 5 and 7 in the right hemisphere + right hypothalamus and cortical regions selected from contrasts 5 and 7 in the left hemisphere + left hypothalamus). The ‘task' and ‘avatar' conditions for VTF were included in the two DCM analyses. The driving input C was enabled for all regions of the ‘task' condition, but not for the ‘avatar' condition. The baseline connectivity A was initialized to a fully connected network. The modulatory connectivity B was enabled for the ‘avatar' condition and was restricted to self-connections and connections between the hypothalamus and all other regions. The parametric empirical Bayes framework was used to identify (at the group level) the connections that were differently modulated across VTFinfectious and VTFneutral conditions. Connections were considered significantly modulated (VTFinfectious > VTFneutral or VTFinfectious < VTFneutral) when a posterior probability of 0.95 was reached. As control analyses, the same DCM analyses were computed with the corresponding conditions presented in the near space (VTNinfectious and VTNneutral), as well as in the fearful cohort.

Serum samples were thawed and analyzed using different methods. For steroid quantification, serum samples (100 µl) were mixed with 550 µl of 5% H3PO4 and 75 µl of internal standard solution and extracted by solid-phase extraction on an OASIS MCX µElution 96-well plate (30 µm, 2 mg). Wells were washed and conditioned with 200 µl of methanol and 200 µl of water, respectively. Loaded samples were washed with 200 µl of 5% NH4OH and twice with 200 µl of water:methanol (4:1 (vol/vol)), and steroids were eluted with 2 × 100 µl of isopropanol. The solvent was then evaporated to dryness under N2 gas (TurboVap, Biotage), and final extracts were reconstituted with 100 µl of methanol. Extracted samples were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem MS (MS/MS) in both positive and negative ionization mode using a TSQ Altis triple-quadrupole system interfaced with a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Chromatographic separation was performed in an Accucore aQ C18 column (2.6 μm, 100 mm × 2.1 mm inner diameter; Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mobile phase was composed of A (0.25 mM ammonium fluoride in water) and B (100% methanol) at a flow rate of 250 μl min−1, column temperature of 40 °C and sample injection volume of 2 µl. Gradient elution was performed with 70% A as the starting condition for 1 min and linearly decreased to 55% at 1.5 min, 15% at 5 min and 0% at 6 min to 7 min. The column was then washed with solvent B for 1 min and equilibrated to initial conditions. ESI source conditions were set as follows: vaporizer temperature of 350 °C, sheath gas of 50 arbitrary units (AU), auxiliary gas of 13 AU and sweep gas of 1 AU. The ion transfer tube temperature was set at 275 °C, the positive ion spray voltage was set at +3,500 V, and the negative ion spray voltage was set at −2,800 V. Scheduled multiple reaction monitoring with polarity switching was used as the acquisition mode with a minimum dwell time between 8 and 22 ms. Optimized collision energies for each metabolite were applied. Raw LC–MS/MS data were processed using TraceFinder 5.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For absolute quantification, calibration curves and stable isotope-labeled internal standards were used to determine the response factor. Linearity of the standard curves was evaluated for each metabolite using a 12-point range; in addition, peak area integration was manually curated and corrected when necessary.

For eicosanoid quantification, serum samples (150 µl) were mixed with 150 µl of extraction buffer (citric acid/Na2HPO4, pH 5.6) and 10 µl of internal standard solution and extracted by solid-phase extraction using an OASIS HLB LP 96-well plate (60 µm, 60 mg). Wells were conditioned and equilibrated with 1 ml of methanol and 1 ml of water, respectively. Loaded samples were washed with water:methanol (90:10 (vol/vol)), and eicosanoids were eluted with 750 µl of methanol. The solvent was then evaporated to dryness under N2 gas (TurboVap, Biotage), and final extracts were reconstituted with 75 µl of methanol:water (6:1 (vol/vol)). Extracted samples were analyzed by reversed-phase LC–MS/MS40 in negative ionization mode using a 6495 triple-quadrupole system interfaced with a 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies). Chromatographic separation was performed in an Acquity BEH C18 column (1.7 μm, 150 mm × 2.1 mm inner diameter; Waters). The mobile phase was composed of A (water with 0.1% acetic acid) and B (acetonitrile:isopropanol 90:10 (vol/vol)) at a flow rate of 500 μl min−1, column temperature of 60 °C and sample injection volume of 2 µl. Gradient elution was performed with 80% A as the starting condition and was linearly decreased to 65% at 2.5 min, 60% at 4.5 min, 58% at 6 min, 50% at 8 min, 35% at 14 min, 27.5% at 1 min and 0% at 16.6 min. The column was then washed with solvent B for 0.9 min and equilibrated to initial conditions. ESI source conditions were set as follows: dry gas temperature of 290 °C, nebulizer at 25 psi and flow of 12 l min−1, sheath gas temperature of 400 °C and flow of 12 l min−1, nozzle voltage of 2,000 V and capillary voltage of 3,000 V. Dynamic multiple reaction monitoring was used as the acquisition mode with a total cycle time of 250 ms. Optimized collision energies for each metabolite were applied58. Raw LC–MS/MS data were processed using Agilent Quantitative analysis software (version B.07.00, MassHunter Agilent Technologies). For absolute quantification, calibration curves and stable isotope-labeled internal standards were used to determine the response factor. Linearity of the standard curves was evaluated for each metabolite using a 12-point range; in addition, peak area integration was manually curated and corrected when necessary.

For other soluble mediators, the ‘human neuroinflammation panel 1 (740796)' LEGENDplex kit (Biolegend) was used, according to manufacturer's instructions. This platform allowed for the quantification of the concentration of 13 different soluble factors at the same time, namely VILIP-1, CCL2 (MCP-1), sTREM-2, BDNF, TGFβ1, VEGF, IL-6, sTREM-1, β-NGF, IL-18, TNF, sRAGE and CX3CL1 (Fractalkine).

Steroids, eicosanoids and neuroinflammatory factors were analyzed and plotted using GraphPad Prism version 10.4.1 (Supplementary Figs. 17–19).

Univariate and multivariate linear regressions were first attempted to predict VR-induced changes in ILC activation from changes in eicosanoid, neuroinflammatory factor and hormone concentrations. These analyses resulted in nonsignificant effects (univariate: R2 = 0.001, 0.015 and 0.058 and P = 0.86, 0.53 and 0.20, for eicosanoids, neuroinflammatory factors and hormones, respectively; multivariate: R2 = 0.13 and P = 0.3), suggesting that the neural signals triggering an immune response are based on a more complex, nonlinear combination of inputs. For this reason, we developed a one-hidden-layer neural network with changes in eicosanoid, neuroinflammatory factor and hormones concentrations as input and changes in ILC activation as output (Supplementary Method 6).

All data were checked for normality distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test). Because the majority of data were normally distributed, to ensure uniform statistical testing, we performed two-sided t-tests in all comparisons. Given the absence of previous studies assessing immunological responses to virtual threats, we first calculated the required sample size for the behavioral multisensory experiment. Based on previous experiments17,19, an averaged effect size f = 0.403 was calculated. Thus, we originally estimated, for immunomonitoring, a sample size of 15 participants per group, with a desired power of 0.95 (1 − β) on within-group comparisons via G*Power 3.1 software. The sample size for the other experiments was then established accordingly. For the replication experiment, based on the effect size of the data presented in the paper of the original cohorts (neural versus infection cohorts: Cohen's d = 1.114 for ILC frequency and d = 1.116 for ILC activation), the sample size with a P value of <0.05 and a power of 0.80 was determined to be 14 participants per cohort. To minimize the risk of dropouts and data loss, we enrolled and analyzed 16 participants per group.

Experts say quantum computing is the future of computers. Unlike conventional computers, quantum computers leverage the properties of quantum physics such as superposition and interference, theoretically outperforming current equipment to an exponential degree.

When a quantum computer is able to solve a problem unfeasible for current technologies, this is called the quantum advantage. However, this edge is not guaranteed for all calculations, raising fundamental questions regarding the conditions under which such an advantage exists. While previous studies have proposed various sufficient conditions for quantum advantage, the necessity of these conditions has remained unclear.

Motivated by this uncertainty, a team of researchers at Kyoto University has endeavored to understand the necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum advantage, using an approach combining techniques from quantum computing and cryptography, the science of coding information securely.

Specifically, the team focused on interactive protocols called inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness, which allow a verifier without a quantum computer to interact with a quantum prover and verify that it indeed possesses quantum computational power. In their study, the team demonstrated that the existence of these proofs depends on the existence of a certain cryptographic primitive called a one-way puzzle.

By integrating these methods, the team introduced a novel framework uniting the seemingly unrelated concepts of quantum advantage and cryptographic security. As a result, the team was able to completely characterize quantum advantage for the first time.

"We were able to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for quantum advantage by proving an equivalence between the existence of quantum advantage and the security of certain quantum cryptographic primitives," says corresponding author Yuki Shirakawa.

The results imply that when quantum advantage does not exist, then the security of almost all cryptographic primitives -- previously believed to be secure -- is broken. Importantly, these primitives are not limited to quantum cryptography but also include widely-used conventional cryptographic primitives as well as post-quantum ones that are rapidly evolving.

The established equivalence between quantum computing and cryptography also provides a stronger cryptographic foundation for future experimental demonstrations of quantum advantage, as well as for ongoing theoretical investigations in the field.

"Quantum advantage is a highly expected and actively studied concept, but it is still not fully understood. Our study represents a significant step toward a deeper understanding of this property," says Shirakawa.

The team expects that future research will extend characterization to other types of quantum advantage and lead to a more general theoretical framework.

Once again, the world is betting on nuclear power. The United States aims to quadruple its nuclear capacity by 2050, and more than 30 countries have pledged to triple global capacity by mid-century. China has more than 30 reactors under construction and in planning, and France has announced plans to build 14 reactors. Technology giants, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are also investing in nuclear to power their energy-hungry data centres and lower their carbon emissions.

A central challenge remains: can development be done at a manageable cost? Historically, the industry has faced a ‘cost escalation curse'1–4. Building more nuclear reactors has led to higher, not lower, costs per watt (see ‘Costly construction'), hampering their economic viability. By contrast, for solar and wind energy, mass production and steady technological improvements have driven costs down5,6.

Source: Analysis by S. Liu et al.

The cost of building nuclear power plants can soar because of a lack of standardized designs, rising material and labour costs, evolving regulations and technical complexities7. But is this cost escalation inevitable? Here, we show that tailored regulations and policies can reverse the trend. Decades of nuclear-energy development in China demonstrate that construction costs can be brought down through a combination of stable regulations and efforts to strengthen domestic supply chains.

Over the past two decades, China has been the main country to substantially and consistently expand its nuclear fleet, to 58 operating reactors in 2024. Since 2022, the government has been approving around ten new reactors each year, putting China on track to surpass the United States and become the world's largest holder of nuclear power capacity by 2030. State-affiliated research centres have outlined a goal of quintupling China's current nuclear capacity by 2050.

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them

We have compiled and analysed a data set on the construction costs of nuclear power plants in China, drawn from a wide range of publicly available sources (see Supplementary information for raw data and further analyses). We focus on the cost of construction, because operating and fuel costs are relatively low and have remained stable3,8.

Our findings are striking. Whereas construction costs increased substantially between the 1960s and 2000s, by around tenfold in the United States and by nearly twofold in France, they had halved in China by the early 2000s and have remained largely stable since.

Various strategies were used to keep technological costs down, such as building larger plants for scale efficiency and leveraging accumulated experience. But these alone fail to fully explain the cost-reduction trend observed in China. The country has also managed to contain costs through strategic development of domestic supply chains, stable regulatory frameworks, state-backed incentive policies and effective construction management.

The key driver of cost reduction has been China's deliberate effort to build domestic capacity in civil nuclear power, which unfolded in three stages. From the 1990s to 2005, China imported foreign reactors to deploy immediately while gradually producing simple, conventional components domestically and using Chinese firms for civil engineering and construction to reduce costs. At the same time, it began researching and developing its own reactor design based on French technology.

Between 2005 and 2010, these efforts to localize production advanced to include more complex, safety-critical components, such as reactor cores. China ramped up capacity, building about 30 reactors using two domestically developed model types. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, China accelerated the adoption of advanced safety features by collaborating with partners from the United States and France, while developing its own advanced reactor models.

Substituting expensive imports with domestically produced components substantially reduces cost. Some Chinese-made nuclear components, such as tubes, ring cranes and charging pumps, cost half as much as their imported equivalents. However, for countries that import their nuclear technologies, domestic supply-chain building must be strategic. For example, South Korea adopted a similar approach to China, which led to cost reductions4,9. By contrast, around the 1980s, France deviated from the tried-and-tested US reactor design in favour of a national version, which hindered standardization and caused construction costs to soar3.

China's regulatory structure and policy environment also play an important part. A consistent, state-backed industrial policy has provided stable electricity tariffs and low-interest financing for state-owned nuclear power companies (see go.nature.com/3uhsdfd). Its centralized nuclear governance structure helps to ensure regulatory stability and coordinates reactor standardization across the country.

The Impossible Problems Hidden in a Simple Game of Tetris

How complex can a simple game be? Tetris pushes even supercomputers to their limits and amazes mathematicians

By Manon Bischoff edited by Daisy Yuhas

As a child of the 1990s, I couldn't avoid the game-turned-best-seller Tetris. Launched in 1984 by Russian programmer Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris quickly became a blockbuster and has had hundreds of millions of players over the years. I myself spent hours on my Game Boy trying to position falling bricks so that they would fill the playing field as completely as possible. Over the course of a game, those blocks fell faster and faster, and my thumbs could barely keep up with the controls.

In principle, all games—even those as varied as Candy Crush Saga, Magic: The Gathering and Wordle—can be examined from a mathematical perspective. But Tetris has many special connections to mathematics. For instance, the game's goal strongly resembles geometry's parquet problems, in which you determine whether you can cover an area with an infinitely large set of tiles without any gaps.

But Tetris is especially intriguing to mathematicians in terms of its complexity. More specifically, researchers have wondered about the computing power that it takes to determine how or if someone can truly “solve” Tetris, assuming conditions such as a finite number of bricks and the ability to know the order in which various shapes will appear. It turns out that that particular framing places Tetris among the most mathematically complex games.

In the field of complexity theory, mathematicians and computer scientists seek to characterize the difficulty involved in solving problems. They have defined multiple complexity classes, or categories, including P and NP problems. Simply put, P problems are easy for conventional computers to solve, whereas NP problems are more difficult but, in the event you have a possible solution, easy to check. (NP problems can be thought of like a Sudoku puzzle: it may take hours to fill in the fields, but it only takes a few minutes to see whether the solution is correct.)

To determine the complexity of a task, one must compare different problems with each other. If every algorithm that solves task A can also solve task B, for example, then A is more complex than B. Or as mathematicians put it: B is “reducible” to A. That means that by comparing Tetris with another known P or NP problem, its complexity can be determined.

So how do we pick a good point of comparison? Computer scientists can turn to so-called NP-complete problems, to which all other NP problems can be reduced. One of these is the three-partition problem.

The three-partition problem deals with the question of whether a given set of integers, for example {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}, can be divided into subsets with three elements each such that the sum of the numbers in the subsets is always equal. For {1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9}, a division would be {1, 5, 9} and {2, 6, 7}. The contents of each subset add up to 15. Such a division is not possible for every given set. Finding out whether this exists or not proves to be extremely difficult: the three-partition problem is NP-complete.

In 2003 computer scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology demonstrated that the question of whether a Tetris board can be cleared in a given game situation can itself be mapped to the three-partition problem. To do this, the researchers equated the gaps in the Tetris game with the subsets of the problem and the falling bricks with the numbers that have to be split up.

In this way, the scientists showed that if the set of numbers can be divided into three-element subsets with the same sum, then the Tetris playing field can also be completely emptied. In doing so, they proved that the questions “Can a set be divided into a three-partition?” and “Can the Tetris playing field be emptied?” are identical from a mathematical point of view.

This insight means the puzzle of whether given bricks can be arranged appropriately falls into the category of NP-complete problems, making Tetris a highly complex game. The longer the sequence of bricks that the game contains, the more time-consuming it is for a computer to determine the solvability. And indeed, conventional computers will be overwhelmed very quickly: there is no algorithm that can solve the problem efficiently.

Tetris has even more complex properties, as computer scientists Hendrik Jan Hoogeboom and Walter Kosters, both at Leiden University in the Netherlands, showed in a 2004 paper. They looked at a slightly different question. Let's assume that you observe a game of Tetris that only features the elongated, I-shaped brick. If I gave you a predetermined number of ways for, say, 40 I-shaped tiles to fall onto an empty Tetris board, could you decide whether, among those eight ways, there is one for which the board ends up empty?

Hoogeboom and Kosters proved that this question is, in fact, undecidable, even with an infinite amount of computing power. That's because the aforementioned question can be mapped to a problem that relates to Kurt Gödel's infamous incompleteness theorems. These state that there will always be statements in mathematics that can neither be proved nor disproved.

Of course, these questions likely have no effect on your success at Tetris. With the speed at which pieces fall, there is hardly any time to think about mathematical problems.

Still, it's remarkable that after more than 40 years, Tetris appreciation continues to grow and evolve, even as the game remains essentially unchanged. For instance, a playing technique known as “rolling” (which allows very fast inputs to be made) has made it possible to advance further than ever before. In the past, the 29th level was seen as an insurmountable limit. But in 2023 a then 13-year-old broke all previous records by rolling through to level 157, causing the game to crash. We can only wait and see what surprises Tetris has in store in the future.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

What could be the world's oldest human burial site—discovered in a cave in central Israel—shows that funerary ritual has been alive and well for at least 100,000 years. 

The Tinshemet Cave, which has been an active archaeological site for nearly a decade, has revealed at least five sets of Homo sapiens and Neanderthal-like hominin remains—all buried in the same ritualistic fashion and surrounded by more than 500 grave goods. In a study published this spring in Nature Human Behavior, the authors called the discovery “remarkable for its exceptional evidence of human morphological variability, with contemporaneous fossils of Homo sapiens and Neanderthal-like hominis.” 

The most fascinating thing about these burials is their age. The Homo remains were dated to 100,000 years ago, thanks to the variety of objects surrounding the skeletons that had been richly preserved in the cave environment (which included ash from ritual fires and acidic limestone). This is now considered one of the world's oldest known burial sites—if not the oldest—and shows how Homo behavior merged at the location, culminating in burial rituals. 

“Viewed from the perspective of other key regional sites of this period, our findings indicate consolidation of a uniform behavioral set in the Levantine mid-MP,” the authors wrote, “consisting of similar lithic technology, an increased reliance on large-game hunting, and a range of socially elaborated behaviors, comprising intentional human burial and the use of ochre in burial contexts.” 

The authors believe that this behavioral uniformity is due to intensified inter-population interactions and the mixing of different Homo groups. 

“This is an amazing revolutionary innovation for our species,” Yossi Zaidner, a director of the excavation and professor of archaeology at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, told the Associated Press. “It's actually the first time we are starting to use this behavior.” 

Zaidner calls the cave's interior “one of the three or four most important sites for study of human evolution and behavior during the Paleolithic time.” 

The remains—including two full skeletons and three skulls (along with some additional bones and teeth)—were placed in fetal burial positions, arranged amidst more than 500 basalt pebbles (which could have once been jewelry-like decorations), animal remains, and plenty of red and orange ochre pigment. The researchers believe that, since some of the objects had to be brought in from hundreds of miles away and had no practical use, these objects are surefire indicators of ritual design. 

“Here we see a really complex set of behaviors,” Zaidner said, “not related to just food and surviving.” 

Even marking out burial sites is believed to have been a new concept 100,000 years ago. “It's a kind of claim you make to the neighbors, saying ‘this is my territory, this part of the land belongs to my father and my forefather' and so on and so on,” Israel Hershkovitz, a physical anthropologist at Tel Aviv University and co-director of the Tinshemet site, told AP. 

The Tinshemet group believes that at the same time modern humans emerged on the African continent, Neanderthals were emerging in Europe, and the two groups met for the first time in the Levant during the Middle Paleolithic period. The region's mix of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens could have created a hybrid population, but research into the cave's skeletal remains have so far proven inconclusive on that front.

The cave has shown not only articulated human remains, but flint tools and evidence for the use of fire, providing a unique view into the social and behavioral complexity of the earliest funerary practices. Add in what could be some of the first examples of jewelry and body painting, and what we know about burials (and society, in general) from 100,000 years ago is changing.

You Don't Remember Being a Baby, but Your Brain Was Making Memories

Brain scans capture memory formation in babies, raising new questions about why people forget their earliest years

By Nick Turk-Browne edited by Daisy Yuhas

A plume of red, a searing pain and the sounds of summer—these are fragments of my earliest memory, when I stepped on a glass shard in a Toronto splash park at six or seven years old. I don't remember much from that day, but a scar on my foot bears witness to what happened.

When you ask adults about their first memory, for a specific event from their childhood, their answer typically dates back no earlier than preschool. This is true whether you ask a college student or a grandparent, suggesting that adults' lack of infant or toddler memories is not just the result of normal forgetting that occurs with the passage of time. The gap in our autobiographical memory from when we were a baby is known as “infantile amnesia.”

There are two potential explanations for this phenomenon. One is that infants cannot store memories. The slow development of the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped region deep in the brain, may be responsible. This region, which is critical for memory, grows and changes throughout childhood, so it might not yet be available to infants. In this telling, babies are not so different from famous cases of amnesia such as those of Henry Molaison and Lonni Sue Johnson, both of whom suffered hippocampal damage in adulthood that made them unable to store memories.

Another possibility is that the infant brain can store memories, but we eventually lose access to them. Recent studies in mice show that not only is the hippocampus able to store memories early in life but that it may retain these memories into adulthood. For example, scientists were able to retrieve an otherwise forgotten memory by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus that had been active during an early experience.

But what about humans? My lab has been on a decade-long quixotic adventure to study awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a form of brain imaging that can measure activity from regions deep in the brain such as the hippocampus. Although this technology is used to study memory formation in adults and is safe for infants, it had not previously been used to study babies' memory.

Why was that the case? Infants move a lot, don't follow instructions and have a short attention span—all of which make it difficult to collect good data from them. As a result, most fMRI research in infants has been conducted while they sleep. But this wasn't an option for our investigations because memories are based on experiences in waking life. Through more than 400 sessions and countless insights from families, we have refined innovative techniques to keep awake infants still, happy, and engaged.

In a recent study, a team at my lab led by Tristan Yates, now a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University, used this method to discover that the infant hippocampus can store memories beginning around one year of age. We showed infants photographs of faces, objects and scenes one at a time during fMRI. Shortly afterward, we tested their memory by showing each of these now-familiar photographs alongside a new image of the same type. If the infant looked longer at the photograph they had seen before, we labeled that image as remembered; otherwise, it was forgotten.

With this behavior documented, we looked back at the brain data when the photographs were first shown and found that the hippocampus was more active when infants viewed images that they later seemed to remember. This result suggests that the infant hippocampus can create memories after only a brief experience. The effects were clearest after 12 months of age, in infants who had stronger overall memory and in the subregion of the hippocampus that is most important for remembering specific events (called episodic memory) in adults.

Our findings support the idea that people store memories when they are an infant that they are later unable to access. But the work also raises more questions: How long do these hippocampal memories last? We tested for a few minutes, but infantile amnesia plays out over years. How sophisticated is this infant memory capacity? We tested individual photographs, but episodic memories involve complex events with multiple people, places and things interacting over space and time (for example, remember your last vacation).

The deepest and most provocative questions relate to why most people's earliest memories are from age four to five (or later) if memories are being stored in their brain by age one. What makes those earlier memories inaccessible? Are there any tricks or practices for accessing them? Would we even be able to make sense of them if so?

Answering these questions will help resolve more than a century of scientific curiosity. Revealing how the youngest brains learn and remember may help advance understanding of language acquisition and developmental disorders and could have implications for parenting and early education. More generally, the mysterious workings of memory early in life may hold clues about why we again lose memory later in life, in the normal course of aging and in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's.

Take a moment to reflect: What is your earliest memory? How do you know it's real? There might even be earlier memories locked away in your brain.

Mixed-reality (MR) display systems enable transformative user experiences across various domains, including communication, education, training and entertainment. To create an immersive and accessible experience, the display engine of the MR display must project perceptually realistic 3D images over a wide field of view observable from a large range of possible pupil positions, that is, it must support a large étendue. Current MR displays, however, fall short in delivering these capabilities in a compact device form factor. Here we present an ultra-thin MR display design that overcomes these challenges using a unique combination of waveguide holography and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven holography algorithms. One of the key innovations of our display system is a compact, custom-designed waveguide for holographic near-eye displays that supports a large effective étendue. This is co-designed with an AI-based algorithmic framework combining an implicit large-étendue waveguide model, an efficient wave propagation model for partially coherent mutual intensity and a computer-generated holography framework. Together, our unique co-design of a waveguide holography system and AI-driven holographic algorithms represents an important advancement in creating visually comfortable and perceptually realistic 3D MR experiences in a compact wearable device.

Mixed reality (MR) aims to seamlessly connect people in hybrid physical–digital spaces, offering experiences beyond the limits of our physical world. These immersive platforms provide transformative capabilities to applications including training, communication, entertainment and education1,2, among others. To achieve a seamless and comfortable interface between a user and a virtual environment, the near-eye display must fit into a wearable form factor that ensures style and all-day usage while delivering a perceptually realistic and accessible experience comparable to the real world. Current near-eye displays, however, fail to meet these requirements3. To project the image produced by a microdisplay onto a user's retina, existing designs require optical bulk that is noticeably heavier and larger than conventional eyeglasses. Moreover, existing displays support only two-dimensional images, with limited capability to accurately reproducing the full light field of the real world, resulting in visual discomfort caused by the vergence–accommodation conflict4,5.

Emerging waveguide-based holographic displays are among the most promising technologies to address the challenge of designing compact near-eye displays that produce perceptually realistic imagery. These displays are based on holographic principles6,7,8,9,10, which have been demonstrated to encode a static three-dimensional (3D) scene with a quality indistinguishable from reality in a thin film11 or to compress the functionality of an optical stack into a thin, lightweight holographic optical design12,13. Holographic displays also promise unique capabilities for near-eye displays, including per-pixel depth control, high brightness, low power and optical aberration correction capabilities, which have been explored using benchtop prototypes providing limited visual experiences14,15,16,17,18. Most recently, holographic near-eye displays based on thin optical waveguides have shown promise in enabling very compact form factors for near-eye displays19,20,21, although the image quality, the ability to produce 3D colour images or the étendue achieved by these proposals have been severely limited.

A fundamental problem of all digital holographic displays is the limited space–bandwidth product, or étendue, offered by current spatial light modulators (SLMs)22,23. In practice, a small étendue fundamentally limits how large of a field of view and range of possible pupil positions, that is, eyebox, can be achieved simultaneously. While the field of view is crucial for providing a visually effective and immersive experience, the eyebox size is important to make this technology accessible to a diversity of users, covering a wide range of facial anatomies as well as making the visual experience robust to eye movement and device slippage on the user's head. A plethora of approaches for étendue expansion of holographic displays has been explored, including pupil replication as well as the use of static phase or amplitude masks20,24,25,26,27,28. By duplicating or randomly mixing the optical signal, however, these approaches do not increase the effective degrees of freedom of the (correlated) optical signals, which is represented by the rank of the mutual intensity (MI)29,30,31 (Supplementary Note 2). Hence, the image quality achieved by these approaches is typically poor, and perceptually important ocular parallax cues are not provided to a user32.

One of the key challenges for achieving high image quality with holographic waveguide displays is to model the propagation of light through the system with high accuracy20. Non-idealities of the SLM, optical aberrations, coherence properties of the source, and many other aspects of a specific holographic display are difficult to model precisely, and minor deviations between simulated model and physical optical system severely degrade the achieved image quality. This challenge is drastically exacerbated for holographic displays using compact waveguides in large-étendue settings. A practical solution to this challenge requires a twofold approach. First, the propagation of light has to be modelled with very high accuracy. Second, such a model needs to be efficient and scalable to our large-étendue settings. Recent advances in computational optics have demonstrated that artificial intelligence (AI) methods can be used to learn accurate propagation models of coherent waves through a holographic display, substantially improving the achieved image quality33,34. These learned wave propagation models typically use convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained from experimentally captured phase–intensity image pairs, to model the opto-electronic characteristics of a specific display more accurately than purely simulated models35. However, as we demonstrate in this Article, conventional CNN-based AI models fail to accurately predict complex light propagation in large-étendue waveguides, partly because of the incorrect assumption of the light source being fully coherent. Other important problems include the efficiency of a model, such that it can be trained within a reasonable time from a limited set of captured phase–intensity pairs and run quickly at inference time, and scalability to large-étendue settings while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

Here, we reformulate the wave propagation learning problem as coherence retrieval based on the theory of partial coherence31,36. For this purpose, we derive a physics-based wave propagation model that parameterizes a low-rank approximation of the MI of the wave propagation operator inside a waveguide accounting for partial coherence, which models holographic displays more accurately than existing coherent models. Moreover, our approach parameterizes the wave propagation through waveguides with emerging continuous implicit neural representations37, enabling us to efficiently learn a model for partially coherent wavefront propagation at arbitrary spatial and frequency coordinates over a large étendue. Our implicit model achieves superior quality compared with existing methods; it requires an order of magnitude less training data and time than existing CNN model architectures, and its continuous nature generalizes better to unseen spatial frequencies, improving accuracy for unobserved parts of a wavefront. Along with our unique model, we design and implement a holographic display system, incorporating a holographic waveguide, holographic lens and micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) mirror. Our optical architecture provides a large effective étendue via steered illumination with an ultra-compact form factor and solves limitations of similar designs by removing unwanted diffraction noise and chromatic dispersion using a volume-holographic waveguide and holographic lens, respectively. Our architecture is inspired by synthetic aperture imaging38, where a large synthetic aperture is formed by digitally interfering multiple smaller, mutually coherent apertures. Our goal is to form a large display eyebox—the synthetic aperture built up from multiple scanned and mutually incoherent apertures, each limited in size by the instantaneous étendue of the system. This idea is inspired by classic synthetic aperture holography39, but we adapt this idea to modern waveguide holography systems driven by AI algorithms.

After a wave propagation model is trained in a one-time preprocessing stage, a CGH algorithm converts the target content into one or multiple phase patterns that are displayed on the SLM. Large-étendue settings require the target content to contain perceptually important visual cues that change with the pupil position, including parallax and occlusion. Traditional 3D content representations used for CGH algorithms, such as point clouds, multilayer images, polygons or Gaussians40,41,42, however, are inadequate for this purpose. Light field representations, or holographic stereograms43,44, meanwhile, contain the desired characteristics. Motivated by this insight, we develop a light-field-based CGH framework that uniquely models our setting where a large synthetic aperture is composed of a set of smaller, mutually incoherent apertures that are, however, partially coherent within themselves. Our approach uniquely enables seamless, full-resolution holographic light field rendering for steered-illumination-type holographic displays.

In summary, we present synthetic aperture waveguide holography as a system that combines a new and compact large-étendue waveguide architecture with AI-driven holographic algorithms. Through our prototypes, we demonstrate high 3D image quality within a 3D eyebox that is two orders of magnitude larger, marking a pivotal milestone towards practical holographic near-eye display systems.

Our architecture is designed to produce high-quality full-colour 3D images with large étendue in a compact device form factor to support synthetic aperture holography based on steered waveguide illumination, as shown in Fig. 1. Our waveguide can effectively increase the size of the beam without scrambling the wavefront, unlike diffusers or lens arrays27,45. Moreover, it allows a minimum footprint for beam steering using a MEMS mirror at the input side. For these reasons, waveguide-based steered illumination has been suggested for holographic displays19,46. Existing architectures, however, suffer from two problems: world-side light leakage from the waveguide and chromatic dispersion of the eyepiece lens. Here, we overcome conventional limitations with two state-of-the-art optical components to overcome conventional limitations: the angle-encoded holographic waveguide and the apochromatic holographic eyepiece lens.

a, An illustration of the synthetic aperture waveguide holography principle. The illumination module consists of a collimated fibre-coupled laser, a MEMS mirror that steers the input light angle, and a holographic waveguide. Together, these components serve as a partially coherent backlight of the SLM. The SLM is synchronized with the MEMS mirror and creates a holographic light field, which is focused towards the user's eye using an eyepiece lens. Our design achieves an ultra-thin form factor as it consists only of flat optical elements and it does not require optical path length to form an image. The steered illumination mechanism produces a synthetic aperture, which supports a two-orders-of-magnitude larger étendue than that intrinsic to the SLM. Our angle-encoded holographic waveguide and apochromatic holographic lens design solve bidirectional diffraction noise and chromatic dispersion issues, respectively. b, An exploded view of the schematic image and captured photos of the holographic MR display prototype. The use of thin holographic optics achieves a total optical stack thickness of less than 3 mm (panel to lens). Top- and side-view photographs of the prototype are shown.

Our holographic waveguide shares many characteristics with conventional surface relief grating (SRG)-type waveguides. Specifically, our design uses a similar pupil replication principle and layout, which consists of an in-coupler, an exit-pupil expanding grating and an out-coupler grating. By contrast, our couplers are constructed of uniquely designed volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) instead of SRGs. SRGs used in conventional waveguides47 have a degeneracy that supports multiple modes of diffraction. This causes a light leakage issue as the light is out-coupled bidirectionally, to both the world side and viewer's eye side. When the waveguide is used for illumination, the leakage enters the eyepiece without being modulated by the SLM, resulting in d.c. noise throughout the entire field of view. This d.c. noise significantly degrades the contrast of the displayed image19, and it is challenging to filter out this noise as it shares the optical path with the signal. On the contrary, VBGs exhibit a type of diffraction known as Bragg diffraction48,49, where only light that satisfies a specific incident angle and a narrow spectral bandwidth is diffracted to a single diffraction order with high efficiency. This single-direction diffraction greatly suppresses stray light and ghost images compared with conventional waveguides. In addition, we use the angle-encoded multiplexing method to cover the larger steering angle, where each grating supports only a portion of the target angular bandwidth with a specific narrow band wavelength with high efficiency. The multiplexing is performed by overlapping volume gratings with the same surface pitch but with different slant angles (see Supplementary Note 1 for additional details). This allows us to collectively cover the target angular bandwidth with high efficiency, while supporting three wavelengths of red (638 nm), green (520 nm) and blue (460 nm) without crosstalk.

Our display architecture achieves an ultra-thin form factor of only 3 mm thickness from the SLM to the eyepiece lens, including a 0.6-mm waveguide and 2-mm holographic lens. The MEMS mirror in our display steers the illumination angles incident on our SLM, which creates a synthetic aperture (that is, eyebox) of size 9 × 8 mm2, supporting an eyebox volume that is two orders of magnitude larger than that intrinsic to the SLM. The diagonal field of view of our display is 38° (34.2° horizontal and 20.2° vertical). An in-depth discussion of the full system and additional components is found in the Methods and Supplementary Note 1.

Our synthetic aperture waveguide holographic display is partially coherent because its synthetic aperture consists of a scanned set of mutually incoherent apertures. In addition, the instantaneous eyebox exhibits partial coherence due to factors such as millimetre-scale optical path length differences generated by the pupil replication process in the waveguide, mode instability of diode lasers and imperfect polarization management. Neither existing AI-based wave propagation models for coherent wavefronts21,33,34 nor recent waveguide propagation models20 are sufficient in adequately describing the complex behaviour of partially coherent light50,51. In this section, we first develop a partially coherent waveguide model to accurately characterize physical optical systems based on implicit neural representations52. Then, we adapt this model to our synthetic aperture waveguide holography setting. Our model can be trained automatically using camera feedback, it generalizes well to unseen spatial frequencies and it is used to produce the high-quality experimental results demonstrated in later sections.

A partially coherent wavefront can be represented by its MI or its Fourier transform—the Wigner distribution function53,54. With our waveguide model, we aim to model the MI of the waveguide, \(J\left({{\bf{r}}}_{1},{{\bf{r}}}_{2}\right)\), where r1 and r2 are spatial coordinates on the SLM plane. This MI depends on the steered illumination angle, so it needs to be characterized for each of them separately. Representing such a high-resolution, four-dimensional function for many apertures within the synthetic aperture, however, is computationally intractable. Consider a discretized MI for 1,920 × 1,080 spatial SLM coordinates for each of 10 × 10 steering angles—the corresponding ensemble of MIs would require more than 100 terabytes of memory to be stored. Moreover, it is unclear how to smoothly interpolate these MIs between aperture positions as they are characterized at discrete positions.

To address these challenges, we introduce a low-rank implicit neural representation for the ensemble of steering-angle-dependent MIs of the waveguide. Specifically, for each steering angle um, m = 1, …, M, the MI is approximated by K coherent spatial modes that are incoherently summed55 as \(J({{\bf{r}}}_{1},{{\bf{r}}}_{2},{\bf{u}})\approx \mathop{\sum }\nolimits_{k = 1}^{K}{f}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{\;k}({{\bf{r}}}_{1},{\bf{u}}){f}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{\;k}{({{\bf{r}}}_{2},{\bf{u}})}^{{\rm{H}}}\), where \({f}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{\;k}({{\bf{r}}}_{1},{\bf{u}})\) is a single coherent mode at spatial frequency u, k = 1, …, K indicates the mode index and H denotes the Hermitian transpose. Note that coherent waveguide models are a special case of this partially coherent model, namely, those of rank 1. This low-rank MI representation is inspired by coherence retrieval methods31. Rather than representing the ensemble of low-rank MIs explicitly, however, we introduce a novel waveguide representation based on emerging neural implicit representations37. This neural-network-parameterized representation is more memory efficient than a discretized representation and it is continuous, so it can be queried at any spatial or spatial frequency (that is, aperture) coordinate. Specifically, our implicit neural representation is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network architecture, \({f}_{{\rm{WG}}}\left({\bf{r}},{\bf{u}};{\varPsi} \right):{{\mathbb{R}}}^{4}\to {{\mathbb{C}}}^{K}\), that represents the MI ensemble of the waveguide using network parameters Ψ. Once trained, the MLP can be queried with the input of spatial (r) and frequency (u) coordinates and it outputs the K modes of the corresponding MI. The primary benefits of this implicit neural representation over a conventional discrete representation are its memory efficiency (a few tens of megabytes versus terabytes) and, as we demonstrate in the following experiments, the fact that our representation generalizes better to aperture positions that were not part of the training data. Remarkably, even in a low-étendue setting, our implicit model achieves faster convergence and better accuracy than state-of-the-art CNN-based models based on explicit representations (Fig. 2d), so the implicit model can serve as a drop-in replacement for existing holographic displays. In a large-étendue setting, our implicit neural model is the only one achieving high-quality results.

a, Using our prototype, we capture training and validation datasets consisting of sets of an SLM phase pattern as well as the corresponding aperture position and intensity image. The aperture positions are uniformly distributed across the synthetic aperture, enabling model training with large étendue. b, The captured dataset is used to train our implicit neural waveguide model. The parameters of our model are learned using backpropagation (dashed grey line) to predict the experimentally captured intensity images. c, A visualization of two waveguide modes of the trained model, including amplitude and phase, at two different aperture positions. Our model faithfully reconstructs the wavefront emerging out of the waveguide, exhibiting the patch-wise wavefront shapes expected from its pupil-replicating nature. d, Evaluation of wave propagation models with varying training dataset sizes for a single aperture (that is, low-étendue setting). Our model achieves a better quality using a dataset size that is one magnitude lower than state-of-the-art models34. e, Experimentally captured image quality for different wave propagation models in the low-étendue setting. Our model outperforms the baselines, including the ASM60 and the time-multiplexed neural holography model (TMNH)34, by a large margin.

Our implicit waveguide models the MI of input light arriving at the SLM plane. Then, the phase of each coherent mode of the MI is modulated by the corresponding SLM phase pattern ϕm. Each of the modes continues to propagate in free space, by distance z, to the image plane in the scene. We use an off-axis angular spectrum method (ASM)35,56 to implement this free-space wave propagation operator for each coherent mode, migrating the bandwidth over a large étendue. Finally, all propagated modes are incoherently summed over the full synthetic aperture to form the desired intensity, Iz, at distance z.

where \({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z}(\cdot ;{\bf{u}})\) is the coherent wave propagation operator with propagation distance z through the aperture centred at u, and \(\left\langle \cdot \right\rangle\) is the mean operator denoting the incoherent sum of modes. As detailed in the Methods, to optimize experimental image quality, the wave propagation operator \({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z}\) also includes several learned components, including pupil aberrations and diffraction efficiency of the SLM.

Using these equations, we can map phase patterns shown on the SLM ϕm with steering angle um to the image that a user would observe. To assess our partially coherent waveguide model with respect to state-of-the-art holographic wave propagation models, we capture a dataset from our display prototype consisting of triplets, each containing an SLM phase pattern, an aperture position and the corresponding intensity at the image plane (Fig. 2a). We then train models to predict the experimentally captured intensity images, given the known input phase patterns and aperture positions.

To evaluate and compare waveguide models in a large-étendue setting, we train ours along with baseline models on a dataset captured at 72 aperture positions with our prototype. We evaluate the generalization capabilities of these models on a test set containing nine aperture positions that were not part of the training set. Quantitative results are presented in Table 1. Previously proposed explicit CNN models generalize poorly to the unseen aperture positions. Importantly, it takes more than 2 days of training for them to converge, which is somewhat impractical. Our implicit waveguide model is smaller in size and shows better generalization capabilities than explicit models, while also converging much faster. Moreover, when used in a partially coherent configuration, the accuracy of our model is drastically improved over all coherent models, as seen by the high quality achieved on both training and test sets when used with three or six modes.

Figure 2a illustrates the data collection aspect of our approach: we show a sequence of phase patterns, ϕm, on the SLM and capture corresponding intensity images, Im, with a camera focused on the image plane. The implicit neural model is trained on these data, as shown in Fig. 2b. For this purpose, we simulate the forward image formation given the phase patterns ϕm and a random set of initialized model parameters. A loss function \({\mathcal{L}}\) measures the mean-squared error between simulated and captured intensity images. The backpropagation algorithm is applied to learn all model parameters, including the partially coherent waveguide model. This model comprises a set of coherent modes \({f}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{\;k}\), each being a complex-valued image on the SLM plane with amplitude and phase, that can be queried at the spatial frequencies corresponding to the MEMS steering angles um (Fig. 2c). In a low-étendue setting, that is, when operating with a fixed steering angle um, this implicit neural model achieves a higher quality with significantly less training data compared with state-of-the-art explicit CNN models34 (Fig. 2d). Therefore, our model serves as a drop-in replacement for existing wave propagation models with strictly better performance. Even though the gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio for explicit and implicit models on the validation set at convergence is only a few decibel (Fig. 2d), the generalization capabilities of our implicit model are far superior to those of the explicit model. This is observed in Fig. 2e, where we show experimental results comparing a model-free free-space wave propagation operator35, the results achieved by the coherent explicit model34 and our partially coherent implicit model. The images used here are representative of a test set of images unseen during training and show that our model outperforms both baselines by a large margin.

The 3D eyebox describes the volume within which a hologram is visible to the observer's eye. A large eyebox is crucial for guaranteeing high image quality when the eye moves and for making any display accessible to a diverse set of users with different binocular characteristics. Figure 3a illustrates the supported eyebox volume of our system (green volume), which is two orders of magnitude larger than that intrinsic to the SLM without steered illumination (orange volume). Moreover, our CGH framework fully utilizes the bandwidth corresponding to an eyebox size of 9 × 8 mm, unlike conventional holographic displays16,44,57, which use only a small fraction of the available bandwidth supported by the SLM (red volume). Figure 3b visualizes images of the phase aberrations of the waveguide system learned by our model at various positions within the supported eyebox. These aberrations vary drastically over the eyebox, making it challenging to be learned using approximately shift-invariant CNN-based models. We further validate our model's ability to produce high-quality imagery across an extended étendue and compare its performance with that of conventional holography in Fig. 3c,d. Figure 3c shows experimentally captured light fields of a two-dimensional resolution chart image located at optical infinity over the extended eyebox in the top row, while the insets in the bottom present the results at specific positions, indicated by corresponding colours. As expected, conventional holography provides a very small eyebox, which restricts the image to be seen only from the centre position. Our approach supports a significantly larger eyebox with high uniformity for transversely shifting eye positions. Figure 3d demonstrates longitudinal eyebox expansion. Conventional holography suffers from vignetting, and naive pupil-steered holography25 does not account for the axial shift of the eye, resulting in inconsistent image overlap. In addition, variations in the waveguide output and aberrations across different steering states significantly degrade image quality, even when the issue of inconsistent image overlap is addressed, as shown in the third row of Fig. 3d. Our method generates robust, high-quality imagery as the eye moves along the optical axis. Note that the pupil position denoted with a blue marker is not used during model training, yet our model achieves comparable image quality and consistent interpolation of parameters, demonstrating its generalization capabilities.

a, Visualizations of the supported étendue (3D eyebox). Conventional holography, such as smooth phase techniques (red volume at the origin), supports only a portion of the eyebox that the SLM can produce (intrinsic étendue, orange volume). Our system supports a two-orders-of-magnitude larger eyebox than conventional holographic display systems (green volume). b, Visualization of our learned model across the expanded étendue. For better visualization and interpolation capabilities, refer to the Supplementary Video. c, Experimentally captured resolution chart images with expanded eyebox. Our system supports an eyebox size of 9 × 8 mm, which is significantly larger than the display-limited eyebox of conventional holographic displays. Using our implicit model, we can efficiently calibrate the system, achieving high image quality uniformly across the extended eyebox, as shown in the inset. d, Longitudinal eyebox expansion results. Markers show the corresponding pupil positions in the octahedron shown in a.

At runtime, a phase-retrieval-like CGH algorithm computes one or multiple phase patterns that are displayed on the SLM to create a desired intensity image, volume or light field. In the large-étendue setting, conventional 3D content representations, such as point clouds, multilayer images or polygons40,41, are infeasible because the large synthetic aperture requires view-dependent effects to be modelled. For this reason, a light field L is a natural way to represent the target content in this setting. Existing light-field-based CGH algorithms aim to minimize the error between each ray of the target light field and the hologram converted into a light field representation34,43,44, typically using variants of the short-time Fourier transform. Supervising the optimized SLM phase on light rays, however, is not physically meaningful because the notion of a ray does not exist in physical optics at the scale of the wavelength of visible light.

To address this issue, we propose a new light-field-based CGH framework. Unlike existing algorithms that rely on ray-based representations for light-field holograms or use random pupils in the Fourier domain58, we supervise our optimization reflecting the wave nature of light more accurately, by incorporating partial coherence and phase continuity at the target field. For this purpose, we formulate the physically correct partially coherent image formation of our hologram to simulate an image passing through the user's pupil, Iholo, and compare it with the corresponding image simulated incoherently from the light field, Ilf, as

where 1μ is the indicator function for a set of subapertures μ (a subaperture is a small aperture state spanning the pupil positions closest to the corresponding light field view), and U is the set of all possible subaperture combinations within our synthetic aperture. We thus aim to optimize phase patterns for any possible pupil position, diameter and shape of the user simultaneously. For this purpose, we randomly sample a batch of subaperture configurations in each iteration of our optimization routine, with the loss function \({\mathcal{L}}\) measuring the mean-squared error for each subset of the apertures within the batch (see the Methods and Supplementary Note 5 for additional details).

In Fig. 4, we show experimentally captured 3D holograms. Figure 4a shows photographs captured at various focal distances—0 D (∞ m), 1.5 D (0.67 m) and 2.5 D (0.4 m)—for two different camera positions within the eyebox (that is, shifted laterally by 4.5 mm). Moreover, we compare a conventional 3D CGH algorithm57, the state-of-the-art light-field-based CGH algorithm34, and our CGH framework for all of these settings. Our results achieve the highest quality, exhibiting the best contrast and sharpness, and they demonstrate clear 3D refocusing capabilities as well as view-dependent parallax. In Fig. 4b, we capture a scene from a single camera position and a fixed focus with a varying camera pupil diameter. As is expected, the in-focus part of the 3D scene remains sharply focused without the conventional resolution degradation while the out-of-focus blur, that is, the depth-of-field effect, gets stronger with an increasing pupil diameter. The phase SLM patterns do not need to be recomputed for varying pupil positions, diameters or shapes, as all possible configurations are intrinsically accounted for by our unique CGH framework. All diffraction orders created by the SLM are jointly optimized to reduce artefacts59.

a, Comparison of holographic rendering techniques using experimentally captured results with different focus states (far: 0 D, middle: 1.5 D, near: 2.5 D) and pupil positions. b, Experimental results with various pupil sizes demonstrate robust image quality in the focused object (left insets), with correctly represented depth of field (right insets) according to the pupil size. RGB channel images were captured separately at the same wavelength and merged to enhance the visual perception of the 3D effect and image quality (pseudo-colour).

The co-design of our synthetic aperture waveguide holography hardware and AI-based holography algorithms enables a compact full-colour 3D MR system with large étendue, demonstrating a high-quality holographic light field across a large 3D eyebox within a compact display device form factor. Partial coherence is the key to achieving the high-quality results we demonstrate with a large étendue, because it enables the creation of light-field holograms with high-rank MI, thus offering more degrees of freedom than purely coherent image formations.

Our prototype supports a 9 × 8 mm eyebox size. In Supplementary Note 8, we derive the relationship between the transverse eyebox size e, SLM size LSLM, eyepiece focal length f and the maximum steering angle θscan as

where the equality holds when the gap between the eyepiece and the SLM approaches zero (that is, zero thickness waveguide and polarizers).

Indeed, equation (6) shows that the eyebox size of our prototype approaches the theoretical upper bound we could achieve with any holographic display system, as our eyebox size is close to that of the SLM. This is particularly exciting because Fresnel holography configurations, such as ours, typically support only very small eyebox sizes.

The proposed co-design of compact large-étendue waveguide architecture and AI-driven algorithms enables compact 3D MR display modes with high image quality across a large eyebox, offering a path towards true 3D holographic MR glasses.

Our architecture is shown in Fig. 1. The total field of view of the compact prototype is 38° diagonal, with a supported eyebox size of 9 × 8 mm and an eye-relief distance range of 23–33 mm (Fig. 3). The diffraction-limited resolution of this system is 1.2 arcmin of visual angle, which is close to the human visual acuity of 20/20 vision, that is, 1 arcmin. The fibre-coupled laser is collimated using a small lens, and the MEMS mirror is tilted 45° to steer the beam directly into the waveguide.

The layout of the waveguide is similar to typical pupil-replicating waveguides47, with three diffractive elements, an in-coupler, a pupil-expansion coupler and an out-coupler. In our compact prototype, each coupler is an angle-encoded multiplexed VBG hologram to cover the target steering angle of 20°, for three wavelengths of 460 nm, 520 nm and 638 nm. The grating is optically fabricated by recording interference pattern of two laser beams on photo-refractive polymer using custom-designed prisms61. The substrate thickness is 0.6 mm, and anti-reflective coating is applied for visible light. The output light is filtered using a polarizer before illuminating the SLM. The achievable frame rates of our prototype are limited by the refresh rate of the SLM (60 Hz). Yet, it is possible to achieve the full bandwidth of the MEMS mirror (400 Hz) with the use of high-frame-rate SLMs that are commercially available62. We do not filter higher-order copies, which contribute to the images by reducing contrast (for example, in Fig. 4, the 8-mm pupil exhibits slightly lower contrast than the 2.5-mm pupil). We note that the effect of higher diffraction orders decreases as the pixel pitch size of the SLM decreases. While our SLM has an 8-μm pixel pitch, a pixel pitch below 4.8 μm can effectively separate higher diffraction orders for pupil sizes of 3 mm.

In addition to a compact prototype, we also built a benchtop prototype as a testbed for our algorithms. The main purpose of the benchtop set-up is to test our waveguide and wave propagation models. For this prototype, we use a conventional eyepiece and SRG waveguide and expand the beam path using multiple 4-f systems to ablate the effect of undiffracted light by optically separating it from the waveguide, while keeping the specifications of wavelengths, SLM, MEMS mirror and geometric parameters similar to those of the compact prototype set-up, which uses the holographic waveguide and eyepiece. We captured Figs. 1 and 2 with our compact prototype and Figs. 3 and 4 with our benchtop prototype.

In a large-étendue setting, we need to simulate a coherent wave propagation operator for a wide range of spatial frequencies. This is computationally challenging for conventional wave propagation algorithms, because a very large number of spatial positions or, similarly, spatial frequencies must be processed simultaneously. We derive a computationally efficient implementation of this wave propagation in synthetic aperture waveguide holography displays based on bandwidth migration.

The naive approach to modelling the propagation of a coherent input field fin with a steering angle um, for example, guided by steered illumination, is to apply a phase ramp function to the input as \({f}_{{\rm{in}}}{e}^{j2\uppi ({{\bf{u}}}^{m}\cdot {\bf{r}})}\). As mentioned above, however, adequately sampling this function would require a prohibitively large number of spatial frequencies to be considered. Instead, we migrate the bandwidth in the Fourier plane and use an off-axis wave propagation to sample the output field at the shifted coordinates56. This off-axis wave propagation with bandwidth migration \({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z}\) can be represented as

where x is the spatial coordinate at the propagated plane and \({{\bf{x}}}^{m}=z\tan \left(\arcsin \left(\lambda {{\bf{u}}}^{m}\right)\right)\) is the shift in the spatial domain during the propagation. Note that this calculation can be performed at the same cost as the original wave propagation, without steering. The inverse Fourier transform along the shifted frequency coordinate does not affect the incoherent sum of each propagate mode, while avoiding aliasing in the transfer function \({{\mathcal{H}}}_{z}({\bf{u}}) {e}^{i{{\bf{x}}}^{m}\cdot {\bf{u}}}\) (see Supplementary Note 4 for details).

In our implementation of equations (1) and (7), we additionally parameterize and learn non-idealities of the physical optical setup, including nonlinear voltage-to-phase mapping and imperfect diffraction efficiency of the SLM. Thus, in our partially coherent propagation model, each coherent mode is propagated to the target plane at z as

where k and m are the index for coherent modes and the synthetic aperture, respectively, \({f}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{\;k}\left(\cdot \right),{c}_{{\rm{WG}}}^{k}\left(\cdot \right)\) are the kth mode of the waveguide output and the corresponding undiffracted component from the SLM, \({\phi }_{{\rm{SLM}}}(\cdot ;m)={\rm{LUT}}\left({\phi }^{m}\right)\) is the nonlinear phase response of the SLM represented as a small MLP33, and \({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z,{\mathcal{A}}}\) is propagation operator with learned aberrations \({\mathcal{A}}\): \({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z,{\mathcal{A}}}(\;f\;)={{\mathcal{F}}}^{-1}\left({\mathcal{F}}({{\mathcal{P}}}_{z}(\;f\;))\times {e}^{i{\mathcal{A}}}\right)\). These modes are added up incoherently and, optionally, an incoherent term to model additional stray light can be added as a separate mode. We note that modelling high diffraction orders and off-axis propagation are essential to capturing the accurate physics of this wave propagation, as presented in Table 1.

The waveguide output can be understood as an ensemble of beam patches shaped by multiple total internal reflections and interactions with the gratings. These interactions are governed by the diffraction efficiency of the gratings, which varies spatially owing to non-uniformities, such as fabrication-induced defects, and angularly in response to changing input angles. In addition, propagation within the waveguide necessitates bandwidth migration, as described in equation (7), which reveals predictable wavefront shifts with varying input angles. This understanding motivates our use of a learned coordinate mapping (coordinate transform MLP) that flexibly learns these shifts with angle changes, enabling scalable modelling over a large étendue.

Our model is general enough to model steered or non-steered illumination through a waveguide or for a free-space optical set-up. In all cases, we first input the spatial coordinates and steered angles into a coordinate transformation MLP with three layers, 32 features and rectified linear unit nonlinearity. This MLP outputs transformed spatial coordinates, which are then passed through a hyperbolic tangent layer to ensure a valid range. Finally, these transformed coordinates are used to query features using multi-resolution hash encoding37. The features from the hash table are subsequently fed into the main waveguide MLP with 3 layers, 64 features and rectified linear unit nonlinearity, as illustrated in Fig. 2a, and outputs K complex field values at given spatial coordinates. We use K = 4 for the benchtop set-up and K = 16 for the thin benchtop set-up. As discussed in the primary text, this model significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be optimized and, thus, provides a much more compact representation that can be optimized faster and with less training data than comparable explicit CNN-based models. Moreover, this model is continuous and naturally interpolates the low-rank MI it represents to any spatial frequency on the synthetic aperture.

We note that implicit neural representations offer a flexible design trade-off for modelling large-étendue optical systems, as memory scales with signal complexity rather than resolution. These representations have been shown to efficiently recover 3D refractive index maps and volumetric fluorescence images, outperforming classical methods in optical microscopy63,64. Unlike these approaches, which map 3D coordinates to a refractive index or image volume, our model maps 4D spatio-angular coordinates to the complex-valued wavefront or pupil aberrations, making it well suited for modelling large-étendue optical systems.

Why education is linked to higher cognitive function in aging is fiercely debated. Leading theories propose that education reduces brain decline in aging and enhances tolerance to brain pathology or that it does not affect cognitive decline but, rather, reflects higher early-life cognitive function. To test these theories, we analyzed 407,356 episodic memory scores from 170,795 participants older than 50 years, alongside 15,157 brain magnetic resonance imaging scans from 6,472 participants across 33 Western countries. More education was associated with better memory, larger intracranial volume and slightly larger volume of memory-sensitive brain regions. However, education did not protect against age-related decline or weakened effects of brain decline on cognition. The most parsimonious explanation for the results is that the associations reflect factors present early in life, including propensity of individuals with certain traits to pursue more education. Although education has numerous benefits, the notion that it provides protection against cognitive or brain decline is not supported.

Systematic discovery of transcription factor (TF) landscapes in low-input samples and at single cell level is a major challenge in the fields of molecular biology, genetics, and epigenetics. Here, we present cleavage under Dynamic targets and Tagmentation (DynaTag), enabling robust mapping of TF-DNA interactions using a physiological salt solution during sample preparation. DynaTag uncovers occupancy alterations for 15 TFs in stem cell and cancer tissue models. We highlight changes in TF-DNA binding for NANOG, MYC, and OCT4, during stem-cell differentiation, at both bulk and single-cell resolutions. DynaTag surpasses CUT&RUN and ChIP-seq in signal-to-background ratio and resolution. Furthermore, using tumours of a small cell lung cancer model derived from a single female donor, DynaTag reveals increased chromatin occupancy of FOXA1, MYC, and the mutant p53 R248Q at enriched gene pathways (e.g. epithelial-mesenchymal transition), following chemotherapy treatment. Collectively, we believe that DynaTag represents a significant technological advancement, facilitating precise characterization of TF landscapes across diverse biological systems and complex models.

Dynamic transcription factor (TF) interactions with DNA are crucial for gene regulation, cellular identity, development and diseases1,2. Aberrant TF activity is a prominent characteristic of various diseases, including cancer, where TFs often act as oncogenes or lose their native tumour-suppressive functions3,4. Mapping the genomic occupancy of TFs is therefore essential for elucidating gene regulatory networks, identifying molecular vulnerabilities and potential therapeutic targets. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) has long been the gold standard for mapping protein–DNA interactions5. However, this method requires substantial input material for TFs, making it incompatible with single-cell applications. Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) has emerged as an alternative approach, allowing for in situ profiling of chromatin interactions—including those involving TFs—with lower input requirements6,7,8. Despite this technical advancement, CUT&RUN requires extensive ligation-based library preparation and, to date, has not been applied to TFs at single-cell resolution9. Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation (CUT&Tag) employs protein A fused to the transposase Tn5 (pA-Tn5) as a probe to directly insert sequencing adaptors into DNA at the target sites. CUT&Tag enables robust mapping of histone–DNA interactions in situ within nuclei, in small samples, with single-cell and spatial resolution10,11. However, employing CUT&Tag to map dynamic, low-affinity target–DNA interactions12,13, such as those involving TFs, remains challenging, primarily due to difficulties in retaining these interactions during sample preparation. More recently, alternative tagmentation-based techniques, such as ACT-seq, CoBATCH14, nano-CUT&Tag15 and ChIL-seq16 have emerged. Nevertheless, these technologies require the use of non-physiological, high-salt concentrations to suppress untargeted, false-positive tagmentation events. Importantly, TF–DNA interactions are sensitive to these stringent conditions, causing their dissociation from chromatin and incompatibility with these tagmentation-based technologies. To overcome these limitations, we present cleavage of Dynamic targets and Tagmentation (DynaTag), an adaptation of CUT&Tag. In contrast to CUT&Tag and related modifications10,14,15,16,17,18, DynaTag utilises a physiological intracellular salt solution19 throughout all nuclei handling steps to retain specific interactions while suppressing non-specific protein–DNA interactions. We extensively validate DynaTag for specificity and demonstrate its utility for studying TF occupancy and their dynamics at single-cell resolution and in bulk, with limited sample sizes, using models highly relevant to stem cell biology and cancer research.

We rationalised that physiological intracellular salt conditions are required to preserve TF–DNA interactions in situ, as supported by our previous studies using an intracellular salt buffer to maintain the correct topology of dynamic nucleic acid structures inside living cells19. For this reason, we generated the DynaTag physiological salt buffer containing 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl2. This cation buffer composition is based on electrophysiological salt concentration measurements in situ20 and thereby ensures the retainment of specific TF–DNA interactions during sample preparation (Fig. 1A). To first validate DynaTag alongside CUT&Tag, we profiled TFs and histone modifications involved in pluripotency and differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We included targets (CTCF, H3K4me3, and H3K27me3) that can be efficiently mapped by CUT&Tag due to their high DNA affinity and resistance to high-salt conditions during nuclei sample handling10. In addition, we included OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and MYC, TFs associated with ESC identity, as well as YAP1. Only DynaTag but not CUT&Tag successfully generated sequencing libraries for all TFs (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Importantly, negative controls (using no primary but only secondary antibodies and pA-Tn5) from both techniques did not result in libraries. To better investigate which component of the DynaTag buffer was crucial for retaining specific TF–DNA interactions, we performed a systematic comparison of the DynaTag physiological salt buffer with other buffers used in CUT&Tag-adapted protocols. We utilised the nuclei washing procedure described in ACT-seq17, CoBATCH14, and G-quadruplex CUT&Tag18. Our results show that the wash buffers used in ACT-seq and CoBATCH caused a dramatic loss in library yield and led to untargeted Tn5 tagmentation in ACT-seq IgG control libraries (Supplementary Fig. 1B, C). Similarly, the use of reduced NaCl concentrations (121 or 150 mM) in the CUT&Tag wash buffer also led to untargeted tagmentation in the IgG controls (Supplementary Fig. 1D, E). Moreover, we showed that the 300 mM KCl buffer used in G-quadruplex CUT&Tag was responsible for failed library generation for all five tested TFs (Supplementary Fig. 1F). Consistent with this result, increasing the KCl concentration from 110 to 300 mM in the DynaTag buffer also abolished library generation (Supplementary Fig. 1G). To further exclude the occurrence of untargeted tagmentation, we performed DynaTag in the presence or absence of MgCl2 in the wash buffer, in both fixed and native nuclei. Our results showed that neither the absence of MgCl2 nor the fixation status affected library yields for any of the tested TFs or the IgG controls (Supplementary Fig. 1H–J).

A Schematic illustration showing that only DynaTag captures TF interactions by using physiological salt concentrations (110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) during nuclei wash steps. In contrast, the use of 150 mM NaCl or 300 mM NaCl or KCl lead to untargeted tagmentation or allows only for the targeting of histone marks, respectively. Created in BioRender. Hänsel–Hertsch, R.

Omni-ATAC-seq uses Tn5 to map accessible chromatin by untargeted tagmentation21. We anticipated that replacing the Omni-ATAC-seq tagmentation buffer with the DynaTag buffer would eliminate library formation. We performed the Omni-ATAC-seq protocol in the absence of MgCl2 or using buffers containing the same excess of pA-Tn5 but with either 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM NaCl, or the DynaTag buffer. Our results showed that only 150 mM NaCl generated libraries, suggesting untargeted tagmentation. In contrast, 300 mM NaCl or the DynaTag buffer did not produce any libraries (Supplementary Fig. 1K), implying a lack of untargeted tagmentation. Next, we assessed the quality of the DynaTag data, including reproducibility, peak quality and potential cell-cycle contributions. For this purpose, we stained the nuclei with DAPI post-tagmentation and sorted 10,000 nuclei in replicates, according to their cell-cycle state into G0/G1, S and G2/M phases. Genome-wide read distributions correlated well among the replicates (Fig. 1B) with excellent fraction of reads in peaks (FRiP) scores for all five TFs across the cell-cycle states (Fig. 1C). Of note, both DynaTag and CUT&Tag showed high similarity and high peak quality for CTCF and the histone marks when assessing genome-wide correlations and the FRiP scores (Supplementary Fig. 1L, M).

To identify peaks with unique or shared co-occupancy patterns, we systematically performed differential occupancy analysis (DOA) of the TFs (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, YAP1) profiled in ESCs using DynaTag. Additionally, we examined whether the DynaTag peaks were located in accessible chromatin regions of ESCs, as determined by ATAC-seq. A genome browser snapshot illustrates two representative genes (Fig. 1D). The two highlighted genomic regions exhibited distinct occupancy patterns among the five TFs. In the left highlighted genomic region, which lies within the gene body of Kdm3b, all TFs except MYC showed clear occupancy signals. In contrast, the right highlighted region—located at the promoter of Egr1—displayed predominant occupancy by MYC (Fig. 1D). This specific snapshot demonstrated that TFs can independently occupy certain accessible genomic regions (Fig. 1D).

Overall, DOA identified six different sets of peaks exhibiting differential occupancies among the five TFs (Fig. 1E). For instance, MYC, YAP1, and OCT4 predominantly occupied specific genomic regions (OSNYM, OSNYM, OSNYM), whereas other TFs showed significantly lower occupancy at these sites (FDR < 0.05, log2FC > 0.6); (Fig. 1E). In contrast, OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG co-occupied the same regions (OSNYM, OSNYM, OSNYM), either together with MYC or YAP1 or in the absence of MYC, YAP1, and OCT4 (Fig. 1E). These occupancy trends indicate specific regulatory programmes in which YAP1 and MYC act mutually exclusive together with OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in ESCs, further underlining the specificity of DynaTag.

Analysis of DynaTag peaks from all five TFs at transcription start sites (TSS) of ChIP-seq derived target genes from ChIP-Atlas22, revealed a remarkable coverage at the expected target genes for each TF (Supplementary Fig. 2). To compare the quality of DynaTag data with existing technologies used to map TFs in murine ESCs, we analysed matched publicly available datasets (OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2) generated by ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN. DynaTag displayed superior enrichment (signal-to-background) and resolution (sharper signal) of binding of all TFs at the TSS of the ChIP-seq derived target genes (Fig. 1F). Systematic analyses of known TF binding motifs in the DynaTag, ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN peak sets revealed that the expected motifs were among the top 10 enriched motifs (highlighted in red). Enrichment of expected motifs in DynaTag peaks was notably higher compared to matched CUT&RUN peaks (Fig. 1F), indicating superior specificity of DynaTag over CUT&RUN. Taken together, these results suggest that, in contrast to CUT&Tag and its modified protocols, DynaTag robustly maps TF–DNA interactions with high reproducibility across different cell cycle states and with excellent signal-to-background ratios. Importantly, the physiological K+ concentration (110 mM KCl) in the DynaTag buffer is crucial to maintain the TF–DNA interactions during nuclei sample preparation, while preventing background signal from untargeted tagmentation. In comparison to CUT&RUN, DynaTag data showed superior resolution and specificity in uncovering the expected occupancy landscapes of all TF targets.

To assess the ability of DynaTag to capture known TF alterations23,24, we differentiated ESCs into epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) and compared the occupancy of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and YAP1 in both cell states. First, we determined the FRiP scores for each cell state, which were found to be equally good for all TFs and comparable between ESCs and EpiLCs (Supplementary Fig. 3A).

DOA of matched TF DynaTag datasets for each cell-cycle state (G0/G1, S, and G2/M) revealed a consistent and substantial decrease in NANOG occupancy across all cell cycle phases. For example, we found on average 15,681 peaks (1807 stdev., log2FC > 0.5, FDR < 0.05) that were significantly higher in read coverage in ESCs, while only 8869 peaks (2210 stdev., log2FC < −0.5, FDR < 0.05) showed a significantly higher read coverage in EpiLCs (Fig. 2A–C). In contrast to NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 showed a similar number of regions with increased and decreased occupancy changes, while MYC and YAP1 exhibited an overall increase in occupancy in EpiLCs compared to ESCs (Fig. 2A–C). In line with our previous analysis showing specific TF co-occupancy behaviours in ESCs (Fig. 1D, E), we next investigated whether these behaviours could be quantitatively assessed between ESC and EpiLC states. We found that independent of increase or decrease of occupancy for any of the OSN (OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG) factors (Fig. 1E), the other TFs (O or S or N) showed a similar behaviour in co-occupancy (Fig. 2D). For example, for DynaTag peaks that showed a decrease in SOX2 occupancy in EpiLC vs ESC states (ESC > EpiLC), OCT4 and NANOG also displayed a decrease in occupancy in the same DNA regions, thus suggesting co-occupancy (Fig. 2D). In contrast, YAP1 and MYC exhibited distinct occupancy patterns without co-occupancy by the other TFs (Fig. 2D).

N = 1. F Normalised enrichment scores (NES) derived from GSEA of RNA-seq data of ESC and EpiLC. G Prediction of TF footprints by TOBIAS based on ATAC-seq data in ESC and EpiLC. P values were computed using the TOBIAS BINDetect module51.

To independently validate the DOA results, we assessed the protein levels of these TFs in the chromatin-bound fraction of ESCs and EpiLCs by western blot analysis (Fig. 2E) and performed gene set enrichment analysis derived from RNA-seq data (Fig. 2F). These two independent assessments confirmed decreased and increased occupancies of NANOG and MYC, respectively, while confirming similar trends of OCT4 and SOX2 in EpiLC versus ESC states. Our findings of increased YAP1 occupancy in EpiLCs compared to ESCs are in line with a previous report demonstrating that YAP1 overexpression in ESCs promotes EpiLC formation25.

Next, we aimed to investigate whether ATAC-seq TF footprint analysis would be sufficient to predict the altered TF activities between ESC and EpiLC states revealed by DynaTag (Fig. 2A–C). However, these predictions failed to accurately capture changes in TF occupancy (Fig. 2G). Finally, we retrieved ChIP-seq-derived peaks22 for NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 from ESC and EpiLC states, and repeated DOA with the DynaTag libraries using these ChIP peaks. These results revealed similar trends as observed for the DynaTag peaks, thus further validating previous DynaTag observations (Supplementary Fig. 3B–D). Collectively, these findings underscore the capability of DynaTag to robustly map TF dynamics in distinct cell states. Of note, TF footprint prediction is not robust enough to predict TF occupancy; instead, direct mapping using DynaTag of TF–DNA interactions is necessary to accurately delineate TF activities and their roles in gene regulation.

CUT&Tag can robustly profile histone modifications at single-cell resolution11, providing tagmentation-based methods the unique ability to characterise complex samples and multicellular organisms. To robustly map TFs at the single-cell level, we established single-nuclei DynaTag (snDynaTag) and targeted NANOG, MYC, and OCT4 TFs in ESCs and EpiLCs. Genome browser examples show that the merged coverage (aggregated coverage) from single-nuclei profiles per TF and condition (ESC or EpiLC) aligns well with the respective bulk DynaTag profiles (Fig. 3A). The bottom row of the genome browser snapshots displays peaks where a clear change in occupancy occurred for the TFs, i.e., NANOG shows a loss of occupancy at particular peaks in the EpiLC state that are clearly visible in the ESC state. In contrast, the bottom examples for MYC and OCT4 show a clear gain of occupancy in the EpiLC compared to the ESC state. Importantly, FRiP scores and genome-wide correlation with the respective bulk data sets indicate that snDynaTag shows similar quality to and correlates well with the bulk DynaTag landscapes (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 4A). To address whether snDynaTag has the potential to uncover differential occupancy of a particular TF in two closely related cell states, we derived fold changes of the genome-wide coverages of the aggregated TF snDynaTag for ESC vs EpiLCs. Coverage analyses of fold changes in the combined peaks derived from the two aggregated snDynaTag data sets revealed thousands of peaks for which the TFs displayed increased (log2FC > 0.5) or decreased (log2FC < −0.5) binding (Fig. 3C, D). In accordance with bulk NANOG and MYC DynaTag DOA trends (Fig. 2A–C), snDynaTag showed an overall loss in NANOG occupancy while an increase for MYC occupancy in the EpiLC state was observed (Fig. 3C, D). We removed nuclei with low counts (2nd percentile; Supplementary Fig. 4B) and applied a z-score normalisation approach (see 'Methods') to account for single-nucleus coverage at peaks that showed consistent changes across nuclei in the ESC versus EpiLC groups (Fig. 3E). We next investigated whether dimensionality reduction analysis of individual TF profiles from ESC and EpiLC states would reveal clusters predominantly populated by one cell type over the other. For all three TFs, we revealed distinct clusters originating from TF occupancy in ESC or EpiLCs (Fig. 3F, G). This suggests that TF snDynaTag can resolve cell-type-specific occupancy of TFs, thus demonstrating the capability to uncover alterations in TF occupancy with single-cell resolution.

To discover dynamic changes of TF–DNA interactions in a complex disease model in vivo, we investigated small cell lung cancer (SCLC). This cancer type harbours key alterations in TFs of the p53 family (e.g. TP53 and TP73)26,27,28, developmental and oncogenic TFs (e.g. NFIB and MYC)28,29,30,31, along with the expression of key SCLC subtype-defining TFs (e.g. ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and YAP1)32. Importantly, nearly all tumours respond to platinum-based therapy but then acquire chemoresistance33. For this reason, we aimed to investigate changes in TF occupancies following chemotherapy treatments in a patient-derived xenotransplantation (PDX) model for SCLC. The PDX model showed initially a good response to in vivo treatment with cisplatin and etoposide, and we subsequently analysed recurring tumours and respective control samples (n = 2 control, n = 2 chemo-treated). We employed bulk DynaTag and single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to study chemotherapy treatments in a PDX model for SCLC, which harboured mutations in TP53 and TP73, and predominant expression of ASCL1 (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. 5)26. We mapped binding and quantified increased and decreased occupancies of 11 TFs (ASCL1, FOXA1, MYC, NEUROD1, NFIB, NRF1, POU2F3, p53, P73, SP2, and YAP1) in chemotherapy-treated relative to control tumours, for which transcripts were detectable (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 5A). We identified a substantial increase in FOXA1 and MYC, and a decrease in ASCL1 and POU2F3 occupancies (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. 6). These results suggest increased FOXA1 and MYC activity in SCLC cells following chemotherapy, and a decreased number of cells driven by ASCL1 and POU2F3 activity in vivo. To determine if changes in TF occupancy are linked to functional alterations in SCLC, we integrated DynaTag data with gene pathway activity changes from matched snRNA-seq data of the same tumours (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). Functional integration revealed a significant increase in FOXA1 and MYC occupancies, as well as a significant decrease in ASCL1 and POU2F3 occupancies at the promoters of genes identified as altered in the GSEA (Fig. 4C, D and Supplementary Fig. 7). Transcriptional plasticity of key neuroendocrine TFs has recently been observed. Specifically, decreased ASCL1 along with increased MYC gene expression has been linked to a non-neuroendocrine state, thus suggesting selection of this phenotype in our PDX model29,34,35. Our results further showed significantly increased FOXA1 and MYC occupancies at genes involved in several metabolism pathways, such as fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 4C, D). Intriguingly, we also uncovered a significant increase in mutant p53 occupancy (p.R248Q variant) at promoters of genes related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Fig. 4C, D). This suggests that the p53 variant acts as a potential driver of EMT, serving as a potential chemotherapy escape mechanism in SCLC. This finding aligns with previous reports linking the p53 R248Q variant to EMT, cell locomotion and increased aggressiveness36,37. We next asked whether the occupancy pattern of p53 R248Q identified by DynaTag in SCLC would resemble that observed by ChIP-seq for the same variant in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)38. Strikingly, the DynaTag SCLC read coverage was notably enriched in peaks derived from the NSCLC p53 R248Q variant ChIP-seq data, while lacked any notable coverage in the wild type p53 peaks39 (Fig. 4E). Vice versa, the NSCLC ChIP-seq coverage of the p53 R248Q variant was notably enriched in the DynaTag-derived peaks from SCLC but not in the peaks derived from wild-type p53 ChIP-seq data (Fig. 4E). Taken together, the DynaTag p53 landscapes acquired in SCLC suggest a gain-of-function for p53  R248Q in response to chemotherapy at promoters of signature genes related EMT, thus highlighting the potential of DynaTag for uncovering in vivo significant TF alterations.

CUT&Tag and its modified versions typically employ high-salt concentrations (e.g. 150–300 mM NaCl or 300 mM KCl) to prevent untargeted tagmentation by protein A-Tn510,14,15,17,18. We reasoned that the intracellular environment, such as its ion composition and concentration, must be recapitulated during nuclei preparation steps to retain specific and prevent non-specific protein–DNA interactions. Our results show that continuously treating extracted nuclei with an intracellular-derived salt solution (DynaTag buffer) effectively suppresses untargeted tagmentation. Importantly, this post-extraction treatment also preserves specificity for both highly abundant, high-affinity binding targets (such as histone modifications) and low-abundance, low-affinity binding targets (such as TFs). We therefore conclude that conventionally used high salt concentrations reduce not only non-specific but also specific interactions, particularly for targets that are low in abundance and/or exhibit weak specific interactions with DNA. Of note, the physiological potassium concentration in the DynaTag buffer and the nuclei wash procedure were key to unlocking the robust mapping of TFs in small samples and at single-cell resolution. We emphasise that droplet-based single-cell CUT&Tag and nano-CUT&Tag rely on high-salt concentrations, which suggests that current protocols are likewise unsuitable as a robust method for mapping targets sensitive to stringent conditions. The authors themselves acknowledged that this remains a limitation requiring robust validation15. We have demonstrated here that DynaTag achieves superior data quality, occupancy resolution and signal-to-background ratio compared to ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN, as shown by comparisons of matched datasets generated from the same cellular system (Fig. 1F).

Overall, we successfully mapped 15 different TF targets in both simple cellular models and complex tissue samples, which are highly relevant for developmental biology and cancer research. Additionally, from a single PDX tumour sample, we successfully conducted 22 distinct DynaTag reactions covering 11 different TF targets, highlighting the quality, versatility and efficiency of this method. Given that many researchers currently employ the original CUT&Tag procedure, we anticipate that transitioning to DynaTag will be both time- and cost-efficient.

Quantification of transcript and protein levels supported the differential occupancy patterns observed with DynaTag. However, predicted TF activities based on ATAC-seq footprinting did not match these occupancy trends between ESCs and EpiLCs. This discrepancy reinforces the importance of validating TF activity predictions derived from ATAC-seq data. Spatially resolved ATAC-seq and CUT&Tag allow localisation of epigenetic activities at the single-cell level within their native microenvironment40,41,42. We anticipate that spatially resolved mapping of TF occupancy will become feasible by integrating DynaTag with existing spatial CUT&Tag methodologies40,43,44,45. In addition, future work on development of spatial technologies for the mapping of TF-DNA interactions may provide a useful tool to uncover biologically relevant TFs alterations in situ in complex tissues.

In the discovery phase of our study, we examined a clinically relevant model of SCLC with high translational significance. SCLC remains among the deadliest cancers, with a 5-year survival rate below 5%. Although SCLC patients initially respond exceptionally well to chemotherapy, unknown resistance mechanisms lead to relapse in the majority of cases33. A multitude of TFs have been suggested to drive oncogenesis and neuroendocrine phenotypes in SCLC, which warrants the need to uncover TF occupancies throughout the deadly course of this disease. By applying DynaTag to identify previously unknown TF activities in SCLC following chemotherapy, we discovered significantly increased promoter occupancy by the gain-of-function R248Q variant of p53. This variant exhibited enhanced activity at promoters of genes relevant to EMT that also showed higher expression in chemotherapy-treated SCLC. Importantly, our findings provide insights into the role of the frequently mutated TP53 locus in SCLC, particularly since point mutations in p53 are associated with sensitivity to chemotherapy treatment26,27 and similar gain-of-function mutations have been documented in other cancer types46,47. Additionally, DynaTag revealed significantly increased occupancy of FOXA1 and MYC at promoters of genes related to multiple differentially expressed gene sets following chemotherapy, suggesting that these TFs may be critical for the survival of chemotherapy-resistant cells. Key changes in the experimental procedure allowed the development of DynaTag to resolve TF occupancy landscapes with so far unmatched sensitivity, selectivity and signal-to-background ratios in small samples and a complex disease model. Finally, we demonstrated that single-nuclei DynaTag of TFs is feasible, enabling future studies of TFs and other chromatin-associated factors in complex tissue samples.

The patient sample S0273026 was collected under approved protocols of the institutional review board (IRB, ID: 19-1164) of the University of Cologne and provided written informed consent to share potentially identifying individual-level data, gender: female, age at the time of first diagnosis: 64 years. All animal experiments were approved and conducted according to the regulations of local animal welfare authorities of the State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection of North Rhine-Westphalia State of Nordrhein-Westfalen (LANUV, AZ: 84-02.04.2018.A002).

Murine embryonic stem cells (kindly gifted by Dr. Simon Poepsel, University of Cologne) were cultured on gelatine-coated (Sigma-Aldrich, ES-006-B) dishes in 2i/L medium: (GMEM (Gibco, 11710035), 20% foetal bovine serum (Merck, ES-009-C), 1X NEAA (Gibco, 11140-035), 1X L-Glutamine (Gibco, 35035-038), 1000 ng/mL LIF (Gibco, A35934), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985023), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, 113060039), 3 µM CHIR99021 (AXON, 1386), 1 µM PD0325901(AXON, 1408)) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and passaged every other day.

For epiblast-like cell differentiation, 200,000 ESCs were plated onto 15 μg/mL fibronectin-coated wells (Corning, 354,008) in 2i/L medium and allowed to attach overnight. The next morning, medium was changed to N2B27 medium as previously described48 (0.5× DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, 10565-018), 0.5× Neurobasal Medium (Gibco, 21103049), 1× N2 (Gibco, 17502048), 1× B27 (Gibco, 17504044), 20 ng/mL activin A (STEMCELL, 78132.1), 12 ng/mL bFGF (STEMCELL, 78134), 1% KSR (Gibco, 10828010), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985023), 0.04 ng/mL bovine serum albumin (Gibco, 15260037) for 48 h. N2B27 medium was changed after 24 h. Murine ESCs were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination with MycoSpY Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Biontex, M030-050).

For nuclei isolation, cells were incubated in NE1 buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9 (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 10 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9333), 0.5 mM Spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S0266), 0.1% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100), 20% glycerol (Carl Roth, 3783.2), 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001)) for 3 min on ice. Nuclei were fixed with 0.1% formaldehyde (Thermo Scientific, 28906) in PBS for 1 min at room temperature while gently agitated. Formaldehyde was quenched with 74 mM glycine (Sigma-Aldrich, 50046), and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 × g for 3 min at 4 °C.

Total RNA from cultured cells were extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA Kit (Macherey-Nagel, 740955.50) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA-seq libraries were generated with the QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit FWD with Unique Dual Indices for Illumina (Lexogen, 115.384) and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (100 cycles) (Illumina, 20028401). All RNA-seq experiments were conducted in four independent technical replicates.

Total RNA from SCLC PDX tumours was extracted analogously to in vitro cultured cells. For cDNA synthesis, 1000 ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, 4368814). Quantitative PCR was performed using pre-designed primers from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) on a Bio-Rad CFX Opus Real-Time PCR platform. No template controls served as background estimation. Data are shown as log10-transformed 2−ΔCt values from two replicates.

Following previously described approaches26,49, patient-derived tumour cells were isolated from the blood as circulating tumour cells and subcutaneously engrafted onto immunocompromised female (7–14 weeks) NOD scid gamma (NSG™) mice to establish a xenotransplant tumour model for patient S02730 (female, age at first diagnosis: 64 years). Following in vivo tumour growth and several passages in NSG female mice (7–14 weeks), tumour tissues were dissociated to single cell suspensions, and 1 × 106 cells were subcutaneously engrafted into both flanks of 7–14 weeks old NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) female mice. At a tumour volume of 100–200 mm3, mice were randomised into control and chemotherapy cohorts; n = 2 mice for each condition. Chemotherapy was applied intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg cisplatin (day 1 and 8) and 10 mg/kg etoposide (days 1–3 and 8–10). Control animals received PBS as a vehicle control. Tumours were harvested at a maximum volume of 1500 mm3, as permitted by the animal welfare authorities. Animals were hosted in a pathogen-free facility on a 12 h light/dark cycle at uniform temperature and humidity.

For nuclei isolation from frozen tissue, samples were briefly thawed on ice and minced on ice with a scalpel. Minced tissues were transferred into gentleMACS M Tubes (Miltenyi, 130-093-236) and 3 mL L1 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 5 mM CaCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich, C5670), 3 mM Magnesium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, M2545), 2 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 0.5 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, 3777), 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001), 1 mM DTT (Fisher Scientific, R0861), 0.1 mM PMSF (Sigma-Aldrich, 93482)) were added. Nuclei were isolated by running the ‘Protein-M-Tube-1.0' programme. Three milliliters L2 (L1 with 0.4 % TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100) were added, and suspension was filtered through a 40 µm cell strainer (Sarstedt, 83.3945.40). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C with breaks at ~30%. Nuclei were resuspended in 1 mL L3 (L1 with 0.2% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100)) and 3 mL sucrose buffer (1 M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S7903), 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0(Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 3 mM Magnesium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, M2545)) were underlaid using a 5 mL syringe. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C with breaks at ~30%. Supernatant was carefully removed without agitating the layers, and nuclei were resuspended in the appropriate buffer for downstream application. For single-nuclei RNA-seq, all buffers were supplemented with 120 U/mL murine RNase inhibitor (NEB, M0314L).

For single-nucleus RNA-seq, nuclei were isolated as described in the general methods. After isolation, nuclei were counted with trypan blue and fixed using the Evercode Nuclei Fixation v2 Kit (Parse Bioscience, ECF2003) and stored at −80 °C until library preparation. Library preparation of fixed nuclei was performed with the Evercode WT Kit (Parse Bioscience, ECW02130) according to the manufactures' protocol. Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (200 cycles) (Illumina, 20028401) with 5% PhiX Control V3 (Illumina, FC-110-3001). Sequencing fastq files were demultiplexed into single-nucleus data using the Split Pipe pipeline off Parse Bioscience (v1.0.6). Single-nucleus RNA-seq data were analysed in R using the Seurat (v 5.0.1) package. First, all four samples were pre-processed separately to perform quality control, which included filtering data for low-quality cells by removing the upper and lower 2% of the nuclei-based transcript coverage. Subsequently, data was further normalised using the sctransform (v 0.4.1) package to prepare samples for integration. All four samples were then read into R in parallel and merged into one SeuratObject, the features were reduced to the union, and variable features were identified. Upon dimensionality reduction via PCA, neighbours and clusters were identified and plotted into UMAP. Cell types were assigned to clusters manually based on the expression of lineage-specific marker genes. To exclude non-malignant tumour microenvironment cells, the SeuratObject was subsetted to the small cell lung cancer clusters. The expression of the eleven TFs was plotted as FeaturePlot into UMAP. For differential expression analysis, the count data were aggregated into pseudobulk counts per sample and a combined transcripts-by-sample count matrix was generated. The combined count matrix was filtered for transcripts of a rowSums <10. DESeq2 was run with standard parameters and the control samples as reference. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified (log2FoldChange > 0.5 or <−0.5 and padj < 0.1).

A slightly more relaxed adjusted p value of 0.1 was chosen as the single-nucleus RNA-seq was only performed in duplicates and therefore offers limited statistical power. For gene set enrichment analysis, the transcripts were pre-ranked by multiplying the log2foldchange by the −log10 of the adjusted p-value and assigning the sign of the log2foldchange to the value to capture the magnitude and significance of the differential expression. GSEA was run using the local GSEA software (v4.3.3). The normalised enrichment score of significantly enriched pathways (NOM p val < 0.05) was plotted using ggplot2.

Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions was performed as previously described in ref. 50. Briefly, cells were first lysed in E1 buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5 (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 140 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 10% glycerol (Carl Roth, 3783.2), 0.5% NP-40 alternative (Sigma-Aldrich, 492016), 0.25% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100), 1 mM DTT (Fisher Scientific, R0861), 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001)) to isolate the cytoplasmatic fraction. Subsequently, soluble nuclear proteins were extracted in E2 buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 (Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 200 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 0.5 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich, 3777), 1 x Complete Proteinase Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001)). Chromatin-bound proteins were isolated by incubation with ~500 U Benzonase (Sigma Aldrich, E1014) for 20 min at room temperature in E3 buffer (500 mM Tris pH 6.8 (Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 500 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001)). To increase the isolation efficiency of chromatin-bound proteins, chromatin was sonicated for five cycles (30 s ON, 30 s OFF) on a high setting of a Diagenode Bioruptor plus before Benzonase digest. Debris from all fractions was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. Protein concentration was assessed with the Qubit Protein Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q33211). 10–20 µg of protein was separated in Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels (Bio-Rad, 4561086) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, 1704270). Total proteins were visualised by Ponceau S (Carl Roth, 5938.1) and served as a loading control. After blocking the membrane in 5% milk in TBS-T (20 mM Tris pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), membranes were incubated 1:1000 diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The next day, membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with 1:2500 diluted anti-rabbit-HRP secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 32460) and visualised with Clarity Max Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705062). All images were acquired on the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System.

ATAC-seq experiments were performed as previously described in ref. 21. Briefly, 50,000 isolated nuclei were tagmented with 2.5 µL TDE1 enzyme (Illumina, 15027865) for 30 min at 37 °C. Upon completion of tagmentation, enzymatic reactions were immediately stopped by adding 3 volumes of ERC binging buffer from the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, 28204). Purified DNA was dual-indexed and amplified with Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, FC-131-2001). Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 1000 platform using NextSeq P2 Reagent Kit (100 cycles) (Illumina, 20044468) with 2% PhiX Control V3 (Illumina, FC-110-3001). All ATAC-seq experiments were performed in three to four independent replicates.

TOBIAS51 was used to identify TF footprints in ATAC-seq data. We investigated TF footprints in the consensus peak regions of ESC and EpiLC in their respective BAM files. The analysis was performed as described for TOBIAS. TF footprints for all vertebrates were downloaded from (https://jaspar.genereg.net).

Protein A-Tn5 was expressed and purified as previously described10. Briefly, T7 Express lysY/Iq competent E.coli (NEB, C3013I) were transformed with the pTXB1-pA-Tn5 (Addgene, 124601) and cultured in LB Broth (Sigma, L3022) with 100 µg/mL ampicillin (Thermo Scientific Chemicals, J60977.14) for 4 h at 37 °C prior to inoculation of additional 1970 mL LB broth supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin for expression. The 2 L culture was incubated at 37 °C until OD600 reached 0.5–0.7 and was then cooled to 4 °C for 1 h. Expression was induced by adding 0.25 mM IPTG (Thermo Scientific, R0393) overnight at 18 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 9500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and stored at −80 °C until purification. Bacteria were lysed in HEGX buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (KOH) (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 1 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 1 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 10% glycerol (Carl Roth, 3783.2), 0.2% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100)) supplemented with 1× Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche, 11836170001) using a Sonicator (BIOBLOCK SCIENTIFIC, Vibra-Cell 75043) for 10 cycles (45 s on/15 s off) with 50% amplitude on ice. Lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. In the meantime, 2.5 mL chitin resin (NEB, S6651S) was packed into Econo-Pac Chromatography Column (BIO-RAD, 732-1010) and washed with 20 mL HEGX buffer. The washed chitin resin was incubated overnight at 4 °C on a roller with the cleared lysate to bind protein A-Tn5. The next day, the resin was washed twice with 20 mL HEGX buffer. Protein A-Tn5 was eluted by adding 6 mL HEGX buffer supplemented with 100 mM DTT (Fisher Scientific, R0861) for 48 h at 4 °C on a roller. Eluate was dialysed against 4 L of 2x Tn5 dialysis buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH 7.2 (KOH) (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 0.2 M NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 0.2 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 1.7 mM DTT (Fisher Scientific, R0861), 0.2% TritonX-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, X100), 20% glycerol (Carl Roth, 3783.2)) using a Slide-A-Lyzer 10 MWCO Dialysis Cassette (Thermo Scientific, 66380) for 24 h. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, MWCO 30 (Merck, UFC9030) to reach ~11 µM protein A-Tn5. Concentrated protein was mixed with equal volume glycerol (Carl Roth, 3783.2) and stored at −20 °C.

For transposase preparation, 16 µL of 100 µM annealed Tn5MEDS A and Tn5MEDS B oligonucleotides were mixed with 100 µL of Protein A-Tn5 glycerol stock and incubated for 50 min at 23 °C. The prepared transposase was stored at −20 °C.

CUT&Tag experiments were performed as previously described with the following modifications10. Instead of immobilisation of nuclei on concanavalin A conjugated beads, nuclei were washed by centrifugation at 450 × g for 3 min at RT. 3 × 105 fixed nuclei were incubated with 1:100 diluted primary antibodies in 50 µL W150 buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5 (KOH) (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 150 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 2 mM EDTA (Sigma-Aldrich, E6758), 0.5 mM Spermidine ((Sigma-Aldrich, S0266), 0.01% (w/v) Digitonin (Carl Roth, 4005.1), 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A7030)) on a nutating platform at 4 °C overnight. The next day, nuclei were washed once with 200 µL W150 buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 µg anti-rabbit IgG antibody (NOVUS BIOLOGICALS, NBP1 72763) in W150 buffer. After three wash steps with 200 µL W150 buffer, nuclei were incubated with 1:200 diluted protein A-Tn5 in W300 (W150 buffer with 300 mM NaCl) for 1 h at RT. Nuclei were washed three times with 200 µL W300 buffer, and Tn5 was subsequently activated by adding 10 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, AM9530G) for 1 h at 37 °C. Upon tagmentation, nuclei were counted using an automated cell counter and equal number of nuclei were transferred into new tubes and denaturated in 50 µL Denaturation buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 (HCl) (Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 50 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 0.2% (w/v) SDS (Fisher Scientific, BP8200100), 0.5 ng/mL proteinase K (Ambion, AM2546)). Denaturation was stopped by purification of the tagmented DNA fragments using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, 28204). DNA was eluted in 23 µL EB buffer and amplified using previously described custom Nextera primers10 and the NEBNext 2X PCR Mix (NEB, M0541L) and the following PCR programme: 58 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, repeat from step 4 for 14 cycles, 72 °C for 1 min. Amplified sequencing libraries were purified with 1.3× SPRI beads (MAGBIO, AC-60050) ratio, followed by elution in 26 µL EB buffer. Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 1000 platform using NextSeq P2 Reagent Kit (100 cycles) (Illumina, 20044468) with 2% PhiX Control V3 (Illumina, FC-110-3001). All CUT&Tag experiments were performed in two independent replicates.

For DynaTag, 3 × 105 fixed nuclei were incubated with 1:100 diluted primary antibodies on a nutating platform at 4 °C overnight in AB buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 (KOH) (Carl Roth, 6763.3), 110 mM KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, P9333), 10 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 1 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, AM9530G), 0.01% (w/v) Digitonin (Carl Roth, 4005.1), 1% (w/v) BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A7030)), 0.5 mM spermidine (Sigma-Aldrich, S0266)) in 0.2 mL PCR tubes. The next day, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 × g for 3 min at RT incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 0.5 µg anti-rabbit secondary antibody (NOVUS BIOLOGICALS, NBP1 72763) or 0.5 µg anti-mouse secondary antibody (abcam, ab46540). Nuclei were washed twice by gentle resuspension in 200 µL AB buffer. Nuclei were incubated with 1:200 diluted pA-Tn5 complex in AB buffer for 1 h at RT with gentle agitation. Nuclei were washed twice by gentle resuspension in 200 µL AB buffer. Tagmentation was initiated by incubating nuclei at 37 °C for 1 h in AB buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 (Invitrogen, AM9530G). Upon tagmentation, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 450 × g for 3 min at RT and resuspended in 100 µL DynaTag buffer (AB buffer without BSA, spermidine and digitonin) and an aliquot was mixed with trypan blue and counted using an automated cell counter. Alternatively, nuclei can be separated by their cell cycle phase using FACS upon DAPI staining. 10,000 nuclei were transferred into new 0.2 mL PCR tubes and incubated for 3 h at 58 °C in 50 µL Denaturation buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0 (HCl) (Sigma-Aldrich, 93362), 50 mM NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich, S5886), 0.2% (w/v) SDS (Fisher Scientific, BP8200100), 0.5 ng/mL proteinase K (ambion, AM2546)). Denaturation was stopped by purification of the tagmented DNA fragments using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN, 28204). DNA was eluted in 23 µL EB buffer and amplified using previously described custom Nextera primers10 and the NEBNext 2× PCR Mix (NEB, M0541L) and the following PCR programme: 58 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 5 min, 98 °C for 30 s, 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 10 s, repeat from step 4 for 12–20 cycles, 72 °C for 1 min. An appropriate number of cycles can be estimated via qPCR and will depend on epitope abundancy. Amplified sequencing libraries were double-sided size-selected using first a 0.5× SPRI beads (MAGBIO, AC-60050) ratio to remove large fragments followed by purification with 1.3× SPRI beads ratio, followed by elution in 26 µL EB buffer. All DynaTag experiments were performed in two independent biological replicates. Two control and two chemo-treated SCLC PDX samples from patient S02730 were used.

BAM files were prepared using deeptools (v3.5.1) multiBamSummary (bins -bs 10). Correlation was plotted via deeptools plotCorrelation (--corrMethod pearson --skipZeros --whatToPlot scatterplot --log1p).

Indexed BAM files were converted into cpm-normalised bigwig files using deeptools (v3.5.1) bamCoverage (-bs 10 --skipNAs --centerReads --normalizeUsing CPM -of bigwig). Bigwigs were loaded into IGV and visualised as group auto-scaled bars.

Aligned BAM files were down-sampled to equal reads per TF using samtools view (-@ 8 -c -F 260) and sorted with samtools sort. Peaks were called from sorted BAM files via MACS2 (v2.2.7.1) (-f BAMPE -g mm --keep-all --nomodel --extsize 55 -B –SPMR) from mouse cells or (-f BAMPE -g hg --keep-all --nomodel --extsize 55 -B --SPMR) from human PDX samples and filtered for conserved peaks between replicates using bedtools multiIntersectBed. Conserved peaks per condition were concatenated, followed by sorting and merging to remove redundant peaks with bedtools sortBed | mergeBed. To count reads, bedtools coverage was used to generate bedgraph files, which were then converted into plain text files.

For FRiP calculation, overlapping reads with peaks were identified using bedtools (v3.5.1) intersect (-wa -u), and reads were counted using samtools (v1.13) view (-c -F 0 × 2). Finally, overlapping peaks were divided by total reads. FRiP scores were plotted in R using ggplot2 (v3.5.0).

Target genes (±1 kb) per TF were downloaded from the ChIP-Atlas repository22 and used to extract the chromosome coordinates to generate a BED file using the GenomicRanges (v1.54.1) R package. Random non-target genes were extracted via setdiff command. Overlap of called peaks and (non)-target genes was counted with countOverlap and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.5.0).

HOMER2 (v5.1, 7-16-2024) was used to quantify the top 10 most enriched known motifs in the matched ESC DynaTag, ChIP-seq and CUT&RUN data. Prior to motif analysis, the peak files were (i) normalised to the same average peak size, (ii) processed using the Homer2 background function to calculate the background sequences underlying the peaks, and (iii) analysed for motif enrichment. For details, please refer to the code available at https://github.com/HaenselHertschEpiLab/DynaTag.

For differential binding analysis, peak count matrices were read into R and analysed with edgeR (v 4.0. 16). Count matrices were pre-processed by removing low count peaks (rowSums <10). Dispersion was estimated with estimateGLMCommonDisp and estimateGLMTagwiseDisp, and data was fitted with glmFit followed by statistical estimation using glmLRT. Significant peaks (FDR <0.05 and logFC >0.5, and logFC <−0.5) were identified and plotted using ggplot2 (v3.5.0).

DiffBind (Galaxy Version 2.10.0) coupled with DESeq2 and the significance threshold FDR < 0.1 was used in usegalaxy.eu52 to identify differentially occupied regions. Default median-of-ratios was used to normalise the count matrix by DEseq2.

Around 4 × 105 mESCs were seeded for this experiment. Cells were harvested and kept on ice, and nuclei were isolated and fixed as described above.

Approximately 300 × 105 nuclei were incubated on a rotator at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies at a 1:50 dilution in 100 μL AB buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 (KOH), 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) Digitonin, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.5 mM spermidine).

Nuclei were centrifuged at 450 × g for 10 min and incubated with anti-Rabbit or anti-Mouse IgG antibody (1:50 dilution) on a rotator at RT for 1 h. Nuclei were then washed twice with 200 μL AB buffer and incubated with a 1:100 dilution of pA-Tn5 adaptor complex on a rotator at RT for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with 200 μL AB buffer, resuspended in 100 μL Tagmentation buffer (AB buffer with 10 mM MgCl2) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After tagmentation, nuclei were pelleted at 600 × g for 3 min and resuspended in 150 μL DynaTag buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5 (KOH), 110 mM KCl, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2).

For single-cell DynaTag, the ICELL8 cx nanoliter dispensing system (TaKaRa) was used similarly as reported for CUT&Tag10. Nuclei were counted using trypan blue to 1.4 cells/20 nL in PBS and 1× Second Diluent (Takara Bio USA, Cat. 640196). Nuclei were stained with DAPI for visualisation, and 80 μL/sample was loaded to a source loading plate. Control wells with PBS (80 μL) were also included in the source plate. Nuclei were dispensed onto an ICELL8 350 v chip at 20 nL per well twice. After each dispense, chips were sealed, centrifuged at 3220 × g for 3 min and scanned using the automated microscopy image analysis software (CellSelect, Takara Bio USA). Additional single nuclei were manually selected using the manual triage function, and a filter file containing information of single-nuclei containing wells and control wells was generated. We obtained ~1500 single nuclei per chip. Then, 35 nL denaturation buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.5 ng/mL proteinase K) was dispensed onto the single-nuclei containing wells, and chips were incubated in a thermocycler at 58 °C (80 °C lid) for 3 h followed by incubation overnight at room temperature. Next, chips were centrifuged at 3220 × g for 3 min and 35 nL quenching buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 2.5% Tween 20) was dispensed.

For indexing, 35 nL of 72 i5 and 72 i7 (set A and set B) unique indexes were dispensed on the single nuclei-containing wells. After the dispense, chips were sealed, centrifuged at 3220 × g for 3 min and on-chip PCR was performed using the KAPA HiFi PCR kit (Roche) (2,7x HIFI fidelity buffer with Mg stock, 0.05 U/μL HiFi, 0.8 mM dNTPs) and the following programme: 58 °C for 5 min, 72 °C for 10 min, 98 °C for 2 min, 98 °C for 15 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 10 s, repeat steps 20 times from step 4, final elongation at 72 °C for 1 min.

PCR products were collected by centrifugation at 3220 × g for 10 min at 4 °C using the single-cell collection kit (TaKaRa, 640212). Libraries were size-selected using SPRI beads. First, a ratio of 0.25× beads was used to remove larger fragments. Then, samples were transferred to a new tube, and a 1.3× ratio of beads was used. Beads were washed twice with 80% ethanol, let air-dry at RT for 5 min and incubated in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) at RT for 10 min. Purified libraries were transferred to a new tube and quantified using Qubit and bioanalyzer.

Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq1000 platform using NextSeq 1000/2000 P2 Reagents (100 Cycles) v3 (100 cycles)(Illumina, 20046811) with 0.5% PhiX Control V3 (Illumina, FC-110-3001).

All CUT&Tag experiments were performed in two to three independent replicates. For analysis, BCL files were demultiplexed into separate fastq files per cell using cellranger (v7.0.1). Fastq files were aligned to mm39 and mm10 using bowtie2 (v2.4.1) and aggregated into merged BAM files per TF using samtools (v1.13) merge for peak calling via MACS2 (v2.2.7.1). Using the aggregate called peaks, bedgraph files were generate per cell. Bedgraph files were converted into a large peak-by-cell count matrix and analysed in R using the Seurat (v 5.0.1) package. Using Seurat, the data was normalised like RNA-seq data and PCA followed by UMAP was run for dimensionality reduction.

In order to correct for the variability of every peak signal across the single cells, we compute z-scores between the two cellular states ESC and EpiLC. Please note that the calculations below are, for sake of simplicity, only shown for one peak region. Since peaks are independent, the same mathematical expressions are valid for any location. To calculate the z-scores, we derive the variance \({\sigma }^{2}\) of the log-transformed location-averaged and cell-summed peak signal \(\bar{z}\) by:

where \(n\) is the number of single cells, \({n}_{b}\) the number of bins around the peak location, \({c}_{{ij}}\) the \(n\times {n}_{b}\) count matrix of the peak and cell average \({\hat{\mu }}_{j}=\frac{1}{n}\mathop{\sum }_{i=1}^{n}{c}_{{ij}}\). Let \({c}_{{ij}}^{{ESC}}\) be the \({n}^{{ESC}}\times {n}_{b}^{{ESC}}\) count matrix of the ESC cells and \({c}_{{ij}}^{{EpiLC}}\) the \({n}^{{EpiLC}}\times {n}_{b}^{{EpiLC}}\) count matrix of the EpiLC cells, we can then determine \({\bar{z}}_{{ESC}}\), \({\sigma }_{{ESC}}^{2}\) for ESC and \({\bar{z}}_{{EpiLC}}\), \({\sigma }_{{EpiLC}}^{2}\) for EpiLC by replacing the count matrix \({c}_{{ij}}\) with the respective cell-type-specific count matrix in the equations above. The z-score is then computed by:

Peak area binning and z-score calculations

Narrow peak files were filtered for peak scores (column 5) equal to or higher than 1000. For each peak, the centre is extended by ±2.5 kb (kilobases). The extended peak region is then divided into 100 bins of 50 bases. To obtain the corresponding read counts for each bin per cell, the aligned BAM file for each cell is used as input for BEDTools/2.31.0-GCC-12.3.0. For all cells of each TF (MYC, NANOG and OCT4) and developmental condition (ESC and EpiLC), a merged count matrix was created for the binned peaks. To calculate the z-score, cells with more than 250 reads were selected, and read counts in each cell were scaled to 10,000 using the scanpy.pp.normalize_total() function. For each peak (containing 100 count bins), the z-score, p value and adjusted p value were calculated. Peaks with an adjusted p value <0.001 were selected for downstream analysis and visualisation with UMAP.

Python's Scanpy package (version 1.10.4) was used to analyse the single-cell data. For each cell, the number of peaks with non-zero counts (non-zero peaks) was calculated. Cells falling within the lower 15% and upper 5% quantiles of non-zero peaks were removed (quantile filtering). For data quality control, violin plots were generated for each TF and developmental condition. These plots show the distribution of log (x + 1) values for: the total number of peak reads per cell, the number of non-zero peaks per cell, before and after quantile filtering, and the non-zero peaks selected by z-score filtering.

For data visualisation, the counts for all peaks were scaled to 10,000 using the scanpy.pp.normalize_total() function, and a log(x + 1) transformation was applied using scanpy.pp.log1p(). After z-score filtering, the dimensionality of the retained peaks was reduced to 10 principal components using scanpy.pp.pca(). A neighbourhood graph was then computed with 25 neighbours using scanpy.pp.neighbours(). Finally, two-dimensional UMAP embeddings were generated using the scanpy.tl.umap() function.

Two control and two chemo-treated SCLC PDX samples from patient S02730 were used.

After isolation, nuclei were counted with trypan blue and fixed using the Evercode Nuclei Fixation v2 Kit (Parse Bioscience, ECF2003) and stored at −80 °C until library preparation. Library preparation of fixed nuclei was performed with the Evercode WT Kit (Parse Bioscience, ECW02130) according to manufacturer's protocol. Libraries were paired-end sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform using NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit v1.5 (200 cycles) (Illumina, 20028401) with 5% PhiX Control V3 (Illumina, FC-110-3001). Sequencing fastq files were demultiplexed into single-nucleus data using the Split Pipe pipeline off Parse Bioscience (v1.0.6). Single-nucleus RNA-seq data were analysed in R using the Seurat (v 5.2.1) package. First, all four samples were pre-processed separately. Percentages of mitochondrial and ribosomal gene expression were computed for all cells. Cells with a ratio of mitochondrial versus endogenous genes expression higher than 0.1 were discarded. Additionally, cells expressing fewer than 1000 or more then 100,000 UMI counts, and fewer than 500 genes were also excluded. Raw expression data were normalised applying SCTransform function, regressing on percentage of mitochondrial gene expression. The top 3000 genes with the highest variance were computed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using RunPCA function, and top 30 principal components were selected. All four samples were then integrated with batch correction by applying reciprocal PCA using the IntegrateLayers function. A k-nearest neighbours graph was computed and further refined into a shared nearest neighbour (SNN) graph using FindNeighbors function, using batch-corrected principal components as input. Cell clusters were defined at different resolutions applying Louvain algorithm to SNN graph using FindCluster function. To identify the resolution that produced the most stable set of clusters, we performed 20 subsamplings of the dataset, each time sampling 80% of the cells without replacement, and repeated the clustering procedure for all resolutions on each subsample. To assess cluster stability, we calculated Jaccard indices for each cluster at each resolution by comparing the original clusters with those obtained from each subsample. A cluster was considered stable if its median Jaccard index across subsamplings was higher than 0.7553. We finally selected the resolution that produced the higher number and fraction of stable clusters. The top 30 cluster-specific genes were identified by first applying PrepSCTFindMarkers function, followed by FindMarkers function with the following parameters: pseudocount.use = 0.2, assay = ‘SCT', only.pos = TRUE, and min.pct = 0.2. Genes with an adjusted p value < 0.01 were selected and ranked by log fold change (logFC); the top 30 genes were retained. For cell visualisation in two dimensions uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was computed with RunUMAP function. To exclude non-malignant tumour microenvironment cells, the SeuratObject was subsetted to the small cell lang cancer clusters. The expression of the eleven TFs was plotted as FeaturePlot into UMAP. For differential expression analysis, the count data were aggregated into pseudobulk counts per sample and a combined transcripts-by-sample count matrix was generated. The combined count matrix was filtered for transcripts of a rowSums <10. DESeq2 (v1.42.0) was run with standard parameters and the control samples as reference. Significantly differentially expressed genes were identified (log2FoldChange >0.5 or <−0.5 and padj <0.1).

A slightly more relaxed adjusted p value of 0.1 was chosen as the single-nucleus RNA-seq was only performed in duplicates and therefore offers limited statistical power. For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, the transcripts were pre-ranked by multiplying the log2foldchange by the −log10 of the adjusted p value and assigning the sign of the log2foldchange to the value to capture the magnitude and significance of the differential expression. GSEA was run using the local GSEA software (v4.3.3), the normalised enrichment score of significantly enriched pathways (NOM p value < 0.05) was plotted using ggplot2 (v.3.5.0).

For estimation of changes in occupancy of TFs via DynaTag at genes associated with altered pathways via GSEA (v4.3.3), the chromosomal coordinates of the TSS (+250; −1000 bp) of each enriched gene per pathway were extracted. Using these coordinated, bedgraph files were generated per TF per pathway from merged BAM files per factor per treatment condition. The counts in the bedgraph files were used to calculate the ratio of control to chemotherapy occupancy per gene followed by calculation of the mean per TF per pathway. To estimate the statistical significance, a paired t test was performed per TF per pathway. The log2-transformed occupancy ratio was plotted as colour scale, and the −log10-transformed p value was plotted as size parameter in a factor-by-pathway bubble plot matrix. The y-axis of the bubble plot was ordered according to the occupancy ratio for better readability. Of note, the p values were not FDR-corrected to account for multiple test problems as the gene sets did not contain excesses numbers of genes. Moreover, the genes with a DynaTag count of 0 in one of the treatment conditions were excluded to prevent division by 0.

To visualise the DynaTag signal at the genomic coordinates used to calculate the occupancy ratio, deeptools (v3.5.1) computeMatrix (reference-point --beforeRegionStartLength 1000 --afterRegionStartLength 250 --referencePoint TSS --missingDataAsZero --skipZeros) followed by deeptools (v3.5.1) plotprofile (--perGroup --colours blue red --plotType=fill) was used.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomised. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

Measurements were taken from all samples.

Gene-set analysis seeks to identify the biological mechanisms underlying groups of genes with shared functions. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in generating functional descriptions for input gene sets but may produce factually incorrect statements, commonly referred to as hallucinations in LLMs. Here we present GeneAgent, an LLM-based AI agent for gene-set analysis that reduces hallucinations by autonomously interacting with biological databases to verify its own output. Evaluation of 1,106 gene sets collected from different sources demonstrates that GeneAgent is consistently more accurate than GPT-4 by a significant margin. We further applied GeneAgent to seven novel gene sets derived from mouse B2905 melanoma cell lines. Expert review confirmed that GeneAgent produces more relevant and comprehensive functional descriptions than GPT-4, providing valuable insights into gene functions and expediting knowledge discovery.

Gene-set analysis allows researchers to explore groups of genes that likely act together in specific biological processes or molecular functions1,2,3,4. This approach builds on the extensive results of mRNA expression experiments and proteomics studies, which have identified differentially expressed sets of genes and proteins5,6. Utilizing the assumption that these genes work together, many computational methods use Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms7,8.

Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA), a cornerstone of functional genomics, measures the overrepresentation or underrepresentation of biological functions associated with a set of genes or proteins9,10,11,12. GSEA typically compares gene clusters against predefined categories in manually curated databases, such as GO13 and the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)14,15, using rank-based metrics. However, gene sets exhibiting strong enrichment in the existing databases have often been well analyzed by previous research. Therefore, an increasing number of recent studies focus on gene sets that only marginally overlap with known functions16.

LLMs have emerged as promising tools for gene-set analysis due to their powerful reasoning capability and rich modeling of biological context17,18. LLM agents leveraging instruction learning19,20 and multi-agent conversation21 and integrating with external resources show particular promise. Jin et al.20 presented GeneGPT to answer genomics questions by teaching LLMs to use the web tools. Wu et al.21 developed AutoGen to build applications of various complexities and LLM capacities potentially for genomic question answering. Hu et al.16 evaluated the performance of five LLMs in gene-set analysis by designing a set of prompts to identify the functions of genes within a given gene set. Another work using standard LLMs, SPINDOCTOR22, summarizes multiple biological process names from various resources given a gene set.

However, previous studies did not often investigate hallucinations, where LLMs generate plausible yet fallacious contents, a common problem in general-purpose LLMs. This potential for fabricated and inaccurate results poses a challenge for creating a reliable framework to accurately generate biological process names for gene sets and hinders the objective interpretability of gene functions.

To overcome these challenges, we developed GeneAgent, a language agent built upon GPT-4 to automatically interact with domain-specific databases to annotate functions for gene sets. GeneAgent generates interpretable and contextually accurate biological process names for user-provided gene sets, either aligning with significant enrichment analyses or introducing novel terms. At the core of GeneAgent's functionality is a four-stage pipeline centered on self-verification (Fig. 1a). This mechanism autonomously interacts with various expert-curated biological databases through Web APIs. By utilizing relevant domain-specific information, GeneAgent performs fact verification and provides objective evidence to support or refute the raw LLM output, reducing hallucinations and enabling reliable, evidence-based insights into gene function.

a, An overview of GeneAgent, containing generation, self-verification, modification and summarization. The self-verification module is iterated through the modification module. b, The workflow of GeneAgent in the gene-set analysis. When obtaining the input gene set, the Generation step creates the raw outputs containing the process name and the analytical narratives using LLMs configured with the engineered prompts proposed by Hu et al.16. The Self-verification step identifies the hallucinations in the raw output based on the claims generated from the process name or the analytical narrative. The Modification step corrects hallucinations in the verification of the process name and activates the verification of analytical narratives. The Summarization step produces the final output containing the updated process name and the analytical narratives for the input gene set. Detailed prompts are provided in Supplementary Document 1. c, The demonstration of selfVeri-Agent with a claim example of ‘ERBB2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2), ERBB4 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 4), FGFR2 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 2), FGFR4 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 4), HRAS (HRas proto-oncogene, GTPase), KRAS (KRAS proto-oncogene, GTPase) is involved in RTK signaling' generated from the process name. A complete example is shown in Supplementary Table 2.

We evaluated GeneAgent on gene sets from three distinct sources: literature curation (GO), proteomics analyses (nested systems in tumors (NeST) system of human cancer proteins6) and molecular functions (MSigDB). All datasets were released after 2023, while the version of GPT-4 used in GeneAgent has training data up to September 2021 (Methods). GeneAgent significantly outperformed recent LLMs using the prompts proposed by Hu et al.16 (Supplementary Table 1). Compared with the gene function synopsis used by SPINDOCTOR, GeneAgent provides more informative gene summaries for LLMs to generate relevant biological terms. These improvements are primarily due to GeneAgent's reduction in hallucinations, thereby enhancing accuracy.

In a real-world application, we tested GeneAgent on seven novel gene sets derived from mouse B2905 melanoma cell lines. GeneAgent not only achieved better performance compared to GPT-4 but also offers valuable insights into novel gene functionalities, facilitating knowledge discovery. This use case also shows GeneAgent is robust across multiple species.

GeneAgent enhances the accuracy of gene-set analysis by minimizing instances of hallucinations through an advanced self-verification feature. This feature allows GeneAgent to autonomously interact with domain-specific databases and refine the raw output from the LLM (Methods and Box 1). A complete example is shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Specifically, the input to GeneAgent is a gene set provided by the user (Fig. 1b), which GeneAgent processes to create the raw output, containing a preliminary process name and several paragraphs analyzing the functions of the input genes. GeneAgent then activates the self-verification agent (selfVeri-Agent; Fig. 1c) to verify the process name and the associated analyses. During verification, GeneAgent identifies any hallucinations by extracting claims from the raw output and comparing these against curated knowledge in domain-specific databases. The gene symbols within the claims are used to query the Web APIs of the backend databases, retrieving the associated manually curated functions.

Based on the curated gene functions, the selfVeri-Agent compiles a verification report that categorizes each claim as ‘supported', ‘partially supported' or ‘refuted'. The selfVeri-Agent first verifies the ‘process name' before examining the modified ‘analytical narratives' to ensure the process name is verified twice (Fig. 1b). Finally, GeneAgent consolidates all intermediate verification reports to produce the final updated outputs. This cascading structure improves the traditional step-by-step chain-of-thought reasoning process23, enabling autonomous verification of the inference process24. A comparison with the GPT-4 chain-of-thought process shows improved performance (Supplementary Fig. 1). GeneAgent incorporates domain knowledge from 18 biomedical databases via four Web APIs. To prevent data leakage, we implemented a masking strategy that ensures no database is used to verify its own gene sets during self-verification (Methods).

We evaluated the performance of GeneAgent in generating relevant biological process names for a given gene set, compared with GPT-4. To ensure a fair comparison, we applied the prompt proposed by Hu et al.16 on the same GPT-4 used in GeneAgent but did not apply the self-verification, denoting this setup as ‘GPT-4 (Hu et al.)'. The gene sets analyzed range in size from 3 to 456, with an average of 50.67 (Table 1).

First, we evaluate ROUGE scores (recall-oriented understudy for gisting evaluation)25 between the generated names and their ground truths, specifically ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), ROUGE-1 (1-gram) and ROUGE-2 (2-gram) scores (Methods). GeneAgent demonstrated better alignment with ground-truth token sequences than GPT-4 (Hu et al.16; Fig. 2a). Across 1,106 gene sets with an average ground-truth length of 4.50 words (Table 1), GeneAgent achieved significant improvements over GPT-4. Notably, in the MSigDB dataset, GeneAgent improved the ROUGE-L scores from 0.239 ± 0.038 to 0.310 ± 0.047 compared to GPT-4. The ROUGE-1 scores matched ROUGE-L, and the ROUGE-2 scores also improved, from 0.074 ± 0.030 to 0.155 ± 0.044.

a, The ROUGE scores of GeneAgent and GPT-4 were evaluated across three datasets: 1,000 gene sets from GO, 50 from NeST and 56 from MSigDB. The s.d. for each bar was calculated using nine-fold cross-validation based on batch size (bs) sampling, with bs = 200 for GO and bs = 20 for both NeST and MSigDB. The ROUGE score for each batch size is presented in the figure. The central value of the error bars represents the mean score across all samples. The results are presented as the mean ± s.d. b, Distribution of similarity scores obtained by GeneAgent and GPT-4 in three datasets. The total number of gene sets used for the statistics is 1,000 (GO), 50 (NeST) and 56 (MSigDB). The middle points represent the mean values; bounds of the inner boxes of each violin plot represent the upper and lower percentiles; and whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points within all data samples. The statistically significant P value is 3.1 × 10−5 for 1,106 evaluated gene sets, which is calculated by a one-tailed t-test with 95% confidence intervals. The results are reported as the mean ± s.d., calculated from all similarity scores obtained by GeneAgent or GPT-4. c, The percentile distribution of semantic similarity between generated names and their ground truths was assessed across all candidate background terms. This background set comprises 12,320 terms, including 12,214 GO biological process terms used by Hu et al.16 and all available annotated terms in NeST (50) and MSigDB (56). The plot illustrates the distribution of gene sets within the top 90th percentile. The caption values represent the number of gene sets in GeneAgent and GPT-4 that fall within the top 98th percentile (that is, shadings shown in the figures). d, The accuracy of tested terms that exactly match the significant enrichment terms obtained by GSEA. Each value on the bar is calculated by the proportion of exact matched terms within all terms tested by the GeneAgent or SPINDOCTOR.

Source data

Next, we measured the semantic similarity between the names generated and their ground truths using MedCPT26, a state-of-the-art biomedical text encoder (Methods). GeneAgent achieved consistently higher average similarity scores across three datasets: 0.705 ± 0.174, 0.761 ± 0.140 and 0.736 ± 0.184, compared to GPT-4's scores of 0.689 ± 0.157, 0.708 ± 0.145 and 0.722 ± 0.157, respectively (Fig. 2b). Additionally, the GeneAgent demonstrated notable advantages in generating highly similar names (Table 2). Specifically, GeneAgent generated 170 cases with a similarity greater than 90% and 614 cases exceeding 70%, compared to GPT-4's 104 and 545 cases, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Remarkably, GeneAgent generated 15 names with a similarity score of 100%, while GPT-4 only generated three.

Finally, we illustrated the practical significance of similarity scores by investigating the difference between generated names and their ground truths. As shown in Table 2, a similarity score exceeding 90% indicates the generated name has only minor differences, such as the addition of ‘Metabolism'. Similarity scores between 70% and 90%, however, typically indicate broader concepts, which would be more similar to an ancestor term of the ground truth. To confirm that this observation represents a true tendency, we conducted a hierarchical similarity analysis8 on gene sets within the GO dataset (Methods). Focusing on similarity scores ranging from 70% to 90%, we found that 75.4% of gene sets (303 of 402) had higher similarity scores with an ancestor term of the ground truth (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Hu et al.16 introduced the ‘background semantic similarity distribution' method, which evaluates the percentile ranking of the similarity score between the generated name and its ground truth within a background set of candidate terms. A high percentile indicates that the generated name is more semantically similar to the ground truth than the majority of candidate terms. To assess the performance of GeneAgent, we designed a similar pipeline based on MedCPT (Methods) and compared it to GPT-4. For example, GeneAgent generated the process name ‘regulation of cellular response to stress' for the gene set with the ground-truth name ‘regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy in response to stress', which achieved a similarity at the 98.9th percentile (Extended Data Fig. 2a), while GPT-4's generated name, ‘calcium signaling pathway regulation', ranked only at the 60.2nd percentile (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

Across the 1,106 gene sets tested, we identified cases where the similarity score between the generated name and the ground truth ranked within the top 90th percentile of 12,320 candidate terms (Fig. 2c). GeneAgent outperformed GPT-4 (Hu et al.16), with 76.9% (850) of the names generated by GeneAgent achieving semantic similarity scores in the 90th percentile. Specifically, GeneAgent produced 758 from GO, 46 from NeST and 46 from MSigDB. In contrast, GPT-4 (Hu et al.16) yields 742, 42 and 40 gene sets, respectively, from the same databases, amounting to 74.5% overall. GeneAgent's advantage becomes more pronounced for high percentiles: at the 98th percentile, GeneAgent generated over 675 gene sets surpassing this threshold, compared to 598 for GPT-4. Notably, GeneAgent generated 82 gene sets that achieved a 100th percentile ranking, while GPT-4 achieved this for only 43 gene sets.

Building on the approach introduced in SPINDOCTOR22, which summarizes multiple biological processes based on gene function descriptions, we conducted enrichment testing on MSigDB. For this analysis, the verification reports produced during GeneAgent's self-verification step served as the gene function synopsis (Methods). For comparison, we collected the narrative and ontological synopsis of 56 gene sets in MSigDB from the SPINDOCTOR study and evaluated results under the basic setting, where no gene synopsis was provided. For this test, we used GPT-4 with the summarization prompts provided by SPINDOCTOR (Supplementary Document 1).

To evaluate the accuracy of enrichment terms summarized from different gene synopses against those from conventional GSEA, we utilized g:Profiler27 to extract significant enrichment terms (P value ≤ 0.05) as ground truth for comparison. Then, we quantified the degree of overlap between the LLM-generated terms and significant terms (Methods). Using an exact match criterion, our findings reveal that 80.7% (296 of 367) of the LLM-generated terms aligned with significant enrichment terms when using verification reports as the gene synopsis (Fig. 2d). This proportion declines to 68.8% (282 of 410) when using ontological synopsis and diminishes to 56.0% (195 of 348) without using gene synopsis. As discussed in the SPINDOCTOR study, unmatched terms may represent instances where the model fabricates a biological function, that is, a hallucination. Therefore, the lower proportion (19.3%) of unmatched terms in GeneAgent underscores its efficacy in mitigating hallucinations.

While Hu et al.16 found LLMs to generate useful gene-set functions and explanatory analyses, verifying these contents required human inspection. However, GeneAgent incorporates the proposed self-verification module, acting as an agent and autonomously interacting with domain databases to obtain relevant knowledge to support or refute the raw LLM output. Consequently, verifying GeneAgent output is substantially performed automatically.

To elucidate the role of self-verification, we examined 15,903 claims generated by GeneAgent and reported decisions of the selfVeri-Agent. Among these claims, 15,848 (99.6%) were successfully verified, with 84% supported, 1% partially supported, 8% refuted and the remaining 7% are unknown because the selfVeri-Agent output does not contain an explicit decision (Fig. 3a). A marginal fraction (0.4%) of claims were not verified due to the absence of gene names necessary for querying pertinent databases through Web APIs.

a, Statistics of the outcome of the 15,903 claims collected from the 1,106 gene sets, including the proportion of the categorizations made by selfVeri-Agent. ‘Successfully' denotes that the claims have a valid verification report returned by the selfVeri-Agent. b, Distribution (y axis) of four Web APIs in verifying Process name and Analytical narratives (x axis). c, The utilization frequency of different backend databases (x axis) in the self-verification stage of GeneAgent. d, Statistics of databases used to support the selfVeri-Agent to make decisions for the input claims. e, The results of human verification for the selected 132 claims derived from 10 gene sets. The inter-annotator agreement score was 93.9% (124/132), with a 95% Wilson score40 confidence interval ranging from 88.5% to 96.9%.

Source data

During the self-verification process, 16% of the claims were not supported. These unsupported claims were distributed across 794 gene sets, representing potential candidates for revision. Of these, 703 (88.5%) were subsequently modified.

Furthermore, we analyzed the frequency that the various Web APIs and their backend databases were utilized during the self-verification process. This analysis showed that process names are predominantly verified with Enrichr28,29 and g:Profiler APIs, whereas the validation of the explanatory analyses mainly relies on E-utils30,31 and AgentAPI (Fig. 3b). Additionally, GeneAgent interacts with backend databases 19,273 times to verify 15,848 claims (Fig. 3c). For these successfully verified claims, the frequency of databases used in the selfVeri-Agent (Fig. 3d) demonstrated that each decision is underpinned by evidence retrieved from at least one database. To estimate the accuracy of the self-verification process of GeneAgent, we manually reviewed ten randomly selected gene sets from NeST with a total of 132 claims, which received 88 supports, 15 partial supports, 28 refutes and one unknown by GeneAgent (Fig. 3e). Manual inspection demonstrated that 92% (122) of GeneAgent's decisions are correct, indicating a high performance in self-verification (Supplementary Document 2).

As a real-world utilization case, we applied GeneAgent to seven gene sets derived from the study of sub-clonal evolution on gene expression in mouse B2905 melanoma cell lines32 (Methods), with the number of genes in each set ranging from 19 to 49 (Table 1). These gene sets are identified from three subclones to the immunotherapy response, that is, high aggression and resistant (HA-R), high aggression and sensitive (HA-S) and low aggression and sensitive (LA-S). The results (Table 3) demonstrate that GeneAgent outperforms GPT-4 in generating correct process names and drafting informative explanation analysis.

Specifically, two gene sets, that is, mmu04015 (HA-S) and mmu05100 (HA-S), are assigned with process names that exhibit perfect alignment with the ground truth established by the domain experts (Table 3). Moreover, GeneAgent reveals novel biological insights for specific genes in the gene set. For example, for mmu05022 (LA-S), GeneAgent suggests gene functions related to subunits of complexes I, IV and V in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes33, and further summarizes the ‘respiratory chain complex' for these genes (Extended Data Fig. 3a). However, GPT-4 categorizes these genes as ‘oxidative phosphorylation,' which is a high-level biological process based on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes34,35, without including the gene Ndufa10 (encoding NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit A10) in this process. Similarly, GPT-4 does not include the gene Atxn1l (encoding ataxin 1-like) into ‘neurodegeneration' and does not provide a biological function for the gene Gpx7 (encoding glutathione peroxidase 7; Extended Data Fig. 3b). These results suggest that GeneAgent is more robust than GPT-4 for novel gene sets, and that GeneAgent is applicable to nonhuman genes.

To further measure the quality of outputs generated by GeneAgent and GPT-4, we formulated four criteria that are recognized as critical for practical use by genomic researchers: relevance, readability, consistency and comprehensiveness (Methods). We recruited two experts specializing in preclinical therapy testing, with a focus on genomic and immunological analysis, to manually assess and compare the results (Table 3b). GeneAgent and GPT-4 both demonstrate excellent readability and consistency across many cases. However, GeneAgent outperforms GPT-4 in relevance and comprehensiveness, which can be attributed to its ability to access domain-specific databases during the verification stage, thereby offering potentially valuable insights for experts. Nonetheless, there is one case, that is, mmu03010 (HA-S), where neither GeneAgent nor GPT-4 produces satisfactory results based on the four criteria. GeneAgent generates a narrow process name, ‘cytosolic ribosomes,' that does not cover mitochondrial ribosomal genes such as Mrpl10 (encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10) and Mrps21 (encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S21), while GPT-4 generates a hallucinated response, ‘synthesis' (Supplementary Document 3).

Recent research has increasingly focused on the ‘self-verification' within LLMs19,36,37,38. These studies utilize the same LLM to generate and then verify its own output, which may lead to overconfidence. This approach also has the potential to increase the risk of failing to discover novel insights, as the model might not adequately question or critique their initial findings39. In contrast, GeneAgent leverages established knowledge from manually curated domain-specific databases to verify the raw output of LLMs (Fig. 1b), which can not only mitigate the overconfidence in the initial results but also help reduce the potential for hallucination, thereby enhancing the reliability of LLMs. We performed an ablation experiment for the verification strategy used in the GeneAgent (Extended Data Fig. 4), with results that support the effectiveness of our self-verification setting.

As an indispensable tool for gene-set analysis, GSEA produces significant enrichment terms and statistical information for gene sets, which can provide informative evidence to verify the raw output of an LLM. In GeneAgent, we included four different APIs (for example, g:Profiler) to ascertain the agreement of gene sets with those represented by expert-curated databases. By comparing the generated names and the most significant enrichment term produced by GSEA, we found that GeneAgent surpasses GSEA in terms of similarity and ROUGE scores (Extended Data Fig. 5). In addition to superior performance, GeneAgent can generate associated explanations, which increases the transparency of the results and explains the functions of genes in the proposed biological process. Therefore, GeneAgent can be seen as a system that merges the strengths of both LLMs and GSEA, delivering performance that surpasses each individual system.

In addition to the eight databases from the GSEA tool, we have incorporated four databases for pathway analysis and six for gene functional verification (Fig. 3c). These databases formed a cohesive system that facilitates the discovery of gene-set knowledge by providing a reliable foundation of gene functions. The databases used in GSEA are complemented by the others, especially for examining the consistency of individual genes and their shared functions. This is particularly vital for uncovering latent biological functions among multiple genes, as it offers detailed insights into the characteristics of individual genes. Taken together, the domain-specific databases curated by experts are essential for enhancing the effectiveness of GeneAgent in discovering gene-set knowledge.

We showed three representative cases in gene sets with a low similarity score across three datasets and their verification reports (Supplementary Table 3). The suboptimal performance of GeneAgent in those cases can be primarily attributed to two factors: (1) the erroneous rejection of an accurate process name due to the scale of domain databases is limited in self-verification; and (2) the incorrect endorsement of an originally dissimilar process because the selfVeri-Agent calls an unmatched database during verification. Using additional relevant domain databases in the self-verification stage or engineering a more effective prompt for the modification stage may help alleviate such issues.

In this work, we only selected GPT-4 as the backbone model, given its popularity and strong overall performance. While future work may explore other LLMs, Hu et al.16 show that GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5, Gemini-Pro, Mixtral-Instruct and Llama 2. Our work shows that while the self-verification step is effective, GeneAgent might still generate biological process names that are substantially different from their ground truth. Although ROUGE is a commonly used evaluation metric, it is not sufficient on its own to fully assess gene-set analysis tasks. Instead, it can serve as a supplement to the evaluation of semantic similarity. Nonetheless, GeneAgent demonstrates remarkable robustness across gene sets of different species and effectively mitigates hallucinations by automatically interacting with domain-specific databases.

In this work, we utilized GPT-4 (version 20230613) as the backend model via the Azure OpenAI API, which is trained on data compiled before September 2021. The Azure OpenAI API is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, ensuring robust data privacy protection. To ensure stable and reproducible output, we set the temperature parameter to the absolute 0. The evaluated gene sets (Table 1) were derived from recent releases by Hu et al.16 and Joachimiak et al.22 after 2023. The gene set corresponding to each ground truth in different datasets was determined by aggregating the genes with which it was directly annotated with those of all its ontological descendants.

Furthermore, we collected 191 gene sets from PubMed articles that were published from November 2021 to December 2023 to evaluate the performance of different LLMs in various data sources (Supplementary Table 1). These gene sets range in size from 3 to 408, with an average of 35.67. The ground truths of these gene sets are released along with articles. The average word count in ground truth is 3.267. For model assessments, we developed the evaluation pipeline using Python (version 3.11.0) alongside PyTorch (version 1.13.0). Other necessary Python packages are NumPy (version 1.26.3), Pandas (version 2.1.4) and Seaborn (version v0.13.2).

GeneAgent is a language agent built upon GPT-4 to automatically interact with domain-specific databases to annotate functions for gene sets, which is composed of four key steps: generation, self-verification, modification and summarization. Each module is triggered by a specific instruction tailored to its function (Supplementary Document 1). The goal of GeneAgent is to generate a representative biological process name (P) for a set of genes, denoted as \(D=\{{{g}_{i}|}_{i=1}^{N}\}\). Each gene gi in this set is identified by its unique name, and the D is associated with a specific curated biological term, that is, ground truth (G). When provided with a D, GeneAgent outputs a \(P\), accompanied by analytical texts (A) detailing the functions of the genes involved, which can be formally defined as GeneAgent (D) = (P, A).

The gene set in the dataset D is separated by a comma (‘,') and serves as input parameters for the instruction of the generation (g) step. Following the generation stage, D is assigned with an initial process name \(({P}_{\rm{ini}})\) and corresponding analytical narratives \({(A}_{{ini}})\), that is, \({\rm{GeneAgent}}_{g}(D)=({P}_{\rm{ini}}\,,\,{A}_{\rm{ini}})\).

Afterwards, GeneAgent generates a list of claims for \({P}_{{ini}}\) by using statements like ‘be involved in' and ‘related to' to generate a hypothesis for the gene set and its process name. After that, GeneAgent activates selfVeri-Agent (Fig. 1c) to verify each claim in the list. Initially, selfVeri-Agent extracts all gene symbols and the process name from the claims. Subsequently, it utilizes the gene symbols to invoke the appropriate APIs for the autonomous interaction with domain-specific databases, using their established knowledge to validate the accuracy of the process name. Finally, it assembles a verification report (\({{\mathcal{R}}}_{P}\)) containing findings and decisions (that is, ‘supported', ‘partially supported' or ‘refuted') to the input claim.

Next, GeneAgent initiates the modification (m) step to either revise or retain the \({P}_{{ini}}\) based on the findings in the \({{\mathcal{R}}}_{P}\). If the \({P}_{\rm{ini}}\) is determined to revise by GeneAgent, the \({A}_{\rm{ini}}\) is also instructed to be modified accordingly, that is, \({\rm{GeneAgent}}_{m}\left({P}_{\rm{ini}},{{A}}_{\rm{ini}},{{\mathcal{R}}}_{P}\right)=({P}_{\mathrm{mod}},\,{A}_{\mathrm{mod}})\). Following this, GeneAgent applies the self-verification to the \({A}_{\mathrm{mod}}\) to verify the gene functions in the explanatory analyses while checking the updated process name again. This step is also started with generating a list of claims for different gene names and their function names and is finished with deriving a new verification report (\({{\mathcal{R}}}_{A}\)) containing a decision of ‘supported', ‘partially supported' or ‘refuted' made by the selfVeri-Agent.

Finally, based on the report \({{\mathcal{R}}}_{A}\), both \({P}_{\mathrm{mod}}\) and \({A}_{\mathrm{mod}}\) are modified according to the summarization (s) instruction to generate the final biological process name (P) and the analytical narratives (A) of gene functions, that is, \({\rm{GeneAgent}}_{s}\,({P}_{\mathrm{mod}},{A}_{\mathrm{mod}},\,{{\mathcal{R}}}_{A})=(P,A)\).

In the self-verification stage, we configured four Web APIs to access 18 domain databases (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Document 4).

(1) g:Profiler27 (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/apis/) is an open-source tool for GSEA. In GeneAgent, we used eight domain-specific databases: GO, KEGG41, Reactome42, WikiPathways43, Transfac44, miRTarBase45, CORUM46 and Human Phenotype Ontology47 to perform enrichment analysis for the gene set. For each gene set, we used the g:GOSt interface to identify the top five enrichment terms along with their descriptions.

(2) Enrichr28,29 (https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/help#api/) is also a valuable tool for GSEA. We configured four databases related to the pathway analysis in the Enrichr API, that is, KEGG_2021_Human, Reactome_2022, BioPlanet_2019 (ref. 48) and MSigDB_Hallmark_2020. In GeneAgent, we selected to return the top five standard pathway names via databases.

(3) E-utils30,31 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) is an API designed for accessing the NCBI databases for various biological data. In GeneAgent, we augment our repository of functional information associated with an individual gene by invoking its Gene database and PubMed database. Different databases can be used by defining the database parameter as Gene or PubMed in the foundation API.

(4) AgentAPI is our custom API library, developed using four gene-centric databases related to gene–disease, gene–domain, PPI and gene–complex. GeneAgent calls the appropriate database by specifying the desired interface at the end of the basic API, and subsequently retrieving the top ten relevant IDs to gene functions. These IDs are then used to match their names in the corresponding database.

Notably, we implemented a masking strategy for APIs and databases during the self-verification stage to ensure unbiased assessments across various gene sets. Specifically, we removed the g:Profiler API when assessing gene sets collected from the GO dataset because it can perfectly derive their ground truths by accessing the GO database. Similarly, we masked the ‘MSigDB_Hallmark_2020' database within the Enrichr API when evaluating gene sets collected from the MSigDB database.

Three distinct ROUGE metrics25 are used to access the recall of generated names relative to ground truths: that is, ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, which are based on n-gram, and ROUGE-L, which utilizes the longest common subsequence (LCS). The calculation formulas are as follows:

Here, the ‘ref' denotes the reference terms and ‘hyp' denotes the generated names. m and n are the token lengths of ‘ref' and ‘hyp', respectively. β is a hyper-parameter.

After generating the biological process name (P) for the gene set D, the semantic similarity between \(P\) and its ground truth (G) is computed by MedCPT26, a state-of-the-art model for language representation in the biomedical domain. It is built based on PubMedBERT49 with further training using 255 million query–article pairs from PubMed search logs. Compared with SapBERT50 and BioBERT51, MedCPT has higher performance in encoding the semantics of biomedical texts.

Calculation of semantic similarity between P and G

First, P and G are encoded by MedCPT into embeddings, and then the cosine similarity between their embeddings is calculated, yielding a score in the interval [−1, 1]. Finally, we take the average value of all similarity scores to evaluate the performance of GeneAgent on gene sets in each dataset.

Calculation of background semantic similarity distribution

First, P is paired with all possible terms \({G}_{i}{\mathcal{\in}}{\mathcal{Q}}\), where Q denotes 12,320 candidate terms consisting of 12,214 GO biological process terms, and all available terms in NeST (50) and MSigDB (56). Then, P and Gi are fed into MedCPT to get the embeddings, that is, \(\mathop{P}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup }\) and \(\mathop{{G}_{i}}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup }\). Afterwards, we calculated the cosine similarity for each \(< \mathop{P}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup },\mathop{{G}_{i}}\limits^{ \rightharpoonup } >\) pair. Finally, we ranked all cosine scores from large to small and observed the position where the pair <P,Gp> (Gp is the ground truth for P) located in. The higher position denotes the generated names have a higher similarity score to their ground truths than other candidate terms.

We first collected the hierarchical structures of all GO terms from the GoBasic.obo file in the GO database (2023-11-15 version), yielding 1,951,615 GO term pairs across five relationships: ‘is a', ‘part of', ‘regulates', ‘negatively regulates' and ‘positively regulates'. Next, we extracted the ancestral terms for all ground truths in the evaluation datasets used in this study, limiting the distance from each ground truth to its respective ancestor to within three hops. Finally, we calculated the semantic similarity between each ancestral term and its corresponding ground truth to assess whether the generated names achieved a higher similarity score with ancestral terms. For our evaluation, we computed hierarchical semantic similarity exclusively for gene sets in the GO dataset.

For gene sets in MSigDB, we first collected its verification report produced by the selfVeri-Agent of GeneAgent. Afterwards, each gene set and the associated report were used as the parameters of the instruction (Supplementary Document 1) for the GPT-4. Therefore, GPT-4 can summarize multiple enrichment terms for the given gene set. Finally, we used the exact match to evaluate the accuracy of the tested terms summarized by the GPT-4. Specifically, for each gene set in the evaluation, we first utilized g:Profiler to perform GSEA, where the P-value threshold is set to 0.05. Then, we obtained significant enrichment terms for the given gene sets as the ground truth. Finally, we counted the number of tested terms summarized by GPT-4 that correctly match the significant enrichment term of each gene set. One tested term is considered as accurate only when there is an exact match between all the words in the tested term and one term in the ground truth.

We randomly selected ten gene sets from NeST with 132 claims for human inspection. There are two parts in the verification report: the claims and the decisions to the claims along with evidence (Supplementary Document 2). Annotators were asked to label the selfVeri-Agent decisions (that is, support, partially support and refute) for each claim and judge whether such decisions are correct, partially correct or incorrect, which follows the study of natural language inference52 and fact verification53. For each claim, the annotators need to make a judgment based on assertions of the gene (set) functions provided in the evidence:

Correct: This category applies when GeneAgent's decision completely aligns with the evidence supporting the input claim. The decision is considered correct if it accurately reflects the evidence documented, demonstrating a clear and direct connection between the claim and the supporting data.

Partially correct: It is designated when GeneAgent's decision requires indirect reasoning or when the decision, although related, does not completely align with the direct evidence provided. This occurs when the decision is somewhat supported by the evidence but requires additional inference or context to be fully understood as supporting the input claim.

Incorrect: This category is used when GeneAgent's decision either contradicts the evidence or lacks any substantiation from the verification report.

The mouse B2905 melanoma cell line, which is derived from a tumor from the M4 model, where melanoma is induced by ultraviolet irradiation on pups of hepatocyte growth factor-transgenic C57BL/6 mice54.

Specifically, 24 single cells were isolated from the parental B2905 melanoma line and then expanded to become individual clonal sublines (that is, C1 to C24)55. Each of these 24 sublines was subjected to whole-exome sequencing and full-transcript single-cell RNA sequencing using the Smart-seq2 protocol. The single nucleotide variants called from exome sequencing results were used to build the tumor progression tree for all the 24 sublines. Based on the in vivo growth and therapeutic responses of the sublines in the clusters, three clades are named as ‘high aggressiveness and resistant (HA-R)', ‘high aggressiveness and sensitive (HA-S)' and ‘low aggressiveness and sensitive (LA-S)'32. Afterwards, EvoGeneX56 is applied to the single-cell RNA-sequencing data of the 24 clonal sublines, where the phylogenetic relation is defined by the mutation-based tumor progression tree, to identify adaptively upregulated and downregulated genes in each of HA-R, HA-S and LA-S clades. The adaptively upregulated and downregulated gene lists were then subjected to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis. The genes in the enrichments and their enriched terms are used to test the GeneAgent. In our case study, we only utilized the seven gene sets analyzed from the clonal subline as the evaluation data of GeneAgent. We did not access or process any original data from clinical experiments.

For the assessment of different outputs between GeneAgent and GPT-4, we established four criteria following the existing studies on the evaluation of LLMs57,58.

Relevance: Assess whether the content about genes pertinently reflects their functions, providing value to biologists.

Readability: Evaluate the fluency and clarity of the writing, ensuring it is easily understandable.

Consistency: Determine whether the analytical narratives align consistently with the specified process name.

Comprehensiveness: Verify whether the outputs provide a comprehensive understanding of gene functions.

Based on these four established criteria, two experts are tasked with evaluating the final responses from the outputs of GPT-4 and GeneAgent. They operate the annotation under a blind assessment protocol, where they are unaware of the algorithm that produced each response. Their main responsibility is to annotate and compare the preference for outputs generated by GPT-4 versus GeneAgent. They carefully review and select the more effective response, justifying their selections with relevant comments. Following a comprehensive synthesis of all feedback, these two experts are required to make a definitive judgment on which output most effectively satisfies the users' requirement (Supplementary Document 3).

a. Statistic of gene sets at different similarity levels obtained by GeneAgent and GPT-4 (Hu et al.). The minimum cutoff value of similarity score is set to 0.7. b. Distribution of gene sets in the Gene Ontology dataset (n = 1000) that exhibit a higher similarity score to the ancestors of ground truth than the ground truth itself. The similarity scores of the gene sets included in the analysis range from 0.7 to 0.9 when compared with the ground truth.

Source data

Semantic similarity between the generated name and ground truth (gray dashed line, x-axis) is converted to the percentage of all terms in the background set with lower similarity to the generated name (gray dashed line, y-axis). a, Example of the ground truth (‘regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy in response to stress') and the generated name of GeneAgent (‘Regulation of Cellular Response to Stress'). The similarity of ground truth and generated name is 0.695, which is higher than other 98.9% candidate terms in the background set. b, Example of the ground truth (‘regulation of cardiac muscle hypertrophy in response to stress') and the generated name of GPT-4 (‘Calcium Signaling Pathway Regulation'). The similarity of ground truth and generated name is 0.500, which is higher than other 60.2% candidate terms in the background set.

a, GeneAgent takes the ‘Neurodegeneration and Respiratory Chain Complex' as the most prominent biological process. Complex I is the ubiquinone oxidoreductase, Complex IV is the cytochrome c oxidase and Complex V is the ATP synthase. b, GPT-4 (Hu et al.) takes the ‘Oxidative Phosphorylation and Neurodegeneration' as the most prominent biological process.

The plot shows the averaged ROUGE scores (left) and the averaged similarity scores (right) of GeneAgent with different settings among all gene sets in different datasets.

Anthropic says its rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude to curb usage among subscribers who are running its AI coding tool, Claude Code, “continuously in the background, 24/7.” Anthropic says the rate limits also aim to stop a handful of users who are violating Claude's usage policy by sharing accounts and reselling access to Claude Code.

The new rate limits will go into effect August 28 for subscribers to Anthropic's $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as its $100 and $200-per-month Max plans, the company said Monday in an email to subscribers and a post on X. 

We're rolling out new weekly rate limits for Claude Pro and Max in late August. We estimate they'll apply to less than 5% of subscribers based on current usage. pic.twitter.com/X8FAss3jIC

Anthropic says its existing usage limits, which reset every five hours, will remain in place. The company is also introducing two new weekly rate limits that reset every seven days; one is an overall usage limit, whereas the other is specific to Anthropic's most advanced AI model, Claude Opus 4. Anthropic says Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.

The announcement comes just weeks after Anthropic quietly introduced rate limits for Claude Code. The company said at the time it was aware of the issues, but declined to elaborate further. While Anthropic's AI coding tool has a been a hit with developers, the company seems to be having a difficult time serving it broadly. Anthropic's status page shows that Claude Code has experienced a partial or major outage at least seven times in the last month — perhaps because some power users seem to be running Claude Code nonstop.

“Claude Code has experienced unprecedented demand since launch,” said Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham in an email to TechCrunch about the weekly rate limits. Rotherham notes that “most users won't notice a difference,” however, did not offer specifics about how much usage subscribers should now expect.

The company notes that this limit will affect less than 5% of subscribers, based on their current usage patterns. Most Pro users can expect 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 within their weekly rate limits, according to Anthropic. However, Anthropic notes that usage may vary based on codebase size and other factors.

Anthropic has said before that it's very constrained when it comes to computational resources, which seems to be the case for most AI model providers today. Most AI companies are racing to bring new AI data centers online to meet the massive demands of serving and training their AI models.

Several providers of AI coding tools are revisiting the pricing strategy around their products. In June, the company behind Cursor, Anysphere, changed the way it priced usage for its $20-per-month Pro plan to limit power users from abusing the plan. However, Anysphere later apologized for poorly communicating those changes, leading to some users paying more than they expected. Another AI coding tool provider, Replit, made similar pricing changes in June as well.

In an email to Claude subscribers, Anthropic says it's committed to “supporting long-running use cases through other options in the future.” However, the company claims these rate limits will help them maintain reliable service broadly in the short term.

Update 1:37 pm PT: This story was updated to include comments from an Anthropic spokesperson.

During the first few months of the new Trump administration, the White House slashed cybersecurity budgets, staff, and initiatives. And some, including cybersecurity experts and legislators, are not happy about it.

One of them is Colin Ahern, the chief cyber officer for the state of New York. In a recent interview with TechCrunch, Ahern said that both he and New York Governor Kathy Hochul are worried that the Trump administration's cuts to cybersecurity are putting the country at risk.

“We work with the federal government day in and day out. We need and want the federal government to be effective,” Ahern told TechCrunch. “I think it's no secret that we are concerned about some of the things — many of the things, in fact — that we're seeing with the ‘Big Ugly Bill,' with the rescissions that just passed,” said Ahern, referring to Trump's flagship budget that passed in early July.

Trump's cybersecurity cuts have been wide ranging and far reaching. 

Since taking office, the Trump administration has fired over a hundred employees at CISA, some of whom the government had to call back after a court ruling reversed the decision. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act cut cybersecurity spending across federal agencies by more than $1.2 billion, including cutting CISA's budget by $135 million, all the while earmarking $1 billion over the next four years for offensive cyber operations for overseas hacking operations. 

Meanwhile, The White House's nomination for national cyber director was criticized for his lack of prior experience in the field, and, the U.S. Department of Education suspended a cybersecurity support initiative for K-12 schools. 

“Everybody wants a federal government that has significant capabilities to deter our adversaries that is resilient against cyberattacks and other attacks from our enemies,” Ahern told TechCrunch. “Like we've said publicly, we do think that what's happening in Washington is putting those things at risk.”

While the U.S. federal government shoulders much of the responsibility for the country's cybersecurity, individual states share a significant mandate to secure their own networks, state organizations like public schools, as well as those of critical infrastructure, such as water utilities. But some of the funding for that comes from Washington.

Earlier this month, Hochul wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to ask for funding available under the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP), which provides state and local agencies with funds to improve security both in the real world and online. 

“HSGP funding is vital to securing and maintaining critical infrastructure assets (transportation hubs, power grids, water systems, communication networks),” wrote Hochul, who urged Noem to make funds available “immediately.”

While Ahern acknowledges the challenges with the federal government, he said it doesn't mean the state is “standing still.”

“We're continuing to invest our time, our resources, and our energy in building relationships across state lines, across party lines, [and] relationships with our county and our local governments so that we can continue to provide the safe, resilient and affordable New York that we think has really made New York the cultural, financial and economic center that it remains,” he said.

According to Ahern, Hochul has been vocal and active in her efforts to improve cybersecurity in New York. 

Last month, the governor signed new legislation that will require anyone working with a computer in a state, city, county, or district government office in the state of New York to take cybersecurity awareness training. The law will also mandate state government offices that are victims of cyberattacks to report the incidents to the state's homeland security office within 72 hours, and ransomware payments within 24 hours, among other provisions. 

Last week, Hochul also announced new proposed legislation to start a new grant program for water and wastewater organizations with the goal of helping them fund upgrades that they will have to come up with to comply with upcoming regulations. 

Ahern told TechCrunch that the state government is opening a new office in New York City to be staffed with several technologists, including cybersecurity personnel. Ahern said he hopes to recruit some who lost their jobs because of the Trump administration.

“DOGE says you're fired. New York says you're hired,” said Ahern, referring to the government's public slogan for this hiring effort.

Daniel Liss, co-founder of the social network Dispo and the dating app Teaser AI, is convinced he's onto the next big thing: steelmaking. 

It all started, incongruously, with a few op-eds he wrote for TechCrunch about anti-trust enforcement in social media.

The commentaries apparently caught the attention of some folks in Washington, D.C., Liss told TechCrunch, and resulted in him being invited to guest judge a war game capstone exercise in spring 2023 hosted by the National War College. The war game was very au courant, running a scenario in which the U.S. and China fought for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea.

Liss' take away from the exercise? “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don't have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don't have the steel to make it,” he said.

At that point, Liss said he became “really interested — obsessed, even” with the steel supply chain. “That was really the birth of Nemo Industries.”

The basic pitch for Nemo Industries, Liss' latest startup, appears as though it were drawn from a Venn diagram of two very American anxieties, steelmaking and AI. The company, until now, has been operating in stealth, but Liss gave TechCrunch a peek behind the scenes.

First, the obvious part: Nemo will use AI to optimize the production of pig iron, modernizing an industry that Liss said is woefully outdated. “These plants are run on, at best, Excel spreadsheets. At worst, clipboard technology,” he said. The people who run them have “unbelievable expertise,” he added, but that's the sort of thing that doesn't scale well.

But Liss isn't pitching Nemo as just another piece of industrial software. Rather, Nemo is planning to build its own furnaces. The decision was driven by Liss' conviction that companies that use AI from inception will have a “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors.

In steelmaking, such conviction doesn't come cheap. Hyundai Motor Group said in March that it would build a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana to supply its factories in the U.S. Nemo's plant may not cost that much since its operations will be focused on pig iron, an intermediate product that steelmakers use to make a range of different alloys.

Nemo will fire its furnaces using natural gas, which releases less carbon dioxide than coal, which is commonly used in the iron and steel industry. Liss said the company is considering capturing the furnaces' carbon pollution; tax incentives introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act remain largely intact, and they make the endeavor profitable for Nemo, he said.

Liss' partner in Nemo is Michael DuBose, an investor who previously worked at Cheniere Energy, a natural gas company. “He's built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure,” Liss said.

The startup will need that sort of scale if it's to succeed. Nemo previously raised $28.2 million, according to PitchBook, and it is currently in talks with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A with existing investors, a person familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. The company also has received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states if the company can build three plants over the course of 15 years, the person said.

It's a tall order for anyone to tackle, but Liss said that sort of ambition is required if the steel industry is going to deliver the sort of returns desired by venture capitalists. And, he added, basic industries like steel have historically delivered big wins for investors.

“When you look at the history of our country, many of the greatest companies that created outsize outcomes for their initial investors were in these categories,” Liss said. “Ultimately, what were the Rockefellers and the Carnegies and the Melons and the Fricks investing in? The dollar amounts are so big in these categories.”

Tech Moves covers notable hires, promotions and personnel changes in the Pacific NW tech community. Submissions: tips@geekwire.com

Kelly Fukai is stepping down as CEO of the Washington Technology Industry Association to become chief executive of the Northwest Gas Association. 

Fukai has been with the WTIA for three years and became CEO of the trade organization in January. She succeeded Michael Schutzler, who held the post for more than a decade.

Fukai's departure takes effect Sept. 11 and the board is working to appoint her replacement.

“It's been an honor to serve as CEO of WTIA and to work alongside such a passionate, innovative community. I'm proud of what we've built together,” she said in a statement. 

The WTIA launched in 1984 and operates as a nonprofit member trade association and a for-profit corporation providing business services under the name Portalus. It also offers health insurance and 401(k) to tech companies and entrepreneurs.

Prior to WTIA, Fukai worked for Avista, the Spokane, Wash.-based natural gas and energy services company, for 16 years ending in 2014. The natural gas trade group includes utilities and pipelines in the U.S. and Canada. 

“I am honored to return to the energy sector and lead [the Northwest Gas Association] at a time of such transformation and opportunity,” Fukai said. “Natural gas continues to play a vital role in ensuring affordable, reliable energy for our communities. I look forward to working with our members and partners to shape a sustainable energy future for the Northwest.”

The WTIA announced that Randa Minkarah will take the newly created role of chief operating executive for the WTIA Consortium, which includes the organization's three initiatives. Minkarah has served on the WTIA board of directors for more than six years and will retain that seat, as well as remaining the chair of both Portalus and the board of trustees for the Association Health Plan.

Minkarah is also the co-founder and former president and chief operating officer of Seattle-area company Resonance AI, an artificial intelligence media company. She also held multiple leadership roles at Fisher Communications, which was acquired by Sinclair Broadcast Group.

— MicroVision, a Redmond, Wash., company building automotive lidar sensors for safety systems, autonomous vehicles and other applications, named Laura Peterson to its board of directors. Peterson was at Boeing for more than 22 years, leaving the role of vice president of business development in China in 2016. She was also president and CEO of Sarcos Technology and Robotics, which is now Palladyne AI.

“Laura's rich background in operational leadership, international business development, global strategy, government relations, homeland security, and M&A will be invaluable to MicroVision as we execute on our strategic plan,” MicroVision CEO Sumit Sharma said in a statement.

The company also announced that Mark Spitzer will retire from the board.

— Fuse, a Bellevue, Wash., venture capital firm, announced the hire of Brooke Borseth as an investment team associate. She will focus on early-stage startups building B2B software. 

The role marks Borseth's return to the Seattle area from Moneta Ventures, a California-based investment firm where she served as a senior associate. At Moneta, she invested in more than 15 companies and supported the firm in raising a $250 million fund.

— Seattle's Sarah Johansson has been promoted to head of legal product for Theo Ai, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based startup with a platform that predicts the outcome of legal disputes. Johansson will be working with legal teams in the U.S. to better understand their workflows to enable the design of custom-built tools. She has been with the company since November 2024.

AI is bringing the browser wars back.

Microsoft is launching a new AI-powered “Copilot Mode” for its Edge browser, part of a broader industry push toward AI-enabled browsing. The company is aiming to keep pace with a new wave of startups and claw back market share in a space dominated by Google Chrome in recent years.

Available starting today, the experimental, opt-in Copilot Mode offers a simplified tab page with a unified input box for chat, search, and navigation. With user permission, the new mode will be able to take into account all open tabs to inform its responses to user prompts.

Microsoft says future updates will let Copilot Mode take more advanced actions — book reservations, remember tasks and organize browsing history into topic-based “journeys.”

The Redmond company dominated the browser market for years with Internet Explorer, before losing its lead to Chrome amid the rise of mobile browsing and the shift to faster, more streamlined alternatives. As of June, Edge holds just under 5% of the global browser market, compared to Chrome's dominant 68%, according to Statcounter.

Google has rolled out an AI Mode for search, and begun integrating its Gemini AI assistant directly into the web browser.

In the meantime, a new wave of AI-enabled browsers is emerging, such as Arc's Dia, Perplexity's Comet, and Opera's Aria AI mode. Microsoft partner OpenAI is also reportedly developing its own browser, leveraging the popularity of ChatGPT —  potentially creating another strong rival in the market.

Copilot Mode is available starting today as an opt-in feature for Edge users on Windows and Mac. Microsoft says it will be free for a limited time, but it hasn't specified how long the free period will last, or what changes might follow. Users can visit aka.ms/copilot-mode to opt in.

Google on Monday announced an update to its Chrome web browser that will introduce AI-generated store reviews to U.S. shoppers with the aim of helping to determine the best places to make a purchase. The feature, which will be available by clicking an icon just to the left of the web address in the browser, will display a pop-up that informs consumers about the store's reputation for things like product quality, shopping, pricing, customer service, and returns.

The feature, which is currently available only in English, will generate the summaries based on reviews from partners, including Bazaarvoice, Bizrate Insights, Reputation.com, Reseller Ratings, ScamAdviser, Trustpilot, TurnTo, Yotpo, Verified Reviews, and others.

The feature will initially be available to Chrome on the desktop. When reached for comment, Google could not confirm if or when AI summaries would come to mobile devices.

Google says the goal with the summaries is to provide a safer and more efficient shopping experience. However, the feature also helps Google better compete with other AI features rolled out by retail giant Amazon, which has been using the new technology to summarize product ratings and reviews, help customers find clothes that fit, get product recommendations and comparisons, and more. 

The changes arrive as Google, for the first time in many years, is facing a potential competitive threat to Chrome's dominance in the global browser market. 

New AI-powered browsers like Perplexity's Comet, The Browser Company's Dia, Opera Neon, and perhaps a challenger from OpenAI have the search giant thinking about how to infuse AI more directly into its own web browser. For example, Google is developing an AI agent that would be able to take control of Chrome for you to take actions on your behalf. Plus, the company recently added support for its Gemini AI assistant in Chrome for Gemini subscribers.

The move is also part of a broader initiative underway at Google to make it more of a modern-day shopping platform for consumers.

Already, the company has tapped AI to help customers locate the products they're interested in, get personalized product recommendations, and virtually try on clothes, and it has been developing tools for better price tracking, shopping in Google's AI Mode, and AI-powered agentic checkout. (The latter two were announced at this year's Google I/O developer conference. Google recently announced that getting outfit and room inspiration in AI Mode would roll out this fall.)

Much like Frankenstein's monster itself, the monster at the center of Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein is a mash-up of inspirations. There's Boris Karloff, the original and most famous Frankenstein. There's artist Bernie Wrightson, whose illustrations of the character greatly impacted del Toro. There's Mary Shelley, of course, whose novel the film is based on. And then there's make-up artist Mike Hill and the actor under that make-up, Jacob Elordi, who you see above in the first official image of the character.

“What attracted me to [Elordi] was his gangliness and his wrists. It was this looseness,” Hill told Vanity Fair. “Then he has these real somber moments where he watches you really deftly, and his eyelids are low, with the long lashes like Karloff. I was like, ‘I don't know who else you could get with a physicality like this.' His demeanor is innocent, but it's encompassed in a six-foot-five frame. He could really do a lot of damage if this man really wanted to be a bad guy.”

Though this Frankenstein will look unlike others we've seen, he's described as being “kintsugi-like.” That's the art of repairing pottery with gold, and it begins to give you some idea of what to expect. “When fully exposed, the creature resembles a marble statue from antiquity that has been shattered and fused back together,” the Vanity Fair piece reads.

That's the physical. For the performance, Elordi binge-watched all of Karloff's movies and put Wrightson's art all over his apartment (which Isaac also did in his trailer). “I turned it into this shrine to all things that I felt pertained to the creature,” Elordi told the magazine. “Bernie's pictures were all over the walls. Maybe when you're asleep, or just by walking around it all, you end up soaking it in.”

Which he had to do very quickly because, mere weeks before production, Andrew Garfield—who was originally cast as the monster—had to drop out. It was a blow, but in Elordi, who is several inches taller than Garfield, the production found someone even more intimidating. “Andrew Garfield stepping out and Jacob coming in. I mean, it was like Jacob is the most perfect actor for the creature,” del Toro said. “And we have a supernaturally good connection. It's like, very few words. Very few things I have to say, and he does it.”

For many more words on Frankenstein, including hints at the plot, characters, and more, head over to Vanity Fair. There are also a ton of new, gorgeous pictures there too. The film comes to Netflix in November.

Gamers in the United Kingdom have found a surprisingly simple way to bypass online age verification checks now required by law on some websites using just a video game.

An X user named Dany Sterkhov appears to be the first to discover the hack. On July 25, he posted that he had bypassed Discord's age verification check using the photo mode in the video game Death Stranding.

Sterkhov made the post just days after the U.K. began enforcing the Online Safety Act—a set of laws passed in 2023 aimed at preventing children from accessing porn or other “harmful” content related to self-harm, suicide, and eating disorders. Companies that fail to comply with the new laws could face fines of up to 18 million pounds ($24.2 million) or 10% of their global revenue, whichever amount is higher. According to the U.K.'s media regulator, Ofcom, platforms like Bluesky, Discord, Grindr, Reddit, and X have already committed to adding age verification systems to their platforms.

“Prioritizing clicks and engagement over children's online safety will no longer be tolerated in the U.K.,” said Ofcom executive chief Dame Melanie Dawes in a statement. “Our message to tech firms is clear – comply with age-checks and other protection measures set out in our Codes, or face the consequences of enforcement action from Ofcom.”

But it turns out some of these age verification methods aren't all that hard to trick.

The Verge and PCGamer have both tried Sterkhov's hack themselves and confirmed it works.

Most of these companies rely on third-party platforms to handle age verification. These services typically give users the option to upload a government-issued photo ID or submit photos of themselves.

Discord uses a platform called k-ID for age verification. According to The Verge's Tom Warren, all he had to do to pass the check was point his phone's camera at his monitor to scan the face of Sam Bridges, the protagonist of Death Stranding, using the game's photo mode. The system did ask him to open and close his mouth—something that is easy enough to do in the game.

Warren was also able to bypass Reddit's age check, which is handled by Persona, using the same method. However, the trick didn't work with Bluesky's system, which uses Yoti for age verification.

Discord and Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo.

Death Stranding gamers weren't the only ones trying to avoid the age verification systems.

ProtonVPN reported on X that it saw an over 1,400 percent increase in sign-ups in the U.K. after the age verification requirements took effect. VPNs let people browse the web as if they were in a different location, making it easier to bypass the U.K.'s age checks.

In the U.S., laws requiring similar age verification systems for porn sites have passed in nearly half the states. Nine states in the U.S. have also passed laws requiring parental consent or age verification for social media platforms.

Not everyone is happy that the Trump administration gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its H20 advanced AI chips in China again.

A group of 20 national security experts and former government officials wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Monday urging the Trump administration to reverse its recent decision to let Nvidia resume selling its H20 AI chips in China.

The letter called the Trump administration's recent decision a “strategic misstep” that will have detrimental effects on the U.S.'s AI “edge” for both military and civilian use cases.

The letter specifically called out H20's AI inference, the process of using a trained AI model to make decisions on unseen data.

“The H20 is a potent accelerator of China's frontier AI capabilities, not an outdated AI chip,” the letter stated. “Designed specifically to work around export control thresholds, the H20 is optimized for inference, the process responsible for the dramatic capabilities gains made by the latest generation of frontier AI reasoning models. For inference tasks, the H20 outperforms even the H100, an AI chip this administration has restricted access to due to its advanced capabilities.”

The letter also claimed that selling the H20 chips in China will worsen the existing AI chip bottleneck in the U.S.; that these chips could be used to support China's military; and that this decision will weaken overall chip export controls.

“The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one,” the letter said. “We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.

The letter's signatories include Matt Pottinger, the former deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term; Stewart Baker, the former assistant secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and David Feith, a former member of the National Security Council, among others.

This letter comes two weeks after the DOC gave Nvidia the green light to start selling its AI chips in China again in relation to ongoing trade discussions with China regarding rare earth elements. At the time, Lutnick tried to downplay the decision and said Nvidia's H20 was the company's “fourth best” AI chip.

Last week, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, which highlighted the need for U.S. AI chip export restrictions but was light on the details of what those export controls would look like.

There was one study that saw 0 participants who contracted HIV during the trial according to the data on the FDA PDF [0].

Another had 2 participants contract HIV out of about 2000 "Person-years". This was compared to another HIV treatment where 9 people contracted HIV (with only 1k "person-years" in that cohort). This equated to 89% reduction in HIV contraction compared to the other PrEP drug.And that IS a fantastic result and if everyone could take this we'd probably be in a great spot HIV wise. ~90% improvement over current PrEP is great, and it's way easier to take and not mess up.[1] https://www.askgileadmedical.com/len4prep/understanding/#stu...

They may also have issues trying to conduct robust clinical trials with IV drug abusers. If a subject entered rehab or were incarcerated for a period of the trial, would that invalidate their data? I don't know enough about the subject but it intuitively feels like it could present a real challenge.

Give James Cameron three years to tinker with the same world, and everything is going to get bigger and better. That's the main takeaway in this first trailer for Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third film in Cameron's mega-blockbuster sci-fi series. Everything in this trailer takes what we expect from Avatar and brings it up a notch. The action is bigger. The sets are more elaborate. The characters are more emotional. And, if we've come to learn anything from Cameron and this franchise, it's sure to all come together in an even bigger way.

The trailer for Avatar: Fire and Ash debuted exclusively in theaters with The Fantastic Four: First Steps, but if you didn't see Marvel's latest, it's now online. Check it out.

As a first trailer, this does a great job of teasing the story and visuals while also not explaining much of it. For example, clearly there's a lot going on with this new Fire tribe we've heard so much about. But there are also issues with Jake (Sam Worthington), Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña) and their remaining children Kiri (Sigourney Weaver) and Lo'ak (Britain Dalton). That throughline with Spider (Jack Champion) and his now Na'vi father Quaritch (Stephen Lang) is also still lingering. Plus we get visuals of new places, our favorite whales, and so much more. But how does it all link together? We don't know.

Basically, at this point, Fire and Ash just looks like the next evolution of Avatar, and we are very much here for it. You do, however, get the sense that with two more movies to follow, and the fourth one not scheduled for release until 2029, Cameron is going to make this his Empire Strikes Back. I'm sensing a big-time revelation or cliffhanger here. We'll see how it goes.

We'll find out much more in the coming months, but, for now, are you excited for Avatar: Fire and Ash? Are you still a fan of these unique visuals? Let us know below.

GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter, and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory.

Throw a dart at the GeekWire 200 and you'll hit a fast-growing AI company. Stop by a Seattle Tech Week event and you're bound to meet an AI engineer or entrepreneur. Scroll through lists of top global startup ecosystems and you'll find Seattle ranked among the best.

But the defining moment for Seattle's startup scene could still be ahead — thanks to an AI transformation that's shaking up the technology industry.

“The opportunity here smacks you in the face with a sledgehammer,” said Greg Gottesman, a longtime venture capitalist in Seattle and managing director at Pioneer Square Labs.

Many startup leaders share the same sentiment, given the density of engineering talent that's crucial to building companies in the burgeoning era of artificial intelligence.

“The number of people who are highly capable and super well-positioned to be able to leverage this next technology wave is very much in our favor,” said Aviel Ginzburg, a tech investor who leads Seattle-based startup hub Foundations.

As entrepreneurs, investors, and startup leaders prepare to gather for the annual Seattle Tech Week events this week, GeekWire interviewed more than 20 people across the community to get a pulse on Seattle's startup ecosystem at the threshold of the AI boom.

The optimism was almost universal. 

“This is Seattle's generational opportunity,” said Samir Manjure, a veteran entrepreneur and CEO of Seattle startup Vieu. “We have the talent. We have the tech. Now we need to move louder, faster, and bolder.”

But beneath the optimism, warning signs surfaced. Some community leaders expressed concern about the region's risk-averse culture, the lack of local capital, and government policy as potential roadblocks to startup success.

“There could be way more founders in the Seattle ecosystem than there are right now,” said Yifan Zhang, managing director of the AI2 Incubator and leader at the new AI House.

Seattle is still developing the “density of early-stage capital and the fast-moving, risk-tolerant culture that defines Silicon Valley,” said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Bay Area firm Mayfield, which has backed two Seattle startups this year.

“That's Seattle's opportunity — to build more connective tissue for early-stage builders to take the leap,” he said. 

Several other key trends emerged in our interviews — as well as suggestions to help the ecosystem thrive in the AI era.

Seattle is primed for the AI moment

There's little doubt that Seattle is an epicenter for AI. 

The Seattle region ranks third behind Silicon Valley and San Francisco as measured by the share of tech jobs involving AI, according to Burning Glass Institute, which analyzed job postings in large U.S. metros. Seattle ranked No. 10 in the actual number of AI jobs. 

“There's an immense amount of technical talent here,” said Sri Chandrasekar, a Seattle-based managing partner at Point72 Private Investments.

Other important factors about Seattle's AI clout:

The presence of large tech companies helps — and hinders — the startup ecosystem

Matt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona, said his portfolio companies recently met with an Amazon executive to discuss the impact of AI on business models. The proximity and exposure to influential tech giants can give Seattle startups an advantage — something McIlwain calls “unfair access.”

“There's not a lot of places in the world where you can have those kinds of conversations,” he said.

But those companies can also suck up tech talent that may otherwise join the startup ecosystem. And they may be a primary reason why Seattle has such a small sliver of the world's billion-dollar “unicorn” startups despite a high concentration of elite software engineers.

Recent layoffs at Amazon and Microsoft could loosen the “golden handcuffs” that have historically kept talent within the corporate walls. But their skills and mindset might not translate well to entrepreneurship.

“They tend to be excellent at scaling in large corporate environments, but may struggle in a much smaller startup,” said Niki Parekh, a longtime entrepreneur whose startup was acquired by Microsoft.

Tech giants are also poaching top engineers to stay ahead in the AI race. Matt Deitke, a former Ai2 researcher who co-founded Seattle startup Vercept, just relocated to Menlo Park to join Meta — which is reportedly offering compensation packages worth up to $300 million over four years.

Leslie Feinzaig, managing director at Graham & Walker, said the ecosystem could use more “middle layer” growth-stage startups — companies that have raised plenty of cash and can provide a soft landing for corporate tech workers transitioning to startup life.

“We want more entrepreneurs, but I think we need to show them what it's like to work in a venture-backed startup,” she said.

Many of the Seattle-area founders featured in our “Startup Radar” spotlights previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and other larger tech companies.

But given that Amazon and Microsoft combined employ more than 100,000 in the Seattle region, it's a bit baffling that there aren't more startups sprouting.

Resources and groups that provide training around entrepreneurship could help.

Cultural humility helps — to a point

Seattle startups are like the college students that never show up to class but ace their tests. Bay Area startups are the popular social butterflies that don't have much depth behind the curtain.

That's how Edward Wu sees the differences between founders in each ecosystem.

“Seattle startups are more low-key, more engineering-focused,” said Wu, CEO and co-founder at Seattle cybersecurity startup Dropzone AI, which just raised $37 million.

Sunil Nagaraj, managing partner at Silicon Valley firm Ubiquity Ventures, appreciates the sense of humility among the Seattle-area startups he's backed.

“Folks there all feel like they're in the grind,” he said. “Very few get ahead of themselves.”

But that approach may limit the number of startups that can achieve massive, disruptive growth — and become the next Microsoft or Amazon. 

Many believe Seattle entrepreneurs need to embrace a bigger vision and a bigger dream. “That's going to help a lot,” said Vivek Ladsariya, managing director at Pioneer Square Labs who relocated from San Francisco last year.

Part of that shift means founders taking more risks — and fostering a culture of accepting failures.

“Failure in Silicon Valley — it is no big deal at all,” Nagaraj said.

Capital remains a constraint — especially early on

Deal Value by Metropolitan Statistical Area (2017-2025)

Seattle-area companies have raised $4 billion in venture capital across 188 deals so far this year, according to PitchBook.

That's not even in the same ballpark as the Bay Area ($105.6 billion across 1,545 deals) and well behind New York City ($12 billion across 941 deals), Los Angeles ($7.9 billion across 385 deals), and Boston ($5.6 billion across 324 deals).

Those numbers could reflect the fact that there just aren't as many high-growth startups getting off the ground in Seattle, relative to other top tier metros. 

Or it may highlight the lack of local investors.

“We have way more quality companies than capital available — there is no question about that,” said Ron Weiner, founder of Venture Mechanics, a Seattle-area incubator and event space.

Sure, Seattle companies can raise cash from investors in the Bay Area or elsewhere — and most do.

But having more local angel investors and VC funds around town can make a difference in spurring startup creation, according to Ladsariya. 

“It will catalyze a lot more founders starting companies,” he said.

And just as more education could help founders, the same could be said for potential angel investors — such as longtime corporate tech employees with capital to disperse.

“The reality is the majority of the angels really just don't know what questions to ask despite having the right intentions,” said Peterson.

Startup communities can also help play a role in helping companies land funding. Kavian Mojabe, founder at MediScan AI, said he strategically met with investors at Foundations. “I would not have raised my round without Foundations,” he said.

Government should support entrepreneurship

Several people mentioned the need for support from lawmakers to boost Seattle's startup ecosystem and broader tech sector that makes up 22% of the state's economy.

“I'd like to see local policy leaders be clear about if they want a startup community here or not,” Peterson said. 

The state passed several new business taxes this year, including an expansion of the retail sales tax to include digital and professional services, and an increase to the capital gains tax. The city, meanwhile, is considering an increase to the business and occupation (B&O) tax for larger companies.

“The ease of doing business in Seattle is a big problem,” Feinzaig said.

Seattle officials contend they support entrepreneurship, pointing to the recently opened AI House and Climate Innovation Hub. Both are funded in part by city and state money.

Seattle ranks No. 2, behind San Jose, among top metros measured by tech economic impact as a percent of the local economy, according to CompTIA. It's also one of just a handful of areas to see employee growth in startup and big tech employment from 2023 to 2024, according to SignalFire.

Mark Monroe, a longtime Seattle entrepreneur and event organizer, envisions a model where city and regional agencies “open their doors” to the startup ecosystem by allowing companies to help improve local infrastructure or processes.

Both government and startup leaders express a desire to work more seamlessly together — but whether that happens in the AI era remains to be seen.

“The more friction that we create to tell those people who want to be entrepreneurs and want to build that they're not welcome here and that this place isn't for them — we're doing ourselves a great disservice,” Ginzburg said. 

Just do the work

Kirby Winfield is done with the navel gazing. 

“The never-ending negative self-talk of Seattle as an underperformer, or a market in need of fixing, is patently absurd,” said Winfield, founding general partner at Ascend. 

He pointed to new data showing that Seattle ranks third among tech hubs as measured by return on invested capital.

“Most ecosystems would kill for the number of startups and big winners we have. We need to simply do more of what we're already doing — it works,” he said.

But Seattle hasn't seen a blockbuster tech startup exit since 2021 — when Okta bought Auth0 for $6.5 billion, Twilio acquired Zipwhip for $850 million, and Remitly went public at a valuation of nearly $7 billion.

The city is home to some fast-growing unicorn companies such as Statsig and Truveta. But it lacks “decacorns,” or privately-held companies valued above $10 billion. And there isn't a hot early stage AI startup with massive revenue growth — companies like Cursor, or Lovable.

“We haven't seen one of those yet in Seattle,” said Chandrasekar. “But I think it's only a matter of time.”

Chris DeVore, founding managing partner at Founders' Co-op, said Seattle has the pieces in place — talent, community, capital. It just needs more examples of entrepreneurs scaling multi-billion dollar startups and generating generational wealth.

“Winning solves everything,” he said. “Build — and win.”

Voice assistants are… not perfect. That's me being nice. But if I were to cease being nice, I'd probably say something more like “voice assistants suck,” and I think most would agree I'd be justified in saying so. While no voice assistant really manages to escape that criticism, I usually opt for Google Assistant, which—in my experience—is the least sucky. Or it used to be, but after some recent hiccups, I may have to start rethinking that dishonorable distinction.

Last week, Google Assistant users reported that the voice assistant was bordering on broken. Those complaints across Reddit and X were so loud, in fact, that Google itself decided to get out there and address them. Here's Google's Director of Product Management, Google Home & Nest, Anish Kattukaran, doing some damage control on X last week.

Hey everyone, I want to acknowledge the recent feedback about Google Assistant reliability on our home devices. I sincerely apologize for what you're experiencing and feeling!

— Anish Kattukaran (@AnishKattukaran) July 23, 2025



Pretty bad, right? Well, unfortunately, those attempts at getting out ahead of problems appear mostly rhetorical, because things somehow have gotten worse, and now Google Home is at the center of what I would describe as a reputation shitstorm. According to way too many people on Reddit, Google Home is so broken that some people are actually unable to even turn their smart lights on and off properly. And it's not just lights; if Reddit complaints are anything to go off of, it looks like all kinds of smart devices are affected by problems with Google Home, including other speakers and even (disconcertingly) cameras and smart doorbells.

While Google has apparently promised to fix the issues, it looks like, for lots of people, they've persisted. A quick scan of the Google Home subreddit reveals that connectivity issues and general issues are still pouring in, with no official announcement from Google. Mileage may vary, but if you're one of the many unlucky Google Home users having issues with third-party devices, you can pull open your Google Home app and navigate to the settings and see if the connecting app is still synced. To do that, go to Settings in the bottom-right corner, then tap “Works with Google,” and a list of your synced apps should show up. If they're no longer synced, re-sync the app by finding it under “Add new.” If they're still synced and not working, unsync the app by tapping on the icon and then tap “Unlink account.” After that, you can try syncing once more and hope that it works.

Obviously, having to do any of this is annoying for lots of reasons. For one, people use the Google Home app and smart products on a daily basis to do things like turn their freaking lights on and off. It's also frustrating from a more general standpoint, given Google Assistant's slow erosion over the past few years to the point where some of its core functions have basically broken. To me, this is the clearest indication that voice assistants are in a very bad place, and something needs to be done. That something, if Google, Apple, and Amazon have anything to do with it, will probably be a much-needed dose of AI chatbots like Gemini, but it remains to be seen whether an infusion of a large language model will be enough. The bittersweet news is that it looks like it can't possibly get any worse, though. On the bright side, Apple must feel pretty good about delaying its promised next-gen Siri. Better late than broken, I say.

Mark Massaro has taught English Composition at Florida Southwestern State College for years, but his job became significantly more difficult in 2023. Not long after AI apps like ChatGPT became freely available, higher education throughout the U.S. was hit with a tsunami of automated cheating. Students have been using AI to write essays—and the trend appears to be worsening as time passes. Massaro said that, out of 25 students in his classes, it isn't unusual for as many as five to turn in papers that appear to be written by AI.

When ChatGPT first launched, and it became apparent that students were using it to cheat, Massaro says he used to run papers through multiple AI scanners a day. If a majority of them labeled the prose as generated by AI, he believed them. Now, however, the school doesn't allow them to upload students' work to such applications because it could be considered a breach of their privacy. It also doesn't help that the accuracy of AI detectors is unreliable.

Instead, Massaro says he must depend on his own wits to assess whether a paper was illegitimately conjured or not. To do this, he's put together a checklist of tell-tale signs that a paper is AI. Whenever a paper is handed in, he consults that list. He shared some of those red flags with Gizmodo, creating a clearer picture of the hellish conditions that AI has imposed on America's educators.

One hint that a paper may be generated is a plethora of em dashes. For whatever reason, apps like ChatGPT like to include plenty of these little. Now, Massaro has a test that he does. If he suspects a student of having generated their essay with AI, he will call them up to his desk and ask them to produce an em-dash on the computer. Frequently, the student doesn't even know how to do it, he said. “I'll be like, your paper is full of em-dashes, just show me how you did it,” he said. If the student struggles, it's obvious what has happened.

Massaro says, contrary to the style stipulations of the traditional college essay, it's common for text that was copied and pasted from a chatbot to have no paragraph indentations. The output from ChatGPT and its ilk notably doesn't have any need for indents. If a student's paper is defined by big blocky chunks of text, there's a good chance that a robot wrote it.

If a student hands in a perfectly worded paper that doesn't have much to say, this could be another tell-tale sign of algorithmic generation, Massaro said. While there are plenty of students who may be good writers but may not have a lot of original thoughts, auto-generated writing has several tells that become obvious over time. Massaro describes the AI style as featuring “uniform sentence and paragraph length,” in which every “paragraph is about the same size, with a rhythmic, mechanical feel.” The writing may also have a “hyper-formal tone,” he said, which is often characterized by an “overly polished academic voice not typical of student work.”

Another red flag is a total absence of any participation in the in-class drafting process, Massaro said. As part of his composition classes, Massaro hosts peer reviews and conferences. A student may also claim that they met with the school's Writing Center to put the essay together, but, in reality, did not do this either. When students turn in these essays, they may also include “unusual vocabulary for the student” that is characterized by “sudden jumps in sophistication not seen in previous work or class discussions.”

Massaro said he occasionally hands out personal reflection papers. A student who actually writes the paper based on, say, their experiences working at the local 7-Eleven, will include all sorts of weird personal details that an AI would never think to invent, Massaro said. On the other hand, if the paper is auto-generated, it may wax on in a very abstract way about the importance of “friendship” to humanity, he chuckled.

Shockingly, some students have been so sloppy with their cheating that they've actually left prompt inputs from their interactions with a chatbot in the final essay that they turned in, Massaro says.

It's well known that AI has a habit of “hallucinating” information. In a student's paper, these AI-spawned references will manifest themselves in many different forms, including plainly incorrect or invented information and fake citations. This can create hours of additional work for Massaro, as he's forced to hunt down whether an obscure fact in an essay is real or not. This sometimes includes poring over real academic journals and books that were cited in the student's papers, but that may not feature the citations included in the student's bibliography (because they're fake).

Confronting a student about cheating can be awkward and difficult, Massaro said, although it is usually easy to tell what has happened right off the bat, he added. Frequently, a guilty student will admit that they used AI, or will simply not respond to Massaro's email (many of his students are remote). Innocent students often protest, and Massaro said he tends to believe them.

The biggest disappointment about the rise of AI-writing is that it is robbing students of their ability to cultivate their own intellectual and creative identity, he said. “This is the time when they're supposed to be finding their voice,” he said. Instead, AI is doing the talking (and the thinking) for them.

Security teams have trouble handling a daily flood of alerts. AI bots can help. 

That's the premise behind Dropzone AI, a Seattle-based startup that just raised a $37 million Series B round to fuel growth. It comes on the heels of a $16 million Series A round raised last year.

CEO Edward Wu said the fresh capital gives the company “capacity and optionality” as it pushes to stay ahead in what he calls the next billion-dollar battleground in cybersecurity.

Dropzone's pre-trained AI security agents are designed to act as Tier‑1 SOC (Security Operations Center) analysts. They use large language models and handle repetitive tasks — investigating alerts and escalating incidents that need human review. The agents mimic the thought process and techniques of expert security analysts. 

The idea is to help alleviate the pressure on security teams as cyber risks rise, and reduce the time needed to respond to threats. 

Dropzone has more than 100 enterprise customers, from mid-size IT departments to managed security service providers. Clients include UiPath, Zapier, and others. 

“This is kind of a needle-mover technology for a lot of different security teams,” Wu said. 

Revenue more than doubled in Q2 compared to Q1, Wu said.

Wu said the system's false‑negative rate is consistently below 1 percent, while false positives drop below 10 percent as the model learns each environment.

Dropzone faces growing competition from tech giants like Microsoft and Google, which offer their own autonomous SOC tools, as well as smaller startups. 

Wu said Dropzone is the only company in its sector that offers a free “test drive” of its product without needing to talk to a salesperson. 

“That has really helped us to show the maturity of our technology,” he said. “We're not hiding our product behind closed-door demos.”

Earlier this year Dropzone rolled out a free browser extension tool called “Coach” that aims to give security analysts an AI co-worker in their browser.

Wu previously spent eight years at Seattle-based security company ExtraHop before launching Dropzone in 2023.

Theory Ventures led the Series B round. Madrona, Decibel Ventures, Pioneer Square Labs, and IQT also participated. Dropzone has 28 employees and is actively hiring.

Flights across Russia have been grounded after a cyberattack hit the country's largest airline, Aeroflot, on Monday. 

Details of the cyberattack remain limited, but a pro-Ukrainian hacker group known for targeting Russian organizations called Silent Crow took credit for the cyberattack alongside Belarusian hackers, citing Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. 

The group said in a Telegram post, seen by TechCrunch, that it had taken control of Aeroflot's critical systems, including terabytes of internal company data. The group said it “destroyed” the airline's systems that it had access to. Screenshots posted by the hackers allegedly show access to several Aeroflot systems, including its internal active directory of internal users and several file shares.

The hackers also claimed to have the personal data of all Russians who have “ever flown with Aeroflot.”

Aeroflot's website was currently unavailable on Monday, with an error message saying it had been “temporarily restricted.”

Footage from inside Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport (pictured) shows a departure screen showing dozens of canceled flights.

A statement from Russian prosecutors confirmed more than 60 flights were canceled, citing a “hacker attack.” Prosecutors said they had launched a criminal investigation into the cyberattack.

More printing, less waste!

The world of 3D printing has grown significantly over the years, and with that, so has the waste generated from the hobby. Thankfully, we have researchers like the team of scientists over at Zhejiang University who are working hard to reduce this waste and make 3D printing more sustainable as a whole. The team is directed by Professor Xie Tao and Professor Zheng Ning, who led the group in developing a 3D printing resin that can be recycled over and over again.

The team elaborated on the process, explaining that the resin is more easily recyclable thanks to what they call a thermally reversible photo-click reaction. This makes the resin infinitely recyclable as the molecular structure can be rebuilt each time as if the material were new. This lends to their ultimate goal of helping reduce resin waste when UV printing.

An important factor in the recyclability of the resin is its structural integrity. There is reportedly no compromise in performance when using the recycled resin as opposed to the original, unprocessed batch. Professor Xie Tao confirmed that the resin is broken down at the molecular level and can then be reprinted.

Resin printers work similarly to FDM printers in that they produce objects one layer at a time. With resin printing, beams of light are used to solidify layers of liquid resin that are stored in a small vat. The resin used by most UV printers today can be recycled sometimes, but not easily—especially in the way that this team has created.

One benefit to the recyclable resin outside of its sustainable nature is its economic impact. The resin also contributes to the "circular economy" in 3D printing. It ensures makers have reliable material with the performance they need while providing a reusability factor that reduces overall cost.

At the moment, no 3D printer can say they produce zero-waste, but there are tons of cool things you can print that help make the world a better place. If you want to get into 3D printing or are looking for a new machine, check out our list of the best 3D printers to see what we recommend.

Cylindrical tower cooler designs caused a stir at Computex. The flagship design is now available for around $55 in Korea.

Korean cases and cooling specialist Zalman Technologies has released the jet-engine inspired Zet5 CPU cooler to retail. According to Korea's Quasar Zone, this appealingly curvy cooler has been released on its home turf with a special offer. The black model with be marketed at 77,00KRW ($55.60) and the white model for 79.000 KRW ($57.00), with prices expected to rise after August 25. First impressions are that enthusiasts will be paying a premium for the unique design. We expect that those prices include 10% VAT for locals.

We saw the Zalman Zet5 CPU cooler at Computex in May and noted that the new lineup (which included a smaller Zet4 and Zet3) was a complete revamp of the firm's dated CNPS9000 series of circular tower coolers.

The flagship Zalman Zet5 stood above its brethren with five nickel-plated heatpipes and its range-topping rating, which suggested it would be capable of handling CPUs with up to 200W TDP. As a reminder, the Zet4 is rated to 180W, and the Zet3 for 150W. They all share the same design language, but Zalman prunes back fans/heatpipes for cheaper, lower TDP models.

Shifting focus back to the Zalman Zet5, in particular, and Quasar Zone shares some tasty packaging and unboxing images to give a good idea of the retail experience. It had samples of both the black and white Zet5. In the box, you appear to get a manual, mounting hardware (naturally), a small tube of ZM-STC10 thermal paste, and a promotional pass of some sort.

We also enjoyed seeing the Zalman Zet5 posed on Jet Wing style presentation stands by Quasar Zone. We saw similar at Computex. Remember that once it is in your case, it won't look quite as aerodynamic, though. Looking at it top down, fitted to a CPU, it isn't quite so eye-catching.

In summary, Quasar Zone's unboxing and hands-on time seems to have been dominated by the resident photographer. It hasn't yet delved into the all-important aspects of performance that a $50+ CPU cooler has to meet up to, to be deemed worthy. There's some top competition for simply air cooling a CPU in 2025, and some models can do a great job for a fraction of this price. Having said that, we hope Zalman Zet-series samples start to arrive in the West shortly.

As trade talks resume this week, security experts pressure the White House to maintain economic pressure points.

The U.S. government has reportedly relaxed the curbs on technology-based exports to China in order "to avoid hurting trade talks with Beijing" and help secure a face-to-face meeting between President Trump and Xi Jinping, according to the Financial Times. This follows what is described as "months" of encouragement by the administration to the industry and security bureau of the Commerce Department to avoid any tough moves on China. Although the industry has responded swiftly and positively, not all members of the Trump administration are happy with this ongoing stance.

U.S. President Trump has postured with aggressive stances on trade towards China for years, and made a major show earlier this year of halting shipments of important technology products, like GPUs for AI training and inference, alongside instigating sharp import tariffs that all but halted much of China's trade with America. However, although his administration talked a big game in its trade war with China, a new report suggests that its stance has been far more moderated behind the scenes and that it's now all-but-halted its export restrictions as part of the ongoing trade talks.

The pause in blocks on exports is reportedly an effort to augment the ongoing Trump administration trade talks with China, with Trump himself keen to secure a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping sometime this year. Talks are set to resume in Stockholm, Sweden, this Monday, though it's not clear what progress is expected to be made. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet, with some suggestions that a further meeting between the two countries' leaders will be a major topic of discussion.

Trump himself said on Friday, before leaving for his trip to Scotland, that the "confines" of a deal with China had been made, but wouldn't elaborate on any details.

The more subdued stance towards China and exports to the country have pleased many industry heads. Nvidia announced earlier this month that it would resume trade of its in-demand H20 AI inference GPU to China. Though this comes in the wake of reports of major smuggling and illicit repair operations, which maintained Chinese industry access to this kind of technology, despite the trade blocks.

However, while companies that thrive on Chinese trade are keen to take advantage of this lull in economic hostilities, not everyone within the Trump administration is pleased. The Financial Times reports that a letter signed by over 20 ex-US administrative officials has been sent to the Trump administration, urging it to reverse course on its tech export bans, especially with regard to Nvidia GPUs.

"The decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one. We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge," it reads.

It goes on to suggest that the relaxation of restrictions would embolden China to chase further exceptions and special treatment, support its military development, accelerate its AI ambitions, and harm America's own supply of the much-needed H20 GPU, describing the move as a "mis-step that endangers the United States' economic and military edge in artificial intelligence."

The White House has yet to release a statement on the letter or the alleged cessation of trade blocks.

A huge win for Samsung

In an unexpected turn of events, Samsung announced on Monday it had inked a $16.5 billion foundry deal with an unnamed partner, confirmed to be Tesla by Elon Musk, who says the company will produce its next-generation A16 chip. The deal represents a major win for Samsung Foundry, which has been lagging behind TSMC for a while. In addition, the deal is big news for Samsung's fab in Taylor, Texas, where the system-on-chips (SoCs) will be produced.

The deal will run through December 31, 2033, and involve production of the Tesla AI6 (formerly HW6) processor, which is used to manage and self-drive Tesla cars, at Samsung's upcoming semiconductor production facility in Taylor. The AI6 processor is projected to ship towards the end of the decade and replace the company's next-gen AI5 processor, which is expected to enter mass production in 2026.

"Samsung's giant new Texas fab will be dedicated to making Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip," Elon Musk wrote in an X post. "The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate. Samsung currently makes AI4. TSMC will make AI5, which just finished design, initially in Taiwan and then Arizona."

Interestingly, Samsung allowed Tesla specialists to 'assist in maximizing manufacturing efficiency,' according to Elon Musk, though he did not disclose how experts in car production can assist in making chips. "This is a critical point, as I will walk the line personally to accelerate the pace of progress. And the fab is conveniently located not far from my house," Musk added.

Samsung used to produce Tesla's HW3 (AI3) processor using its 14nm-class fabrication process and is currently producing the company's HW4 (AI4) SoC using its 7nm-class (7LPP?) manufacturing technology. TSMC will be in charge of production Tesla's AI5 (HW5) processor, though it is unclear whether the world's No. 1 foundry will use its N3A process technology (expected to be qualified and ready by late 2025 and ready for production in Taiwan, so a likely scenario for Tesla), or more conservative N4A or N5A process technologies (which are already available at TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona).

Neither Tesla nor Samsung Foundry disclosed details about the upcoming AI6 project, but considering the fact that Tesla tends to update its main SoCs every three to four years and the AI5 processor is expected to land in Tesla cars sometime in 2027, one can expect AI6 to arrive in 2029 at the earliest.

A source with knowledge of the situation told FNnews that Tesla demanded a production yield in the range between 60% and 70%, and Samsung is aligning its plans to meet that target. Mass production and delivery are expected to begin around 2028, approximately three years from now, so Samsung has plenty of time to fix the defect density of its fabrication process intended for AI6.

Current projections indicate that equipment installation at the Taylor fab in Texas will start in the first half of next year, followed by test production and Tesla's evaluation in the second half of 2027. In preparation, Samsung has also reassigned semiconductor division staff from headquarters to the Taylor site, according to the FNnews report. Keep in mind that this is unofficial information, though.

The fab in Texas is said to be capable of making chips on Samsung's SF4, SF3, and SF2 (formerly SF3P) process technologies. It is also likely capable of making chips in the automotive-grade 2 SF2A fabrication process, though it is unknown whether this node will be used to build Tesla's AI6 SoC.



In general, signing a $16.5 billion deal with Tesla is a big deal for Samsung Foundry, which is a major testament that the company can produce chips reliable enough for a major automaker. The contract is also crucial for Samsung's fab in Taylor, Texas, as it gets a major customer. While Tesla's volumes are not as high as those of consumer electronics companies (the company sold 1.79 million vehicles last year), we are talking about fairly high-end processors here, so it definitely is an important contract.

In a massive burial mound in the plains of western Azerbaijan, archaeologists discovered the remains of an ancient, towering warrior still clutching a four-pronged spearhead in his hand.

The man's skeleton measures over six feet six inches (two meters) in height and dates back to the Middle Bronze Age, approximately 3,800 years ago. Scientists believe he may have been a prominent military leader, due to the way in which he was laid to rest. The discovery offers a glimpse into the social and religious beliefs and rituals of Bronze Age societies, according to a translated statement from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Culture.

The burial mound was found near the Ceyranchol plain, in an area locally known as Yovsanlidere, near Azerbaijan's western border. Measuring more than 90 feet (28 meters) in diameter and over 6.6 feet (2 meters) in height, the mound contained 14 one-ton limestone slabs face-to-face just beneath its surface, along with a stone idol shaped like a bull and a circular limestone seal.

Known locally as kurgans, burial mounds like this one were ceremonial structures often built by nomadic cultures, offering valuable insights into ancient societies' rituals and beliefs about the afterlife.

At the center of the mound was a chamber, 6 feet (2 meters) wide and 20 feet (6 meters) long, divided into three sections. One section contained the human skeleton, another was filled with ceramic vessels, and a third was completely empty. The empty space may symbolize the “resting place” for the deceased's spirit, according to the statement.

The four-pronged bronze spearhead is an especially rare find, not just in Azerbaijan but throughout the broader South Caucasus region. Alongside the spear, researchers uncovered a variety of other valuable items, including bronze ankle adornments, obsidian tools, paste beads, and inlaid ceramic pottery, suggesting the individual held significant prestige. Inside the ceramic vessels, they found the bones of cooked animals, believed to be provisions for the afterlife.

For the past five years, more than 2,000 academics and volunteers, both local and international, have conducted research on the Keshikchidagh reserve, an archaeological hotspot. Research on the Keshikchidagh site is ongoing, and plans for laboratory analyses—including carbon dating and isotope testing—are underway for the newly discovered burial mound, the researchers said in the statement.

Old flagship beaten by new turnip – four generations later, Nvidia's Pascal GeForce GTX flagship has fallen to the lowly RTX 5050

Graphics card enthusiast TrashBench has created a video pitching the venerable flagship of the Pascal era against the ‘turnip' of the Blackwell era, with unexpected results. The ‘Voltage first. Questions later.' Aussie explains that he set out to “overclock a GTX 1080 Ti hard enough to embarrass Nvidia's new RTX 5050.” However, things didn't turn out as planned, with the 5050 grasping an unexpected triumph both at stock and with its impressive overclockability.

TrashBench's plans regarding the GTX 1080 Ti didn't get off to the best start with two samples of this old flagship having to be cast aside before finding one that could muster anything more than stock performance. Apparently, it took “days” to get the selected card to perform, with fine-tuning of curves, offsets, drivers, and APIs used – and a custom coolant loop – to rouse this respected champ of old.

We all get old, but TrashBench says that there was a brick-wall limit at 2.2 GHz for the best 1080 Ti he had on hand. Sadly, there are only so many rocket pods you can fit to an old silicon Zimmer frame before it topples over. At this stage of the video, it is admitted that the original “1080 Ti beats 5050 idea was dead.” Actually, things would be turned upside down.

Attempting to give the RTX 5050 a fighting chance, TrashBench also boosted this little card's cooling far beyond stock. As the water block he had was too large for the tiny 5050, a tower CPU cooler was applied to the GPU, with a fat fan attached.

The RTX 5050 came out fighting with TrashBench seeing a 3.3 GHz core clock, a 28% increase on the stock speeds. The extra shot of speed, coming from purely “raw offset” tweaking, precipitated a very respectable 17.55% gain, on average, in the handful of games TrashBench tested for this comparison. Compare that to the extra average uplift of just 3% TrashBench could achieve by tuning the old GTX 1080 Ti.

The end result was that the - already better performing - RTX 5050 ended up eclipsing expectations with an awesome overclock and even better 1440p gaming benchmark results. Check out the charts above.

In addition to this excellent showing for the much maligned RTX 5050, TrashBench proudly announced that he pocketed the top six scores in 3DMark Time Spy for this GPU model. The rest of the system specs were respectably ordinary, consisting of an “5‑12600KF locked at 5.3 GHz with the e‑cores off for all the overclocked runs,” plus 32GB DDR4‑3200 CL16.

TrashBench summed up the whole comparison experiment by explaining, “The 1080 Ti was meant to be the star, and the 5050 stole the whole show.” However, with the rose-tinted GTX 1080 Ti glasses now truly slipped (four generations later), he added, “I didn't see that coming. So, I guess it's good night, Grandpa.”

It's a dark November night in Los Angeles. The car in front is lit by its rear lights only. After driving for 20 miles, it stops, suddenly, in the middle of the street. A man in a dark T-shirt gets out and runs toward an apartment. A woman appears and jumps up, wrapping her legs around him. They start making out before going to get tacos and, later, returning to her place.

At 6 am the next morning his car is still outside the woman's apartment. A few hours later, they emerge holding hands, heading to a local farmer's market where they kiss and hug publicly.

The whole time, a private investigator named Stephanie A., who goes by Your Fav Investigator online, has been sending videos of the interaction to the man's wife, who she says hired her to sleuth for suspected infidelity. Once presented with the video evidence, Stephanie says, she never heard from the wife again, but the video remains on her social feeds. While the man's face is obscured and no personal information is revealed, the video of his misdoings has been “liked” by over 85,000 people on Stephanie's Instagram. Infidelity stake-out videos on Instagram and TikTok titled ‘Trust your gut … CASED CLOSED!' and ‘Pickleball or cheating?' are her bread and butter.

“I love everything” about being a PI Stephanie, 39, explains over Zoom. “The investigation prior to the case, the adrenaline rush during surveillance. I really enjoy helping people find peace of mind or clarity in their situations.” She did not want her last name used due to the nature of her work.

“It's like riding shotgun into someone else's drama.”

With a family history in law enforcement and a background in loss prevention, Stephanie is at the vanguard of a new wave of very online private investigators, often focused on outing cheaters, with each of them sharing the ins and outs of the PI life to massive TikTok followings in the US and beyond. And true crime-obsessed audiences are eating it up.

“People love the tea. It's like riding shotgun into someone else's drama,” says Stephanie.

Once relegated to hidden-camera reality shows like Cheaters, dozens of prominent social media PIs have sprung up over the past few years, focusing on topics like insurance fraud, missing persons, and even high-stakes heists. But by far the most viral videos center on infidelity, with the most popular internet PIs carrying out surveillance and even background checks on men their clients have deemed suspicious.

“It still shocks me how bold some people are, not just lying and cheating openly in public but sleeping over and playing house while their spouse is out of town,” says Stephanie, who has been working as a private investigator for 12 years.

The boom in these investigations comes at a time when online shaming around cheating seems to have reached a fever pitch, the most recent example being former Astronomer CEO Andy Byron, who was caught tightly embracing his company's chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, on the Jumbotron at a Coldplay concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 16.

The couple scattered from the Jumbotron's gaze—Byron literally diving out of frame—prompting Coldplay frontman Chris Martin to quip, “Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.”

Predictably, the footage went massively viral, resulting in both Bryon's and Cabots' resignations and Byron's wife being inundated with Facebook messages from strangers offering their sympathies. The moment has also been endlessly memed and turned into a video game, and online betting companies are offering odds on whether the ensnared couples are going to get divorced.

It's easy, in what to most is an entertaining internet lark, to forget that people's very real lives are impacted by exposés such as this. And while many people believe that justice is being served in public cheating scandals, others feel that intense surveillance tools should not be deployed on strangers, particularly ones who are not public figures.

Still, there's no denying that there's a massive audience for the cottage industry of influencer investigators.

Jamie Cohen, an assistant professor in media studies at Queens College, City University of New York, and a writer on internet literacy, says there's a rawness to these social media stings that appeals to the public.

“We like watching true-crime content [on social media], because we can lean into a plot that isn't scripted or gate-kept by traditional media. There's no executive producer or editors; it's happening in fairly real time.”

Like all good crime novels, the best stakeouts have numerous twists and turns. Lisa Allen-Stell, who runs her own agency, Pink Lady Investigations in California, recalls being hired on a two-year contract by a married man who wanted to make sure that his mistress—who was also married—wasn't in a third relationship with his married best friend. Keeping up so far? It turns out that the best friend was spending most of his time with men, not with the mistress.

Allen-Stell got into online investigating after a “horrible” divorce and custody battle made her empathetic to the plight of women in similar circumstances. So far she has racked up 1.4 million likes on various stakeout videos and stories about her work as a PI.

All of the PIs interviewed for this piece have completed the relevant training in their local jurisdiction, but certification requirements differ across states and countries—some, like Idaho, don't require any. And while PIs like Stephanie and Allen-Stell don't market themselves as influencers, they do utilize popular TikTok formats in their posts. Stephanie often posts rundowns of her meals when she's tailing suspects in restaurants or does her skin care routine in her car, noting, “Everyone seems to love it.” In her recent videos, Allen-Stell demonstrates how to sweep a hotel room for hidden cameras and talks about the HydroJug cup she's "obsessed" with, taking it on stakeouts and flights. Taken as a whole, their channels offer a mix of authority and accessibility—a marked shift from the PIs of old, or at least our collective perception of a PI. Philip Marlowe and Jake Gittes never broadcast from the front seat of their car wearing a Yankee's hat and under-eye masks, but for Stephanie, it's her preferred stakeout attire.

This unvarnished relatability has helped Stephanie and Allen-Stell blow up, with both able to make a living from their work. Stephanie charges a minimum retainer of $650 for surveillance cases and says she has built a “comfortable and growing” career, with most of her cases coming via the internet and her Instagram and TikTok pages fueling “major growth.” TikTok's Creator Rewards Program, which is open to accounts with at least 10,000 followers and 100,000 views in a 30-day span, even pays for views, with partnerships across both platforms adding another income stream to her work. Allen-Stell offers background checks from as little as $20, with surveillance costing clients $125 per hour in most cities and slightly more in Los Angeles and San Francisco, due to higher overheads.

For Stephanie, a financially successful business has brought her closer to her dream of building an all-women surveillance team. She says her clients—particularly the ones who found her via Instagram and TikTok—are almost exclusively women are women. “Investigative work includes critical thinking, discretion, patience, and being quick on your feet,” she says. “I've found that women tend to blend in more easily during surveillance and often have a sharper eye for detail.”

PI work calls for empathy and emotional intelligence, she adds, “especially since the majority of my clients are women navigating deeply personal situations. Plus, it would be cool to have an all-woman team, especially in a male-dominated industry.”

Based in Queensland, Australia, Cassie Crofts, aka Venus Investigations, is also focused on safety, with a team of investigators offering women background checks on potential dates or flatmates. Marketing herself as “Part detective, part BFF, 100% confidential,” her confessional-style TikToks have racked up over 39,000 likes.

Crofts got into the industry when, over a glass of wine, a friend confided that she thought her partner was cheating. The group wanted to find out more, but the obligatory socials search aside, they didn't know where to begin. Hiring a traditional “old man in a trench coat” didn't really feel like an option, so Crofts, a 37-year-old radio journalist, earned her private investigator certificate after months of formal training and classroom time.

While she does offer in-car surveillance like Stephanie, she more often focuses on background data for definitive proof, accessing databases available to PIs. In one case, she traced a man's supermarket rewards card to a town miles from where he told his wife he would be—a town where his ex-girlfriend happened to live. She also might ask for information around shared bank accounts. Sometimes, it's even simpler than that. “There was one case where they had access to each other's phones, and I said to check his most frequently used emojis. There was an eggplant there, and he wasn't sending her eggplants,” Crofts says.

Like Stephanie, Crofts says the majority—“80 to 90 percent”—of her client base is made up of women and nonbinary people, and with good reason. Suspecting your partner of infidelity “could be the most heartbreaking, devastating moment of your life,” she says. “The idea of going up to a middle-aged man in a suit and spilling the deepest worries about your relationship and the love of your life is a really hard thing to do, let alone to someone who doesn't feel like they're an empathetic presence. We try to provide that sort of support to people when they're going through this scenario.”

Nicola Fox Hamilton teaches cyberpsychology at Dublin's Institute of Art, Design and Technology and cohosts the In Bits cyberpsychology podcast. She says safety is one of the reasons these investigations resonate with women. “You have men taking ideas from the manosphere, be it extreme people like Andrew Tate or people who are more benignly misogynistic. Women are aware that there are quite a few men who think this way, and it's probably increased their fear so they want to know more about men before they meet them, to filter out that stuff and to actually meet a partner who is a decent human being and who values them as an equal.”

But not every case is focused on infidelity. Allen-Stell says that one of her most harrowing cases involved a 17-year-old girl hooked on heroin and being trafficked.

Allen-Stell claims she and the girl's parents cornered the traffickers at a roadside motel. She says the parents went in and got the girl, and they waited for police. “She was super skinny and vomiting, but I protected her with my life, like she was my kid,” Allen-Stell says.

According to Allen-Stell, the girls' father then began slashing one of the perp's tires, causing Allen-Stell to tap out, not wanting to be caught in anything illegal.

Naturally, online audiences want to know how the stories they get so invested in turn out.

Stephanie says her followers often ask, “Can we know what your client did after? Did they leave? Did they stay?”

But, beyond vague details, no good PI will reveal personal information about their clients; protection is paramount. Licensed PIs are protected by law, but amateurs could be putting themselves at risk of harassment or stalking lawsuits by doing so. When Allen-Stell and Stephanie do share videos online, they say it's always with the client's approval.

Just one client of the PIs WIRED interviewed wanted to share her experience for this piece, and only briefly. Chloe (not her real name) worked with Allen-Stell when she had concerns over her daughter dating a “significantly” older man.

“I specifically chose a woman for the job, as I felt her insight and intuition would be invaluable in a sensitive situation,” she says, adding that she would recommend Allen-Stell to anyone seeking a PI.

While sleuthing comes with potential pitfalls, the subjects of these investigations can also be at risk. The true-crime audience has a voracious appetite for seeing the guilty party punished, particularly when cheating is involved.

“Some private investigators are sharing way too much,” says Allen-Stell. “I hope they're not on surveillance showing the person's actual house. What if a neighbor happened to see? ‘Oh, she's doing surveillance, so that means this person is cheating?' I don't think it's fair to out people publicly.”

But if the internet wants to know something, it finds a way, as a viral June 2024 video tracking down a man accused of cheating on a domestic US flight proved. The video, posted by a TikTokker who had no connection or background info about the man, detailed the flight number in question and details about the alleged cheater's family.

In the case of Andy Byron, of Coldplay concert infamy, there are multiple articles asking “who is his wife?” and speculating about his family. As 404 Media writes, the incident is “emblematic of our ​​current private surveillance and social media hellscape,” where TikTok commenters are using face-recognition tools to identify random people online.

“I think shaming is the extension of the algorithmic flow toward extremism,” says Cohen. “The internet normalizes content as it progresses, meaning anything extreme must continue to become more extreme … We're also living through a period of perceived lawlessness, and true-crime investigations and shaming seem like justice, albeit amateur, vigilante justice.”

Writing on Reddit in 2023, user Electronic_Gur_843 appealed for advice after being “blasted publicly on the internet” for a “mistake.”

“It was a traumatic experience that resulted in me being torn down by hundreds of thousands of people. It was on me for making the mistake, but it was also blown out of proportion. I don't want to reveal too much, but I can assure you it was nothing illegal or bad enough to deem me a 'bad person.' I was just young/naive about the power of the internet and stirred up some drama.”

They say their google results turn up “pages of articles” about them, adding that the whole experience left them “severely depressed.”

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 9.5 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide attempt, as of 2023, meaning that putting a stranger's business on main can have real, and sometimes devastating, consequences.

“The aim of public shaming is to hold people accountable for their behavior that operates outside of the social norms or is considered to be offensive,” says Fox Hamilton, adding that this is usually done with the aim of creating a society where everyone toes the line. But this mentality also means if something bad happens to someone—like being caught cheating online and having your family messaged by strangers as a result—we're more likely to victim blame, because we see them as deserving it.

Ironically, Fox Hamilton says that “people who have that belief in a just world are often more likely to publicly shame or jump on the bandwagon with stuff like this, because they think ‘you did a bad thing, it's your fault, and I'm not responsible for anything bad that happens here.'”

There's also a slippery slope when we start policing people according to our own morals and assumptions. In response to the Coldplay concert scandal, right-wing influencer Matt Walsh wrote on X, “One of my least popular (but still correct) opinions is that adultery should be a criminal offense punishable by serious prison time for both parties involved.” It's not hard to imagine how that logic could be used to apply to a woman trapped in an abusive marriage or to people who don't subscribe to monogamy.

When the target is a public figure, like a CEO, audiences can feel even more justified in attacking.

“There are so many issues going on in the world at the moment with big tech companies, and I think to some people Andy Byron represents that in a symbolic way,” says Fox Hamilton.

Whether they're posting a video recounting a case or posting active surveillance, the PIs interviewed by WIRED all say they are careful to obscure faces and any identifiable landmarks to protect the identities and locations both of the accused and the accusers. In Stephanie's case, she sometimes goes a step further, reenacting cases for video—a step taken to make sure of her client's confidentiality. None of their clients or clients partners have been doxed online.

Allen-Stell agrees the public can take things too far—describing the Coldplay show fallout as a “witch hunt.”

“What started out as holding people accountable has turned into the sport of public humiliation,” she says. “It's reckless. The internet is not a courtroom, and random users are not investigators.”

Perl was once everywhere. Or at least it felt that way. Around the turn of the millennium, it seemed that almost every website was built on the back of this scripting language. It processed massive amounts of text—mechanisms for doing this powerfully and easily were part of the language—and it was even used in bioinformatics, munging and churning through genetic data. Based on one list, the companies that used Perl ranged widely: Amazon, Google, Yahoo, Deutsche Bank, Akamai, Citibank, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, Mozilla. A lot of Craigslist was programmed in Perl.

Even at its peak use, the popularity of Perl was always a bit surprising. Perl is an undeniably messy language. It's often referred to as the “duct tape of the internet,” with programmers joking that it's a “write-only” language: You write in it but seldom read it (at least successfully).

There is an amalgamated mashup nature to Perl, all in service of its motto: “There's More Than One Way to Do It.” Just as there are synonyms in English, Perl has a variety of approaches to writing the same thing. While this is a common feature of programming languages to a certain degree, Perl seems to want to knock you over the head with it. There are multiple ways, for example, of writing conditional statements, from using the traditional “if” to “unless”; to writing an if statement backward in a single line; to even a three-part operator that involves a question mark and a colon. I have a distinct memory, in the early 2000s, of writing code in Perl one day, and the next day not understanding what I had written.

But this clutter and baroque structure are in fact intentional and part of the broader philosophy that underlies Perl. The language's creator, Larry Wall, was trained in linguistics, and his intention was to become, along with his wife, a missionary involved in rare languages. Wall ended up taking a different path and fully embraced coding. But his deep thoughts around how languages work never left him.

Wall's perspective seemed to be that an obsession with linguistic purity was overrated. English has words from French, Greek, German, and even Akkadian, betraying its winding history and multifarious origins. We split our infinitives and dangle our modifiers. We have puns, both intended and not. So what's a little bit of strangeness when it comes to how to write an if statement? Wall viewed evolution as part of the process of language development. There is an organic process going on here, and the final products needn't be orderly. And so, a broad—and nonjudgmental—approach to language construction is vital, whether it's a language designed to write scripts or sonnets.

Perl has its “more than one way” to do things and English has its numerous styles and flexible nature, a nature that can contain everything from cooking recipes to haikus, shopping lists to Faulkner. That is the sign of something that is truly open-ended. As Wall once said: “I'm a firm believer that a language … ought to be an amoral artistic medium.” If Perl has any overarching vision or dogma, it's merely the fact that, perhaps, there shouldn't be programming dogma at all.

To be clear, I was never a deep user of Perl. Its syntax and messiness overwhelmed its power for me, and when I was introduced to the well-ordered structure of Python, I ran to that language and never really looked back. This might in fact be a hint as to why the language lost its luster. Even in 1998, during its heyday, there were suggestions that Perl's bloat might lead to a desire to jump to something “cleaner.” Whatever the reason, Perl is no longer as popular as it once was.

Still, I find myself returning to this strange language, and I think it's because of the humility at its core. We need humility as we recognize that our world is more complicated than we might be able to comprehend, even or especially when it comes to the large technological systems of our own making (AI, cough cough). A single comprehensive theory or model won't cut it in a world of exceptions and edge cases and raging complications. We need slow, stumbling approaches, and Perl's evolved pluralism can show us the way.

Perl can even teach us about ourselves. If I had to choose a language that is furthest from Perl, it might be Lisp. Developed around 1960, Lisp is elegant, almost mathematical in its construction. The “Maxwell's Equations of Software,” as its definition has been described—just to give you a sense of the esotericism. Perl is, of course, not that. It's organic and sometimes maddening. For all its messiness, in other words, it's a language of the people.

And that's the thing about programming languages: They are actually for people; they can't just be parsable by machines. In the classic textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, the authors make this clear: “Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” Yes, the joke is that Perl is “write-only”—but you can always tell it was written by human beings.

A Perl renaissance is, I admit, unlikely. But perhaps the lesson of Perl is timeless. It asks us to be less precious—and more human—when it comes to programming languages and their design. Only then might we be able to bridge the gap between us and the machines.

Why does OpenAI's monthly subscription for ChatGPT Pro cost $200? Because CEO Sam Altman said so. “I personally chose the price and thought we would make some money,” Altman wrote on X.

Launched late last year, the plan designed for power users includes almost unlimited access to ChatGPT as well as first dibs on feature launches, like OpenAI's new agent. The plan attracted, well, power users. A month after its initial release, Altman claimed OpenAI was still losing money on the all-you-can-eat subscription.

Even though Altman admitted the $200 monthly tier was a money-loser, the release set a precedent and ushered in the vibe-based pricing era for expensive chatbot subscriptions.

Generative AI tools are costly and resource-intensive to run, with many startups rapidly burning through cash. And much like how OpenAI defined the consumer market for chatbots with the release of ChatGPT, Altman's $200-a-month price tier for ChatGPT Pro was matched by competitors.

In April, Anthropic dropped Claude Max for $200 a month. Google got into the game not too long after with the AI Ultra plan for Gemini, which costs $250 a month and includes cloud storage. These releases were followed by the monthly $200 Cursor Ultra plan, for AI-assisted coding, and the $200 monthly Perplexity Max plan, for AI-powered search. The most recent addition to the trend, xAI's SuperGrok plan, is also the most expensive at $300.

Despite this trend in pricing for the most expensive tier, many of the companies continue to offer free, albeit limited, access to their generative AI tools as well as a $20-a-month plan for users who want more access to the models but aren't going buck wild with it.

“This higher-tier subscription is first testing for new interfaces and new interactions,” says Allie K. Miller, an influential business consultant who subscribes to many of the most expensive plans. She sorts who's actually paying for these $200-and-up plans into two core groups. First, you have a faction of Silicon Valley insiders who have money to burn and want to experiment with “alpha products that are on the more expensive side.” For this group the value is not really about making money with the tools. “It gives them not only cachet in their community, but they feel like a new-age explorer,” she says. Miller lumps Google Glass and Apple Vision Pro owners into this same group.

The second core group of subs, as Miller describes it, believes they are getting a solid return on their investment. “We're making back that money with time saved or revenue earned in very little time,” she says. This could include Silicon Valley investors who are trying to use AI Ultra to automate email communications, software developers who are using Claude Max to code for hours every day, and investment bankers who are turning to Perplexity Max for daily market updates. Dmitry Shevelenko, the chief business officer at Perplexity, claims that a majority of subscribers to the Max plan use it as a money making tool.

“I probably saved a lot more than $200 per month for a long time by talking to Claude about my mortgage,” says Scott White, Anthropic's head of product for Claude. He thinks of Claude Max subscribers “as people with a builder mentality, a problem-solving mentality who are sophisticated enough and motivated enough to get all of the use and power output.” White used the generative AI tool to help decide how much of his home mortgage to pay down as well as other personal financial analysis.

Why the $200 price tag, though? White declined to discuss specifics about the economics of Claude Max's pricing and whether Anthropic is losing money on the plan. He brought the conversation back to the value provided by Anthropic to power users and how the abilities of AI tools are improving. “It's a very dynamic environment,” says White. “We are going to be adaptable. The market is going to be adaptable.”

Leaders at Google are also keeping an eye on the competition when it comes to pricing the company's most expensive AI subscription. “We look at what makes sense in terms of the market landscape,” says Shimrit Ben-Yair, a vice president of Google One and Google Photos. She lists the cost to provide the included features and the perceived value to consumers as two additional factors contributing to why Google picked $250 a month for its AI Ultra plan. Google did not respond to follow-up messages asking whether the company is losing money by providing this to power users.

OpenAI and Cursor declined to comment for this story.

As a non-builder normie, paying that much for any AI tool is impossible to justify as part of my budget. I canceled my ChatGPT Pro subscription almost immediately after I finished testing the new agent feature for work. When the recurring $18 charge for Netflix is on the bubble, allocating $200 every month to an AI tool feels laughable. In this economy? Be real. But, leaders at AI companies are hopeful that those top-shelf plans, which are pleasing power users now, will attract more mainstream subscribers in the future.

Ben-Yair considers Google's $20-a-month plan for basic Gemini access as already having reached mainstream adoption from consumers, with the $250-a-month tier potentially following soon behind. “It's true that while it skews a bit more professional today,” Ben-Yair says, “my personal passion is the consumer space and what it can unlock.” Anthropic's White hopes to cultivate additional power users for Claude by making the tool simpler to use and providing more user guidance inside the chatbot.

Even if the companies were able to convert more everyday people into power users who are willing to pay multiple hundreds a month for AI access—a tough sell for the millions of Americans living paycheck to paycheck—it remains unclear how long OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others can even can afford to offer this high-level access to generative AI tools.

One thing that is almost for certain, though, is that the cost of these plans won't stay stagnant in the coming years. They will just get more expensive. “We have not hit the ceiling on the cost of these systems, particularly in the enterprise space,” says Miller. When the market price is set by vibes, truly anything is possible.

Hi, we're Shraman and Shreyas Kar, brothers and founders of Golpo: the most powerful AI video generator for explainer videos. Golpo turns your documents, internal workflows (PDFs, Jira boards, GitHub repos, Google Calendars, etc.) into fully produced, customizable explainer videos through our platform or API in any language. Our videos can be used for anything from creating complex workflows, product demos, technical papers, or even stories starring your baby cousin and Captain Underpants in Bengali.

Ask: Try it: video.golpoai.com

Reach out: If you want to use our API or generate videos at scale, email us at founders@golpoai.com. We'd love to chat.

Here is a video made by Golpo explaining Golpo.

https://youtu.be/3jyBks8QxQo







Videos are incredibly time-consuming and tedious to make. You need to be an expert in video editing, sourcing, storyboarding etc…

But videos are the most engaging format to communicate information. A video can change someone's mind in a way almost no other medium can.

Today, AI video models, like Sora and Veo 3, are not practical for communicating real information. They are great at making cinematic videos but cannot explain a 10-step onboarding flow, walk through a Github repo, train your team, or teach multivariable calculus. If you need to actually communicate something, no AI video tool would be useful for you.

We have built a proprietary video generation engine to generate explainer videos from your documents.

Golpo is built specifically for use cases on explaining, learning, and reporting, and feels authentic and engaging in a way no other AI video generator does.

After Golpo generates a video, you can fully customize its animations frame by frame. Also you can make a video anywhere form 15 seconds to 30 minutes

We are both brothers and Stanford CS students and have been building together our entire lives.

More than 11,000 additional women opted for the most effective form of birth control-long-acting reversible contraception (LARC)-within just 15 months of B.C. making prescription contraception free.

New research from the University of British Columbia and collaborators shows a 49-per-cent jump in LARC dispensations after the province introduced universal, no-cost coverage in April 2023. That's a seismic shift in how reproductive-aged women are managing their reproductive choice, the researchers say. The study tracked nearly 860,000 women aged 15–49 and found that cost had been a major barrier to accessing the most effective methods like intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants, which can cost up to $450 out of pocket.

The policy was not promoted heavily through advertisements and such-just standard government announcements with a simple promise: You won't pay a cent. And that was enough to tip the scales for thousands of women who had been priced out of the most effective options.

LARC methods are 10 times more effective than the birth control pill or condoms. By removing the cost barrier, B.C. has found a straightforward way to prevent unintended pregnancy and promote reproductive autonomy.

According to lead author Dr. Laura Schummers, assistant professor in UBC's faculty of pharmaceutical sciences, B.C.'s success offers a blueprint for other provinces and for national pharmacare. With clear evidence that cost-free access drives uptake of the most effective contraception, the case for scaling up is stronger than ever.

Apart from carrying the information to encode proteins in, RNA molecules can adopt intricate 2D and 3D structures. Specifically, the same RNA molecule can switch between ON and OFF structures, modulating the ability of ribosomes to bind to the RNA and translate it into proteins. A new study, led by University of Groningen molecular biologist Danny Incarnato and authored by postdoctoral researcher Dr Ivana Borovska, identifies hundreds of such regulatory RNA switches in E.coli bacteria and human cells. It was published in Nature Biotechnology on 25 July.

Several years ago, Incarnato developed a method to map the alternative shapes adopted by RNA molecules in living cells. Using this method, he identified regions of RNA capable of shapeshifting between two different structures, each with its own effect. Incarnato: 'The ability of RNA to switch between alternative structures usually implies some sort of regulation, similar to an ON-OFF switch.'

Incarnato's team has now used this method to study the complexity of RNA structures in living cells. Moreover, they developed a new tool that leverages evolutionary information to identify functional RNA structural switches with high accuracy. They used the tool to uncover hundreds of them. One example is a switch that reacts to temperature and helps bacteria to respond to cold stress. Incarnato: 'Identifying a significant number of switches is a first step. The next step is to find ways to influence their functioning.' For example, small molecules could be designed to modulate these switches, which could ultimately lead to new treatments for diseases.

The current research, which has taken more than three years to complete, builds on some six years of fundamental research into the detection of 2D RNA shapes. Incarnato: 'This is revolutionary, something the whole field has been seeking for years.'

Patients who develop alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) after major surgery face significantly higher risks of complications, longer hospital stays, and increased health care costs, according to a study published in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons (JACS). The findings underscore the need for screening before surgery and targeted interventions. 

Using the National Inpatient Sample (2016–2019), researchers analyzed data from 3 million adults who underwent major operations, including colectomy, cardiac surgery, and liver resection. Among them, 16,504 (0.5%) were diagnosed with AWS, including 6,591 (0.2%) with life-threatening delirium tremens (DT). DT is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can include shaking, confusion, and hallucinations. 

AWS is a preventable complication, yet it's often overlooked in surgical planning. Our study shows that proactive screening and multidisciplinary care - involving surgeons, social workers, and addiction specialists - can save lives and reduce costs." 

Timothy M. Pawlik, MD, PhD, MPH, FACS, lead author, surgeon-in-chief at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center

The study highlights actionable strategies to improve outcomes:

"A patient recovering from major surgery shouldn't also battle withdrawal," said Dr. Pawlik, recalling a case where AWS led to aspiration pneumonia post-surgery. "We can change this by addressing alcohol use before surgery and ensuring safer recovery environments." 

Limtations: The study relied on administrative data, potentially underestimating AWS incidence. Long-term outcomes and treatment specifics (e.g., benzodiazepine use) were not assessed.

Researchers have discovered a way to make the immune system's T cells significantly more effective at fighting cancer. By blocking a protein called Ant2, they were able to reprogram how these cells consume and generate energy—essentially rewiring their internal power supply. This shift makes T cells more active, resilient, and better at attacking tumors. The findings open the door to new treatments that could strengthen the body's own immune response, offering a smarter, more targeted approach to cancer therapy.

A new study may pave the way for a new generation of cancer therapies—by training the body's own immune system to work smarter and hit harder. Led by PhD student Omri Yosef and Prof. Michael Berger from the Faculty of Medicine at Hebrew University, in collaboration with Prof. Magdalena Huber of Philipps University of Marburg and Prof. Eyal Gottlieb of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, the international team discovered that fine-tuning immune cells metabolism dramatically improves their ability to destroy cancer.

At the heart of the research is a powerful insight: when T cells—key players in the immune system—are forced to rewire how they convert energy, they become significantly more effective at identifying and attacking tumors.
"By disabling Ant2, we triggered a complete shift in how T cells produce and use energy," explains Prof. Berger. "This reprogramming made them significantly better at recognizing and killing cancer cells." In simpler terms, blocking this protein forces the immune cells to adapt their metabolism, turning them into stronger, faster, and more aggressive cancer fighters.

Published in Nature Communications, the study focuses on the mitochondria—the "metabolic hub" of cells. By deliberately disrupting a specific energy pathway inside T cells, the team essentially rewired the cells' engines, creating a state of heightened readiness and potency. The altered T cells exhibited greater stamina, faster replication, and sharper targeting of cancerous threats.

Perhaps most importantly, the researchers showed that this metabolic rewiring can be triggered not only through genetic modifications but also with drugs—opening the door for potential clinical applications.

This discovery is part of a growing movement in cancer immunotherapy that focuses not only on guiding the immune system but upgrading its inner machinery. While more studies and clinical trials are needed, the implications of this breakthrough are promising: new treatments that harness the body's own defenses, fine-tuned for peak performance.

"This work highlights how deeply interconnected metabolism and immunity truly are," says Prof. Berger. "By learning how to control the power source of our immune cells, we may be able to unlock therapies that are both more natural and more effective."

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a major global health concern, affecting approximately 1.5 billion people. This life-threatening disease often progresses silently, eventually leading to worsened conditions like liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. There is currently no treatment for CLD other than liver transplantation.

Vitamin D is commonly consumed for enhanced bone health. This study opens exciting possibilities for repurposing an inexpensive supplement as a complementary therapy for liver diseases. Prof. Hyo-Jung Kwon from the College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungnam National University in Daejeon, Republic of Korea, and his colleagues have studied the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications of Vitamin D in liver disease. "Here, we explored the effects of vitamin D on ductular reaction and CLDs, and investigated underlying mechanisms. Our data reveal that vitamin D supplementation ameliorates ductular reaction and reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis largely through TXNIP," comments Prof. Kwon. Their study was published online on 13 May 2025, in Nature Communications. 

Ductular reaction refers to the proliferation of ductular cells (primarily cholangiocytes) in response to liver injury. While initially protective, excessive or prolonged ductular reaction contributes to inflammation and fibrosis. In this study, researchers observed that lower plasma levels of vitamin D were associated with more severe ductular reaction in patients with CLD.

Vitamin D upregulates the expression of TXNIP (Thioredoxin-interacting protein). This was confirmed in a mouse study where Txnip deletion in cholangiocytes promoted ductular reaction and even exacerbated liver inflammation and fibrosis. In vitro analysis revealed the Vitamin D/TXNIP molecular axis. "Furthermore, Txnip deficiency increases TNF-α and TGF-β secretion by cholangiocytes to stimulate Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells, consequently leading to inflammation and collagen deposition," adds Prof. Kwon.

Research that supports early diagnosis and better treatment for CLD is not only warranted but essential. "Our preclinical data reveal a new mechanism by which vitamin D supplementation ameliorates CLDs and support the idea that the vitamin D/TXNIP axis could be a promising therapeutic target in clinically addressing the ductular reaction and CLDs," comments Prof. Kwon.  Further research is needed to validate the clinical application of vitamin D supplementation as a standard supportive therapy for patients with chronic liver disease.

Ultimately, this work could improve outcomes for millions worldwide by offering safer and more personalized liver disease therapies.

Colorectal cancer is among the most prevalent and lethal malignancies worldwide, with liver metastases occurring in nearly one-third of patients and accounting for a major share of cancer-related deaths. Traditional research has primarily focused on single genes or pathways, limiting our understanding of the metastatic process and hampering therapeutic progress. The emergence of high-throughput "omics" technologies now allows researchers to probe cancer's complexity at multiple molecular levels. By analyzing DNA, RNA, proteins, metabolites, and microbes, scientists can capture a multidimensional view of tumor evolution and host interaction. Owing to these unresolved clinical challenges, an integrated multi-omics perspective is urgently needed to guide future discoveries in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM).

The team of Chongqing University Cancer Hospital published a sweeping review (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2025.0066) in Cancer Biology & Medicine, synthesizing the latest research on multi-omics in colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). The article explores how six omics disciplines—genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics—contribute unique but complementary insights into the mechanisms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of CRLM. This cross-disciplinary overview not only catalogs scientific advances but also advocates for a unified omics approach to tackle one of colorectal cancer (CRC)'s deadliest outcomes.

The review highlights how each omics layer uncovers distinct dimensions of CRLM. Genomic studies reveal key mutations like TP53, KRAS, and SMAD4, and show that metastatic lesions harbor more genetic instability than primary tumors. Epigenomic analyses identify DNA methylation changes and histone modifications—such as hypermethylated TPEF or altered H3K27me3—that could serve as early indicators or drug targets. Transcriptomics brings attention to noncoding RNAs and microRNAs like miR-122, circRNA_0001178, and lncRNA-SNHG15 as potential drivers or markers of metastasis. Proteomic data show structural protein shifts, such as increased ECM proteins and EMT regulators like THBS1, which facilitate invasion. Metabolomic findings reveal how altered pathways, including cholesterol or succinate metabolism, may foster immune exhaustion and resistance. Meanwhile, microbiomics links species like Fusobacterium nucleatum to immunosuppressive microenvironments and therapy response. Crucially, integrated multi-omics studies identify patterns missed by individual layers—for instance, how SMAD4 mutations activate STAT3 signaling to blunt chemotherapy efficacy. Together, these findings present a rich, multidimensional framework for decoding CRLM.

Dissecting cancer through a single lens is no longer enough. By integrating data across the genome, transcriptome, proteome, and beyond, we gain a panoramic view of how colorectal cancer evolves and spreads. This multi-omics synergy opens up new avenues for discovering actionable biomarkers, designing personalized treatments, and ultimately improving survival for patients facing liver metastasis."

Dr. Yan Li, senior author of the review

The implications of this multi-omics paradigm are far-reaching. Clinicians could one day tailor treatment plans using personalized omics profiles, while non-invasive liquid biopsies may track disease progression through cfRNA or methylation markers. Targeting metabolic or microbial factors—like modulating gut microbiota or inhibiting cholesterol-related pathways—could boost immunotherapy outcomes. Although technical and clinical hurdles remain, the review strongly advocates for integrating omics in both research and practice. As these methods mature, they promise to reshape how colorectal liver metastasis is detected, treated, and prevented—moving precision medicine from concept to clinic.

Researchers from Columbia Engineering have established a framework for the design of bioactive injectable hydrogels formulated with extracellular vesicles (EVs) for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. 

Published today in Matter, Santiago Correa, assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Columbia Engineering, and his collaborators describe an injectable hydrogel platform that uses EVs from milk to address longstanding barriers in the development of biomaterials for regenerative medicine. EVs are particles naturally secreted by cells and carry hundreds of biological signals, like proteins and genetic material, enabling sophisticated cellular communication that synthetic materials cannot easily replicate.

In this study, Correa and colleagues designed a hydrogel system where EVs play a dual role: they act as bioactive cargo but also serve as essential structural building blocks, by crosslinking biocompatible polymers to form an injectable material. Using an unconventional approach that leveraged milk EVs from yogurt, the team was able to overcome yield constraints that hinder the development of EV-based biomaterials. The yogurt EVs enabled the hydrogel to both mimic the mechanics of living tissue and actively engage surrounding cells, promoting healing and tissue regeneration without the need for additional chemical additives.

"This project started as a basic question about how to build EV-based hydrogels. Yogurt EVs gave us a practical tool for that, but they turned out to be more than a model," said Correa who led the study with Artemis Margaronis, an NSF graduate research fellow in the Correa lab. "We found that they have inherent regenerative potential, which opens the door to new, accessible therapeutic materials."

Correa directs the Nanoscale Immunoengineering Lab at Columbia University, where his research focuses on drug delivery and immunoengineering. He is also a member of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center and collaborated on this project with Kam Leong, a fellow Columbia Engineering faculty member. The study was further strengthened through international collaboration with researchers from the University of Padova, including Elisa Cimetta (Department of Industrial Engineering) and graduate student Caterina Piunti. By combining Padova team's expertise in agricultural EV sourcing with the Correa lab's experience in nanomaterials and polymer-based hydrogels, the team demonstrated the power of cross-disciplinary, global partnerships in advancing biomaterials innovation.

By using yogurt-derived EVs, the team defined a design space for generating hydrogels that incorporate EVs as both structural and biological elements. They further validated the approach using EVs derived from mammalian cells and bacteria, demonstrating that the platform is modular and compatible with diverse vesicle sources. This could open the door to advanced applications in wound healing and regenerative medicine, where current treatments often fall short in promoting long-term tissue repair. By integrating EVs directly into the hydrogel structure, the material enables sustained delivery of their bioactive signals. Because the hydrogel is injectable, it can also be delivered locally to damaged tissue.

Early experiments show that yogurt EV hydrogels are biocompatible and drive potent angiogenic activity within one week in immunocompetent mice, demonstrating that agricultural EVs not only enable fundamental biomaterials research but also hold therapeutic potential as a next-generation biotechnology. In mice, the material showed no signs of adverse reaction and instead promoted the formation of new blood vessels, a key step in effective tissue regeneration. Correa's team also observed that the hydrogel creates a unique immune environment enriched in anti-inflammatory cell types, which may contribute to the observed tissue repair processes. The team is now exploring how this immune response could help guide tissue regeneration.

Being able to design a material that closely mimics the body's natural environment while also speed up the healing process opens a new world of possibilities for regenerative medicine. Moments like these remind me why the research field in biomedical engineering is always on the cusp of something exciting."

A new study of 3,500 Canadians aged 55 and older revealed a strong association between early childhood adversities and depression. Experiencing physical abuse in childhood was linked to a threefold increase in the likelihood of lifetime depression, while exposure to sexual abuse or parental domestic violence more than doubled the risk.

The University of Toronto research was published recently in Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics Plus.

"Our findings shine a light on how trauma in the earliest years can echo through decades, shaping patterns of mental health and well-being," says the first author, Megha Goel, a doctoral student at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging (ILCA).

The researchers also found that a strong sense of purpose matters: Individuals who rarely felt life had meaning were more likely to suffer from depression.

This research reinforces what many people intuitively know-when we feel disconnected from purpose, our mental health suffers. And the good news is, meaning is something we can build and nurture."

Megha Goel, doctoral student at the University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW) and the Institute of Life Course and Aging

Physical health was another important correlate of lifetime depression. People with three or more chronic physical health conditions had 5 times the prevalence of lifetime depression compared to their peers without any chronic conditions.

"The mind and body are deeply connected-especially as we age. These findings make the case for more holistic healthcare for older populations," says senior author Esme Fuller-Thomson, Director of University of Toronto's ILCA and a professor in the FIFSW and the Department of Family & Community Medicine.

The study's findings also indicated that middle-aged adults 55 to 64 years-old were twice as likely to have experienced depression at some point in their life compared to Canadians aged 65 and older (12.8% vs 6.1%). This was surprising, as the older group had a longer lifespan during which depression could have developed.

Consistent with previous studies, women had much higher prevalence of lifetime depression than their male peers (11.6% vs 6.6%).

The finding that one in 11 older adults has a lifetime history of depression underlines the importance of ensuring that individuals experiencing depression at any age receive timely and effective interventions. Although the study was not designed to evaluate the effectiveness of any intervention to address depression, "many previous studies indicate that a particularly promising intervention for depression is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)," said Dr. Fuller-Thomson.

As was outlined in the article, CBT is a talk-based, goal-oriented therapy typically delivered over 8-12 one-hour weekly sessions. It aims to reduce depressive symptoms through a collaborative, problem-solving approach, helping individuals identify, challenge, and restructure maladaptive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. "CBT has demonstrated efficacy across age groups, equipping individuals with practical skills that extend beyond therapy and fostering lifelong coping strategies. Digital delivery of CBT via the internet or telephone can help reach underserved older communities by reducing transportation barriers and addressing mobility limitations and reducing costs," highlighted Fuller-Thomson.

The study was based on a nationally representative sample of Canadians aged 55 and older who participated in the 2022 Canadian Mental Health Access to Care Survey.

"Our research shows that the roots of depression in later life are complex and deeply interconnected," says Goel. "Early life experiences, ongoing physical health challenges, and even whether someone feels a sense of meaning in their day-to-day life all play a role. These findings underscore the importance of a holistic, lifelong approach to mental health."

A healthy diet can slow down the accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults, while inflammatory diets accelerate it. This is shown by a new study from Karolinska Institutet published in Nature Aging.

Researchers have investigated how four different diets affect the accumulation of chronic diseases in older adults. Three of the diets studied were healthy and focused on the intake of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, nuts, legumes, unsaturated fats and reduced intake of sweets, red meat, processed meat and butter/margarine. The fourth diet, however, was pro-inflammatory and focused on red and processed meat, refined grains and sweetened beverages, with lower intake of vegetables, tea and coffee
Just over 2,400 older adults in Sweden were followed for 15 years. The researchers discovered that those who followed the healthy diets had a slower development of chronic diseases. This applied to cardiovascular disease and dementia, but not to diseases related to muscles and bones. Those who followed the pro-inflammatory diet, on the other hand, increased their risk of chronic diseases.

Our results show how important diet is in influencing the development of multimorbidity in aging populations."

Adrián Carballo-Casla, co-first author, postdoctoral researcher at the Aging Research Centre, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet

The next step in their research is to identify the dietary recommendations that may have the greatest impact on longevity and the groups of older adults who may benefit most from them, based on their age, gender, psychosocial background and chronic diseases.

The study was funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR) and the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, FORTE, among others.

Australian researchers have discovered a promising new strategy to suppress the growth of aggressive and hard-to-treat cancers by targeting a specialized molecular process known as 'minor splicing'. 

Published in EMBO Reports, the study shows that blocking minor splicing can markedly slow tumor growth in liver, lung and stomach cancers, while leaving healthy cells largely unharmed. 

The research in animal models and human cells, from Australian medical research institute WEHI, demonstrates the potential of this strategy to target cancers driven by mutations in common cancer-causing genes. 

Splicing is how cells turn long strands of RNA into shorter pieces called messenger RNA, which provide the template for the production of proteins. 

While major splicing carries out 99.5% of this work, minor splicing is an indispensable process for the remaining 0.05% of genes, affecting about 700 of the 20,000 genes in the human genome. 

The new research reveals that blocking minor splicing causes the accumulation of DNA damage in cancer cells and activates a key tumor suppressor pathway that leads to cell death. Remarkably, healthy cells are largely unaffected. 

Although it affects only a small sub-set of genes, minor splicing is crucial for the correct expression of genes that drive cell growth and division – making it a potential Achilles' heel for cancer cells. 

Importantly, many of these genes are commonly hijacked by cancers driven by KRAS mutations, which are among the most frequent genetic changes found in solid tumors. 

WEHI laboratory head Professor Joan Heath said scientists have long known that KRAS is central to many aggressive cancers but have struggled to turn that knowledge into broadly effective treatments. 

KRAS mutations come in a variety of flavours, making them extremely hard to treat, so even with decades of scientific effort there has been only limited progress so far. 

But our approach is different. Instead of trying to target specific mutations that may only apply to a subset of patients, we're disrupting a fundamental process that these fast-growing cancers rely on. 

This research offers a new way to tackle a problem that's long resisted conventional approaches, with the potential to help a much wider group of patients." 

Professor Joan Heath, WEHI

Using zebrafish and mouse models, as well as human lung cancer cells, the WEHI-led research is the first to demonstrate the impact of inhibiting minor splicing in in vivo models of solid tumors. 

The study found reducing the activity of a protein encoded by the RNPC3 gene – an essential component of the minor splicing machinery – significantly slows tumor growth in liver, lung and stomach cancers. 

"Just by halving the amount of this protein, we were able to significantly reduce tumor burden," said Dr Karen Doggett, first author of the study. 

"That's a striking result, especially given how resilient these cancers usually are." 

The study also revealed that disrupting minor splicing triggers the p53 tumor suppressor pathway, a critical defence mechanism in the body's fight against cancer. 

Dubbed the 'guardian of the genome', the p53 protein responds to DNA damage by stalling cell division, initiating DNA repair or triggering cell death. This well-known pathway is frequently mutated or disabled in many cancers, allowing these cells to grow unchecked. 

"Blocking minor splicing leads to DNA damage and activates this critical defensive response, which means cancers with a functional p53 pathway are likely to be especially vulnerable to this strategy," Dr Doggett said. 

"This opens the door to treatments that could be both more effective and less toxic, offering hope for patients with aggressive cancers that currently have limited options." 

To search for compounds that might inhibit minor splicing, the research team turned to the National Drug Discovery Centre headquartered at WEHI, with a screen of over 270,000 drug-like molecules identifying several promising hits. 

"We've validated minor splicing as a compelling therapeutic target – now the challenge is to develop a drug compound that can safely and effectively inhibit it," Prof Heath said. 

The research draws on WEHI's deep expertise in gene discovery and cancer biology, showcasing the power of collaboration across multiple labs and technologies. 

"One of the strengths of this study is the breadth of models and tumor types we used," Prof Heath said. 

"We didn't just test one kind of cancer or use one analysis method. This diversity in our approach gives us confidence that our strategy could be relevant across many forms of cancer, and not just in a narrow set of conditions." 

The research was supported by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC), Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Fortina Hernández is called "the one who knows it all."

For more than two decades, the community health worker has supported hundreds of families throughout southeast Los Angeles by helping them sign up for food assistance, sharing information about affordable health coverage, and managing medications for their chronic illnesses. She's guided by the expression "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."

But she makes only around $20 an hour from a community health organization and must hold down a second job to make ends meet. "They pay us very little and expect too much," she said in Spanish. “We build trust. We offer support. We're the shoulder people rely on, but we don't get fair wages.”

California looked to professionalize thousands of community health workers such as Hernández to improve the health of immigrant populations, particularly Hispanic residents, who often experience higher rates of chronic diseases, are more likely to be uninsured, and face more cultural and linguistic barriers when trying to access services. Studies show their work may reduce hospitalizations as well as emergency room and urgent care visits.

The state hewed closely to a series of expert recommendations put out in 2019 to standardize training and certification, integrate these workers into the health care workforce, and provide fair wages, including reimbursements through Medi-Cal, the state's Medicaid health insurance program, to compensate for work that traditionally has been done on a volunteer basis or for low pay. But six years in, California has backed out of many of those initiatives.

The state has eliminated a certification program and rolled back nearly all funding to train and expand this workforce even though it set a goal of 25,000 workers by this year. Although Medi-Cal began covering their services, participating health plans set uneven billing requirements, making it difficult for workers to get reimbursed. And the state didn't follow through on a planned pay raise.

With federal funding cuts just passed and President Donald Trump targeting immigrants for deportation — even sharing personal Medicaid data with the Department of Homeland Security — advocates fear California is abandoning its health equity initiative for immigrants, people of color, and people with low incomes when they say that effort is needed most.

"We're in a very dire situation right now," said Cary Sanders, senior policy director for the California Pan-Ethnic Health Network, a statewide health equity advocacy group.

A spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, Elana Ross, said "the state has taken difficult but necessary steps to ensure fiscal stability" and that the administration continues to have a dialogue with community health workers. Ross added that the Democratic governor, a potential presidential candidate, remains committed to defending immigrants being targeted by the Trump administration.

There are more than 60,000 community health workers nationwide, including roughly 9,200 in California, and this workforce is projected to grow 13% over the next decade, three times as fast as for all occupations, according to 2024 data from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics. But experts say these numbers are an undercount given the various titles community health workers hold and that many work outside of health care and governmental institutions.

Community health worker is an umbrella term that includes peer supporters and community health representatives. These workers, often known as promotores, tend to be women who work in clinics, hospitals, public health departments, and local nonprofits, places where they are trusted and have a grasp of their community's most pressing health needs.

Besides helping people manage chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes, they promote reproductive health, children's health, and oral hygiene, and they help seniors with dementia prevent injuries and review medications. They can make people feel safe when reporting domestic violence and other abuses. They also connect people to housing and food assistance. “The community health worker is not sitting at a desk,” Hernández said. “Our office is on the street.”

Back in 2019, the California Future Health Workforce Commission recommended integrating community health workers into the health care system, and in 2022, the state authorized $281 million over three years for the California Department of Health Care Access and Information, which oversees health care workforce development, to recruit, train, and certify them.

The agency sought to standardize training and certification, but some community groups feared that would create barriers to entry by not giving enough credit for lived experiences and cultural competency. But just as the agency offered more flexibility and allowed community-based training, the state slashed $250 million in funding last year due to budget constraints. This year, the certification program was officially eliminated.

Spokesperson Andrew DiLuccia said the agency is now considering a program to accredit community organizations rather than individual workers and plans to spend its remaining $12 million on technical assistance, workforce development, and salaries for those working with immigrant communities.

According to the National Academy for State Health Policy, 32 other states offer a voluntary or mandatory community health worker certification program.

Some community health advocates say California's missing an opportunity to carve a career path for this workforce. Currently, some courses offered by nonprofits, counties, and colleges require a fee, a degree, English fluency, or prior experience. Most are concentrated in the San Francisco or Los Angeles area, leaving training deserts in much of the state.

Lourdes Bernis, a dentist from Ecuador, is a model for how community health workers could be integrated into the health care system. She began as a volunteer promotora more than a decade ago and in 2019 received free training from Los Angeles County, allowing her to move into a full-time job with benefits for the county's Department of Mental Health to help Spanish-speaking women manage depression and anxiety as they recover from drug use.

Bernis now plans to become a peer-to-peer support specialist inside hospitals and clinics. Meanwhile, many of her colleagues with decades of experience remain stuck in low-paying roles and can't afford training to advance. "There are promotoras who have 20 to 25 years of experience, but they are still volunteering," Bernis said in Spanish. 

To pay community health workers, Medi-Cal began covering their services in July 2022, but California suspended a planned pay increase for them after voters approved Proposition 35, which hiked the pay of physicians, hospitals, community clinics, and other providers instead. Since then, the state has yet to establish a uniform system for how health plans should contract with organizations that employ community health workers.

"We have to jump through hoops," said Maria Lemus, executive director at Visión y Compromiso, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit representing community health workers. "It just causes havoc, because each plan could have different requirements."

Lemus said it took the organization nearly six months to establish payment with one health plan.

And though Medi-Cal reimbursements are tied to individual tasks, ranging from $9.46 to $27.54 for 30 minutes of work, advocates say they aren't fully compensated for the time they spend building trust and following up with patients. Advocates say these workers should earn at least $30 a visit, with benefits, but many earn about $21 an hour, often without benefits.

Advocates say they're surprised by how infrequently these services are used in a program with 15 million Californians. More than 16,000 Medi-Cal enrollees used these services in the first year, rising to 68,000 last year, according to state data. "I don't think it's reached the potential that the governor talked about, and that we all imagined that it could possibly achieve," Sanders said.

Griselda Melgoza, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the agency, which administers Medi-Cal, has seen "a steady, upward trend" and believes the data underestimates utilization because the benefit is sometimes bundled with other services.

A proposal to assess whether Medi-Cal managed care plans are doing enough outreach and education to enrollees about community health services died this year.

With health funding cuts from the Trump administration and passage of the GOP's tax and spending legislation, advocates fear there will be even less funding and support for community health worker positions, shrinking a workforce tackling health disparities. Already, Fresno County's Department of Public Health said it has cut its community health workers by more than half, from 49 positions to 20.

Yet, outreach is more crucial than ever. As the Trump administration continues immigration raids, which appear to have targeted at least one health clinic in the state, advocates and policy researchers say community health workers could act as intermediaries for immigrant patients afraid to seek medical care in hospitals and clinics.

Without a state certification program, no raises, and dwindling training funds, the path to professionalizing community health workers is unclear, leaving workers feeling left behind.

“The community trusts me," said Hernández, the veteran community health worker, "but at the government level, there's still a long way to go before this work is valued and fairly compensated.”

President Donald Trump rode to reelection last fall on voter concerns about prices. But as his administration pares back federal rules and programs designed to protect patients from the high cost of health care, Trump risks pushing more Americans into debt, further straining family budgets already stressed by medical bills.

Millions of people are expected to lose health insurance in the coming years as a result of the tax cut legislation Trump signed this month, leaving them with fewer protections from large bills if they get sick or suffer an accident.

At the same time, significant increases in health plan premiums on state insurance marketplaces next year will likely push more Americans to either drop coverage or switch to higher-deductible plans that will require them to pay more out-of-pocket before their insurance kicks in.

Smaller changes to federal rules are poised to bump up patients' bills, as well. New federal guidelines for covid-19 vaccines, for example, will allow health insurers to stop covering the shots for millions, so if patients want the protection, some may have to pay out-of-pocket.

The new tax cut legislation will also raise the cost of certain doctor visits, requiring copays of up to $35 for some Medicaid enrollees.

And for those who do end up in debt, there will be fewer protections. This month, the Trump administration secured permission from a federal court to roll back regulations that would have removed medical debt from consumer credit reports.

That puts Americans who cannot pay their medical bills at risk of lower credit scores, hindering their ability to get a loan or forcing them to pay higher interest rates.

"For tens of millions of Americans, balancing the budget is like walking a tightrope," said Chi Chi Wu, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. "The Trump administration is just throwing them off."

White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to questions about how the administration's health care policies will affect Americans' medical bills.

The president and his Republican congressional allies have brushed off the health care cuts, including hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid retrenchment in the mammoth tax law. "You won't even notice it," Trump said at the White House after the bill signing July 4. "Just waste, fraud, and abuse."

But consumer and patient advocates around the country warn that the erosion of federal health care protections since Trump took office in January threatens to significantly undermine Americans' financial security.

"These changes will hit our communities hard," said Arika Sánchez, who oversees health care policy at the nonprofit New Mexico Center on Law and Poverty.

Sánchez predicted many more people the center works with will end up with medical debt. "When families get stuck with medical debt, it hurts their credit scores, makes it harder to get a car, a home, or even a job," she said. "Medical debt wrecks people's lives."

For Americans with serious illnesses such as cancer, weakened federal protections from medical debt pose yet one more risk, said Elizabeth Darnall, senior director of federal advocacy at the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network. "People will not seek out the treatment they need," she said.

Trump promised a rosier future while campaigning last year, pledging to "make America affordable again" and "expand access to new Affordable Healthcare."

Polls suggest voters were looking for relief.

About 6 in 10 adults — Democrats and Republicans — say they are worried about being able to afford health care, according to one recent survey, outpacing concerns about the cost of food or housing. And medical debt remains a widespread problem: As many as 100 million adults in the U.S. are burdened by some kind of health care debt.

Despite this, key tools that have helped prevent even more Americans from sinking into debt are now on the chopping block.

Medicaid and other government health insurance programs, in particular, have proved to be a powerful economic backstop for low-income patients and their families, said Kyle Caswell, an economist at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C.

Caswell and other researchers found, for example, that Medicaid expansion made possible by the 2010 Affordable Care Act led to measurable declines in medical debt and improvements in consumers' credit scores in states that implemented the expansion.

"We've seen that these programs have a meaningful impact on people's financial well-being," Caswell said.

Trump's tax law — which will slash more than $1 trillion in federal health spending over the next decade, mostly through Medicaid cuts — is expected to leave 10 million more people without health coverage by 2034, according to the latest estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The tax cuts, which primarily benefit wealthy Americans, will add $3.4 trillion to U.S. deficits over a decade, the office calculated.

The number of uninsured could spike further if Trump and his congressional allies don't renew additional federal subsidies for low- and moderate-income Americans who buy health coverage on state insurance marketplaces.

This aid — enacted under former President Joe Biden — lowers insurance premiums and reduces medical bills enrollees face when they go to the doctor or the hospital. But unless congressional Republicans act, those subsidies will expire later this year, leaving many with bigger bills.

Federal debt regulations developed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under the Biden administration would have protected these people and others if they couldn't pay their medical bills.

The agency issued rules in January that would have removed medical debts from consumer credit reports. That would have helped an estimated 15 million people.

But the Trump administration chose not to defend the new regulations when they were challenged in court by debt collectors and the credit bureaus, who argued the federal agency had exceeded its authority in issuing the rules. A federal judge in Texas appointed by Trump ruled that the regulation should be scrapped.

Grief after the loss of a loved one is a natural response – an inevitable part of living and loving. But in a minority of the bereaved, grief is so overwhelming that it can lead to physical and mental illnes, even if they don't necessarily qualify for a diagnosis with the mental health condition 'prolonged grief disorder'.

For example, studies have shown that people who recently lost a loved one use healthcare services more often, and have an increased mortality rate, over the short term.

Now, researchers from Denmark have shown that bereaved people with persistent high levels of intense grief used more healthcare services and were more likely to die within 10 years. The results are published in Frontiers in Public Health.

"This is the first study to investigate the long-term use of healthcare and patterns of mortality over a decade after bereavement in a large-scale cohort."

Dr Mette Kjærgaard Nielsen, Study Corresponding Author and Postdoctoral Researcher, Research Unit for General Practice, Aarhus University

Starting in 2012, Nielsen and colleagues followed a cohort of 1,735 bereaved women and men living in Denmark with a mean age of 62 years on enrollment. Among them, 66% had recently lost their partner, 27% a parent, and 7% another kind of loved relation.

Through the national register of drug prescriptions, the researchers knew which patients had recently been prescribed treatment for a terminal condition. They were thus able to contact those dying patients to invite them and their loved ones to participate in the study. The protocol had been approved by the Health Research Ethics of the Central Denmark Region and the Danish Data Protection Agency.

Previously, Nielsen et al. had identified five common 'trajectories' among this cohort, based on changes in the intensity of grief symptoms over the first three years after losing a loved one. They measured this with the tried-and-tested 'Prolonged Grief-13' (PG-13) questionnaire, which assesses symptoms through 13 questions.

People on the 'low' trajectory (38%) displayed persistently low levels of grief symptoms, while 6% followed a 'high' trajectory with persistently elevated levels. Three other categories lay between these extremes: 18% and 29% followed a 'high but decreasing' and a 'moderate but decreasing' trajectory, respectively, and 9% a 'late onset' trajectory with a peak of symptoms around six month after bereavement.

In the present study, the researchers extended their follow-up of the participants for a total of 10 years until 2022, except for those who died or emigrated earlier. To do so, Nielsen et al. used data from the Danish National Health Service Register to assess how often each participant received 'talk therapy' from a GP or specialist, or were prescribed any psychotropic medication. Records from the Danish Registry of Causes of Deaths gave information on deaths from any cause.

The results showed that for participants on the 'high' trajectory, the hazard rate (ie, instantaneous event rate) of dying within 10 years was 88% higher than for participants on a 'low' trajectory. They also showed that participants on the 'high' trajectory were most likely to receive additional health care services beyond three years after bereavement. For example, these had 186% higher odds of receiving talk therapy or other mental health services, 463% higher odds of being prescribed antidepressants, and 160% higher odds of being prescribed sedatives or anxiety drugs.

Differences in the frequency of use of these healthcare services between the five trajectories were no longer significant after the first eight years, but the excess mortality of participants on the 'high' trajectory remained pronounced over the full 10 years of follow-up.

What might be the physiological cause of the excess mortality? The researchers aren't sure yet.

"We have previously found a connection between high grief symptom levels and higher rates of cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and even suicide. But the association with mortality should be further investigated," said Nielsen.

The authors point out that people at risk for a 'high' grief trajectory may be recognizable for intervention early, since the data showed that these patients were prescribed psychotropic medication more often even before their loss.

"The 'high grief' group had lower education on average, and their more frequent use of medication before bereavement suggested that they had signs of mental vulnerability, which may cause greater distress on bereavement," said Nielsen.

"A GP could look for previous signs of depression and other severe mental health conditions. They can then offer these patients tailored follow-up in general practice, or refer them to a private-practice psychologist or secondary care. The GP may also suggest a bereavement follow-up appointment focusing on mental health," suggested Nielsen.

People with dementia are diagnosed an average of 3.5 years after symptoms are first noticed, or even longer (4.1 years) for those with early-onset dementia, finds a new study led by UCL researchers.

The study, published in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of global evidence examining time to diagnosis in dementia.

The researchers reviewed data from 13 previously published studies which took place in Europe, US, Australia and China, reporting data on 30,257 participants.

The research team was investigating the average interval between symptom onset (rated by patients or family carers using interviews or medical records) to the final diagnosis of dementia.

"Timely diagnosis of dementia remains a major global challenge, shaped by a complex set of factors, and specific healthcare strategies are urgently needed to improve it. Other studies estimate that only 50-65% of cases are ever diagnosed in high-income countries, with many countries having even lower diagnostic rates."

Dr Vasiliki Orgeta, Study Lead Author, Division of Psychiatry, University College London

Dr. Orgeta added, "Timely diagnosis can improve access to treatments and for some people prolong the time living with mild dementia before symptoms worsen."

In a pooled meta-analysis of 10 of the included studies, the researchers found that it typically takes 3.5 years from the first alert of symptoms to a patient receiving a diagnosis of dementia, or 4.1 years for those with early-onset dementia, with some groups more likely to experience longer delays.

They found that younger age at onset and having frontotemporal dementia were both linked to longer time to diagnosis. While data on racial disparities was limited, one of the studies reviewed found that black patients tended to experience a longer delay before diagnosis.

Dr Orgeta said: "Our work highlights the need for a clear conceptual framework on time to diagnosis in dementia, developed in collaboration with people with dementia, their carers, and supporters."

Dr Phuong Leung (UCL Division of Psychiatry) said: "Symptoms of dementia are often mistaken for normal ageing, while fear, stigma, and low public awareness can discourage people from seeking help."

Professor Rafael Del-Pino-Casado, of the University of Jaén, Spain, said: "Within healthcare systems, inconsistent referral pathways, limited access to specialists, and under-resourced memory clinics can create further delays. For some, language differences or a lack of culturally appropriate assessment tools can make access to timely diagnosis even harder."

Dr Orgeta added: "To speed up dementia diagnosis, we need action on multiple fronts. Public awareness campaigns can help improve understanding of early symptoms and reduce stigma, encouraging people to seek help sooner. Clinician training is critical to improve early recognition and referral, along with access to early intervention and individualised support so that people with dementia and their families can get the help they need."

A team led by UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers has uncovered the atomic structure of a protein complex pivotal to the function of motile cilia, the hair-like structures extending from the surfaces of many cell types that generate their movement.

The researchers' findings involving radial spoke 3 (RS3), reported in Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, help answer some fundamental questions about how motile cilia work and could eventually lead to new treatments for ciliopathies, diseases in which cilia's structure and/or function are impaired. These include primary ciliary dyskinesia, a life-shortening genetic disorder that causes infertility, chronic respiratory problems, reversed organ placement, and excess brain fluid.

"Our findings reveal RS3 as a unique hub connecting mechanical support with energy production and recycling in these highly conserved, motion-generating organelles."

Daniela Nicastro, PhD, Professor, Cell Biology, UT Southwestern

Dr. Nicastro co-led the study with Xuewu Zhang, Ph.D., Professor of Pharmacology and Biophysics, and first author Yanhe Zhao, Ph.D., Research Scientist in the Nicastro Lab.

Cilia are ubiquitous on cells, playing a variety of roles, Dr. Nicastro explained. While non-motile cilia serve as sensors for chemical and mechanical signals, motile cilia rhythmically beat to propel some types of cells through fluid or to move small objects and fluid in their environment and across tissues.

Scientists have long known that the oscillatory beating of a motile cilium is generated by thousands of molecular motor proteins called dyneins. But how cells coordinate their actions to whip cilia back and forth and where the energy driving this motion comes from has been unclear.

To help answer these questions, researchers at UTSW and elsewhere have investigated the structures of various protein complexes that make up motile cilia's inner workings. Most of these studies have used model organisms, such as the single-celled green algae Chlamydomonas, that move through their aquatic habitats with two motile cilia.

Three of these ciliary complexes compose structures called radial spokes, which repeat many times along the length of cilia and connect the peripheral microtubule-cylinder that holds the dynein motors to a central spine, so that in cross-section the radial spokes look like the spokes of a wheel. While the structures of Chlamydomonas' radial spoke complexes 1 and 2 (RS1 and RS2) mirror those found in mammals, including humans, the algal RS3 is much shorter than the mammalian complex.

Studies by the Nicastro Lab have shown patients carrying mutations that affect RS1 and RS2 but leave RS3 intact have less severe ciliopathies than those where RS3 is also affected, suggesting RS3 is uniquely important for cilia function. However, RS3's molecular structure had been unknown.

To solve the mammalian RS3 structure, Drs. Nicastro, Zhang, and Zhao and their colleagues used a variety of approaches to study mouse RS3, including high-tech imaging from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography as well as proteomics and computational biology.

Their investigation revealed that mammalian RS3 is made of 14 proteins, 10 of which were previously unknown to be part of this complex. By matching these proteins to those in a comprehensive mouse protein database, the researchers identified them and their functions.

Dr. Zhao said several of RS3's proteins are involved in placing or removing phosphate groups from other proteins – a regulatory function that he and his colleagues suspect plays a part in coordinating the activity of the dynein motors. Several other proteins in this complex are involved in generating ATP, a fuel that cells use for energy and that drives dynein motion.

Together, he said, these findings suggest RS3's components are pivotal for both synchronizing dynein activity and powering the motors' motion in cilia.

RS3's structure could act as a blueprint for designing drugs that modify its activity, Dr. Zhang said. Such therapies could eventually be used to treat ciliopathies such as polycystic kidney disease and primary cilia dyskinesia. The researchers plan to continue investigating the individual roles and interactions of proteins that make up RS3 and how this structure might differ among species.

Dr. Nicastro played a pivotal role in establishing UTSW's Cryo-EM Facility, which she directed until December 2019. Dr. Zhang is a Virginia Murchison Linthicum Scholar in Medical Research.

Each cell in our bodies carries about two meters of DNA in its nucleus, packed into a tiny volume of just a few hundred cubic micrometers-about a millionth of a milliliter. The cell manages this by winding the strings of DNA around protein spools. The protein-DNA complexes are called nucleosomes, and they ensure that DNA is safely stored.

But this packaging into nucleosomes also poses a challenge: important cellular machinery must still access the genetic code to keep cells healthy and prevent diseases like cancer.

One of the most important proteins in our cells is p53, the "genome's guardian." It helps control cell growth, triggers repair of damaged DNA, and can even order faulty cells to self-destruct.

In many cancers, p53 is disabled or hijacked, so understanding how p53 works is vital for developing cancer therapies. But there's a problem: most of the DNA sequences that p53 targets are buried inside nucleosomes, making them difficult to reach. Scientists have long wondered how p53 can reach those "hidden" sequences to do its job, as well as how other proteins that interact with p53 manage to find it in this maze of chromatin.

Now, researchers led by Nicolas Thomä, who holds the Paternot Chair in Cancer Research at EPFL, have found that nucleosomes act as a gatekeeper for p53's molecular partners. By studying how p53 interacts with different cofactors while attached to nucleosomal DNA, the team has revealed a new layer of control over this critical protein's activity.

The researchers used a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), biochemical assays, and genome-wide mapping. Using these tools, they reconstructed how p53 binds to its DNA targets when those targets are wrapped up in nucleosomes.

They then tested whether two important "cofactor" proteins could still reach p53 when it is bound to nucleosomal DNA: USP7, which helps stabilize p53, and the viral E6-E6AP complex, which helps degrade p53.

They found that p53 can still bind to DNA even when it is wrapped in nucleosomes, especially at the edges where DNA enters or exits the spool. But more surprisingly, the researchers discovered that USP7 could interact with p53 even while bound to the nucleosome, forming a stable complex that they could observe in detail using cryo-EM.

In contrast, E6-E6AP couldn't access p53 when it was attached to nucleosomal DNA. This means that the structure of chromatin itself selectively allows or blocks certain proteins from reaching p53, adding an extra level of regulation beyond simple genetic sequences or protein-protein interactions.

The work shows that the physical structure of DNA and its packaging in the nucleus actively influences molecular interactions. By revealing how nucleosomes can "gatekeep" access to p53, the research opens new possibilities in cancer research that could inform future therapies that aim to restore or control p53 function in disease.

Two major tournaments in women's soccer concluded this weekend with England besting World Cup champion Spain on Sunday in a penalty kick shootout to win the UEFA Women's Euros for the second straight time and Nigeria rallying from two down to score three second-half goals and capture the country's 10th Women's Africa Cup of Nations title.

While the USWNT was out of competitive action, the quality of these tournaments provided women's football fans in America and around the globe entertaining soccer at a high level. Here are some other things we learned:

The Euros were considered widely successful for women's soccer, and the 2025 edition hosted in Switzerland brought the largest crowd in the history of the tournament. The total attendance, including Sunday's final in Basel, surpassed 657,000, and 29 of the 31 matches sold out.

Interest in the tournament extended far beyond Europe. The Euros were easy to access here in the United States with games broadcast on FOX. According to The Athletic, viewership nearly doubled from the previous tournament in 2022 when England defeated Germany to win the program's first major championship.

Both the Euros and the Africa Cup of Nations featured women who play their club ball in America for the NWSL. Golden Boot leader Esther González of Gotham FC was the top scorer at the Euros with four goals – and very nearly made it five with a wicked header in the final against England that drove just wide of frame.

Jess Carter, who also plays for Gotham, was superb defensively for England in the final, playing a full 90 minutes and making several gutsy stops when Spain pushed to find the game-winner in extra time. She joined NWSL figures Esme Morgan (Washington Spirit) and Anna Moorhouse (Orlando Pride) on England's championship squad.

In total, eight players from the NWSL played in the African Cup of Nations, including Ghana midfielder/forward Stella Nyamekye (Gotham FC) and Zambia striker Barbra Banda (Orlando Pride).

One player will return to Houston Dash a champion – Michelle Alozie, who subbed on in the 78th minute for Nigeria in the final in Morocco. 

As we gear up for a new season of college soccer, which kicks off next month, the NCAA was also well represented at the Euros. Four Lionesses played college soccer for the North Carolina Tar Heels, including England's head coach, Sarina Wiegman. The Dutch manager played alongside USWNT legends Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly at UNC under head coach Anson Dorrance. Wiegman now has an impressive three Euro titles to her name after previously managing her native Netherlands to the crown in 2017.

The other English Tar Heels are forward Alessia Russo, who scored the crucial header in the second half to pull England even with Spain, Lucy Bronze, the tough-as-nails right fullback who played the entire tournament on a broken leg, and Lotte Wubben-Moy.

The USWNT might've been out of action during this window of competitive play, but plenty around the program showed their support for the sport.

USWNT head coach Emma Hayes shouted out both Euros finalists Sunday on Instagram, saying that “our game is here to stay.” Forward Catarina Macario showed up in Switzerland to root for her Chelsea FC teammates. USWNT legend Alex Morgan also made the trip to Europe to attend the semifinal between Spain and Germany. And World Cup champion Carli Lloyd sat behind the desk on the FOX Sports broadcast, offering analysis alongside four-time European champion Ariane Hingst, Alexi Lalas and Stu Holden.

The USWNT also got a look at one upcoming opponent. On Monday, U.S. Soccer announced the USWNT will host Portugal for two friendlies in the October international window.

Portugal did not make it to the knockout rounds of this year's Euros, though the no. 22-ranked team in FIFA did give semifinalist Italy a run for their money. The two sides played to a 1-1 draw in the group stage behind an 89th minute equalizer from Portugal's Diana Gomes.

Aside from Portugal, fans of U.S. Soccer got a look at their team's best competition. As of July 28, the USWNT is ranked No. 1 in the world FIFA rankings and we're still two years away from the next major women's tournament, but countries like No. 2 Spain, No. 3 Germany, No. 5 England, and surging Italy prove to be the among the strongest competition coming out of Europe ahead of the 2027 FIFA Women's World Cup.

The city of Philadelphia is poised to take a significant role in next year's FIFA World Cup 26, with the announcement that the event's Volunteer Center will set up shop in the Fashion District. As reported by NBC Philadelphia, the Volunteer Center will be located on 901 Market Street and will serve as a training and recruitment spot for those looking to volunteer at the much-anticipated World Cup.

Alongside those duties, the Volunteer Center is set to include an in-house FIFA museum, promising to provide volunteers with a deeper understanding of the World Cup's storied past and the specific goals of Philadelphia Soccer 2026. The city is gearing up to host six World Cup matches in the summer of 2026 and is expected to quickly recruit approximately 3,000 volunteers to effectively manage the incoming wave of soccer enthusiasts and logistical demands.

The Philadelphia Business Journal notes the strategic choice of the Fashion District for the Volunteer Center, recognizing the potential for it to act as an accelerator for the revitalization of the Market East area. This section of the city, known for its vacancies and dilapidated buildings, could see a much-needed injection of energy and reinvestment as the World Cup draws nearer.

Michelle Singer, co-chair of Philadelphia Soccer 2026, expressed her satisfaction with the location, stating, "The site is easily accessible — volunteers can walk, take public transit or drive — and it is located just blocks away from the country's most historical sites and the city's economic center," in a statement reported by CBS Philadelphia. She also emphasized the convenience for volunteers due to the proximity to hotels, public transport, and parking facilities.

Mayor Cherelle Parker highlighted the center's significance for Philadelphia, saying, "The center will not only help power critical volunteer efforts supporting FIFA World Cup 26™ but also generate significant economic activity for our local businesses, restaurants, and hotels," as noted by CBS Philadelphia.

Everton are reportedly exploring a surprise loan move for Manchester City's Jack Grealish and believe they hold a key advantage over rivals West Ham and Napoli in the race. The England international is open to leaving City, and the Toffees are hoping to strike a 'premium' loan deal as they prepare for a new chapter at the Hill Dickinson Stadium under new ownership.

The Atlanta United Unified Team presented by Gallagher has traveled to Houston, Texas to participate in the Genuine World Cup, an international competition with teams from over 30 countries, that raises awareness for the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities and autism. This is the first time Atlanta's Unified Team participates in an internationally renowned competition, and they will be one of the only two MLS teams in the tournament.

In 2017, Spanish sports club Gimnàstic de Tarragona, organized the Champions Genuine, an international soccer tournament for people with intellectual disabilities. In the same year, LaLiga Genuine was born, the first official soccer league in the world consisting of teams of people with intellectual disabilities, organized through the LaLiga Foundation. The Genuine World Cup was the league's inaugural event.

The inaugural Genuine World Cup 2024 (GWC) was held on August 3, 2024 in Houston, Texas, raising awareness for the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities and autism. GWC offers an opportunity to experience the values of ‘genuine soccer' through a 12-team tournament featuring athletes with intellectual or neurological differences.

Teams for the inaugural season included Houston Dynamo FC, Inter Miami and Special Olympics Texas from the US; Club Tigres, Querétaro FC and Mexico DI National Team, Sporting Clube de Portugal and SL Benfica from Portugal; and Athletic Club Fundazioa, Fundació Barça, Valencia CF and Nàstic de Tarragona from Spain.

You can follow the competition on Atlanta United's Digital platforms.

There will be a total of 38 teams participating in the 2025 edition of the tournament. Atlanta United and Inter Miami CF are the only two MLS clubs with representation in the competition.

Europe has the majority of participants, including soccer powerhouses FC Barcelona, Manchester City, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayer Leverkusen, AS Roma and Atlanta United's first opponent in the tournament, Ajax. South American clubs such as Boca Juniors and Corinthians are also among the participating clubs.

There are also a few national representatives, such as a team from the Mexican Federation and the Puerto Rican Federation. See the list below for all participating teams:

Atlanta United Unified will play their first match of the competition vs Dutch powehouse Ajax on Tuesday, July 29 (time TBD). Depending on the result of that match, we will know who Atlanta's next opponent is.

Here are a few more things to know about the Atlanta United Unified Team:

The Unified program is a league-wide initiative that began in 2013 as a part of MLS Works, Major League Soccer's community outreach program, in partnership with Special Olympics North America (SONA). The goal of the program was to bring soccer to athletes with intellectual disabilities.

For Atlanta, the Unified Team has been baked into the club's identity since the very beginning. When Atlanta United joined the league as an expansion side in 2017, Unified already existed in MLS. Atlanta United's founding president Darren Eales and current Director of Community Engagement Marissa Ahrens were both passionate about Atlanta having a Unified Team and made it a priority for the new club.

The Atlanta United Unified Team played its first season in 2017, just like the first team. That first year, there were 14 members and the team played two matches, one home and one away against Orlando City SC.

Atlanta United remains undefeated over the last two seasons and in 2025 has one win, two draws and one more home match pending August 24 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium vs Toronto FC to close out the Unified season.

The Unified team includes a combination of individuals with intellectual disabilities (Special Olympics athletes) and individuals without intellectual disabilities (Unified partners) as members of one team. This year, the team consists of eight athletes and 10 partners. Athletes are in the age range of 16-25. Since 2022, the team has held tryouts, which are open to anyone who wanted to join.

Like the first team, the group wears matching gear for training sessions. For matches, the Unified team is outfitted in authentic uniforms provided by adidas. During one of the first training sessions of the year, players were surprised before practice at the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Training Ground. All the players received personalized travel bags and training gear.

For the Genuine World Cup, only Special Olympics athletes are elegible to play.

Juventus star Tim Weah's agent has lashed out at the Serie A giants' handling of his ongoing transfer saga, going so far as to accuse one of the people involved of “disrespect” towards the U.S. international.

Since leaving Lille in 2023 for just over €10 million, Weah has struggled to find his feet at the Old Lady, appearing primarily as a substitute throughout his two seasons in Italy, scoring just seven goals in 78 games.

Now with three years remaining on his contract and a new head coach in place in Igor Tudor, Juventus is attempting to move Weah on. A move was proposed in June that would have seen the 25-year-old swap Serie A for the Premier League, with him and now-ex-teammate Samuel Mbangula moving to Nottingham Forest for $25.7 million

Weah turned the move down with his focus being a return to Ligue 1, while Mbangula was eventually sold to Bundesliga side Werder Bremen. Subsequently, Weah has been heavily linked with a transfer to Marseille, but it appears the teams have hit an impasse, with the French side not willing to move from its $17.6 million offer, while Juventus is seeking $23.5 million, per The Athletic.

In response to the frustrating situation for his client, Weah's agent Badou Sambague has said in a statement, “The sporting department is managed by three persons. Two have class, and another is still searching himself [sic]. We cannot blame him.

“Two are looking for solutions, and one is creating problems. And we can't let that go. Tim Weah, is always professional, was left out during the [FIFA Club] World Cup. This person botched his [Club] World Cup, tried to force him to go where he wanted.

“Today, as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us.

“These are old-fashioned methods that won't sit well with me. I'm not used to speaking out, but not doing so today would be accepting the unacceptable and total disrespect. Class can't be bought for a manager, that's for sure, but it has always been part of the history of Juventus. One person is undermining that. Let's see…”

The Club World Cup, which was held in the U.S. and ultimately won by Chelsea, saw Weah make just one appearance for Juventus, playing 45 minutes in a 5-0 win against Al-Ain in their group opener.

As a result of being named to Juventus' roster for the CWC, Weah was forced to miss the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where Mauricio Pochettino's side went undefeated en route to the final, ultimately losing 2-1 to Mexico.

Weah will likely be keen to avoid missing any more USMNT games in the coming months, with the U.S. set to co-host the World Cup next summer along with Mexico and Canada. To date, since Pochettino took charge of the USMNT in September, Weah has made just three appearances, starting all three.

U.S. men's national team winger Tim Weah's agent has come out and blasted Juventus for holding up a summer transfer to Olympique Marseille. 

Weah has been linked with a move to Marseille this summer after turning down a proposed deal to Nottingham Forest in the Premier League. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Lille player is thought to be prioritizing a return to France ahead of a pivotal season preparing to fight for a starting role in Mauricio Pochettino's side at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

The USMNT forward, who was absent from the Concacaf Gold Cup squad this summer amid club commitments for the FIFA Club World Cup, is in transfer limbo given the French side won't budge from an offer of €15 million ($17.6 million), The Athletic reports. The 25-year-old made just one appearance in the Club World Cup coming off the bench in Juventus's group stage opener against Al Ain.

Badou Sambague, Weah's agent, released a statement of frustration amid stalling transfer talks.

“Juve is a fantastic club,” he told The Athletic. “The sporting department is managed by three persons. Two have class, and another is still searching himself [sic]. We cannot blame him. Two are looking for solutions, and one is creating problems. And we can't let that go. 

“Tim Weah, is always professional, was left out during the [Club] World Cup. This person botched his [Club] World Cup, tried to force him to go where he wanted. Today, as revenge, he's demanding a fortune and waiting for a Premier League offer that won't come and will never be approved by us.

“These are old-fashioned methods that won't sit well with me. I'm not used to speaking out, but not doing so today would be accepting the unacceptable and total disrespect. Class can't be bought for a manager, that's for sure, but it has always been part of the history of Juventus. One person is undermining that. Let's see...”

The player's side believes an offer was previously accepted by Juventus general manager Damien Comolli, but the club are now thought to be pushing for a €20 million ($23.5 million) figure. Both teams involved in the transfer are competing in the Champions League this upcoming season, but Weah is reportedly interested in playing for Roberto De Zerbi in Marseille.

Weah has three years left on his Juventus contract and seemingly is upset by a missed opportunity to represent his country and impress Pochettino in the Gold Cup.

With the 2026 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, football fans around the world are starting to look for information about tickets for the opening match, which will take place in Mexico at the legendary Estadio Azteca —now known as Estadio Banorte— on Thursday, June 11, 2026. One of the top Google Trends questions is: How much does the cheapest ticket cost to attend the 2026 World Cup opening match?

The first thing you should know is that FIFA has not yet released individual ticket sales for the opening match. For now, the only way to get a ticket to the opening match is by purchasing a hospitality package called Venue Series, which includes tickets for all five matches to be played at Estadio Azteca and premium services such as food, drinks, VIP lounges, and personalized service.

This means that you cannot purchase a standalone ticket for the opening match. All available categories include this game as part of a full package.

According to the official sales system from On Location, the authorized FIFA Hospitality operator, the cheapest ticket for the opening match is part of the FIFA Pavilion Standard package, which includes entry to the five matches scheduled at Estadio Azteca.

In this package, the estimated cost of the opening match —based on the official cart breakdown— is:

It is important to note that you cannot purchase only the June 11 ticket. This price is part of a complete package with the following features:

The full price of the FIFA Pavilion Standard package, which includes all five matches, is:

FIFA has announced that registration for general ticket sales without hospitality will open in September 2025.

The 2026 opening match will mark a historic milestone: the Estadio Azteca will become the first stadium in the world to host three World Cup openers (1970, 1986, and now 2026). This prestige has increased demand and interest in attending this match, making its tickets the most sought-after of the tournament.

Before talking about prices, it's important to remember that the Estadio Azteca, or Estadio Banorte, will host five matches in total during the 2026 World Cup:

This makes Azteca the Mexican stadium with the most assigned matches, ahead of Estadio Akron in Guadalajara (4 group stage matches) and Estadio BBVA in Monterrey (3 group matches and one Round of 32).

Sunderland are reportedly interested in signing Real Madrid forward Gonzalo Garcia.

A fee of £13m has been mooted for the 21-year-old and his capture would be a stunning one if the Black Cats can pull it off.

Potential signings were a hot topic after Sunderland's 3-0 defeat to Hearts and ahead of tonight's latest pre-season clash against Hull City.

Head coach Regis Le Bris spoke to the media and was asked for the latest on whether further incomings are imminent following rumours of a move to sign Granit Xhaka.

The manager admitted the club “have to reinforce this squad to be stronger” and described the window as “unpredictable”.

He told the press: “All I can say right now is that we are trying our best to improve the team. We will have to see what happens.

"If you look at the Hearts game, then it looks as though we are far away from where we need to be. That is clear. But at the same time, it is always a work in progress.

“Maybe you get confidence against a certain type of team or a certain style of play, but then later, if you don't play with the right level of intensity, you can be surprised, and I think the game against Hearts was part of that process. So it was useful. Tough, but useful.

“Then, when it comes to where the squad is at, we will see. It is still unpredictable, so we always have to manage the players we have and be confident with them.

“But at the same time, we are not naive and we know we have to reinforce this squad to be stronger.”

A new centre-forward to rival Eliezer Mayenda and Wilson Isidor appears to be on the to-do list, with Garcia of interest. Now, a new update has emerged regarding a deal with those at the Bernabeu.

According to reports in Spain, Sunderland have now submitted an offer to sign Garcia from Real Madrid worth an initial £13m.

The total package includes another £4.3m in add-ons and a 30% sell-on clause, with the Black Cats wanting ‘to close the deal quickly'.

Garcia recently starred at the Club World Cup, scoring four goals and providing one assist in six games for Real in the USA, being dubbed a “goal machine” in “monstrous” form in the media.

He is capable of playing anywhere across the front three and has broken through into Madrid's first team after starring for Real Castilla.

“Fashion District Philadelphia's selection as the site of Philadelphia Soccer 2026's FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Center represents a significant victory for our city,” said Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker. “The center will not only help power critical volunteer efforts supporting FIFA World Cup 26™ but also generate significant economic activity for our local businesses, restaurants, and hotels. We are proud to support this effort and the thousands of volunteers who will ensure that next summer's tournament is a success.”

The Fashion District spans three blocks in the center of downtown Philadelphia. The area is home to several designer stores, restaurants and hotels. 

The Volunteer Center will be adjacent to the Pennsylvania Convention Center and within walking distance of over 6,000 hotel rooms. Public transportation is also easily accessible to the center's location. 

“The Fashion District is an ideal location for FIFA World Cup 26 Philadelphia™ to welcome and serve the thousands of volunteers who will make the games one of Philadelphia's most successful events in history and a showcase for our city and region," Michelle Singer, Philadelphia Soccer 2026's Board Co-Chair, wrote in a statement. "There really is no better site to base our large volunteer effort and I am glad we were able to secure it."

FIFA World Cup 26 is expected to recruit 3,000 volunteers from a diverse range of communities within Philadelphia. Philadelphia Soccer 2026 will be working with FIFA to interview and onboard volunteers in the coming months.

A few weeks back, the FIFA Club World Cup concluded with Chelsea FC defeating Paris Saint-German. Flanked by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, Donald Trump, greeted by a chorus of boos from fans at MetLife Stadium, took to the field during the trophy ceremony, As Edge of Sports' Dave Zirin reported, Infantino, “has been using the tournament to continue toadying up to Donald Trump, in advance of the North American–hosted World Cup, and to representatives of another future World Cup host, Saudi Arabia” (https://www.edgeofsports.com/column/fifa-is-abusing-its-players-to-keep-authoritarians-happy/index.html).



The 2026 World Cup will be held in Canada, Mexico and the United States. It will feature 48 teams (up from 32) and will consist of 102 matches. As FIFA expands its global footprint with a larger, more lucrative 2026 tournament in North America, the organization's willingness to placate powerful leaders is raising questions about who really benefits.



Kansas City, Missouri will be hosting six matches at Arrowhead Stadium. The following commentary World Cup is by Randy Gould, editor and chief reporter for the Kansas City-based Oread Daily email newsletter. 



“The World Cup is coming to Kansas City next year. It probably shouldn't.  Daytime soccer in Kansas City in the summer won't be all that much fun.  



“The heated world has arrived. We do not have any domed stadiums here, so if we are in the middle of summer heat in this new hot era, maybe the games could be rescheduled for like 3 AM!



“I don't know if people are noticing that sporting events are more and more often being canceled due to extreme heat.  Hmm, what should we take from that in regard to the soccer World Cup? 



“We should take from that exactly what Dave Zirin's article headlined ‘FIFA Is Abusing Its Players to Keep Authoritarians Happy' makes clear.  Gianni Infantino, and the rest of the top FIFA brass simply are unconcerned with the well being of the players.  They just do not care, despite the concerns raised by many players and others.”



As Zirin reported, “By holding the Club World Cup in the extreme summer heat—in the offseason for most of the 32 clubs involved—FIFA demonstrated blatant disregard for the health of the players.”



Zirin added: “FIFPRO, the global players union that represents more than 60,000 professional footballers worldwide, has long slammed FIFA for valuing petro-dictators' bottom lines over the well-being of the athletes. Back in 2023, the union noted that the Club World Cup schedule ‘demonstrates a lack of consideration for the mental and physical health of participating players, as well as a disregard for their personal and family lives.'”



Gould: “Infantino does care about cozying up to the rich and powerful.  He enjoys the company of authoritarian dictators.  He is more than happy to kiss Donald Trump's ass time and time again.



“Once again, the spectacle of global sport masks the brutal machinery of power, profit, and authoritarianism. In its relentless drive to court petro-tyrants and authoritarian strongmen, FIFA has once more revealed itself as not merely complicit in oppression — but actively enabling it.  Zirin's piece exposes how football's global governing body has sacrificed player safety, worker rights, and even basic human dignity on the altar of authoritarian appeasement and corporate greed.  



“Why would the world's best soccer clubs even play in the FIFA Club World Cup? The answer is money.”



Zirin points out that “The tournament total prize money pool has $1 billion in it, with $525 million doled out to clubs simply for participating and another $475 million allocated based on results. …. Manchester City, owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the Abu Dhabi United Group, reportedly walked off with nearly $52 million just for reaching the final 16 of the tournament. The winner of the tournament will nab a cool $125 million.”



Gould: “Whether it's the almost slave like conditions for stadium workers in Qatar, the gagging of political expression, or the weaponization of tournaments by regimes like Saudi Arabia,  Erdoğan's Turkey, and Trump's USA, FIFA continues to function as a de facto propaganda ministry for the world's most repressive governments. While players are expected to shut up and entertain, their labor—and their bodies—is commoditized in service of soft power and profit, not solidarity or sport.



“This is not just a sports story. It's another chapter in the global assault on democracy, workers, and dissent — another instance of top-down structures silencing bottom-up voices. There is no area, no space these days that capital has not taken over. The same systems that crush unions, bulldoze Indigenous land, and surveil dissidents in the USA and numerous other States are draped in FIFA banners and presented to us as celebration.



“Oh well, apparently the model of the 1936 Nazi Berlin Olympics has been seized upon by FIFA today.”

Aziz Akhannouch, Morocco's Head of Government, has signed a memorandum of understanding between the government and the National Airports Authority (ONDA) for an investment of 38 billion dirham (US$10.3bn) over the next five years.

Under this MOU, which was signed in Rabat, airport capacity will be expanded in Marrakech, Agadir, Tangier and Fez, with a new hub terminal and runway constructed at Mohammed V Airport in Casablanca, at a cost of 25 billion dirham (US$2.8bn). In parallel, 13 billion dirham (US$1.4bn) will be allocated for maintenance, modernization and land acquisition, ensuring the agility and sustainability of the airport network.

The memorandum of understanding was signed by the minister of tourism, handicrafts, and social and solidarity economy; the minister of transport and logistics; the minister delegate in charge of the budget; the director general of the National Agency for Strategic Management of State Holdings; and the director general of the National Airports Authority.

According to the Moroccan government, the agreement will lay the groundwork for a modern, resilient and sustainable airport model aligned with the Airport 2030 strategy, which has been designed to support the growth of Royal Air Maroc, accommodate increasing air traffic and strengthen airport infrastructure, serving as a key driver for the development of several sectors – especially tourism – as Morocco prepares to co-host the 2030 FIFA World Cup soccer competition and looks toward the future.

Akhannouch stated that the memorandum aligns with the country's ongoing development momentum and prepares the air transport sector to meet national aspirations and the challenges ahead, thanks to the far-sighted vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, may God assist Him.

He added that this agreement reinforces Morocco's trajectory as a regional platform and international aviation hub and contributes to equipping the country with a modern and efficient infrastructure that supports economic growth, territorial integration and social inclusion, in line with the High Royal Directives.”

In related news, ONDA recently launched two international calls for expressions of interest for the construction of the new terminal at Casablanca's Mohammed V Airport, in the run-up to the 2030 FIFA World Cup. Read the full story here

Miami-Dade County Commissioner Kionne McGhee on Friday said that he will “ask for a special meeting to undo past funding votes to cover local expenses for the seven soccer matches scheduled for Hard Rock Stadium next summer” in the 2026 FIFA World Cup, according to Douglas Hanks of the MIAMI HERALD. The county currently “plans to spend” $46M on subsidies for the event. McGhee represents a suburban district in South Miami-Dade that has “some of the county's highest concentrations of poverty.” He said, “We are obligated as elected officials to get this money back and give it to the nonprofits.” Hanks noted the approved $46M for the World Cup overlaps with what is “likely to be the leanest budget year for the county since the aftermath of the 2008 housing crash.” Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has proposed a 2026 budget “that slashes” about $40M in “funding for county charity grants.” The $46M is made up of $21M in “planned cash payments for the games” and $25M in “free police, paramedic services and other county staff.” To secure a special meeting revisiting a “politically fraught issue that's already gone through a commission vote,” McGhee needs a “signed request from at least six other commissioners on the 13-member board.” FIFA World Cup 2026 Miami Host Committee Chair Rodney Barreto said, “I know tough decisions have to be made. I think the county can make them and still fully support FIFA World Cup 2026 in Miami-Dade” (MIAMI HERALD, 7/25).

The Latest | Jul 28, 2025

The United States Women's National Team is set to make history in Kansas City this fall with its first-ever match at CPKC Stadium, the first stadium in the world purpose-built for a women's professional team. The USWNT announced today that the match will take place on Wednesday, Oct. 29, at 7 p.m. CT, with the opponent to be announced at a later date, as part of a three-match schedule during the FIFA international window. The match will be broadcast on TNT, TruTV and HBO Max in English, on Universo and Peacock in Spanish, and on Westwood One Sports Radio. 

“We're incredibly honored to welcome the U.S. Women's National Team to CPKC Stadium for the first time in history,” said Angie and Chris Long, co-owners of the Kansas City Current. “Hosting the best U.S. players and this elite USWNT staff in this state-of-the-art venue represents an incredibly special moment in the history of all women's sports. Kansas City shows up for women's sports, and we know our region and CPKC Stadium will deliver an unforgettable atmosphere on an iconic night.” 

Opened in 2024 as the home of the Kansas City Current, CPKC Stadium has become a global symbol of innovation and investment in women's sports. The venue, located on the Missouri riverfront, was made possible through the leadership of KC Current co-owners Angie and Chris Long, whose vision to elevate women's soccer has transformed the sports landscape in Kansas City and beyond. 

“The investment that Angie and Chris Long have made in their club and this venue is massively impressive, important for the future of the women's game in the USA and deserves to be rewarded with a match like this,” said USWNT head coach Emma Hayes. “I'm looking forward to my first visit to the stadium and to an amazing atmosphere for the players that the Kansas City fans always bring. CPKC Stadium is a smaller venue than we usually play in, but in this instance, it's important to bring the National Team there.” 

The match represents a landmark moment for Kansas City soccer fans, who have long supported the growth of the sport. With a capacity of 11,500, CPKC Stadium has sold out every KC Current regular season home match in the National Women's Soccer League. The visit from the USWNT marks a celebration of how far the region has come as a leader in advancing equity and excellence in women's sports.

Former Serie A forward and Italian World Cup winner Luca Toni has claimed Juventus “need to hit the gas if they want to catch up and fight for the title”, with Liverpool's Federico Chiesa, Newcastle United's Sandro Tonali and Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund names mentioned as ideal reinforcements for the Bianconeri.

Speaking in a lengthy interview with the Gazzetta dello Sport, the former Juventus and Roma forward said that “I'd try to get Tonali every day of the week. He is expensive but he transforms your midfield. If I were Juventus, I'd bring back Chiesa on loan. He's out of the project at Liverpool and I would bet on his hunger for redemption.”

Juventus are also in the market for a new striker, with Serbian forward Dusan Vlahovic rumoured to be leaving the club this summer. The Bianconeri have already added Canadian attacker Jonathan David to their squad, of whom Toni was highly complimentary: “Numbers are everything for a striker and David's are excellent. I'm curious to see if he can maintain that rhythm in Italy, where there is less space and stronger defences. It will be a good challenge for him. The quality of Yildiz will help. Keeping the Turkish talent feels like a huge signing for Juve, especially these days when it is tough for anyone to resist Premier League offers.”

The Old Lady have also been linked with another loan move for PSG forward Randal Kolo Muani, who spent the second half of the 2024-25 campaign with the Bianconeri. Toni described the Frenchman as “a European level striker who already knows Tudor, Juventus and Serie A – it makes sense to go after him again.”

However, if a move for Kolo Muani falls through, Toni suggested that “I would go for Rasmus Hojlund, maybe on loan. During his time at Atalanta, before the move to Manchester United, he gave me really good vibes. I'd go off that, not the struggles he has had in England.”

Hojlund had a disappointing 2024-25 campaign with the Red Devils, scoring just four goals in 32 Premier League appearances. The Danish forward has been linked with Milan, Inter and Napoli this summer but no concrete moves have been made for the 22-year-old.

CoCo Vandeweghe believes that Leylah Fernandez is a ‘threat at the US Open' after the Canadian lifted the Citi DC Open title, with Steve Johnson adding that he predicts ‘big things' for the 22-year-old.

Fernandez dominated Anna Kalinskya 6-1, 6-2 to win the title at the WTA 500 event – her biggest victory to date.

Previously, the Canadian had won four WTA 250 events.

Earlier in the week, the world No 24 defeated the likes of Jessica Pegula, Taylor Townsend, and Elena Ryabkina.

“I think it just leads to more victories. I think she is a threat at the US Open. You are always going to play well where you have had success,” Vandeweghe, a former US Open women's doubles champion, analysed whilst speaking on the Tennis Channel Live Podcast.

Steve Johnson replied: “I see big things. Whenever you can get a title on a hard court leading up into a Grand Slam, whatever surface it may be, especially now going home.

“Some players have a hard time playing at home with the crowds and the pressure and all that.

“I think she is going to be doing just fine up there, she has held the Canadian flag for a few years, making the US Open final that young.

“She has dealt with all that pressure, her tennis is there. If her serve and her backhand is playing like it is today I think she is an absolute threat for the rest of the summer and leading up to the US Open.”

The American refers to Fernandez's fairytale run at the 2021 US Open, where she reached the final at barely 19-years-old.

Along the way, the Canadian defeated defending champion Naomi Osaka, Elina Svitolina, Angelique Kerber, and Aryna Sabalenka – losing out to Brit Emma Raducanu, 6-4, 6-3.

“The match was very solid from my part,” the Canadian said, during her post-match interview.

“I was very happy the way that I held my nerves. I was definitely very nervous in the beginning, but I got to play my game in the important points and kind of push through those nerves, so I was super happy about that.

“I have gone through so many different challenges this week.

“You know, I think it just has made me stronger in a way that if I can get through this week, through the cramps, through the long matches, through the heat, the humidity, I can get through anything.

“So I was just very happy that I got to not only push myself physically through the limits but also mentally. So that kind of will help me hopefully for future tournaments.”

“My intention was actually to be more offensive than her, but I think at the same time, I like long rallies,” analysed the Canadian.

“So that kind of helped me to settle in. You know, I knew she was going to be offensive from the get-go, so I had to counterattack as quickly as possible and then get it to the front foot once I had the opportunities.

“So I was just glad I was able to take advantage of certain balls she gave me in certain moments. Balls were going in for me today.

I know a couple of shots that I hit, I was even surprised that it went in. So it kind of feels good that this year, today was a good day for me (smiling).”

Fernandez will next participate in the Canadian Masters, opening against world No 45 Maya Joint.

A local Coloradan is gearing up for her fourth and likely final run in the U.S. Open as a junior wheelchair tennis athlete.

Sabina Czauz, 18, is currently ranked No. 3 in the world in her age group. This year's U.S. Open Junior Wheelchair Championships are set for Sept. 3 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York. 

Living in Thornton with her family, Czauz trains at the University of Colorado tennis courts in Boulder. Though tennis has taken her farther than she imagined, it wasn't her first love.

“I used to play wheelchair basketball, and when COVID hit, obviously we couldn't play anymore,” Czauz said. “But a teammate of mine started playing tennis, and he invited me down to play. And as soon as I came down for a practice, I just fell in love. It was really, really fun. And I just kept coming to practice. And I guess here I am.”

Her first trip to the U.S. Open was a bit of a surprise.

One of the original players couldn't make it, so the day before, Czauz was called up as a substitute, flying in the next day to be thrown right into the fire.

“I wasn't really prepared for it or anything,” she said. “And I think back then, I wasn't really thinking that I would go professional in tennis. I didn't think it was anything but just a hobby; I wouldn't really go anywhere with it. But it was crazy. I was there. I didn't really know anybody I played. I lost first in both singles and doubles. But it was a great experience that just kind of opened my eyes to what was possible with wheelchair tennis.”

Now Czauz was hooked. In year two, she ranked into the competition, determined to ruffle some feathers in her sophomore campaign.

She began to study tennis more deeply to mentally prepare herself for the game, something she said was a big difference from her wheelchair basketball days.

In tennis, you're relying mostly on yourself, with the help of your doubles teammate when you're in those specific competitions.

Basketball is the epitome of a team sport, she explained, with several teammates coming together to make something happen. On the tennis court, you're basically on your own.

Plus, in a wheelchair, the basketball comes and goes, but you're always holding onto that racket in tennis, making pushing more difficult, she said.

“It's a lot more mentally challenging because you don't have the support of like five other people on your side, helping you, playing with you,” Czauz said. “It's just you out there playing. You might have coaches and people in the stands, but ultimately, it's up to you. They can't really help you when you're on the court … (In year two) I improved. I made it farther. You know, it just strengthens something in you. You want to keep doing it. You want to get to the finals next year.”

Coaching Czauz has been won of the joys of Kendall Chitambar's career, he said. Chitambar is the co-founder and director of tennis at the Rocky Mountain Tennis Center in Boulder.

Her competitiveness and grit have been contagious, especially for someone relatively new to the sport.

“Working with Sabina has been one of the most rewarding experiences and privileges of my coaching career,” Chitambar said. “Her determination and love for the game are inspiring, and it's been incredible to watch her grow as both a player and a person. Thanks to the support from USTA Colorado, Colorado Wheelchair Tennis Foundation and the 5430 Kids Tennis Foundation, we've been able to create meaningful opportunities for athletes like Sabina to thrive on and off the court.”

Last year (year three), Czauz said her doubles team made it to the finals before losing to the two top players on the other side.

She's proud to keep inching closer, but said this year is likely the last dance. It's time to finish this journey with a trophy.

“This year, I think I have a good chance of winning, hopefully,” Czauz said. “I guess I kind of just want to soak it in and remember it, in case I can't be there next year. After this year, I'm going to the University of Arizona in the fall, and I'm going to be playing on their wheelchair tennis team. Hopefully I'll still be participating in some U.S. and ITF tournaments and get my ranking up in women's and see how far that takes me.”

Emma Raducanu must try to remain "injury free" but she is playing the "right kind of tennis" ahead of the US Open, believes Billie Jean King Cup captain Anne Keothavong.

The 22-year-old has been looking back to her best so far this season, having reached the semi-finals of the Citi Open in Washington last week. She was denied a repeat of the 2021 US Open final against Leylah Fernandez after losing to Anna Kalinskaya.

She also reached the semi-finals of the doubles event alongside Elena Rybakina before pulling out through illness.

Raducanu will make her first appearance at the dual-venue format National Bank Open in Canada since 2022 before heading to the Cincinnati Open, which is taking place from 5-18 August - live on Sky Sports Tennis.

Speaking to Sky Sports News, Keothavong said: "I thought she had a pretty good grass-court season and has carried that confidence into the start of the North American hard-court swing. Seeing her win matches in tough conditions, serving really well, showing really good composure out there. It's all positives and signs that she's moving in the right direction. She loves this part of the year!

"Hard courts are where she's most comfortable. She's had some fantastic wins over the likes of Maria Sakkari and also former Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka as well. There are lots of positives despite the loss in the semi-finals. I thought she still played pretty well. She also made the semi-finals in the doubles so she's getting matches under her belt and this will all just be good preparation in the lead-up to the US Open."

Raducanu also reached her first WTA 1000 quarter-final at the Miami Open, quarter-finals at Queen's Club and the third round at Wimbledon where she lost out to world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka in one of the matches of the tournament.

After dropping to British No 3, Raducanu's run in Washington ensured she once again overtook Katie Boulter to become the top-ranked British player.

She ended Boulter's two-year run at the top of the domestic standings in June but then slipped back to 46 in the world after losing a close tussle with Sabalenka at the All England Club. Raducanu is currently ranked No 33 as she looks to secure a seeding for next month's US Open.

"I thought she played well at Wimbledon," remarked Keothavong. "She went out to the world number one in Aryna Sabalenka but that match was one of the best matches of the Championship. The result didn't go her way but the performance was there and there were signs that she was playing the right kind of tennis."

Raducanu has been without a coach in North America amid uncertainty over the future of her partnership with Mark Petchey and has only hitting partner Alexis Canter in her corner, but there was no lack of direction in some of her performances.

"She's 22 years of age and that's still very young in women's tennis and she achieved so much so young but now it's just getting comfortable with where she's at, putting the hard work in - which she does - and just getting as many matches under her belt," said Keothavong. "Making sure that she's trying to apply herself and do the right things on the match court, which last week we saw her do, and most importantly remaining injury free.

"I think that's the biggest challenge for her, becoming a more robust athlete and being able to compete at the highest level week in, week out."

Keothavong's team is one of eight nations set to compete at this year's Billie Jean King Cup Finals in Shenzhen between 16-21 September.

The Brits will play Japan in the quarter-finals on September 18. Should they come through that tie, they will go on to play the winner of USA vs Kazakhstan.

Keothavong has selected a strong team for the showpiece event of the women's team tennis calendar, including Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal and Raducanu, as well as Jodie Burrage, while Fran Jones checked off another career milestone this week after breaking into the WTA top 100 for the first time in her career by winning the Palermo Ladies Open.

"It's great to have four women inside the world's top 100 all competing against each other vying for that British number one spot. And they all get on well with each other too," said Keothavong.

"As captain of the Billie Jean King Cup team I'm in a privileged position that my best players have put themselves out there and are motivated to do well in this particular competition.

"We're up against Japan in September where the finals is taking place in Shenzhen in China. There's still a fair bit of time and a lot more tennis that the players have to play until we get there but it's shaping up nicely."

Thirteen years after her breakout as a junior champion, Taylor Townsend's path through criticism, setbacks, and reinvention has brought her to the top of the doubles rankings.

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Taylor Townsend was never given the luxury of a quiet rise. In 2012, at the age of 16, she was the junior world No. 1, an Australian Open champion and a Wimbledon doubles winner. But the praise quickly gave way to judgment.

She was the “it” girl of her tennis generation -- until she wasn't.

Townsend, who didn't have the lean, sculpted look of so many other elite junior players, was barred from competing in the junior US Open and sent to its training center in Florida to focus on improving her fitness. Eventually, her USTA funding and support was revoked.

What are professional athletes supposed to look like? Townsend was an early test case in the highly uncomfortable setting of harsh public scrutiny.

“I have had to go through some of the hardest struggles and the most personal struggles in the public eye,” she told reporters here at the Mubadala Citi DC Open. “Some really very kind of intimate topics that had to be a topic of conversation literally around the world as a child and having to defend myself as a kid.

“It's made me who I am, and it's made me appreciate every step of the way, and being able to have somebody say, externally, ‘You look so happy playing,' that's a win.”

There was cause for joy on Friday when, 13 years after she reigned as the top junior, Townsend captured the No. 1 PIF WTA Ranking in doubles.

“It is a dream,” Townsend said. “It's one of the goals that I set for myself when I actually began to think it was attainable.”

She and Zhang Shuai, playing together for the first time, advanced to the final when the semifinal team of Emma Raducanu and Elena Rybakina -- “ER Squared” -- retired after 25 minutes, trailing 4-1. The win secured the No. 1 doubles ranking for Townsend, who overtook Katerina Siniakova after the 325 points awarded for reaching the final.

On Saturday, Townsend and Zhang closed out the title with a 6-1, 6-1 win over Caroline Dolehide and Sofia Kenin in just 48 minutes. It marked Townsend's 10th career WTA doubles title and Zhang's 15th.

The outcome ends Katerina Sinakova's 46-week reign at No. 1. She and Townsend have been playing together since 2024, when they won titles at Wimbledon and the year-end WTA Tour championships. Back in January, they won the Australian Open title and followed it up at the WTA 1000 in Dubai.

When Siniakova chose to play singles at the Prague Open, Townsend approached Zhang, and the two won their first two matches. The 325 points for reaching the final puts Townsend ahead of Siniakova, who dropped last year's 250 points that came from winning the Prague title with Barbora Krejcikova.

Townsend's singles run ended Friday with a 6-4, 7-6 (4) loss to Leylah Fernandez. But earlier in the tournament, after beating No. 6 seed Sofia Kenin, Townsend presided over a sprawling, illuminating press conference.

“There hasn't been anyone who has gone through what I went through since I went through it, so I think things have changed a little bit -- which is great, right?” Townsend said. “When I was going through the whole body image thing, there was no body positivity movement. That didn't exist.

“It was common to scrutinize body types and give a person a body archetype and what you should be and having to put people in this box. And now, throughout the years, it has evolved into shattering those boxes and basically people being able to accomplish whatever they want in their fields, however you look and whatever.”

 

Thirteen years after her breakout as a junior champion, Taylor Townsend's path through criticism, setbacks, and reinvention has brought her to the top of the doubles rankings.

Emma Raducanu has reclaimed her spot as Britain's No. 1 following a stellar start to her hardcourt season, having just been told exactly what she needs to do after losing in the Washington heat. 

The British player made it to the semi-finals of the Citi Open in both singles and doubles, partnering with Elena Rybakina, who shared what she is really like, and her performance has catapulted her past Katie Boulter in the WTA rankings.

Raducanu has chalked up 21 tour match victories in 2025, marking her highest single-season tally, and amassed the necessary 195 points to climb to world No. 33 in the rankings.

She advanced 13 spots and is back in the top 35 for the first time since 2022.

Perhaps most notably, if Raducanu can crack the top 32 before the U.S. Open, she'll be seeded, boosting her chances of a favorable draw as she seeks to emulate her 2021 title-winning run.



The 22 year old has the potential to ascend further in the rankings if she delivers a strong performance at this week's tournament in Montreal. However, she will lose the 108 points she earned at the 2024 Citi Open, which was rescheduled last year due to the Olympics, next week.

Raducanu didn't participate in the Canadian Open last year and now has a chance to rack up some valuable ranking points, having been pitted against Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round. She could potentially face off against Wimbledon runner-up Amanda Anisimova in the third round.

Citi Open finalists Leylah Fernandez and Anna Kalinskaya are among the major climbers in this week's rankings shake-up, with Fernandez demolishing her rival 6-1 6-2 in the Washington final to secure her fourth career crown.

DON'T MISS: 

She started the tournament ranked 36th in the world and surged to 24th, while Kalinskaya jumped from 48th to 31st in substantial leaps ahead of the year's final Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows.

Aryna Sabalenka maintains her stranglehold at the summit and boasts nearly double the points of runner-up Coco Gauff.

British star Fran Jones exploded into the top 100 at 84th and now joins three other players representing the nation in triple digits, alongside Raducanu, Boulter and Sonay Kartal.

Boulter slipped two positions to 43rd following her defeat to Maria Sakkari in Washington, while Kartal also tumbled three spots to 48th, having remained inactive since her impressive fourth-round Wimbledon campaign.

Jones captured her second WTA 125 crown of the month at the Palermo Open, overpowering third seed Anouk Koevermans 6-3, 6-2 in the championship match. She sailed through the entire tournament without dropping a set.

Raducanu, who had Jones supporting her during matches in Eastbourne, expressed how "proud" she felt of her fellow Brit after learning her close friend had cracked the top 100 for the first time in her professional career.

Coco Gauff is a two-time major champion, but she failed to deliver on John McEnroe's lofty prediction for her six years ago.

Just weeks after winning her second major title at the French Open, Gauff was eliminated from Wimbledon in straight sets, 7-6 (3), 6-1 by Dayana Yastremska, who admitted before her matchup that she was allergic to grass, the playing surface. Yastremska, who was unseeded, told fans after the win just how much it meant for her to take down one of the biggest stars in the sport.

Gauff was looking to end her streak of futility at Wimbledon, but instead, the world No. 2 added her most painful chapter yet. For McEnroe, though, she hasn't lived up to his expectations.

Gauff has emerged as one of the biggest names on the WTA Tour since she made her breakthrough and defeated Venus Williams at Wimbledon in her debut Grand Slam match aged 15 back in 2019. While she is a two-time major champion, she has fallen short on one of McEnroe's predictions. 

When speaking on the BBC following her win over Williams, McEnroe was full of praise for Gauff. He said: “Gauff's not only physically mature, but also mentally. 



“I look at the way she plays. If she's not number one in the world by 20, I will be absolutely shocked.”

Only five teenagers in history had managed to reach the summit of the WTA rankings before, with Martina Hingis representing the youngest at 16 years and 182 days. Tracy Austin also achieved the incredible feat, and she followed McEnroe in expecting Gauff to do the same. 

“People have been talking about Coco for years,” Austin added. “They have now started to recognise her internationally. Obviously, she's a tremendous athlete, but to walk on court to face Venus, a player who she idolises, there were plenty of opportunities for her to get tight and nervous. She has been raised for greatness, and this is the beginning.”

Gauff would go on to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon that year, but McEnroe's prediction about her never came true. However, she won the 2023 U.S. Open and the 2025 French Open. 

Gauff may not be world No. 1 as Aryna Sabalenka holds that distinction. But the 21-year-old is world No. 2, ahead of Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek. 

Gauff will now look to rediscover her best form on the hardcourt surface as she prepares for the 2025 U.S. Open. She faces Danielle Collins at the Canadian Open, where Gauff is the No. 1 seed in the tournament.

Wim Fissette, fresh from leading Iga Swiatek to Wimbledon glory earlier this month, has made some rather startling comments about his future within the sport.

After all, he has only been partnered with the Polish superstar for nine months, with the success they have already achieved being really impressive.

And yet, if his claims are to be over-analysed, the allure of the ATP Tour might one day prove too strong.

However, whilst speaking to the Tennis Insider Club, he made it clear that his plans, or hopes to transition into that area of the sport, are far from immediate.

In fact, they're nothing but theoretical for now. 

Fissette did, however, provide great insight into the differences between coaching on the men's and women's tour, and how he personally might adapt were he ever to make the switch.

He began by denying any suggestion it would happen soon: “Not necessarily. I'm actually happy and proud to be a WTA coach. I enjoy working with women.

“I would like, maybe one day, to work with someone on the ATP, but I would not see it as an upgrade.

“It would be an interesting experience, but I don't see it as like that would be better for me. No, I am happy as a WTA coach.

“But as a challenge at some point it would be interesting. But I have never had any offers from the ATP.

“I do think that going from WTA to ATP, I think it's easier to go from ATP to WTA.”

This comes many weeks after Fissette explained how coaching Swiatek is different from Naomi Osaka, with the former having just overtaken the latter on Grand Slam titles.

Given the steady progress made under his guidance, culminating in that remarkable Wimbledon title earlier this month, there's no reason why Fissette would be looking for a chance anytime soon.

And similarly, Iga Swiatek only now seems to have recaptured her motivation after going so uncharacteristically long without a trophy.

All of a sudden, the narrative surrounding the 23-year-old has shifted, and she enters this North American swing of the tour as a favourite to compete for the very best honours.

With that in mind, it's not expected that these comments will have any bearing on what the future holds for this partnership.

It has, thus far, been an overwhelming success. And this is just the beginning.

What Fissette and Swiatek could achieve together is limitless, and it's really exciting to imagine what the future holds for them both.

The ATP may interest him, but it is definitely not in his immediate plans.

However, she hasn't advanced past the quarterfinals in her last 13 tournaments, and has lost her last four matches against top 10 opponents. With semifinals points to defend in Montreal as well as at the US Open, this marks the start of an important stretch for the American.

However, she hasn't advanced past the quarterfinals in her last 13 tournaments, and has lost her last four matches against top 10 opponents. With semifinals points to defend in Montreal as well as at the US Open, this marks the start of an important stretch for the American.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz – the top two players in the ATP rankings – both decided to skip the Toronto Masters 1000, which also had to suffer the forfeit of Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper. The Italian and the Spaniard have had to use a lot of energy in the last month and a half, particularly at Roland Garros and the Wimbledon Championships, where they faced each other in the final giving a show to fans around the world.

Their clash in Paris was one of the most electrifying of the modern era, considering that the 22-year-old from Murcia cancelled out three match points in a row to his top rival before winning in the fifth set after almost five and a half hours. The current world No. 1 got his revenge in the final act of Wimbledon just over two weeks ago, coming back from a set down and preventing Carlitos from lifting his third trophy in a row at Church Road.

Both allowed themselves a period of relaxation after the third Major of the season and resumed practicing a few days ago, respectively in Monte Carlo and Spain. Fans will have to wait until the Cincinnati Masters 1000 to see these young champions in action, who have already set the US Open as their main goal this summer.

The 23-year-old from Sesto Pusteria will try to defend the top position in the ATP rankings in the second half of the season, while Carlos will be able to take advantage of the fact that he has not shone from Wimbledon onwards in 2024.

In a long interview with 'Il Corriere della Sera', former Italian ace Paolo Canè commented on Sinner and Alcaraz's choice to skip Toronto: "Although they are still very young, Jannik and Carlitos are already true champions. Not only do I agree with their decision to skip this tournament, but I am happy about it. It means that they have understood that they have to preserve their body and not just think about results, but about prolonging their careers. The secret in today's tennis is to play little and win often."

Americans have seen many tennis greats come and go during their esteemed history in the sport.

The country boasts some of the most accomplished singles players of all time, including Serena Williams, Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi. Some of the best doubles players have also made their name in the sport; the Bryan brothers are considered to be among the best doubles pairings of all time.

The new generation has shown significant promise. Coco Gauff is a two-time Grand Slam champion, while Taylor Fritz reached the 2024 US Open final. Furthermore, Ben Shelton and Frances Tiafoe have both reached the Grand Slam semi-final stage.

However, American male players are suffering from a drought. You have to go back to 2003 to find the last male American to win a Grand Slam singles title, when Andy Roddick beat Juan Carlos Ferrero to win the US Open.

Despite the likes of Shelton and Gauff taking the majority of headlines in recent times, another teenage American player has put himself in the same conversation as Pete Sampras.

Learner Tien has enjoyed a breakout 2025 campaign after initially stunning tennis fans at the Australian Open.

The 19-year-old beat former world number one Daniil Medvedev on his way to a fourth round appearance at the 2025 Australian Open.

The young American has impressed throughout the year, picking up wins at the Italian Open and Wimbledon.

Fast forward to July, and Tien is competing in the Canadian Open. On Sunday evening, the 19-year-old captured his second ATP Masters 1000 victory of the season, defeating compatriot Colton Smith 6-4 7-5.

As per OptaAce, since the ATP format's introduction in 1990, Learner Tien is now the fifth American teenager to win ATP Masters 1000 matches on multiple surfaces, along with Jim Courier, Michael Chang, Pete Sampras and Andy Roddick.

Tien's previous Masters 1000 victory came at the 2025 Italian Open, where he beat Reilly Opelka 6-4 7-6 in the first round.

Tien's next opponent in Canada, Denis Shapovalov, has come into the tournament in red-hot form, having recently won the Los Cabos Open.

Undoubtedly, the match will be tricky for Tien. Not only will Shapovalov be brimming with confidence after his recent tournament victory, the Canadian will likely have the full support of the home crowd.

An abundance of talent 💫Learner Tien moves past compatriot Smith 6-4 7-5 and will now face home hope Shapovalov in the second round. @NBOtoronto | #NBO25 pic.twitter.com/1ooBHtIdjE

Tien can take some positives going into the match. He registered a strong serving performance against Colton Smith, winning 81 per cent of his first serve points and 71 per cent of his second serve points.

However, the American will need to improve his overall consistency on serve, having struck six double faults against Smith.

Sunday's (July 27) Washington Open women's singles final was a memorable outing for a former Grand Slam runner-up, as it secured the biggest title of her tennis career to date.

Leylah Fernandez, defeated Anna Kalinskaya 6-1 6-2 in DC, to win her first WTA Tour 500 event.

It is also the first tournament she has won in America as her previous wins came at 250 level events in Mexico and Hong Kong. 

The Canadian's commanding win came in just over an hour and was a much more straightforward affair than her semi-final contest with Elena Rybakina, which lasted over three hours as all three sets were decided by a tie-break.

Fernandez' most challenging moment in the final came during the opening set at 1-1, as Kalinskaya had two break points.

However, Kalinskaya failed to convert either and did not get another break opportunity for the remainder of the contest as Fernandez began to dominate proceedings from that moment onwards.

Whilst Kalinskya failed to break her opponent at any time, Fernandez converted four out of her six break points during the final, with two each in both sets.

The Canadian, who was a finalist at the 2021 US Open, was full of praise for those in her inner circle after winning in Washington.

"I want to thank my team, my coaches for being here all week with me and putting up with my antics and superstitions", the champion said in her post-match speech.

"I want to dedicate this trophy to my mom, my older sister, and to my fitness trainer, Abdul Sillah. You guys have been fighting, and still are fighting, so thank you so much for never giving up on me."

In addition to beating the third seed, Rybakina, in the last four, Fernandez' run to the final included a stunning upset of top seed Jessica Pegula, in the Round of 16.

The tournament victory adds to the three tournament wins Fernandez has on the WTA Tour, and will see her jump 12 places up to 24 in the latest WTA singles rankings.

Fernandez will next be in action at the Canadian Open in Montreal, with her first match scheduled for Tuesday (July 29) against Australia's Maya Joint.

Just like in Washington, the 22-year-old will be unseeded for the 1000 event in her home city.

Leylah Fernandez has won the biggest title of her career after defeating Anna Kalinskaya in the Washington Open final. 

Fernandez dominated Kalinskaya in straight sets, 6-1, 6-2, to hoist her fourth title, and first WTA 500 crown.

The Canadian has enjoyed an impressive week in the American capital, earning victories over Elena Rybakina and Jessica Pegula en route to the final. 

After displaying the sort of tennis that saw her reach the US Open final in 2021, CoCo Vandeweghe and Steve Johnson think Fernandez can build on her Washington triumph later this summer. 

Giving her analysis on the ‘Tennis Channel Live Podcast', Vandeweghe said: “I think it just leads to more victories. I think she is a threat at the US Open. You are always going to play well where you have had success.”

Steve Johnson replied: “I see big things. Whenever you can get a title on a hard court leading up into a Grand Slam, whatever surface it may be, especially now going home.

“Some players have a hard time playing at home with the crowds and the pressure and all that.

“I think she is going to be doing just fine up there, she has held the Canadian flag for a few years, making the US Open final that young.

“She has dealt with all that pressure, her tennis is there. If her serve and her backhand is playing like it is today I think she is an absolute threat for the rest of the summer and leading up to the US Open.”

Fernandez recorded her best finish at a Grand Slam in 2021 at the US Open, when she made her first major final. 

She earned two comfortable victories in the opening rounds at Flushing Meadows that year, before defeating the defending champion, Naomi Osaka, in round three. 

In the fourth round, Fernandez beat the 2016 US Open champion Angelique Kerber and then knocked out fifth seed Elina Svitolina. 

Her semi-final opponent came in the form of Aryna Sabalenka, whom she was able to best in three sets to reach the championship match.

There is nobody in tennis quite like Corentin Moutet.

Although he's far from a household name that transcends the sport like Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner, hardcore tennis fans have all the time in the world for a player like Moutet.

Not only is he a great underdog story as a 5-foot-11 grinder who has had to work his way up the professional tennis ladder, but he's also got a showman quality that is all too rare in the sport these days.

Moutet is a creative shot-maker, but he's also got a short fuse and is no stranger to making a scene on the court. 

The Frenchman also happens to be playing some of the best tennis of his career of late, and comes into the qualifying rounds at the Canadian Masters having just made it to the semifinals at ATP Washington.

Moutet took full advantage of being awarded a “lucky loser” spot in Washington by defeating Alexandre Muller, Dan Evans, and Daniil Medvedev before losing to Alex de Minaur in the semis.

The 26-year-old now faces a quick turnaround for his showdown with Jenson Brooksby in Toronto on Monday.

After taking all of 2024 off, Brooksby has been quite impressive this season. The American won a title in Houston in March and was the runner-up in Eastbourne last month.

Brooksby's once promising career looks to be reignited.

Moutet and Brooksby come into Monday's match in decent form, and the stylistic matchup – neither player is going to smash the other off the court – should lead to a long, winding match.

Toronto will be Schoolkate's fourth tournament since Wimbledon. The Australian briefly returned to grass earlier this month in Newport.© Ed McGrogan

Fonseca and Schoolkate play the modern baseline game that we know so well: Good flat and kick serves; controlling topspin forehands; two-handed backhands; a desire and ability to punish short balls. Fonseca's forehand is his biggest weapon, while Schoolkate's backhand, which he can rifle down the line, is often the shot to watch from him.The two have never met, but judging by their similar game styles, it could be competitive. I'll take the guy on the fast track. Winner: Fonseca

WASHINGTON (AP) — The biggest tennis title of Leylah Fernandez's career arrived at the D.C. Open on Sunday with the help of a terrific backhand, some superb returning — and energy courtesy of Shake Shack's burgers and fries.

The left-handed Fernandez, a 22-year-old from Canada who is ranked 36th, wrapped up a big week of tight matches with a lopsided victory, defeating Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-2 in the final.

Alex de Minaur, Luciano Darderi and Alexander Bublik won ATP Tour titles last week in Washington, Umag and Kitzbuehel, respectively. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Rankings, as of Monday 28 July.



No. 8 Alex de Minaur, +5
The Australian has climbed five spots after winning his 10th tour-level title and third at ATP 500 level in Washington. In a thrilling final, De Minaur saved three championship points en route to defeating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina at the hard-court event.

No. 19 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, +7 (Career High)
The 26-year-old has broken the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time following his final run in Washington. The Spaniard defeated seeds Taylor Fritz and Ben Shelton before falling agonisingly short against De Minaur.
No. 25 Alexander Bublik, +5
Bublik has jumped another five spots to No. 25 in the PIF ATP Rankings after winning his second consecutive title at the ATP 250 clay-court event in Kitzbuehel. The 28-year-old won in Gstaad eight days ago and backed that up by clinching the crown in Austria, where he beat Arthur Cazaux in the final to improve to 3-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Cazaux has climbed 25 spots to No. 75. Read final report & watch highlights.

No. 35 Luciano Darderi, +11
Like Bublik, Darderi became an ATP Tour champion for the second week in a row. The Italian won in Bastad a little more than a week ago and then blitzed through the field in Umag to clinch his third crown of the season. Darderi holds a perfect 4-0 record in tour-level finals and only Carlos Alcaraz has lifted more trophies on Tour in 2025. Read final report & watch highlights.
No. 46 Corentin Moutet, +13 (Career High)
The Frenchman has climbed to a career high following his semi-final showing in Washington. The lucky loser brushed aside Alexandre Muller and Daniel Evans before he earned his fourth Top 20 win on hard courts against Daniil Medvedev in a three-set rollercoaster. Moutet's run was ended at the semi-final stage by champion De Minaur.

Alex de Minaur may not score his performance in the Mubadala Citi DC Open final a perfect 10, but that will take none of the shine off the scrappy comeback that earned him his 10th tour-level title in dramatic fashion on Sunday.

In a 5-7, 6-1, 7-6(3) victory against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, the Aussie saved three championship points on serve at 5-4 in the final set — but only after breaking from 30/0 when the Spaniard served for the title. De Minaur was 16 millimetres from defeat on his opponent's third match point, but a desperate lob clipped the sideline and helped him turn the point and the match around.

"It's something about this court. I did it in 2018 against Rublev and honestly, I just kind of knew I could do it," said the Aussie, who saved four match points against Andrey Rublev that year but lost in the final to Alexander Zverev at age 19. "I just backed myself and I told myself to commit no matter what and if I lost this match it was going to be on my terms. Today it went my way. I've had a couple of brutal ones not go my way, so I'm glad this one went my way."



For Davidovich Fokina, who was seeking his first ATP Tour title, it is a cruel blow after he missed out on two championship points in Delray Beach this past February against Miomir Kecmanovic and lost the Acapulco final to Tomas Machac in March.

After a late-night, three-set upset of top seed Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals, the Spaniard nearly repeated that magic in another three-hour battle against De Minaur. Instead, he buried his head in his towel after falling agonisingly short in final, with the Aussie coming over to console his fellow 26-year-old.

"You're way to good to not have one of these [trophies]. It's coming for sure," De Minaur told him during the trophy ceremony. "You deserved it today. I just got lucky. You are a hell of a competitor, a hell of a player. No one on the Tour wants to play you. This is not the end, this is only going up for you."

De Minaur is now 3-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head against Davidovich Fokina, with their first meeting coming in 2019 at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF.

Behind his title run, De Minaur moved up five places this week to No. 8 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and two places to eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Davidovich Fokina rose seven places in the Live Rankings to return to the Top 20 at No. 19, and also shot up seven places to 11th in the Race To Turin.

At first glance, seventh seed De Minaur and 12th seed Davidovich Fokina could have seemed like surprise men's singles finalists at the ATP 500. But their seasons on the ATP Tour paint a different picture.

At the conclusion of the event, both players lead the ATP Tour in hard-court wins in 2025 and stand among the top five in total match wins this season, De Minaur with 35 and Davidovich Fokina with 32. They are also two of just four players to have played in multiple finals on the year, alongside Carlos Alcaraz (3) and Andrey Rublev (2).

De Minaur credited his mentality and mindset with his recent success: "I'm very happy with where I am at the moment, how I'm dealing with things on and off the court," he explained. "I had the mindset that even if today didn't go my way, it was a very positive week. 

"So I was proud of my efforts no matter what, but jeez it feels good to hold my 10th title."

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Aussie star Alex de Minaur miraculously saved three championship points and came back from 4-1 down in the deciding set to clinch his 10th ATP Tour title on Monday.

The 26-year-old downed No.12 seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 5-7, 6-1, 7-6(3) in a thrilling final to win the tournament and secure about $640,000 in prize money.

It is De Minaur's eighth career title on hard courts. He was runner-up at the same tournament in 2018.

It looked like he would fall at the final hurdle again when Fokina raced out to a big lead in the third set.

But De Minaur fought back and saved three championship points, before winning the tiebreak to seal an epic victory.

De Minaur will rise to No.8 in the world on the back of the win.

Fokina dropped to 0-4 in tournament finals and he slumped to his chair in tears following the match. He remains the highest-ranked man without a title.

"I want to say congrats to Alex. He deserved the win," Fokina told the crowd afterwards.

"He was fighting every f---ing ball."

In a show of pure class, De Minaur walked over to a crying Fokina and sat beside him on his chair and gave some words of encouragement.

And in his victory speech he began with a tribute to his opponent.

"I wanna start with Alejandro, as I told you and your team, you're way too good to not have one of these," De Minaur said.

"It's coming for sure. You deserved it today. I just got lucky.

"You are a hell of a competitor and player. No one on the tour wants to play you.

"This is not the end. It's only going up for you."

De Minaur is yet to win a major and will be eyeing the US Open, which begins August 24.

Alex de Minaur has blown the tennis world away with a beautiful gesture for his devastated opponent after the Washington final. De Minaur saved three championship points to win the 10th ATP title of his career on Sunday, prevailing 5-7 6-1 7-6 (3) against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.

Fokina was a shattered man after letting three championship points slip at 5-3 in the third - the third of which came when de Minaur produced some insane scramble to survive. The Spaniard has never won a title at ATP level, and has now fallen agonisingly short in two finals.

Fokina was in tears after the final point and buried his face in his towel. De Minaur noticed how distraught his opponent was and immediately went to console him.

The Aussie was seen sitting next to Fikona before wrapping an arm around his opponent and offering some words of encouragement. Tennis fans and commentators were blown away by de Minaur's gesture, which came before he'd celebrated the victory properly.

He also offered some kind words for Fokina in his victory speech, saying: "You're way too good to not have one of these (trophies). It's coming for sure. You deserved it today. I just got lucky. You are a hell of a competitor and player. No one on the tour wants to play you. This is not the end. It's only going up for you."

One person wrote on social media: "Hard not to feel for Alejandro Davidovich Fokina today and hard not to appreciate how kind this was of Alex De Minaur." Another commented: "I have a newfound respect for Alex De Minaur after he consoled Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. He is a remarkably humble individual."

De Minaur's triumph made him just the fourth Australian to record 10 career titles since the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990. The others are Pat Rafter, Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis.

The Aussie has surged from 13th in the ATP rankings up to World No.8, and looks destined for an all-important top-eight seeding at the US Open. Before the tournament began, de Minaur said he was adamant he was at his “peak” and big wins had to start coming.

“I've got the experience now. I've got the knowledge, the physicality side of things. Everything is just there for me to go out and perform,” he said. “I can really have a swing these next three or four years and really show that I'm at my peak and break through some barriers.”

With no rankings points to defend after Wimbledon because of a hip injury he suffered last year, the Aussie will only climb higher in the rankings before Flushing Meadows. The 26-year-old took a break after the French Open after feeling burnt out, and it appears to be working wonders.

He lost in straight sets to Alexander Zverev in the Washington final in 2018, but is now the champion. The World No.8 has a tour-leading 22 hard-court wins on the season, and his 42 wins at ATP 500 level since the start of the 2023 season is the most by any player on tour.

From surviving three-hour duels to beating top seeds Jessica Pegula and Elena Rybakina, Leylah Fernandez's DC run revealed a fighter ready for the hard-court summer.

From the beginning, Leylah Fernandez was all over Anna Kalinskaya, crowding the baseline and running down virtually every ball.

But with the end in sight, at 4-1 in the second set, Fernandez visibly tightened. She lost the first two points on her serve and the Tennis Channel announcers broached the subject of the inevitable “complications.”

But the nerves they conjured evaporated as Fernandez geared up and won four straight points -- the last two on an ace and another unreturnable serve.

Fernandez won the biggest title of her career on Sunday with a resounding 6-1, 6-2 win over Kalinskaya at the Mubadala Citi DC Open. With a strong field featuring four Top 20 players, this 70-minute result was totally unexpected.

Fernandez came into this Washington, D.C. tournament scuffling a bit. The 22-year-old Canadian hadn't won a tournament in nearly two years, had a middling record of 3-3 at the Grand Slams and a losing record overall.

But amid the oppressive heat and humidity and on the hardcourts that seamlessly suit her game, Fernandez was unstoppable. She took out No. 1-seeded Jessica Pegula in the second round and backed it up with a terrific victory over No. 3 Elena Rybakina in the semifinals, in a match that ran 3 hours and 12 minutes.

This was Fernandez's fourth career title, the first since Hong Kong in late 2023.

She'll take away nearly $200,000 and those 500 PIF WTA Rankings points -- but perhaps more important a growing confidence that maybe reaching that US Open final four years ago wasn't some kind of random accident.

Emma Raducanu, who won that final, has talked about the difficulty that followed the breakthrough -- the pressure and expectations, hers and everybody else's. Fernandez acknowledges that she struggled with the same thing.

“It was mainly my own expectations,” Fernandez told wtatennis.com an hour after winning. “I played some great tennis in New York -- a lot of my balls were going in. At some point, post-2021, I let my guard down a little bit. To be fair, my coach [and father Jorge] had warned me about it and I was just too naïve at the time to believe him.

“To say, `No, I've got to keep working, I've got to keep earning my spot. It's not going to be easy here on out.' So, post-US Open, it was hard to battle through that. And it's still hard, because we're still connected to that result until we both do another good result.”

This was also Fernandez's seventh final and, despite the fact Kalinskaya is four years older, that championship experience showed up in the final. Kalinskaya -- still a sparkling 9-3 in D.C. main draw matches -- came in without a dropped a set, but now she's 0-3 in Hologic WTA Tour finals.

Fernandez's ranking will rise a dozen spots, to No. 24 on Monday, and she'll play a first-round match, likely Tuesday, against Maya Joint for the second time in two weeks.

Fernandez spent a few minutes afterward fielding questions from wtatennis.com:

Your first title in almost two years, what does it mean to you?

It's been a long, long couple of years with a lot of ups and downs. Getting this title is great not only for confidence and self-belief, but also for the whole team and family. The past couple of years, we've gone through a lot of tough moments. This trophy just indicates how much they have fought. And it shows me if they can fight through their difficulties, I can do it in a little tennis match with a tennis ball coming back at me. That's the goal and the mentality. 

Talking to you all week, you seemed so confident, so upbeat … based on the work you've been putting in, did you have any sense this might be a successful tournament for you?

I had no idea [laughing] it was going to be a nice tournament for me. I just went in thinking … enjoy my time. I put in the work, I put in the hours. The important thing was to get here and do what I trained for. If there's things to work on -- there's always things to work on -- and it will be good preparation for Montreal and Cincinnati. It's a great steppingstone going into Canada.

You beat No. 1 seed Jessica Pegula and No. 3 seed Elena Rybakina. How does that make this title even more satisfying?

It's very satisfying. We've gone through some very tough opponents, from the first round all the way through to the final. Maya [Joint], she's a tough opponent and she's had an amazing year. Playing Jess in Washington, it's never easy. She loves hard courts, had some great results here. She wasn't going to give me anything. Taylor [Townsend] was another battle, physically and mentally. I've played doubles with her and we're pretty good friends, so setting that aside wasn't easy. I was cramping and back in the locker room, I told her ‘You killed me.' It wasn't going to be an easy tournament from the get-go, so to get through all those tough opponents and challenges was great.

How does winning in DC help you prove to people -- and maybe yourself -- the US Open final was not a fluke?

It definitely helps a little bit. It gives us some good momentum going into bigger tournaments. To play against the big players here in Washington -- it wasn't an easy draw -- it's a good feeling to get my first 500. And I hope -- hope -- I can continue with that momentum the next few tournaments, but also stay grounded and not forget there's a new beast every week. That we've just got to start from zero.

2025 Belgian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in a wet-dry Belgian Grand Prix, extending his Drivers' Championship lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris

Oscar Piastri claimed victory in the Belgian Grand Prix, holding off McLaren team mate and title rival Lando Norris in a wet-dry affair at Spa-Francorchamps to extend his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Heavy rain ahead of the 44-lap race delayed proceedings by almost 80 minutes but once racing got underway on Lap 5, the crucial moment came immediately as Piastri got a better run on his team mate and polesitter through Eau Rouge.

The Australian's run was so great he completed the pass along the Kemmel Straight well before the braking zone of Les Combes and thereafter managed a margin of roughly one second in the early running.

With the circuit having substantially dried and with track position, Piastri pitted on Lap 12 for the medium tyres with Norris forced to complete another lap, and after making his own stop the following tour for hard rubber, the Briton found himself nine seconds adrift.

Despite having to manage his softer compound, Piastri maintained a healthy gap which only reduced in the final laps to as much as 3.1s, but a small mistake from Norris at La Source on the penultimate lap meant the margin extended to 3.4s at the chequered flag.

The two title challengers were well clear of Charles Leclerc in third, the Ferrari driver finishing 20s behind Piastri but having held Saturday's Sprint winner Max Verstappen at bay throughout, the Red Bull man just 1.5s away from another rostrum.

FORMULA 1 MOËT & CHANDON BELGIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

Mercedes' George Russell enjoyed a lonely race for P5, having passed Alex Albon early on, with the Williams driver surviving constant pressure from Lewis Hamilton in the second half of proceedings to claim sixth.

Hamilton had climbed 11 places in his Ferrari after a pit lane start and was one of the first to switch from the intermediate tyres at the crossover point to eventually finish seventh.

Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto claimed 8th and 9th respectively, with Pierre Gasly's Alpine taking the final point on offer in P10 after heading a DRS train for much of the race.

This was headed by Haas' Oliver Bearman, with Nico Hulkenberg P12 after making a second stop having been running in the points, while Yuki Tsunoda lost two places in the closing stages.

The Red Bull driver finished ahead of Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Esteban Ocon (Haas), Kimi Antonelli, Fernando Alonso and Carlos Sainz - the Mercedes, Aston Martin and Williams drivers all starting from the pit lane.

Alpine's Franco Colapinto and Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar completed the order as all drivers reached the chequered flag as there was no caution period once racing had got underway after the delayed start.

With Saturday's Sprint having been held in sunshine and optimal conditions, drivers and teams were thrown a huge curveball on Sunday afternoon as heavy rain hit the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit less than 30 minutes before the start of the scheduled 44-lap race.

Unsurprisingly, the race started behind the Safety Car with polesitter Norris leading the field away from McLaren team mate Piastri with all drivers on the intermediate Pirelli tyre and searching for grip amongst the standing water.

Several drivers started from the pit lane after power unit and set-up changes, including Sainz, Hamilton, Antonelli and Alonso, with the quartet joining the back of the Safety Car queue as the formation lap got underway.

But with less than a lap completed, Race Control took the decision to red flag proceedings due to the large amounts of spray with Norris reporting, “I can't see a lot behind the Safety Car”, as all drivers entered the pit lane.

After nearly an 80-minute delay and suspension of the starting procedure following another heavy spell of rain, the field took to the track again behind the Safety Car under bright skies and the race officially got underway.

After four laps behind the Safety Car and with standing water at a minimum, racing finally commenced on Lap 5 with Norris leading Piastri, Leclerc and Verstappen into La Source at the rolling start.

Up Eau Rouge Piastri was nailed to the back of his team mate and comfortably moved ahead along the Kemmel Straight, completing the move well before the braking zone into Les Combes.

The Australian pulled a margin of one second by the end of the lap, while further behind, Russell moved up to fifth at the expense of Albon and Stroll dropped behind both Sainz and Hamilton down to 18th.

As the two McLarens began to clear out at the head of the field, Verstappen started to mount pressure on Leclerc for P3, while the second Ferrari of Hamilton passed Sainz for 16th into the final chicane on Lap 7 as Antonelli ran deep behind.

Hamilton's charge continued, passing Colapinto around the outside into Les Combes and Hulkenberg at the final chicane on Lap 8, with Gasly his next victim on the following tour into Stavelot.

By Lap 10, Piastri's margin to Norris sat at 1.7s, the race leader reporting that slick tyres would be needed soon, with Leclerc 5.5s adrift in his battle with Verstappen as the Ferrari driver struggled for rear grip.

But having added downforce compared with the Sprint, Verstappen struggled to gain a run on Leclerc along the Kemmel Straight despite much better exits from La Source.

Hamilton became the first driver to take the plunge for slick tyres, pitting at the end of Lap 11 from P13 and the Briton was joined by Gasly, Hulkenberg and Alonso as all drivers switched to the medium compound.

The following lap, Piastri pitted from the lead for the medium tyre as Norris continued on another lap, but behind the majority of drivers also stopped, only Tsunoda, Hadjar and Ocon staying out on their used intermediates.

Ocon soon became a roadblock for Leclerc, Verstappen and Russell, the trio passing the Haas driver at high speed through Blanchimont as Norris pitted at the end of the lap.

The decision was made to switch to the hard tyre in the hope of running to the end of the race, but the Briton lost time with a small problem fitting the front-left tyre and found himself 9.1s adrift of Piastri once up to speed.

Behind, Leclerc still headed Verstappen, Russell and Albon, with Hamilton now up to P7 as less than four seconds covered the group, with Lawson, Hulkenberg and Bortoleto completing the top 10.

The two Kick Saubers swapped positions on Lap 20 at the end of the Kemmel Straight, while behind, Antonelli demoted Colapinto for P15 as Hadjar made a second stop on Lap 21, swapping the medium tyre for hards.

At the halfway point, Piastri led Norris by 8.1s but was unsure whether he could manage his medium tyres without stopping again, claiming over the radio “I think it will be tough to get to the end”.

Outside the top 10, Gasly was several seconds away from the points but had a DRS train behind him in P11 consisting of Tsunoda, Bearman, Alonso and Antonelli.

Norris lost a further second in his pursuit of Piastri, running wide at Pouhon on Lap 26, while Antonelli moved ahead of Alonso for P14 into Les Combes the next lap as Sainz in P19 received a black and white flag for track limits at Eau Rouge.

Sainz had recently pitted for a set of hard tyres along with Colapinto, as the pair joined Hadjar at the back of the field as the only drivers to have made two pit stops.

Alonso was the next to stop at the end of Lap 29, with drivers struggling to manage the medium tyres on an almost completely dry circuit, with Antonelli and Hulkenberg also feeling the need to come into the pits over the following laps.

Hulkenberg, who had pitted from P10, moved up to 14th at the expense of Ocon along the Kemmel Straight and quickly closed a gap of more than six seconds to Stroll in front.

Antonelli was next to challenge Ocon after sweeping around the outside at Les Combes, but the Frenchman was able to move back ahead through the following bend as Alonso came to challenge the pair behind.

Out front, the gap between the leading pair began to close rapidly as Norris reduced the gap to just 5.5s at the start of Lap 38, and which came down to 3.8s on Lap 41, with Piastri told to potentially expect drops of rain at La Source over the remaining laps.

A deep moment into La Source on the penultimate lap all but ended Norris' charge having brought the gap down to 3.1s, eventually finishing 3.4s behind Piastri who extends his Drivers' Championship lead to 16 points.

Leclerc was 20s adrift in third but having held off Verstappen, with Russell a lonely fifth from Albon and Hamilton, the seven-time World Champion having moved up 11 places.

Lawson, Bortoleto and Gasly completed the top 10, with Bearman just missing out on the points after passing Tsunoda, who also lost a further position to the charging Hulkenberg on fresh rubber.

Stroll, Ocon, Antonelli, Alonso, Sainz, Colapinto and Hadjar completed the order as all drivers finished in a race which featured no further cautions after the delayed start.

"I knew that Lap 1 was going to be probably my best chance of winning the race, and I got a good exit out of Turn 1 and lifted as little as I dared through Eau Rouge and then it was enough," said Piastri.

"The rest of the race we managed really well, struggling a little bit at the end, maybe the medium wasn't the best for the last five or six laps through last laps but we had it mostly under control, which is what I wanted. I was pretty disappointed with myself after yesterday, but turns out starting second at Spa is not too bad after all."

F1 will travel directly from Spa-Francorchamps to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix over the weekend of August 1-3. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Prime Video is slowly but surely cementing its authority in the young adult genre.


	The streamer's incredibly popular adaptation of Jenny Han‘s The Summer I Turned Pretty returned for its third and final season earlier this month to stellar viewership. From Season 1 to Season 3, the premiere week-audience has tripled.


TSITP is no doubt a juggernaut for Prime Video that, unfortunately, has to come to an end. But make no mistake, YA will continue to be alive and well at Amazon. In fact, the series returns in the middle of what feels like a moment for Prime Video's YA slate, which has been growing slowly but surely over the past few years.

	











	The streamer is currently home to titles including We Were Liars, Motorheads, Maxton Hall and Overcompensating, with more on the horizon including Legally Blonde prequel Elle, series adaptations of Elle Kennedy's popular Off Campus college romance novels, and Rebecca Yarros' fantasy epic Fourth Wing. There are also titles in the works that aren't specifically YA but target a similar demo including The Better Sister, which launched in May, and upcoming works like The Girlfriend and Mike Flanagan's Carrie adaptation.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Prime Video's Head of TV Vernon Sanders tells Deadline it's all part of a plan to build an ecosystem of content that keeps the fans top of mind.


	There's a “sense of community we're trying to build at Prime Video that it's not just the destination to watch content, but it's a chance to connect with storytellers, creators and for audiences to build relationships with one another. So that's our ultimate goal, and we're seeing this summer the real fruits of those labors start to pay off,” he said. 

	











	In the interview below, Sanders talks more about the YA strategy at Prime Video and shares updates on several anticipated titles including many listed above.


DEADLINE: We knew TSITP was popular, but the numbers shared today truly are impressive. How have you used the success of that show and everything you've learned along the way to build the larger blueprint for YA television at Prime Video?


VERNON SANDERS: We knew that we had what we hoped was going to be a giant hit coming in Season 3. Credit to our PR and marketing teams who teamed up on a women-led campaign that started in spring and has spread through the entire summer. We were extremely excited to see the results on The Better Sister, which was a big hit for us. We've been really pleased with the build-up, whether it's We Were Liars or Overcompensating or Motorheads. We have The Runarounds coming later this year. We have The Girlfriend. All of these were really strategically placed throughout the year. This women-led campaign has really sort of brought it all together. There was a giant event in New York where we brought the cast of not only our U.S.-led series and movies, but we also brought our international cast. So we had the cast of Culpa. We has Maxton Hall, which is another hit. We've really created what we think is this fan-led community, which is really sort of humming along. So I think smart scheduling, and also this fan/customer-led campaign, has really ignited us here. We're very, very excited by the results.


DEADLINE: YA has always been a very enduring genre, but in the streaming era it struggled to find its footing. For a while, there no longer seemed to be a true “home” for YA content. Outside of just finding and bidding on good material, how do you build a library of titles in that space that feels cohesive and plants a flag establishing Prime Video as a streaming home for YA?


SANDERS: I think we're unique in that Prime Video has, obviously, all the roots of that Amazon helped build. The company got started by selling books. Our relationships with readers and authors, I think, is quite unique. I think we may have stumbled upon a little bit of a recipe that's really worked for us. Great adaptations lead to more book sales. More book sales lead to more conversation. That leads to success for all of us. I think it's about the voice, and so it doesn't have to just be an author who is adapting or a writer who's adapting or a showrunner who's adapting. We're also leaning into creators. We're trying to find those folks who just have something to say and and have had some success really resonating with that audience. So whether it's Megan Park or Benito Skinner — we're super excited by the results we've seen by from Overcompensating. Josh [Schwarz] and Stephanie [Savage] have had incredible success, and they're bringing that success to us. Julie Plec … Mike Flanagan is doing an incredible adaptation of Carrie. We love working with Reese Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter on Elle, which we think is going to be something that's going to surprise everyone. So it's really about the voice and building community, and that's what we're focused on for this part of our strategy.


DEADLINE: I really enjoyed Overcompensating. I hope to see more from that show.


SANDERS: We are hopeful. We've got some Season 2 writers rooms happening on several of our spring and early summer launches. We were always proud of Overcompensating, [and] just the reception of it has really, really given us even more encouragement. So stay tuned.

	











DEADLINE: When Season 2 of TSITP debuted, you mentioned Jenny Han was excited by the possibility of expanding the universe beyond the books. What's the temperature now? Might we expect spinoffs in the future?


SANDERS: That was probably wishful thinking for me at the time, and Jenny has stayed really focused to getting these seasons right. We're pursuing new and different things with Jenny right now. She's presented some some other things that are related to this. So once the full season is launched, we'll get into conversations, and we'll ask her to pick from the many things that she's surfaced. But we've moved away from those conversations.


DEADLINE: What about We Were Liars? Should we expect more?


SANDERS: Well, that's one of the shows where the writers are hard at work, working on what a Season 2 would be. We've been really excited by the results we've seen there, and it's one of the shows that I hope will have some positive news to report soon. They're hard at work in presenting us with material on a Season 2, and there's been quite a clamor from fans of that show to keep the story going. So we'll see.


DEADLINE: I also wanted to ask about Motorheads. That felt like a very new and different offering from Prime Video in the YA space, and I'm curious what drew you to it and what void it's helping fill in your content strategy?


SANDERS: We were just really wowed by the idea of the show. We were launching NASCAR this summer, and so having a show that actually spoke to fans of that genre [was an asset]. It was really just the characters. We feel like we lucked out getting into business with those showrunners as well. We are conscious of not wanting to repeat ourselves. So there's a real breadth to what we're trying to do. We're always trying to make sure that we've got some shows that are earnest. We've got shows that have some darkness to them, [like] We Were Liars. And Motorheads has just really sort of resonated with us and struck us. What I've been excited to see on that show in particular is we've got such great completion rates. So folks who start that show tend to watch it all the way through, and that's a great sign. So thanks for asking about that show. We're quite proud of it.


DEADLINE: I know it's film, but I feel obligated to ask about Red, White & Royal Blue. Anything you can tease on the sequel?


SANDERS: The film team would kill me if I revealed anything, so I'm gonna leave that to them, but that movie was an inspiration for all of us on the series side. It was so well done, and we took a lot of lessons and cues from that in terms of what we were doing.


DEADLINE: You also have Off Campus, another popular series. What can you say about where you are in that process?


SANDERS: I will share that we've been obsessively watching dailies, and we're really excited by what we're seeing. We should be getting our first cuts in the not-too-distant future, and that show is definitely going to be launching in 2026. So it won't be this year, but it will definitely be next year.


DEADLINE: As we are discussing the current state of YA at Prime Video, what does the future look like? What should we expect in the next five or so years?


SANDERS: As I said, this is a part of our strategy. We're also focused on young men, and we've had a lot of success with animation and some of our big tentpoles [have been] a real beacon for young male audiences. But for young women, I think it's not only wanting to build a great library that if someone comes in for a show, they are sort of brought into a whole world of options and great stories that has all the elements. So, romance, horror, surprise. We're excited about our adaptation of Fourth Wing, which we're really working hard at. If you look at that, it has so many elements to it. It's got a more smorgasbord of genres inside that. But I think the thing I'm most focused on, thanks to the teamwork between our marketing teams and our PR team, is this sense of community we're trying to build at Prime Video that it's not just the destination to watch content, but it's a chance to connect with storytellers, creators and for audiences to build relationships with one another. So that's our ultimate goal, and we're seeing this summer the real fruits of those labors start to pay off.

	











DEADLINE: I know this one is probably early stages, but since you mentioned it, how are things on Fourth Wing?


SANDERS: We don't have news to report yet, so I won't be breaking anything here, but we're hard at work. We love our relationship with Rebecca Yarros, who has been incredible, and we're going to get this one right. So that would be my promise to the fans.

She died at home from complications related to lung cancer and over her 16 years as president and chief executive of the Annenberg Foundation, she donated $1.5 billion to thousands of organizations in Southern California.


							By 

	The Associated Press



Wallis Annenberg, the billionaire philanthropist who supported the arts, science, education and animal welfare causes over decades in Los Angeles, died Monday, her family said. She was 86.


	Annenberg died at home from complications related to lung cancer, the family said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.




	“Wallis transitioned peacefully and comfortable this morning to her new adventure,” the statement said. “Cancer may have beaten her body but it never got her spirit. We will hold her and her wisdom in our hearts forever.”

	Her name adorns institutions across the Los Angeles area, including the Wallis Annenberg Building at the California Science Center, the Wallis Annenberg GenSpace senior center and the Wallis Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts.


	The Wallis Annenberg Wildlife Crossing, the world's largest bridge for animals on the move, will open next year over an L.A. freeway.


	During her 16-year tenure as president and chief executive of the Annenberg Foundation, the nonprofit organization has donated about $1.5 billion to thousands of organizations in Southern California, the Times reported.


	Under Wallis Annenberg's leadership, the foundation expanded its philanthropic scope beyond media, arts and education to include animal welfare, environmental conservation and healthcare.


	Her father, Walter Annenberg, started the foundation after selling his publishing empire, including TV Guide and other publications, in 1989 to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Walter Annenberg died in 2002.


	Wallis Annenberg was a longtime board member of LA's Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, or LACMA. In 2002, she gave $10 million to endow LACMA's director position.

Sometimes studios just can't fight the power of fan casting. In-demand star Elle Fanning recently confirmed that she joined prequel film “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping” in part due to fans online. 

“I think fans made this happen in a way,” Fanning told MTV in the below video. “The studio [Lionsgate] said they were getting kind of hounded online, like, ‘Elle needs to play Effie.'” 

Fanning was announced to be playing Effie Trinket on May 20; the character was originally brought to the screen by Elizabeth Banks, whom Fanning said that she “loves.”

 










Fanning added to ET that Effie is her “favorite character” because of “how great” Banks' performance is. According to Fanning, Banks also congratulated her on being cast in the role. “She sent me flowers that were beautiful, saying, ‘The odds are ever in your favor,'” Fanning said, continuing that she really does want to “get it just right [onscreen] especially for the fans.”

“Predator: Badlands” and “Sentimental Value” actress Fanning isn't even the only “The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping” star to be fan casted: Jesse Plemons is set to play Plutarch Heavensbee, the role originated by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, after audiences voiced how similar both actors looked.

Attempts at franchise fan casting has been rampant in recent years, to various degrees of success. Jessica Chastain has constantly shrugged off the “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” casting rumors, while there was a push for Aubrey Plaza to play “Tomb Raider” (a charge led by Edgar Wright) prior to Sophie Turner taking on the role. Wright's “Running Man” collaborator Glen Powell was said to be in talks as Cyclops, which he has denied (we at least do know that “X-Men” will be rebooted with a new cast).

The only real mic drop moment led by fans thus far took place in another MCU installment, “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.” John Krasinski had a cameo as a multiverse version of Reed Richards AKA Mr. Fantastic. Of course, Pedro Pascal is now playing the character in the latest “Fantastic Four: First Steps,” now in theaters.

Plus, Faheem Abdullah's "Saiyaara" hits the tallies' top 10.

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from the soundtrack to the hit animated film KPop Demon Hunters, rebounds a spot to No. 1 on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts. Two weeks earlier, the song became the first leader on each list for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI.

	











	HUNTR/X also earns its second Global Excl. U.S. top 10 as “How It's Done” rises 12-10. On the Global 200, it lifts 9-7 for a new best.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Plus, Faheem Abdullah's “Saiyaara” debuts at No. 10 on the Global 200 and blasts 177-4 on Global Excl. U.S. His first top 10 on the charts is from the Hindi-language movie of the same name that premiered July 18.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020 rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.


	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.

	











	“Golden” crowns the Global 200 with 98.5 million streams (up 20% week-over-week) and 8,000 sold (up 26%) worldwide July 18-24.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” rebounds 4-2 on the Global 200 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May, while two songs that debuted a week earlier descend: BLACKPINK's “Jump,” down to No. 3 from the summit, and Justin Bieber's “Daisies,” which dips 3-4.


	Saja Boys' “Soda Pop” — also from KPop Demon Hunters — buzzes 6-5 for a new Global 200 high, becoming the act's second top five hit. Their “Your Idol,” down 5-6, has reached No. 3. “Soda Pop” drew 51.6 million streams (up 7%) and sold 4,000 (up 14%) in the tracking week.


	Faheem Abdullah's “Saiyaara” launches at No. 10 on the Global 200, vaulting 321% to 98 million streams and 778% to 1,000 sold worldwide. The first entry on the survey for the Indian artist also hits No. 1 on the India Songs chart.


	“Golden” shines atop Global Excl. U.S.; “Jump” falls to No. 2; and “Ordinary” holds at No. 3, after eight weeks at No. 1 starting in May,


	“Saiyaara” skyrockets 177-4 on Global Excl. U.S., with the bulk of its streams from outside the U.S. (96.8 million, up 320%, of its 98 million worldwide). The song makes the third-greatest leap in the chart's history, with its 173-spot gain trailing only those of Official HIGE DANdism's “Subtitle” (186 places; 200-14, in 2022) and BTS' “Film Out” (182 spots; 185-3, in 2021). As on the Global 200, “Saiyaara” is Abdullah's first Global Excl. U.S. top 10 via his first entry.

	











	Rounding out the Global Excl. U.S. top five, “Daisies” backtracks 4-5 in its second week on the chart.


	Plus, “How It's Done” rises 12-10 to become HUNTR/X's second Global Excl. U.S. top 10 with 29 million streams (up 5%) and 1,000 sold (up 6%) beyond the U.S.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated Aug. 2, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 29. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service.

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” adds an eighth week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become his first leader on the chart.


	Concurrently, Warren's album You'll Be Alright, Kid vaults 19-5 on the Billboard 200, becoming his first top 10 on the ranking, after it was expanded with 10 songs, including “Ordinary.”


	Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, “Golden,” from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters and by HUNTR/X, the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, rises 4-2 for a new high. It also reaches No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart — becoming the first song by an all-woman group to lead the list since it began in 2013.


	Plus, Morgan Wallen's former Hot 100 No. 1 “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, at No. 4, sparks history for the singer-songwriter on the Hot Country Songs chart, where it leads for a 10th week. It marks his record-breaking fourth song to reign for 10-plus weeks, surpassing Florida Georgia Line's three.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 2, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 29. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 20.7 million official streams (up 6% week-over-week),  74 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1%) and 6,000 sold (down 12%) in the United States July 18-24.


	The track keeps at No. 4 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at the summit; scores a sixth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and drops to No. 9 from No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, where it has led for nine weeks.


	“Ordinary” also continues at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led in all nine weeks since the survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	“Golden” by HUNTR/X, the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, surges 4-2 for a new Hot 100 high. It simultaneously tops Streaming Songs for the first time, rising a spot with 25.7 million streams, up 12%, marking the Hot 100's top gainer in streaming for a fourth consecutive week.


	“Golden” becomes the first song by an all-woman group to lead Streaming Songs since the chart began in 2013. (Previously, four collaborations by two solo women and no other billed acts each hit No. 1: “Boy's a Liar, Pt. 2” by PinkPantheress and Ice Spice, in 2023; “WAP” by Cardi B featuring Megan Thee Stallion and “Savage” by Megan Thee Stallion featuring Beyoncé, both in 2020; and “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea featuring Charli XCX, in 2014.)


	“Golden,” from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters, also jumps 109% to 3.7 million in radio audience — it debuts at No. 35 on the Pop Airplay chart — and 10% to 4,000 sold. (A remix of the song by David Guetta was released Friday, July 25, and will count toward next week's charts.)


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100, and helps him make history on the Hot Country Songs chart, where it rules for a 10th week. The song, which topped the Hot 100 in its debut week in May, becomes his record-breaking fourth song to lead Hot Country Songs for 10-plus weeks, surpassing Florida Georgia Line's three.


	Wallen's other hits to dominate Hot Country Songs for double-digit weeks: “Last Night” (25 weeks, 2023); “You Proof” (19 weeks, 2022); and “Wasted On You” (11 weeks, 2021-22). Meanwhile, Florida Georgia Line's three such songs: “Meant To Be,” with Bebe Rexha (a record 50 weeks, 2017-18); “Cruise” (24 weeks, 2012-13); and “H.O.L.Y.” (18 weeks, 2016).


	Justin Bieber's “Daisies” drops to No. 3 on the Hot 100 a week after it debuted at No. 2, becoming his 27th top 10. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay (10.5 million, up 145%).


	Morgan Wallen's “Just in Case” holds at No. 5 on the Hot 100 after reaching No. 2.


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” lifts a spot for a new No. 6 Hot 100 high, a week after it became her first top 10.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and wrapped as the year's No. 1 song, ascends 9-7 — as it adds a record-extending 101st week on the chart overall and a record-padding 71st week in the top 10.


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 6-8 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” rises 11-9 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It runs up a 29th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest command on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” is steady at No. 10 following five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

It's not clear what title Greenstein will hold once David Ellison's $8 billion deal to buy Paramount Global officially closes.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	It's all but official: Sony Motion Picture Group co-president Josh Greenstein will depart the studio for a top job under David Ellison once the $8 billion Paramount Global–Skydance merger closes, sources confirm.


The Hollywood Reporter was the first to report this spring that Greenstein would be part of the management team installed by Ellison at the newly configured conglomerate. It's not clear exactly what his job will be, but it's expected to extend beyond only Paramount Pictures.




	The FCC approved the deal on July 24, but it won't officially close until August 7 or thereabouts. It's not clear whether Ellison will wait until then to officially announce his roster of executives beyond what's already known.

	Skydance and declined to comment regarding Greenstein. Ditto for Sony.


	Greenstein has a longstanding relationship with Skydance chief David Ellison and chief creative officer Dana Goldberg. 


	At Sony, Greenstein shares the co-president title with Sanford Panitch. He previously worked at Paramount Pictures, heading up marketing and distribution. He likewise first focused on marketing and distribution when joining Sony, but then moved up the ranks to co-head the motion picture group.

The world is still in mourning following the tragic death of “Cosby Show” star Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Naturally, his fans, friends, family, and industry colleagues have posted heartfelt tributes since the news of his death broke on July 21. Now, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his sister on the famed show, has weighed in. 

Malcolm-Jamal Warner passed away on July 20 while on vacation with his family in Costa Rica. Sadly, he drowned, and his official cause of death is listed as accidental asphyxia. His autopsy was completed on July 22. He leaves behind a wife, a daughter, and a slew of friends and family members. 

“Cosby Show” actress Keshia Knight Pulliam took to her Instagram account on July 27 to pay tribute to Malcolm-Jamal Warner. She said in the caption of the post, “A week ago I lost my big brother, but I gained an angel… I love you… I miss you… We got our girls.”

A post shared by Keshia Knight Pulliam (@keshiaknightpulliam)

The post itself contains a video of Malcolm-Jamal Warner on stage playing the bass guitar. Notably, Malcolm-Jamal wasn't only an actor. He was also a Grammy award-winning musician. It is believed that the video was from a performance at City Winery in Atlanta. 

The end of the clip shows two young girls walking with a horse. Many online believe the two girls are Keshia and Malcolm's respective daughters, but this has not been confirmed. 

Keshia Knight Pulliam also posted the clip to her Instagram story. Following this, she shared her reasoning for not commenting on Malcolm-Jamal Warner's passing sooner. She wrote, “Thank you for every text, call, and all of the love that you have sent my way…”

She went on, “I've just needed a moment.” Of course, this is understandable as it seems the two remained close in the decades after “The Cosby Show” came to an end. 

Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Keshia Knight Pulliam both starred on “The Cosby Show” throughout its run. This was from 1984 until 1992 on NBC. As her posts allude to, she played Rudy Huxtable, the youngest child in the family. 

As mentioned, the two remained close in recent years. According to USA Today, Keshia Knight Pulliam was even a guest on an episode of his “Not All Hood” podcast. This was about a month before his tragic passing.

Jake Sully and the gang are back, and this time, they're straight fire… and ash. With his latest dispatch from the far reaches of Pandora, director James Cameron is pulling the Sully clan out of the pool and tossing them in the fire, showing a different and much more flamable side of his fantasy world. The trailer for Avatar: Fire And Ash delivers plenty of both, as well as new creatures, characters, and beautiful views of his digital paradise. The film formerly known as Avatar: The Seed Bearer may no longer bear seeds, but it does show off a very different and equally impressive side of the fantastic planet.

Arriving before anyone can say that The Way Of Water had no cultural impact, the Fire And Ash trailer introduces audiences to the Mangkwan Clan, also known as the Ash People, who live in Ash Village on the side of a volcano. Led by Varang (Oona Chaplin), an Ash Na'vi in a red and black headdress, the Ash People go to war with Pandora's Forest and Water tribes. Sadly for our old friends, Varang says that their goddess, Eywa, has no dominion here. It's all the better for Stephen Lang's Quaritch, whose warships are on the hunt for the elusive unobtanium once again. But hey, Spider (Jack Champion) is back. Isn't it nice to see our boy raised by Na'vi once again?

﻿﻿﻿

We could spend all day discussing the series lore, marveling about those jellyfish hot air balloons, the preferred method of travel for the nomadic Wind Trader tribe. There are also brief glimpses of Tulkun. Will Payakun appear in the film? Inquiring minds want answers. Still, we know people want to look at the pretty pictures, and who could blame them? The trailer continues to utilize 3-D in ways that others have given up on. James Cameron has not. 25 years into his bizarre and immensely profitable venture, he shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, he's getting faster.

Plug your braid into the Tree of Souls with Avatar: Fire And Ash on December 19.

Suri Cruise, the only child of former couple Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, was spotted looking stunning as she strolled the streets of New York City on July 9, 2025. The 19-year-old wore a flowy low-rise skirt and cropped white tank top. She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag.

In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. The story says Suri's masterful use of interesting accessories elevates her basics to a level of street coolness. 

According to Hello! magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. “Of course, I will miss the close proximity, but I'm really proud of her and I'm happy,” the outlet says mom Katie Holmes told Town & Country about Suri's new chapter.

Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season.

A post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes)

“I can't wait to get back into a tank top. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. She also named “nice, simple slip dresses” as an essential. 

But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. “Wearing a glamorous dress to the ballet or opera makes me feel like I am the New York woman I dreamt of being when I was a little girl,” she told the “Fashion Bible.”

Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.”

The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans.

“JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters.

“You know you triggered an entire generation with this post,” teased another, before adding, “Cannot wait to see the project.”

A third fan quoted the show's famous line, “I remember everything,” and punctuated it with a crying emoji.

Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: In one of the biggest star-power packages to hit the TV marketplace in awhile, Emmy winner Sterling K. Brown, Oscar winner Da'Vine Joy Randolph and Black Panther‘s Winston Duke are in talks to lead a limited series based on Percival Everett's acclaimed 2022 novel The Trees. Marcus Gardley (The Chi) is writing the adaptation, which has sparked a bidding war, sources tell Deadline.


	Gardley is executive producing alongside Brown and Abby Victor for Indian Meadows, Selwyn Seyfu Hinds and Katie Zucker via Mad Massive Entertainment, and Everett. UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group, is the studio.

	Everett's The Trees is a fast-paced thriller that tackles racism and police violence. It opens with a series of brutal murders in the rural town of Money, MS. When a pair of detectives from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrive, they meet expected resistance from the local sheriff, his deputy, the coroner, and a string of racist white townsfolk. The murders present a puzzle, for at each crime scene there is a second dead body: that of a man who resembles Emmett Till.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The detectives suspect that these are killings of retribution, but soon discover that eerily similar murders are taking place all over the country. As the bodies pile up, the MBI detectives seek answers from a local root doctor who has been documenting every lynching in the country for years, uncovering a history that refuses to be buried.


	The roles have not been confirmed, but Sterling and Duke are believed to be playing the detectives.

	











The Trees reunites Brown and Hinds following their recent collaboration on Washington Black. Hinds is creator, showrunner and executive producer and Brown star and executive producer of the limited series, an adaptation of Esi Edugyan's novel of the same name, which debuted on Hulu last week.


	Brown, an Oscar nominee for American Fiction, is a three-time Emmy winner including for his roles in American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson and This Is Us. He is a double nominee at this year's Emmys for his new series with This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman, Hulu's Paradise, which he headlines and executive produces — for Outstanding Lead Actor In a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. That brings his Emmy nomination total to 12. Brown is repped by Jennifer Wiley-Moxley of JWM Entertainment Group, CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.


	An Oscar winner for The Holdovers, Randolph is also known for starring opposite Eddie Murphy in Dolemite Is My Name and for her Emmy-nominated role on Hulu's Only Murders In the Building. Her upcoming movies include Eternity and The Gallerist. She is represented by CAA and Fox Rothschild.


	Duke rose to stardom with his MCU role as M'Baku, which he originated in Black Panther and has reprised in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame and the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday. Other prominent film credits include The Fall Guy, Jordan Peele's Us, Netflix's Spencer Confidential as well as Sony Picture Classics' Nine Days, which he headlined and executive produced. Duke is repped by CAA, M88 and attorney John Meigs.


	Everett's The Trees was shortlisted for the 2022 Booker Prize and won the 2022 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, among other accolades. He is repped by CAA and Melanie Jackson Agency.


	Gardley co-wrote the 2023 feature adaptation of The Color Purple. His series credits also include NOS4A2, Maid and Foundation. He is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer.


	Hinds served as a writer-producer on Jordan Peele's reboot of The Twilight Zone. He has multiple films in development including Prince Of Cats, an adaptation of Ronald Wimberly's graphic novel, at Legendary, and 1000 Miles, based on the memoir Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom by William and Ellen Craft. Under an overall deal he had at UCP, he has been developing a TV series based on Usher's album Confessions. He is repped by CAA, Entertainment 360, and Del Shaw Moonves.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Corey Fogelmanis (I Wish You All the Best) has landed a role in The Adventures of Cliff Booth, Netflix‘s David Fincher-directed sequel to Quentin Tarantino's 2019 Oscar winner Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Netflix declined to comment. Character details are under wraps, as is the film's plot. Brad Pitt leads the ensemble, reprising his role as Cliff Booth, who in this film transitions from stuntman to Hollywood fixer. As previously announced, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Elizabeth Debicki, Scott Caan, Carla Gugino and JB Tadena will also star. Fincher directs from from a script by Tarantino.

	











	Fogelmanis will next be seen leading I Wish You All the Best, a coming-of-age drama marking the directorial debut of Tommy Dorfman, on which we were first to report. Starring alongside Lena Dunham, Alexandra Daddario and Cole Sprouse, the actor plays Ben, a reserved, non-binary teen navigating life under the constraints of his deeply religious parents. The film premiered to critical acclaim at SXSW and is slated for release via Lionsgate on November 7.

	Fogelmanis also stars as Nathan Walter in Netflix's series My Life with the Walter Boys, which returns for its second season August 28. He first garnered attention for his role as Farkle on the Emmy-nominated Disney Channel series Girl Meets World, starring opposite Sabrina Carpenter, and later appeared alongside Academy Award winner Octavia Spencer in Universal's psychological thriller Ma.

	











	Most recently leading the Hulu slasher Carved, the thesp is repped by Buchwald, Echo Lake Entertainment and Felker Toczek Suddleson.

Donald Trump doesn't appear to be ruling out the possibility of pardoning convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, telling reporters on Monday that he is “allowed to give her a pardon,” but that he is yet to be asked to do so.  


	“Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon,” Trump said when asked about the prospect while meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. “But nobody's approached me with it. Nobody's asked me about it. It's in the news, about that, that aspect of it.” 


	“Right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it,” he added before moving on to the next question.


	Last week, the Justice Department met with Maxwell — who is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and other charges related to her and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse ring — in an effort to determine if she has “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims.” The move is part of an effort by the Trump administration to appease members of the MAGA base furious over the administration's refusal to release large troves of evidence related to the Epstein case. 

	











	Trump gave a similar answer to reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about the possibility of a pardon for Epstein's longtime accomplice: “I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I haven't thought about.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Trump also told reporters on Monday that he had never had “the privilege” of going to Epstein's private island, Little Saint James, where the disgraced financier and convicted sex trafficker, who died in prison 2019, allegedly invited wealthy associates to party and have sexual encounters with underage girls. 

	











	“A lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island,” Trump said. “In one of my very good moments, I turned it down. I didn't want to go to his island.” 


	The president claimed that he had fallen out with Epstein — his friend for many years — not because he was a predator with a fixation on underage girls, but because the financier had poached his staff. “For years I wouldn't talk to Jeffrey Epstein. He did something that was inappropriate: He hired help, and I said don't ever do that again. He stole people that worked for me,” Trump said. “I said, ‘Don't ever do that again.' He did it again, and I threw him out of [Mar-a-Lago], persona non grata.”

	The notion that Trump is even considering a pardon for Maxwell has sparked backlash from Epstein accusers, as well as some Republican lawmakers. 


	“She didn't just procure girls for Epstein, but she participated in their abuse — I think that's an important thing for people to understand,” Epstein abuse survivor Annie Farmer said on Saturday in an interview with ABC News. Farmer added that if Maxwell were to be released from prison, it would be “devastating” not only to her but “for so many people involved in this case.” 


	Teresa Helm, another survivor, told MSNBC on Friday that a pardon for Maxwell “mean the complete crumbling of this justice system that should first and foremost stand for, fight for and protect survivors.”


	On Friday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) told NBC News that while it's up to Trump to decide whom to pardon, in his opinion, Maxwell's 20 year sentence “was a pittance. I think she should have a life sentence at least.”

	“So again, not my decision, but I have great pause about that, as any reasonable person would,” he added of the prospect of pardoning Epstein's accomplice. 


	The president seems to still be weighing his options.

The three-month trek broke local records in all nine cities it visited.

Beyoncé wrapped her Cowboy Carter Tour last night (July 26) with $407.6 million in box office and 1.6 million tickets sold over 32 shows. These are unprecedented numbers and, show-by-show, set a bevy of Boxscore records during its run.


	Dating back almost 40 years, all Boxscore data is based on figures reported to Billboard Boxscore from a variety of industry sources. Reporting is voluntary, and some artists, venues, and promoters opt to withhold data from representation on the charts.


	The Cowboy Carter Tour consolidated the routing of Beyoncé's previous tours to just seven American markets, plus London and Paris. In fewer cities, she played more shows, extending to four nights in Atlanta, five in Los Angeles and New York, and six in London. It's rare for an artist to play so many shows at a single stadium on a single tour, and with more dates, she was able to sell more tickets and push higher grosses.


	It all added up to $407.6 million in record speed. At just 32 shows, it's the shortest tour in history to cross the $400 million threshold – by a country mile. Next up is Beyoncé's own 2023 Renaissance World Tour at 56 dates, with nearly double the number of shows. Then, there's The Rolling Stones' 2017-2021 No Filter Tour (58) and Metallica's ongoing M72 World Tour (60 so far).


	Beyoncé was already all over the Boxscore record books heading into 2025, but her recent box office performance expands her footprint. The list below includes 47 records that she broke, tied or extended via Cowboy Carter Tour.


	Methodology note: when totaling Beyoncé's career-gross at each venue, her headline show grosses are added to 50% of her co-headline grosses, or 33% in the case of her tri-headline tour in 2004 with Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys.

	After beginning play over the weekend in front of The Fantastic Four: First Steps screenings, 20th Century Studios‘ trailer for James Cameron‘s Avatar: Fire and Ash has dropped. It's the first look at the third installment of the franchise, and comes ahead of its planned December 19, 2025 release.


	“You can't live like this baby — in hate!” exclaims Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) to his wife, Na'vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña). As we've known coming out of the press tour for Avatar: The Way of Water, not all Na'vi clans are nice, and we have known for a while the Ash People were going to be trouble. And the military humans led by Recom Miles Quaritch aren't letting up. Also shown here, Sully's children are in peril again, as expressed by Neytiri, and human friend Spider continues to get in entanglements.

	











	By the way, that's Oona Chaplin as the Ash Queen Varang, and she's a doozy. She exclaims to Sigourney Weaver's Kiri, “Your goddess has no dominion here.” Oooohh.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Also returning for part three is Cliff Curtis, Britain Dalton, Trinity Bliss, Jack Champion, Bailey Bass and Kate Winslet.


	Cameron directs and wrote the script with Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver, from a story by Cameron & Jaffa & Silver & Josh Friedman & Shane Salerno.


Avatar: The Way of Water hit an opening franchise record for the Cameron films with $134 million domestic, $441.7M worldwide. That second film ended its run at $2.32 billion, becoming the third highest-grossing movie ever at the global box office. Combined, the Avatar movies have grossed $5.24 billion, with the first 2009 movie remaining the highest-grossing movie ever with $2.92 billion.

	A new era of Who history began earlier this month with the launch of the Song Is Over farewell tour in Italy. The show marked not only the start of the band's supposed last tour, but also the unveiling of new drummer Scott Devours. He took over from Zak Starkey after a bizarre and protracted battle that played out in public, and placed Devour in a pretty awkward position. 


	“It really is a strange contradiction of emotions to have the greatest moment of my professional career also be one framed with some sadness and shadowed by someone else's loss,” Devours wrote in a message to fans in May. “It's tough to put into words actually, but I know it's there and it's real.”


	He continued: “In my world, there are no bigger shoes to fill than those behind Pete and Roger. The weight of this responsibility is enormous and I am feeling every ounce of it. What I want to say to all of the fans is that I will do everything I can to honor the legacy of the Who, Zak, Kenney Jones, Simon Phillips and the memory of the great Keith Moon.”

	A big part of the responsibility is playing parts that were largely originated by Moon, which is no easy task for any drummer. The most famous drum part of the night comes near the end of the show when they break out “Won't Get Fooled Again.” Here's a look at how the five main drummers in the Who have handled the solo over the years, with some bonus commentary Roger Daltrey's primal scream that follows. (And yes, we know it's not technically a pure drum solo since it's accompanied by an organ part.)

	











Keith Moon — May 25, 1978 @ Shepperton Studios in Surrey, EnglandJust four months before Moon's death, the Who gathered at England's Shepperton Studios to play a brief set for director Jeff Stein. He was prepping a documentary about the Who's history, The Kids Are Alright, and felt there weren't adequate versions of “Baba O'Riley” and “Won't Get Fooled Again” in the film vault. Moon was in suboptimal health at this point and was winded when they wrapped up with “My Generation,” but Stein begged them to do “Won't Get Fooled Again” one more time. That's the footage you see here, and it's also the single last song that Moon ever played with the Who.

	It feels unfair to judge Moon on his literal final performance of anything, and there are certainly better live renditions of the song from his younger years, but he still dug deep and largely nailed the solo. It's a great swan song. B+


The Scream: Near-perfect. It's Daltrey at his primal best. A-


Kenney Jones — Dec. 17, 1982 @ Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, CanadaThe Who could have pulled a Led Zeppelin when Moon died and dissolved the band. But they decided to soldier on with Small Faces/Faces drummer Kenney Jones just months after Moon's death. The new lineup made one unfairly maligned album, 1981's Face Dances, one appropriately maligned album, 1982's It's Hard, and then decided to call it quits after an expansive farewell tour. (Yes, it's now 43 years later and they've just kicked off another farewell tour. They are hardly unique in this regard.)


	The tour wrapped up at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens with a show that was broadcast around the world on Pay-Per-View. The main set ended with “Won't Get Fooled Again.” You can't see what Jones is doing since vintage images of the Who flash on the screen during this drum solo, but you can hear that he does his best to replicate Moon's original part. It lacks some of the power and finesse of the master recording, but expecting anyone to play like 1971 Keith Moon isn't fair. B- 


The Scream: This one is slightly thin and gets a little wobbly at the end. B-

Simon Phillips — Aug. 24, 1989 @ Universal Amphitheater in Los Angles, CaliforniaTo varying degrees, the Who laid the groundwork for power pop, arena rock, punk, and even progressive rock. They also laid the groundwork for reuniting just a few years after the conclusion of a farewell tour. When they came back in 1989 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tommy, and make oodles of money, they jettisoned Jones and brought journeyman drummer Simon Phillips into the fold. Simply put, Daltrey was never totally happy with Jones, and Townshend loved working with Phillips in the Eighties on his solo albums and occasional live show.

	











	When the tour hit Los Angles, they invited special guests Steve Winwood, Patti Labelle, Billy Idol, Phil Collins, and Elton John to join them for a complete performance of Tommy. The second set focused on hits from other eras, wrapping up with “Won't Get Fooled Again.” Phillips speeds up the drum solo and adds his own flourishes. It largely works, and we give him a lot of credit for not simply redoing Moon's original part, since Phillips is more than capable of doing that. B


The Scream: It's a beastly one, but it's almost ruined by the horn section chiming in. The Who got by just fine with four members in their heyday. Reuniting with a 15-piece was madness. B- 


Zak Starkey — Oct. 20, 2001 @ Madison Square Garden in New York, New YorkSimon Phillips had his hands full in Toto when the Who came back together in 1996 for a tour celebrating Quadrophenia. But Daltrey had recently toured with Ringo Starr's son Zak on drums, and he slid seamlessly into the Who. Starkey grew up on the Who's music, even learned to play the drums alongside Moon, and knew every nuance of their catalog. It was the perfect injection of youth and energy just as the group was starting to show their age.


	They were off the road in 2001, but reconvened at Madison Square Garden for a special show honoring the Sept. 11 first responders. This was a stacked bill that also included David Bowie, Elton John, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and Paul McCartney. But the Who undoubtably were the highlight. And Starkey's “Won't Get Fooled Again” drum solo is majestic. It's the best it sounded since the Seventies. A-


The Scream: Daltrey sounds a bit hoarse here, and he loses points for forgetting the “Meet the new boss/Same as the old boss” coda. That's an essential element of the song's finale. B- 


Scott Devours — July 20, 2025 @ Anfiteatro Camerini in Piazzola sul Brenta, ItalyThere are nice, clean ways for major rock bands to part with longtime drummers. Pearl Jam and Iron Maiden both recently handled the situation with great class and dignity. Unfortunately, the Who's separation with Starkey was the equivalent of peeling off a child's Band-Aid very slowly while the kid screams, putting the Band-Aid back on, and then doing it all over again. We may never know exactly why the Who fired Starkey earlier this year, un-fired him, and then fired him again. But it happened. And now Devours from Daltrey's solo band has the job.

	Devours filled in for an injured Starkey for brief periods on the 2013 Quadropehnia tour, but his official debut took place this month at the start of the Who's the Song Is Over farewell tour. They closed out the night with “Won't Get Fooled Again” even though “The Song Is Over” was on the printed setlist. (It was a punishingly hot night, and Daltrey had leg cramps.) Devours had a lot of pressure on him at this moment, but he delivered a powerful drum solo that kept to the original tempo. There will always be a special place in our hearts for Starkey, but this was impressive. B+ 


The Scream: This is a fierce one where it looks like it's causing Daltrey legitimate pain. He's said in recent years that he loathes playing this song, and especially hates delivering the scream every night, but we give him a lot of points for continuing to handle it himself, and not pass it off to a background singer.

Tom Cruise popped up at one of Oasis' reunion gigs in London over the weekend, officially putting to rest any lingering rumors surrounding the incredibly low stakes and deep cut (certainly by Oasis' standards) beef between the actor and band.


	Cruise kept a relatively low profile at Oasis' July 25 gig at Wembley Stadium, but he was spotted by the DJ/producer Goldie, who happened to be sitting a few rows ahead of him. Cruise can be seen in the background of one video Goldie posted on social media, while the DJ also snapped a selfie with the movie star. 


	While it would obviously make sense for a gigantic movie star who largely resides in London to attend one of the biggest concert events of the year, Cruise and Oasis do have a prickly history, as NME notes. Back in Oasis' 2007 tour doc, Lord Don't Slow Me Down, there's a scene in which brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher find some rare common ground, which just so happens to be roasting Cruise. 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“He's a little fucker, and he's not been in one good film in his entire career,” Noel declared. 

	











	Liam then proclaimed that Cocktail was “great,” then seemingly dismissed the (actually correct) opinions of others in the room who said Eyes Wide Shut was good, too. Liam then added, “I hate Tom Cruise. Bastard. Him and [footballer] Michael Owen.”

	If these comments ever rankled Cruise, it seems like he's gotten past them, certainly for the good of Rock & Roll. Also, for what it's worth, there was a very classically vague tabloid report in 2009 suggesting that, a couple of years after Lord Don't Slow Me Down, Cruise and Liam “made polite conversation” after running into each other at a Berlin hotel.

	











	Oasis have a few more shows left in London before continuing the U.K. and Ireland leg of their reunion tour. The run will touch down in North America later next month, with additional shows scheduled in Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and South America through November.

How's this for a logline? When it comes to the third film in James Cameron‘s massive “Avatar” franchise, “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” Disney will only share that this new installment “takes audiences back to Pandora in an immersive new adventure with Marine turned Na'vi leader Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), Na'vi warrior Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), and the Sully family.” That's all assumed, right? And, for now, that's about as much plot as we're going to get in the “Fire and Ash” realm.

The film's first trailer? It adheres to the same idea. When Disney showed the trailer to a select group of press last week — before a planned rollout alongside “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” which opened on Friday, and after a very brief leak of the first look earlier this month — the studio generously played it three times in a row. Each time, my reaction was the same: this looks amazing, but what the heck is going on here?

Top of mind: Who are these new Na'vi we're going to meet? Who are the so-called Ash people aligned with? Where do they live? What sort of neat animals do they have? And while this trailer does give us some good looks at this band of Na'vi, including their sooty village and their quite fierce leader, the big questions remain, plus a new one: are they actually fighting the Sully family and their aquatic Metkayina clan?

 










The brief glimpses we get at them hint that, at least during certain parts of the film, they are indeed fighting the Sully fam, even taking to the skies on their own be-winged animal pals in service to battle. In January, Cameron told Empire a bit more about the film, including some quite relevant notes on the Ash leader, Varang (played by Oona Chaplin). (You can get a good look at Varang and the Ash village in two concept art images shared above and below, provided by Disney.)

“Varang is the leader of a people who have gone through an incredible hardship. She's hardened by that. She will do anything for them, even things that we would consider to be evil,” the filmmaker said. “One thing we wanted to do in this film is not be black-and-white simplistic. Or blue-and-pink simplistic. … We're trying to evolve beyond the ‘all humans are bad, all Na'vi are good' paradigm. … She's an enemy, an adversarial character, but [Chaplin] makes her feel so real and alive.” That's worth keeping an eye out for in this first trailer.

At CinemaCon in April, star Saldaña said on stage that the film introduces two new clans, the Windtraders (who you can see in the top image) and the Ash People, who have forsaken the Na'vi's deity. A teaser clip shared at the event ended with one of these Ash people warriors threatening Sigourney Weaver's character by saying, “Your goddess has no dominion here,” which is also how this trailer ends. So, no, things don't sound like they've always been sunshine and flying dragons for the Ash people.

 










The film also stars Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Jack Champion, Britain Dalton, Trinity Bliss, and Bailey Bass. It was filmed alongside “Avatar: The Way of Water” from 2017 to 2020. Two planned (and currently untitled) sequels are in various stages of production and are expected to be released in 2029 and 2031, respectively.

Walt Disney Pictures will release “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in theaters on Friday, December 19. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Final grosses surpassed $400 million in just three months. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



On Saturday night (July 26), Beyoncé played the last of 32 shows on her Cowboy Carter Tour. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, it grossed $407.6 million and sold 1.6 million tickets, thus making it the highest-grossing country tour in Boxscore history.


	The Cowboy Carter Tour follows the pattern established by Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, which broke the same record in R&B when it wrapped with $579.8 million in 2023. Cowboy Carter Tour's country-heavy set list marks her swerve from one genre to the other.

	Beyoncé is the first woman, and the first American artist (male, female, solo, or group) to wrap two tours over the $400 million mark, joining Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, and Ed Sheeran among all acts.


	Dating back almost 40 years, all Boxscore data is based on figures reported to Billboard Boxscore from a variety of industry sources. Reporting is voluntary, and some artists, venues, and promoters opt to withhold data from representation on the charts. 


	The Renaissance World Tour played 56 shows in 39 cities, blanketing North America and Europe. The Cowboy Carter Tour employed a different strategy, compressing to 32 shows in just nine markets, eight of which were the highest grossing stops on the Renaissance trek. In fewer cities, Beyoncé bulked up her stays, extending to four nights in Atlanta, five in Los Angeles and New York, and six in London. It's rare to play so many shows at a single stadium on a single tour, so much so that she set or tied venue records for the most sold-out shows at all nine stadiums. Overall, the tour set more than 40 Boxscore records.


	More shows inevitably meant more tickets and higher earnings. Beyoncé's five-night run at East Rutherford, N.J.'s MetLife Stadium (New York area) grossed $70.3 million and sold over 250,000 tickets, becoming not only that venue's biggest engagement ever, but the highest-grossing reported stadium run on a single tour, ever.


	Six nights at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium brought in $61.6 million and exceeded MetLife in ticket sales with 275,000 between June 5-16. Sales also exceeded 200,000 in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Paris. Grosses surpassed $40 million in Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.


	Due to the relative expanse of the Renaissance World Tour, it remains Beyoncé's highest grossing and best-selling (2.8 million tickets) tour yet. But by focusing on the best-performing markets on her previous treks, the Cowboy Carter Tour achieved a new career peak. On a per-show basis, Beyoncé's 2025 dates score the highest average gross ($12.7 million), average attendance (49,900 tickets), and ticket price ($255.36) of her career.


	Posting such huge numbers in such quick succession, the Cowboy Carter Tour is the fastest reported tour to $400 million in Boxscore history, getting there in just 32 shows in 90 days. Among the 21 tours that have crossed that milestone, the next-shortest tour is Beyoncé's own, as the Renaissance World Tour's 56 dates narrowly beats 58 on The Rolling Stones' No Filter Tour and 60 on Metallica's ongoing M72 World Tour.


	The tour came in support of Cowboy Carter, Beyoncé's pivot to country music after she conquered the dance genre on Renaissance. Regarded as the first two acts of a genre-bending trilogy, both albums topped the Billboard 200 and sent their lead singles to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. They each won a Grammy in their respective field, claiming best dance/electronic music album in 2023 and best country album in 2025. Cowboy Carter went one step further, taking home album of the year, securing her record-extending 35th trophy. The only live performance she gave following the album's release – and before the tour kickoff – was a tour preview that doubled as the halftime show for Netflix's NFL Christmas day game, dubbed Beyoncé Bowl.


	Dating back to 2004's Verizon Ladies First Tour with Missy Elliott and Alicia Keys, Queen Bey has raked in more than $1.75 billion and sold over 13.2 million tickets over 463 reported shows. That includes the grosses of her six solo headline tours, plus 50% of her co-headline earnings on two tours with Jay-Z (2014, 2018), and one third of the 2004 grosses alongside Elliott and Keys. She is one of the 10 highest grossing acts in Boxscore history and is No. 1 among Black artists and R&B artists.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of The Fantastic Four: First Steps.

The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Marvel Studios' Hail Mary to reinvigorate interest in its diminished cultural behemoth, makes all the right moves. Its retrofuturist aesthetics and use of actual colors give the 37th entry in the mega-franchise a fresh look. Set on Earth-828, multiverses away from the mainline MCU, the story stands alone, meaning there's no homework required. It even sidesteps the franchise's longtime villain problem with a well-known and very big baddie. But to really shake off the post-Endgame doldrums, Marvel needed to stick not just the landing, but the deboarding—it's been a long time since one of the studio's mid-credits stingers has left a mark.

When Nick Fury first hinted at the Avengers Initiative, the MCU didn't immediately follow up. It built trust slowly, introducing characters at the end of one movie and fleshing them out in the next. Marvel was figuring out how to do this in real time, but it became a fixture of the franchise and a way to keep fan excitement up as the credits rolled. By the time Thanos (portrayed initially by Damion Poitier) was smirking at the camera in Avengers, things slowed down further, building toward Endgame by making Thanos updates a regular occurrence in the credits as the movies assembled a massive cast for the team-up. But more recently, with so many TV shows and movies to sift through, and so many increasingly obscure characters to look up, the stingers lost their luster. How many more movie tickets would we have to buy before this all started to make sense?

Over the last half-decade, these stingers hit one dead end after another. We heard of new battles to fight or friends to rescue, but nothing ever came of it. Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) hasn't been seen since he, Wong (Benedict Wong), and Katy (Awkwafina) went to karaoke—to say nothing of Wenwu's (Tony Leung) supposed successor, Xu (Meng'er Zhang). After ditching those three, Marvel introduced fans to Harry Styles' Starfox for still unexplained reasons. And remember when Doctor Strange grew a third eye, and Charlize Theron showed up as Clea Strange? Before returning to these dangling threads, Marvel moved on to an entirely new Phase. This may have been cleared up on Disney+, where, for all anyone knows, a Clea Strange limited series is wrapping up. No one can say for sure.

Recently, though, Marvel has been Invisible-Woman-clear about where this is going. The mid-credits moments from its last two movies are scenes that will likely appear in Avengers: Doomsday, tying that upcoming film directly to Marvel's First Family. The Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ mid-credits scene follows up on the one from Thunderbolts*; like how Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) pager guided viewers from Infinity War to Captain Marvel, seeing the Fantastic Four's Multiversal Ship pop up in Thunderbolts*‘ prepares us to head back to the swinging '60s. Building off that, First Steps‘ stinger, shot by the Russo brothers on the set of Doomsday and set four years after Galactus' defeat, shows Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) finding Doctor Doom playing with her son. Smash cut: “The Fantastic Four will return in Avengers: Doomsday.” It's a thoroughly effective, if predictable, tease, and with Marvel's next adventure, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, a year from theaters, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige needed a more forceful hook than usual.

Marvel wasn't coy about Doom. The Fantastic Four: First Steps teases him throughout, cutting to the empty chair of the representative from Latveria, Doom's dominion, at Future Foundation meetings. Even before that, though, Marvel put all its chips on Doom. At last year's Comic-Con, the studio rebutted years of criticism by announcing a retreat back to the old guard. The Russos were returning to direct Doomsday, and ex-Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. would come back to star as the film's antagonist, Doctor Doom. By heralding Downey's return a year and a half early, fans already knew his version of the character was in the mix. First Steps‘ stinger even generates some last-minute anticipation as Sue approaches him. Would he speak? Did he shave? Which Black Sabbath shirt would he be rocking? Marvel didn't shell out for Downey to actually appear in the 15-second cameo, so those questions will have to wait until the next issue, true believers. Still, in an era when Marvel leaves more dangling threads than it snips, it's a relief to leave the theater without scratching your head and rushing to Wikipedia. 

Although the Fox acquisition somewhat replenished Marvel's stock of A-list characters, particularly by bringing in the Fantastic Four and X-Men, it still needs to rebuild trust with its audience through clear setups and payoffs. It also has to teach new fans how this works; the kids born the same year as Iron Man will be voting next year. That, the literal passage of time, is where the mid-credits machine began to break down. Marvel took for granted how invested people were in its universe and, more importantly, how much time they had to spend in it. Merely adding an A-lister or obscure character to the MCU isn't enough. With First Steps, at least, it's clear Marvel is building to something, even if it's Doomsday prepping.

Following near-constant demand for a new edition, William Basinski has announced a deluxe reissue of his ambient opus The Disintegration Loops. The 8xLP set was newly remastered by Josh Bonati and includes a lengthy foreword by Laurie Anderson. The Disintegration Loops (Arcadia Archive Edition) is out November 7 (via Temporary Residence Ltd.). Watch trailers for the special reissue below. Plus, listen to an excerpt of the newly remastered version of “Dlp 1.1.”

The Disintegration Loops (Arcadia Archive Edition) includes the entire five-hour suite that Basinski originally captured while looping analog tape as it actively deteriorated in the process. All eight vinyl records are housed in full-color jackets featuring the restored original artwork, as does the 4xCD version. The deluxe reissue also includes Anderson's poetic 1,000-word foreword and a heavyweight, case-wrapped box holding all the materials.

“These dissolving sounds, this emptying space, has gained my complete confidence. They are taking me somewhere. I am willingly following these sounds, becoming more and more transparent,” Anderson writes in her foreword. “I am willingly following these sounds, becoming more and more transparent. And how does it end? The final fade isn't about the end of the music. It's like the music continues and I have stepped out of the river and moved away. The music itself is continuous, always there.”

Basinski originally released The Disintegration Loops in 2002. He reissued the album in 2012 for its 10th anniversary. Read about The Disintegration Loops at No. 3 in “The 50 Best Ambient Albums of All Time.”

How do you report the news if your own government is against the truth being exposed? Julia Loktev's acclaimed documentary “My Undesirable Friends: Part 1 — Last Air in Moscow” examines this now universal question as independent journalists worldwide are being labeled as treasonous dissenters. “My Undesirable Friends” takes place in Moscow during the winter of 2021, with the last remaining indie news station struggling to report on the invasion of Ukraine.

The all-female staff are soon deemed enemies of the state, and are forced to go into hiding after later being declared foreign agents. “My Undesirable Friends” premiered at the 2024 New York Film Festival and screened at Berlinale 2025.

The official synopsis reads: “At TV Rain, the only remaining independent channel, young journalists have been branded ‘foreign agents' — targeted for surveillance or worse, and required to tag their reporting with a disclaimer that they are serving foreign powers. Regardless, Ksyusha furiously produces and edits stories to distract herself from her fellow-journalist fiancé's imprisonment; Anya hosts everyday heroes of resistance on her interview show, while shielding both her sanity and her young daughter from the regime's relentless ‘fuckery'; Sonya produces the ‘Hi, You're a Foreign Agent' podcast at her kitchen table while beholding her empty living room (why buy a sofa when who knows what will happen to her?); and Alesya fends off anxiety that her office has been bugged, while hiding her relationship with her girlfriend from her traditional mother. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is just weeks away, as these Gen-Z heroines confront propagandist absurdity and personal endangerment, fighting for the soul of a country they love to the bitter end.” 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The IndieWire review selected the feature as a Critics' Pick, with the timeliness of the doc especially being praised. “My Undesirable Friends” is described as an “addictive thriller that gets to know its subjects with the fly-on-the-wall intimacy of a reality TV show.” 

“‘Being at the right place at the right time — or the wrong place at the wrong time' is how ‘The Loneliest Plane' director Julia Loktev has described the circumstances that led to the documentary she's made about Nemzer's work. First conceived as a look at the daily lives of reporters who've been branded ‘foreign agents' by their own government, the essence of the project — now a five-part, five-and-a-half-hour epic — was profoundly transformed four months into production, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion against Ukraine,” the review reads. “What begins as Loktev's attempt to understand what it's like to be forced to mark oneself as ‘other' — right down to disclosing foreign agent status alongside wedding pictures in social media posts — gradually turns into an accidental journey into the process of decision-making at the end of the world…”

Film Forum will release “My Undesirable Friends: Part 1 — Last Air in Moscow” in NYC August 15 with a national rollout to follow. Check out the trailer below.

Fubo has accelerated the expected timeline for closing its sale to Disney, now anticipating the transaction will close in the fourth quarter of this year or the first three months of 2026.


	It requires regulatory approval with a review ongoing at the Department of Justice. Fubo stockholders must also approve the deal at a meeting of shareholders, date still to come, the company said in a preliminary proxy filed with the SEC today.


	Previously, the close was expected in the first half of 2026.


	In January, Disney agreed to combine its Hulu + Live TV with Fubo and become majority owner of the combined company. The agreement was struck in the midst of a legal tussle that saw Fubo challenge a proposed sports streaming joint venture called Venu between Disney, Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery as anti-competitive. The partners delayed Venu's launch under a preliminary injunction and ultimately scrapped it and settled with Fubo after a judge denied their motion to dismiss the case.

	Disney and Fubo simultaneously announced their own deal to create an expanded MVPD player with 6.2 million subscribers.


	Fubo and Hulu + Live TV will continue to be available to consumers as separate offerings post-closing. Hulu + Live TV, will continue to be streamed in the Hulu app and be offered as part of the bundle with Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+. Fubo will continue to operate in the Fubo app. 


	The agreement gives Fubo the right to launch a new Sports & Broadcast service featuring Disney's sports and broadcast networks including ABC and ESPN well as ESPN+ if the deal closes or not.

	











	The new Fubo will continue to be run by current management led by CEO David Gandler. A board of directors has yet to be announced. Fubo will continue to trade on the New York Stock Exchange with the same stock symbol, FUBO.


	Disney will own 70% of the company. The media has had operating control of Hulu but gained full ownership in June when it completed the acquisition of Comcast's minority stake.


	Today's filing also included updated, combined pro forma financials for the March 2025 quarter – meaning numbers calculated as if Fubo and Hulu + Live TV were already one company.


	It reported total revenue of $1.56 billion ($1.12 billion Hulu + Live TV, $416 million Fubo), operating expenses of $1.64 billion, and an operating loss of $85 million.


	Po forma net income of $134.8 million showed a $41 million loss at Hulu + Live TV and a $188.5 million profit at Fubo, inflated by a $220 million gain that was part of the settlement with Disney, WBD and Fox.

Donald Trump continued his ostensible effort to distract from the Epstein files fallout by reviving his wildly unfounded accusation that celebrities like Beyoncé and Oprah Winfrey were illegally paid millions to endorse Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.


	Over the weekend, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he was “looking at the large amount of money owed by the Democrats, after the Presidential Election, and the fact that they admit to paying, probably illegally, Eleven Million Dollars to singer Beyoncé for an ENDORSEMENT (she never sang, not one note, and left the stage to a booing and angry audience!), Three Million Dollars for ‘expenses,' to Oprah, Six Hundred Thousand Dollars to very low rated TV ‘anchor,' Al Sharpton (a total lightweight!), and others to be named for doing, absolutely NOTHING!”


	This is not the first time Trump has aired these types of allegations. Back in May, for instance, he called for a “major investigation” after claiming that Harris violated campaign finance law by paying figures like Beyoncé, Oprah, Bruce Springsteen, and Bono for endorsements “under the guise of paying for entertainment.” 

	











	He reiterated this in his Truth Social post on Saturday, claiming the “ridiculous fees” received by Beyoncé, Oprah, and Shrapton were “incorrectly stated in the books and records.” He added, “Can you imagine what would happen if politicians started paying for people to endorse them. All hell would break out! Kamala, and all of those that received Endorsement money, BROKE THE LAW. They should all be prosecuted!”

	











	Trump has not offered any evidence of wrongdoing against the Harris campaign or the celebrities he's accused. Additionally, there is technically no law against campaigns paying celebrities for endorsements, though any payments do need to be disclosed. Similarly, when it comes to hosting events with celebrities, campaigns are required to cover the fair-market value costs of production so as to prevent individuals or companies from donating more than federal contribution limits.

	For instance, when Beyoncé appeared at a rally for Harris in Houston, Harris' campaign paid her company $165,000 for “campaign event production,” according to campaign-finance records (via The New York Times). That figure is, of course, significantly lower than the $11 million sum Trump has falsely accused her of receiving. (The multi-million figure began circulating online not long after the Houston campaign event, and Harris' campaign quickly debunked it as “not true.”)

	Similarly, Winfrey's company was paid $1 million to cover production costs and salaries related to a live-streamed town hall in Detroit. Winfrey has previously said the sum did not include a personal fee. And the $1 million sum is also notably less than the $3 million Trump has accused Winfrey of taking. 


	Reps for Beyoncé and Winfrey did not immediately return requests for comment. A rep for Sharpton's National Action Network said, “There was unequivocally no violation. National Action Network never made an endorsement and Rev. Al Sharpton never received anything.”

Pete Davidson and girlfriend Elsie Hewitt made their first public appearance together since revealing they're expecting their first child. The couple attended the Los Angeles premiere of Pete's new movie “The Pickup” at Regal LA Live on Sunday, July 27. The soon-to-be parents walked the black carpet hand in hand and shared a sweet kiss for the cameras.

The 31-year-old comedian and the 29-year-old model posed together and separately, marking a significant milestone in their blossoming relationship.

In “The Pickup”, Davidson stars alongside Eddie Murphy and Keke Palmer in a high-stakes action comedy about a routine cash run gone wrong. Davidson plays Travis, one of two armored truck drivers ambushed by a crew of savvy criminals, led by Palmer's character Zoe. 

As chaos erupts, Travis and Murphy's Russell must work together to survive an increasingly dangerous day. The film is set to premiere on August 6 on Prime Video.

Just days before the “The Pickup” premiere, Pete opened up about fatherhood at the New York premiere of his other film, “The Home,” on July 22. “I'm very lucky and very, very happy,” he told E! News, making his first public comments since Hewitt confirmed her pregnancy on July 16 via Instagram.

Davidson shared how deeply meaningful becoming a parent is to him. “Being able to take care of something and show it the childhood I didn't have,” he said. 

“I assume you just try to give them what you didn't have, and what you didn't like, not do it.”

Pete shared that his close friends, including longtime supporter Adam Sandler, have been incredibly encouraging. “Everybody's just been super excited for me, because they know it's been my dream,” he said. “They all just have been like, ‘You're going to be great at this. It's the best thing you'll ever do in your life.'”

He added that Sandler “gave me some great advice,” and said the warm support has meant a lot to him.

Davidson and Hewitt were first linked in March when they were spotted together in Palm Beach, Florida. By May, a source told People the couple had already moved in together.

Then, on July 16, Hewitt confirmed they were expecting their first child, posting a carousel of photos—including a sonogram—with the cheeky caption: “Welp now everyone knows we had sex.”

Mamie Van Doren has outlived them all. One of the three heavy-hitter blonde bombshells of Hollywood's golden age — the others, of course, being Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield — Van Doren is 94 years young and living a helluva life. On Labor Day weekend, she will be honored with the Legacy Award at the annual Cinecon Film Festival and present a screening of her underrated film noir, 1959's “Guns, Girls and Gangsters.”

In the very definition of a wide-ranging interview, Van Doren spoke with IndieWire about her unique legacy, that string of movies in the '50s and '60s, but mostly her rollicking (and insanely interesting) personal life — a life that quite literally has included encounters with virtually every big name of the past 75 years. I mean, everyone. One of her first Universal Studios-arranged dates was with Rock Hudson. You know, the Rock Hudson that was an incredibly popular leading matinee idol, the epitome of a manly man, only to be outed years later after his tragic AIDS-related death in 1985.

“With Rock Hudson, they said he was gay at the studio… ‘You don't have anything to worry about.' But that's not true. That was not true at all,” Van Doren recounted. “He came on to me, and in my book I told about having [on] a Crimmins skirt and him getting very passionate and rolling on the kitchen floor.”

 










I guess for those dirty details, we'll have to read “Play the Field,” her aptly-titled autobiography (she also wrote a second memoir about her pet cockatoo titled “China and Me”). Keep in my mind, we're talking about a woman who was discovered by Howard Hughes. Yes, the one Leonardo DiCaprio played in “The Aviator.” And, no, she does not think that movie accurately captured Mr. Hughes.

“Is it accurate? Uh… no,” she said. “I met him, and he had a little bungalow at the Garden of Allah [Hotel in Hollywood] when he was seeing me. He also had one up at the Beverly Hills Hotel, but the real young ones he kept up at the Garden of Allah. And the swimming pool was beautiful… I was taking my shower after I got out of the pool, it was at night, and he insisted upon me getting my hair wet in the pool, because he had a role for me in the picture that he said that I had to have wet hair. So, I get out of the pool… I had a bikini… and I ran into the bungalow, showered, came out, and I got towel around me. He's laying in bed.”

At that moment she considered, “What do I do, Mamie?” She thought about her idol, classic Hollywood star Jean Harlow, and whether or not she would get into the bed. “I know she did it,” Van Doren decided. So she got into the bed with Howard Hughes.

 










“I jumped in bed. I said, ‘Howard… I have to have a rubber. You have a rubber?' I peeked under the sheet and there was already a rubber on him. Well, shall I say… I thought that penises were the size of the man, — if he's six foot four or five — the penis is going to be more in keeping with the size of the man. Well, that's not the way it works,” she recalled.

Van Doren was born in South Dakota but became a Los Angeles home girl after her family moved to the city in 1942, when Mamie was just nine years old. Of course, in those days, she was Joan Olander, named in honor of Joan Crawford. She entered beauty pageants, earning the titles Miss Palm Springs and Miss Eight Ball, and that led to her contract with Hughes and RKO Radio Pictures — of which he was the then-head. When she later moved to Universal, she took on Mamie Van Doren — named after the then-First Lady Mamie Eisenhower. At the time, Van Doren was a Republican.

That didn't last.

“I was a, I would say, Eisenhower conservative. I idolized Eisenhower. I watched the war years — because I was born in '31 and I went through the war years, a very strong time in my life — and I was out here, so I watched,” she recounted. “I knew everything that was going on in the war. I watched it very closely. It was a very strong time in my life. It's an imprint in my mind of World War II. And then Korea came along, and most people, kids my age, went to Korea and got killed, and then came along Vietnam. And then I said, ‘Well, hell, nobody's paying any attention to these grunts out there… and I got very involved with Vietnam.”

 










Vietnam changed her perspective, even transforming her into a much more liberal activist.

“I went over there in '68 and I did a lot of clubs, and I got paid for the clubs and everything, but between clubs, I would go to the hospitals and entertain. And it was a terrible, bloody year. 1968 was the worst bloody year they had. We really lost a lot of young men. And when I came back home, I just felt really awful, and I watched the war very closely, and when I saw our pilots being marched in cages in Hanoi… I decided to go over there,” Van Doren said.

It was a high-risk area to be. Mamie's helicopter was even shelled. “I had to be really, really careful,” and she instructed the soldiers who transported her that if taken prisoner, “Kill me. Don't let them take me.”

As for her film stardom, she appeared with virtually everybody, including a series of films starring rock ‘n' roll idols making their breaks into cinema — Jerry Lee Lewis, Conway Twitty, Paul Anka, and Eddie Cochran among them. Her best-remembered role is likely as the second lead in the romantic comedy “Teacher's Pet,” starring Clark Gable and Doris Day. Her part, however, ended up a little more slight than it was supposed to be.

 










“[Gable] saw me at Warner Brothers in the commissary, and he wanted me for the part that I got, and it was a larger role when I read it. And then when I went to see it, they cut the scene out that I had in the dressing room, which was a very cute scene. It was a kissing scene, and they said that I look like [Gable's] grandchild or something stupid. And why would he go out with Doris Day when he had me? Luckily, someone saved it, and I have this clipping of him kissing me,” she remembered. “If I had had the scene that I had… I think I could have gotten probably an award or something of an acknowledgement, because it was really done well.”

One of her co-stars in that movie was Gig Young — over whom she literally dodged a bullet.

“I had a problem with that one. I was very on the outs with my husband at that time, but we were still together, and I didn't have any kind of relationship with him then, but I realized that he liked me,” Van Doren said. “And then Merv Griffin had a show coming out of Las Vegas. [Young] was on the show, and I was on the show. Well, he was there, and he wanted to take me out. And I didn't want to go out with him. There was something about him that I didn't particularly care for. I have a sense that's really good. I have a really good nose for horse flesh, that's for sure. And I refused to go out with him. He got very upset and very mad at me, and then I heard later that he married somebody, and he shot her.” Young, it should be noted, also shot himself after he shot his fifth wife Kim Schmidt in 1978.

 










Van Doren didn't ever play by the studio's rules. Married five times, Mamie had a son with band leader Ray Anthony, in 1956. That didn't sit well with Universal.

“It was hard because there weren't any women at the studio… the men ran the studio and ran everything. So I kept pushing and pushing, and sometimes I did things I shouldn't have done, and then… I found myself pregnant, and I got married afterwards, and then that was unheard of. At least it got me out of my contract at Universal,” she said, explaining that Universal didn't want her to have the baby.

With the '60s bringing a new feminine ideal, Van Doren's blonde bombshell fell out of favor. Monroe, a personal friend of Van Doren's, died in 1962.

“Marilyn and I were very good friends, and we liked each other. We went to the same drama coach,” Van Doren said. That coach was Natasha Latz. “I got to know Marilyn… I was 12 years old when I first met her, she was at the Blue Book Modeling Agency at the Ambassador Hotel, and I lived out back at the Ambassador Hotel. And when I was a kid, and I would go into the swimming pool all the time, and I used to see her modeling all the time. So I met her when she was 17 then and I was 12. We used to see each other all the time at parties, and I knew what she was doing all the time… She really had a hard time of it.

 










Thinking back on Monroe's tragic death, Van Doren observed, “Marilyn always thought she had to have a man with her. She's always looking for a father, but she was crazy about [John F.] Kennedy. I think they only went to bed one time, and then he passed her on to his brother. And she got hung up on Bobby [Kennedy], and she just couldn't stand rejection anymore.”

Even if she largely exited filmmaking long ago, Van Doren has never left her talent behind — a talent that blossomed under the rigorous studio system of the 1950s.

“My talent was just incredible. It came very natural. As an actress, I didn't have any problem. As a singer, I didn't have any problem. All I did was vocalize and I could sing. As a dancer, I wasn't as good as a dancer because I have large breasts, and that's a lot of work… I really was lucky. I got to learn how to dance really well. I did a lot of ballet at Universal. They paid for all that. That was part of my studio contract,” she said.

Van Doren remains an enduring cultural icon, one that is part of a lineage of bombshells that has led to modern-day stars like Pamela Anderson. In 2006, Van Doren even appeared alongside Anderson in a titillating photo spread for “Vanity Fair.”

“I was very proud of myself,” she said. “I thought, I look just as fucking good. I had my real tits. There's a lot of things I never had to do anything to improve upon… and I felt very secure. I never get insecure with women. If there is someone that is better than me, I take my hat off. I love beautiful women. I really adore women that are talented, strong. I don't have a jealous bone in my body when it comes to another woman.”

 










Van Doren has also remained outspoken about causes dear to her, serving as an early high-profile grand marshal for the LA Pride Parade in 1987 — at the height of the AIDS Crisis.

“Elizabeth Taylor came along trying to say that she was the first one that ever did anything for the community. And it was a very bad shock… I wasn't invited to anything after that,” Van Doren explained. “So, the gay community got together and… put me in the parade and made me the queen.”

Van Doren said that, after Taylor took on the task of being a leader in the campaign to fight AIDS, she and other advocates were “iced out.” “A lot people — we were all the first ones — we're all getting ready to go to this charity thing that [Taylor] had, and they called us and told us that we weren't wanted. That was the end of it. I want to make it very clear in history, she was not the first one. She only did it after Rock Hudson died.”

For Van Doren, it is about the guiding principle of just being a good person… paying it forward.

“I've got a couple of wonderful angels on my shoulder. I really believe that, and I have a connection with God. And everything I do, there's a reason why I do it. It's to help and be kind to people. I've tried to be kind to people even when they weren't kind to me. And if I'm around someone that's very bad, I try to just get away from it. I don't like to be around bad things,” she said.

 










And soon, Van Doren will tell even more in a forthcoming third memoir, as well as the documentary “Mamie Confidential,” currently in production. To say it'll be must-see would appear to be an understatement. Van Doren actually promises it will be a “lulu.” As for who should play Van Doren in a potential biopic, Mamie has a definite opinion: Sydney Sweeney.

“I've watched her movies. She's a good actress. She hasn't had that one plum that she needs. And that one plum is my movie called ‘Mamie Van Doren.' I'd love to have her play me,” she said.

Among the other honorees will be Ann-Margret and Juliet Mills… stay tuned for the IndieWire exclusive interviews with those icons, coming soon.

Mrs. Doubtfire star Matthew Lawrence has said he would “love” to bring back Robin Williams using artificial intelligence.


	Williams and Lawrence appeared as father and son in Chris Columbus' beloved 1993 comedy drama, which was based on the novel Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine.


	Speaking to Entertainment Weekly at Comic-Con over the weekend, Lawrence said he has spent time thinking about reviving Williams' “iconic” voice with AI. Williams died by suicide in 2014 at the age of 63.


	“I would love — now, obviously, with the respect and with the ok from his family — but I would love to do something really special with his voice because I know for a generation, that voice is just so iconic,” Lawrence explained.

	“It's not just the fact that I knew him and worked with him and so it's in my head — it's in everybody's head. And it would be so cool.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The actor, who went on to appear in Boy Meets World, NCIS, and Marry Christmas, said the notion was sparked by watching an old commercial featuring a voiceover from Williams. 


	“It's kinda like this very contemporary, modern, almost sort of foreshadowing of what's going on commercial that he did, where he did this computerized voiceover,” he added. 


	“And it always stuck with me. And then, during his passing, with the AI coming out, I'm like, ‘Man, he's gotta be the voice of A.I. He's gotta be the voice in something.' So yeah, I would love to do that.” 

	











	Cultural figures have been resurrected using AI with the permission of their estate. Netflix's The Andy Warhol Diaries recreated the artist's voice using the technology, while something similar was done with Val Kilmer on Top Gun: Maverick. 


	It is not without controversy, however. Scarlett Johansson said she was “shocked” that OpenAI used an imitation of her voice despite her declining to be part of the project months earlier. OpenAI said the voice was not intentionally modeled on Johansson,  but paused its use.

	For as long as there has been a gun-rights movement, the movement's leaders, industry representatives, and academic supporters have argued that carrying firearms made Americans more secure. Studies conducted over the past 14 years by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry's trade group, have meanwhile found that the practice is a boon for business. But what is good for profits, according to one NSSF study from that period, has resulted in a harmful trade-off: As armed Americans have moved into public spaces, people in every corner of society have felt an increased sense of danger.


	That market-research report, produced in 2018 and titled “Multi-Generational Research: Purchases, Perceptions, and Participation for the Firearms Industry,” was based on a survey of 1,800 people, spanning four generations, from baby boomers to Gen Z, and asked a wide range of questions covering a variety of gun-related topics. The researchers concluded that “more Americans feel less safe when it comes to people legally carrying concealed guns in public.” The finding applied to non-gun owners and gun owners alike, as well as to both ends of the political spectrum. “While millennials, liberals, and non-owners are more adamant about feeling less safe,” the study continued, “a majority of gun owners and conservatives also don't feel safe when it comes to concealed carry.”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In spite of these findings, the NSSF is pushing the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a federal bill that would bar states from fully enforcing their laws on gun carrying. The bill has broad support among conservative lawmakers, with 186 Republican co-sponsors in the House and 46 in the Senate. If the legislation arrives on President Donald Trump's desk, he has pledged to sign it.

	











	In addition to the 2018 report, The Trace and Rolling Stone obtained four other NSSF-funded reports, covering a period between 2011 and 2024. Taken together, those reports show, in plain writing, that concealed carry is a pivotal driver of gun-industry profits, and turning away from it would be detrimental to business. 

	











	After these findings were summarized for Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat, he said, “The gun industry isn't just selling firearms; it's selling fear, even to its own customers.” Padilla added that the reciprocity bill “would decimate longstanding, common-sense gun regulations, making it impossible for states like California to choose how they protect their residents and endangering countless law-enforcement officials. This would be outrageous federal overreach and wouldn't make anyone safer — it would just make it easier for the gun lobby to turn a profit.”

	IN MODERN AMERICA, THE PRACTICE of concealed carry was once strictly regulated, and local authorities commonly held wide discretion over who received a permit. But in the 1980s, the gun lobby spearheaded a nationwide effort to loosen restrictions. During the next two decades it became possible in most states for a person to acquire a carry permit if they could legally purchase a firearm, pay a nominal fee, and pass a rudimentary training course. Some 23 million Americans now have permits, according to an estimate from the United States Concealed Carry Association.


	That figure, though, does not account for another tectonic shift over the past decade: Americans carrying guns without a permit. Twenty-nine states have eliminated them entirely, allowing a legal handgun owner to carry their weapon in public, hidden from view, regardless of whether they know how to use it.


	For now, a law that allows a resident of one state to carry a concealed handgun often does not give that person license to do so in another. New York and California, for example, home to the country's most populous cities, have implemented strict guidelines, including reference checks, and not following them is a criminal offense.


	Since the start of the Trump era, the NSSF has zealously advocated for legislation that would override local control over carry laws, arguing against a “confusing patchwork of ever-changing rules for firearm owners when traveling across state lines.” The NSSF-endorsed Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would allow a person who legally carries a handgun in their home state to carry everywhere in the country, regardless of their proficiency, or whether they could pass reference checks that might raise concerns.


	The NSSF, a nonprofit, is the gun industry's chief representative on matters of gun policy, and its core purpose is to do whatever it can to help ensure the industry's future. One way it achieves this goal is by funding market research for its members, who largely consist of gun retailers and manufacturers, not the general public, who in most instances does not have ready access to the research, which lives behind a costly paywall.  

	











	In the 2018 multigenerational study, respondents were asked to finish this open-ended statement: “People legally carrying concealed guns makes me feel …” Overall, 57 percent of non-gun owners said “less safe,” while another 27 percent said “no impact.” Meanwhile, 28 percent of gun owners specifically said they felt “less safe,” on top another 27 percent who said they felt “no impact.” That meant, the researchers noted, that despite the prominence of concealed carry, a majority of gun owners “still don't feel safer.”


	The study also raised serious concerns about the future. After a decade of high-profile mass shootings, including Sandy Hook and Parkland, the “majority of Millennials want change,” it found, with 59 percent stating they would “support a political movement to abolish the Second Amendment.” The study warned: “the NSSF may have already lost millennials.”


	During previous calls for reform, the industry and its boosters have argued that a significant portion of Americans are on their side. But, according to the study, this was not true. Despite, for example, the National Rifle Association's defiant posture after Sandy Hook, the study found that only 18 percent of respondents “completely” agreed that “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun, is a good guy with a gun,” followed by 20 percent who agreed “somewhat.” Americans, in other words, did not believe that the solution to the problem was more gun carrying. “Changes to current gun laws seem inevitable,” the study said, “with a majority of Americans thinking that gun laws should be made stronger and 72 percent of Americans saying that passing additional gun laws would have an impact on gun violence in America.”


	As the NSSF enthusiastically promotes reciprocity legislation, it has never publicly disclosed its awareness of concealed carry's negative psychological effects on all types of Americans, including gun owners. 


	The organization declined to provide a comment for this story, and neither the White House nor the bill's primary sponsors, Senator John Cornyn and Representative Richard Hudson, responded to questions about the multi-generational study's findings.


	“Responsible gun owners know that carrying a firearm safely is a skill that requires years of practice and training, and many of them are rightly concerned about everyday carry because they know it's dangerous,” says Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat to whom The Trace and Rolling Stone also described the findings of the NSSF studies. “The gun industry spends millions of dollars lobbying for policies that put guns into the hands of people who have no idea how to use them responsibly because they care about making money.”

	











	IN THE 1990S, LEADING GUN-RIGHTS advocates and conservative lawmakers strategically embraced conspiracy, fearmongering, and hyperpartisan politics to mobilize voters. As the decade came to a close, the strategy was just beginning to bear fruit for the firearms industry. At the time, 26 percent of gun owners said they owned a firearm for self-defense, according to a widely cited survey by Pew, and there were only 2.7 million permit holders nationwide. But over the next decade and a half, as carry laws continued to loosen, that number jumped to 48 percent, becoming the top reason, by far, for owning a gun. During the same period, there was a roughly fivefold increase in permit holders. 


	The more that fear was stoked among Americans, the more they were motivated to purchase firearms for protection. And the majority of the buyers were people who already owned guns. 


	In 2011, the NSSF commissioned a report on handgun ownership and usage, based on a survey of nearly 11,000 handgun owners. Ninety percent of the respondents owned an average of 7.4 handguns, while only 10 percent owned one. Nearly 70 percent of the multiple-handgun owners said they planned to buy another firearm in the next year, while more than 50 percent of single-handgun owners planned to do the same. 


	For those who already owned multiple handguns, which was almost everyone, the report said, “The main use for their most recently purchased handgun is concealed carry.” The report added that 61 percent of single-handgun owners who had bought their weapon sometime over the past three years planned to acquire a concealed-carry permit within a year, while 35 percent already had one.


	Between 2012 and 2018, Americans experienced public carnage at a relentless pace. There was the movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado; Sandy Hook; the vigilante killing of Trayvon Martin; the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina; the Pulse night club massacre; and the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, at a Las Vegas music festival. After 17 high school students and staff were gunned down in Parkland, Florida, calls for reform were louder than ever before, creating a perilous moment for the gun industry.


	Yet the gun industry and its support groups continued their absolutist position against regulation, pushing for civilians to arm up and advocating for laws that would make it as easy as possible to carry firearms in public. The financial incentive could not be ignored. In 2018, the NSSF produced a report titled “Concealed Carry Market,” a study based on more than 4,500 survey respondents and drawn from lists generated by gun-rights groups. The report overtly ties concealed carry to profit. “The more frequently someone carries a handgun the more they tend to spend on carry handguns, ammunition and accessories,” the study reads. It goes on to stipulate the relationship is correlational, but specifies, “This trend is very strong and held across all categories and for both men and women.”

	The report also noted the “explosive growth” in permit holders, which, it pointed out, “does not include individuals in states that do not require a permit.” The report added: “As conceal carry laws continue to ease across the country, it is anticipated that the number of permit holders will continue to increase. As the ranks increase so will the need for carry-friendly handguns, ammunition and carry equipment and accessories.”


	Every few years, the NSSF produces retail reports, based on surveys with hundreds of gun retailers. As The Trace and Rolling Stone reported in June, white male buyers comprise some 60 percent of the gun market — a vast overrepresentation that may be creating a pipeline of heavily armed extremists. The surveys also show that, year in and year out, handguns account for 40 to 45 percent of firearms sales, more than any other weapon. In the group's most recent report on first-time gun buyers, covering a purchase period between 2021 and 2024, researchers found that 64 percent of respondents bought a semiautomatic pistol. When asked what gun-related issue most concerned them, more than 40 percent of gun buyers answered, “Restrictions on carrying a firearm in public places.”

	Speculation surrounding Collins' health began circulating online this week, with some social media users falsely claiming that the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer had entered hospice — a facility typically reserved for end-of-life care. However, a rep for Collins confirmed to TMZ that those rumors are unfounded.

	The spokesperson clarified that Collins is currently hospitalized, but only due to a recent knee operation, and not due to any terminal condition.

	Concerns over Collins' health have been ongoing in recent years. The former Genesis frontman has openly discussed his medical challenges, many of which stem from a serious spinal injury he suffered in 2007. Complications from that injury led to nerve damage and drop-foot, a condition that has left him with little to no sensation in one of his feet. Since 2015, Collins has used a cane to walk and has had difficulty standing for extended periods.


	In his 2024 documentary Phil Collins: Drummer First, which premiered on Dec. 18 on the Drumeo YouTube channel, the musician gave a candid update on how his health has impacted his life and career.

	











	 “I've spent all my life playing drums. To suddenly not be able to do that is a shock,” he said in the film. “If I can't do what I did as well as I did it, I'd rather relax and not do anything. If I wake up one day and I can hold a pair of drumsticks, then I'll have a crack at it. But I just feel like I've used up my air miles.”


	Collins, who officially retired from performing with Genesis in 2022 following a seated farewell concert, also shared in past interviews that he had postponed recording new music due to feeling “very sick.”


	His final Genesis performance in London saw him joined by longtime bandmates Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks, and was marked by an outpouring of love from fans. At the time, Collins joked to the crowd, “After tonight, we've all got to get real jobs.”


	Collins has achieved remarkable success on the Billboard charts throughout his career, particularly during the 1980s. As a solo artist, Collins earned seven No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including “Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now),” “Sussudio,” and “Another Day in Paradise,” which spent four weeks at the top.


	His 1985 album No Jacket Required dominated the Billboard 200, earning diamond certification and winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. With Genesis, Collins reached No. 1 with “Invisible Touch” in 1986.

Jay Leno, who previously helmed The Tonight Show, criticized late-night hosts whose political jokes only appeal to “half their audience.” 


	During a recent interview with the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, Leno said it's important to use humor that gets the “whole audience.” He added that hosts risk losing viewers if they are seen “cozying up to one side or the other.”


	“To me, I like to think that people come to a comedy show to kind of get away from things, you know, the pressures of life, whatever it might be,” Leno said. “Now you have to be content with half the audience because you have to give your opinion.”


	Leno recalled his friendship with Rodney Dangerfield as an example of not letting politics get in the way. “I knew Rodney 40 years and I have no idea if he was a Democrat or Republican,” Leno noted. “We never discussed politics, we just discussed jokes.”


	The former host concluded by saying, “I don't think anybody wants to hear a lecture.” He added. “I love political humor, don't get me wrong. But it's just what happens when people wind up cozying too much to one side or the other. Why shoot for just half an audience all the time? You know, why not try to get the whole. I mean, I like to bring people into the big picture. I don't understand why you would alienate one particular group — or just don't do it at all. I'm not saying you have to throw your support [on one side]. But just do what's funny.”

	Leno hosted The Tonight Show on NBC from 1992 to 2009 and again from 2010 to 2014. Jimmy Fallon took over as host in 2014. Leno's interview was taped several weeks ago, but the comments come after the surprise cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. Its network, CBS, cited financial reasons, but it is presumed that the move was political. Colbert's fellow late-night hosts, including Jon Stewart, Seth Meyers, John Oliver, and Jimmy Kimmel, have all voiced their support for him.

	











	David Letterman, who hosted The Late Show from its inception in August 1993, called the cancellation “gutless.” “This is pure cowardice,” Letterman told former Late Show producers Barbara Gaines and co-host Mary Barclay in the video. “You're telling me 60 Minutes, the pinnacle of journalistic excellence and integrity for decades … they decided, ‘Aw, we're sorry, let us give you $20 million.' I believe this is in the wake of that.”

	A veritable treasure trove of unreleased and unheard Billy Joel material has arrived alongside the conclusion of the music legend's And So It Goes documentary.


	Celebrating the life and over 60-year career of the Grammy Award-winning recording artist, Billy Joel: And So It Goes made its debut on HBO on July 18, with its second and final part premiering a week later on Friday, July 25.

	Just hours after the conclusion of the film, an extensive 155-track “musical companion” was uploaded to streaming services, compiling six-and-a-half hours of unheard material and live performances from Joel's storied career.


	Alongside early tracks from his time as a member of groups such as The Hassles and The Lost Souls, the 115 songs are also accompanied by audio clips of Joel and others providing introductions to the following selections.

	A number of live cuts from notable performances such as Joel's appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test and some recorded the day he signed with Columbia Records, are also present, as is the debut rendition of “Scenes From an Italian Restaurant” – recorded on May 6, 1977 at C.W. Post College in Long Island.


	“I always wanted to write a cinematic type of song about the lives of people I knew in high school,” Joel explains of the song. “People who peaked too early.”

	











	Though never released as a single, the near-eight-minute song was later released on The Stranger that same year and would become one of Joel's most revered songs, along with his most-played.


	Produced by Steve Cohen, Bradshaw Leigh and John Jackson, the new collection is likely to be accompanied further releases of similarly unheard material in the future. “There's a ton of stuff that's in his personal vault and there's a ton of stuff that's in Sony's vault, with not a ton of overlap,” Jackson told Ultimate Classic Rock. “We are determined to go through both things in the coming years.


	The premiere of the new documentary comes just months after the Rock & Roll Hall of Famer canceled all of his upcoming shows due to his diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, writing in a statement at the time, “I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding.” 


	His team also shared at the time that he would be undergoing “specific physical therapy” to combat the disorder, which has affected his hearing, vision, balance and performance capabilities.


	Joel provided an update as to his current health status during an appearance on Bill Maher's Club Random Podcast just last week on July 21. “I feel good,” he explained. “They keep referring to what I have as a brain disorder, so it sounds a lot worse than what I'm feeling.”

Yolanda Hadid is embracing her role as “Oma” in the sweetest way possible. The former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star recently gave fans a glimpse into the custom candy nook she built inside her Texas home for her granddaughter Khai.

In a series of Instagram Stories, Hadid showed off glass jars brimming with sweets—gummy bears, M&Ms, cookies, and more—lining a dedicated section of her pantry. “My mind wants all of that, but my body wants just this,” she captioned one photo, referring to a green smoothie.

“Obviously, this is inspired by my granddaughter Khai when she comes, because she loves candy,” Hadid said in a previous home tour with Architectural Digest. “So I said, ‘Oma will make you one little section for you.'”

The pantry, while whimsical and colorful, doubles as a tornado-safe room. “I have some blankets up there, so if we get in a storm, I'm gonna make myself a little bed and eat all my candies, and I think I'm gonna do just fine,” she joked on Instagram.

In addition to the candy pantry, Hadid revealed a specially designed “bunk room” for Khai and any future grandkids. The western-inspired room features three full-size bunk beds with faux sheepskin headboards, cozy wood paneling, and themed bedding. There's even a section with a vanity and storage area for toys and clothes.

“My bunk bed room design was inspired by my granddaughter Khai… her presence has given me so much inspiration, truly the greatest blessing and honor in my life,” Hadid wrote on Instagram last November. “You think you know about love at this stage and then you become a oma.”

A post shared by YOLANDA (@yolanda.hadid)

The setup isn't just for Khai, who is the daughter of Yolanda's eldest, Gigi Hadid. Yolanda revealed that the space is a favorite among all of her children, including Bella and Anwar Hadid, whom she shares with ex-husband Mohamed Hadid.

The space also includes snacks for her adult children. “All the kids when they come, they love different things, so I have a little bit for everybody,” Hadid added.

Hadid also revealed the bunk room is a place where Khai can bring friends—and perhaps one day, younger siblings or cousins. “I just wanted to make her something really cute where she can bring friends, and I'm hoping for two more grandkids,” she told Architectural Digest. “I just wanted, you know, a cute place where they could all be together.”

The Bravo alum has continued to share glimpses of her serene life in Texas, often featuring peaceful scenes from her farm and tender moments with family. In a recent birthday tribute to her son, she included more images of Khai, showcasing their close-knit bond.

'Supernatural' Star Jensen Ackles Makes Bold Comment About His Character, Dean Winchester originally appeared on Parade.

Supernatural star Jensen Ackles is sharing his thoughts about his beloved character, Dean Winchester.

While speaking to Collider for a June 25 interview, Ackles, who starred as the demon hunter Dean, discussed filming the series for 15 seasons. Ackles spoke about his acting choices for Dean, who famously has difficulty expressing emotions. The Boys star said he believed his Supernatural character chose to hide his pain through his humorous comments and sometimes surly demeanor.

“I think his vulnerability was something that was heavily guarded in a lot of the first seasons," said the 47-year-old actor. "As the show went on, you got to kind of peel back a little bit of that vulnerability, and see that there's a young kid there who never had a childhood, who missed his father, who missed his mother, who fights for his brother. Of course, all of that's under the gruff exterior of what he had to create in order to face the world that he was in.”

Ackles also shared he has a preference for playing complex characters, like Dean, on television shows, as opposed to movies.

“It just makes for a more complex character and more complex storytelling. That's one of the reasons why I love doing television so much as opposed to features… You don't just have an hour and a half or two hours to do so. You've got 13 episodes, or you've got 15 years," said Ackles during his Collider interview.

Ackles shared that his equally complex character, Detective Mark Meachum, on the new Prime series, Countdown, is somewhat similar to Dean. During a June 18 interview with TV Line, Ackles said "there's some familiarity there." He explained while Mark has real-world issues, as opposed to Dean's constant fights with supernatural creatures, both characters face their problems with guns blazing.

"There's some familiar aspects to those two characters. They are a little cavalier in the way that they attack the dark forces," continued Ackles.

Trisha Paytas probably feels like a passenger on Ozzy Osbourne's “Crazy Train” as the internet continues to push conspiracies that her newborn baby, Aquaman, is the musician reincarnated. “My baby is just a baby y'all,” the social media figure captioned a TikTok post where she played the song with the aside, “What plays in my head 12 days postpartum and the internet won't stop with the reincarnation conspiracies.”


	Paytas gave birth on July 12, but didn't make the grand reveal online until July 22. Within hours of her announcement, news broke that Osbourne had died at the age of 76. Suddenly, there was a collective sense of déjà vu. As her comment section filled with people joking “Welcome back, Ozzy,” it called to mind the fervor around her daughter Malibu, who was born the same day that Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022. The reincarnation jokes had reincarnated themselves.

my baby is just a baby y'all 😔


	“I was so out of my trolling era, and I was in such a good space spiritually,” Paytas told Rolling Stone in 2024. “The fact that my pregnancy got ruined by trolling — now, I guess, it's kind of funny and karmatic. But it just made me so upset.”

	In a follow-up TikTok, Paytas added: “I know reincarnation theories about my babies are just a meme, it's just what the internet does, but I'm not gonna lie — being 12 days postpartum sometimes make you feel a little cookoo. I'm like, wait, why does the internet keep wanting to put souls into my baby? First of all, reincarnation is only one soul into one baby, if you believe in that. Second of all, you guys, I don't know much about reincarnation, I just know that the soul has to be passed along.”

	She admits that the Queen Elizabeth II jokes were “kind of funny,” though she found the Pope Francis theories (she was pregnant with Aquaman when he died) less comedic. But more than anything, she said, “It makes me sad, it makes me feel like I did something wrong.”


	The Osbourne jokes are even more uncomfortable for her. “Ozzy has real family, he is such an icon,” she said. “It's more real. Ozzy's more real. There's real people involved and I don't know if they would love being tied to [him] being reincarnated. They just lost him. And then everyone else passing away, it's not my uterus doing it.”

Ideas that were once fringe are increasingly part of Australian public life. Ariel Bogle and Cam Wilson say they may not be about a singular event, but an overarching interpretation of how the world works

On the edge of George Street in Sydney, a woman is wrapped in an upside-down Australian flag. She holds one side of a large banner that reads ‘GROOM DOGS NOT KIDS', showing pictures of poodles with ears dyed rainbow and pink.

There are young people, people in their sixties and seventies, parents with children in prams. There are t-shirts imploring you to ‘think while it's still legal'. Another person holds a sign declaring their staunch opposition to a town planning initiative that's been erroneously linked to the rollout of a new surveillance regime, ‘Aussies SAY NO to 15 minute cities. FREEDOM'.

It is May 2023 and almost everyone has a smartphone in hand. They are live streaming, posting on the messaging app Telegram and waiting for the start of what is alternatively called the We Are Ready march or the Worldwide Rally for Freedom. What the crowd shares is a belief that something is very wrong. The sorry state of the world has an explanation both attractively simple and entirely complex: there are powerful and nefarious forces working secretly against us. Nothing is as it seems. Everything is connected.

Did Australian prime minister Harold Holt drown at sea or was he kidnapped and taken away in a Chinese or Soviet submarine? Are Masonic symbols hidden among landmarks in Canberra? Is the government hiding UFOs at Pine Gap?

These aren't just questions that interest people at events like the Worldwide Rally. We're all primed to dabble in these kinds of stories, the clues and coincidences that add up to something altogether fascinating. They can simply be a fun group activity on the internet. For most people they won't become an all-consuming worldview or a call to action – for others, they do.

There isn't a great deal of available research about who believes in conspiracy theories in Australia and why – it's a difficult concept to measure. Based on our reporting, believers defy a neat categorisation of interest or class, even as members of these groups fear “elites” who are conspiring against them, or categories of “outsiders” taking what they deserve. It's hard to say whether one country's population is more conspiratorial than another but there are conditions that often correlate with conspiracy belief, including perceptions of inequality and corruption.

Some research suggests Australians aren't more conspiracy theory-prone compared with other countries. A 2019 survey found a majority of the Australians surveyed endorsed at least one of the conspiracy theories included by the researchers, ranging from Holt being kidnapped by a Chinese submarine to the claim the Australian racehorse Phar Lap was poisoned by American gangsters. Others were more sinister. There were those who believed the Port Arthur massacre was orchestrated by the government as a cover to disarm the nation. Or that fluoride in the water is part of a plot to make Australians docile and easier to control.

What did people mean when they said they agreed with these ideas? Was it a playful scepticism towards power or a complete worldview? Should we call them all conspiracy theorists? Clearly not.

Conspiracy theories are not just for the “fringe dwellers of society”, the study concluded. “Our results suggest that basic human motives may give rise to extraordinary beliefs for many ordinary people.”

Many people are suspicious about how power works, and they are right to be. In the United States, it's been argued that conspiracy theories about the “deep state” – claims that there is a “shadow government” in control no matter who is voted in – partly emerged from “excessive state secrecy and official deception”. Australia's institutions, too, are notoriously secretive and insular. The revolving door between politics and lobbying is well known. Anyone with even the most passing familiarity with our history knows how cruel the state can be, how it was built on violence and displacement, and how it can organise itself against the interests of the people it claims to protect.

But when this suspicion tips into an unyielding dedication to stories that can rationally be disproven, when grievance is nursed and monetised, when fear becomes an end in itself, common ground rapidly disappears, and any evidence that does not align with these beliefs, no matter how compelling, is rejected. Conspiracy theories point the finger at groups operating in secret against the people. They operate as “accusatory and suspect, rather than as accepted knowledge”, as author Joseph Uscinski writes. As we and others have found, conspiracy theories are often as much about creating enemies as unveiling some hidden truth.

Whatever their prevalence or how deeply these beliefs are held, there's something disturbing at work here. We've watched closely as once-fringe ideas and the language of conspiracy have become increasingly part of Australian public life, egged on by politicians and influencers in search of an audience, and by irresponsible journalism and new ways of communicating online. Terms such as “QAnon” and “sovereign citizens” have gone from internet jargon to common parlance. They are monetised and made into elaborate cover for racism. Believers harass nurses and election workers, clog up the courts, infiltrate councils and even get elected to parliament. In some cases, we see them take up weapons.

Certainly, there are those whose experiences of living in Australia – a nation with a documented history of profound brutality to First Nations people, immigrants and other vulnerable groups – have created justifiable suspicion of those in power. Many of those we've spoken to have turned to these ideas after moments of profound disruption and tragedy, after they've fallen through the cracks. For others, it goes beyond scepticism into fantasy that does not lead anywhere useful. 
 As the march crosses the Pyrmont Bridge, the crowd spots a drone filming the protests. ‘How long before they put an AK-47 on it?' one man jokes.

The march reaches a small stage near the Google offices. A grey-haired man materialises and tells the crowd to put aside their differences. “Doesn't matter if you're . . . anti-vaccine or even, God forbid, pro-vaccine . . . as long as you're for freedom,” he says.

It seems increasingly as though conspiracy theories are not about a singular event but an overarching interpretation of how the world works. They can create a sense of identity and group membership. At the Worldwide Rally for Freedom in 2023, like so many of the events we attended, no one seemed as if they were a single-issue protester – it was vaccines and child-predator cabals and a one-world government that would take all our freedoms one by one. If they hadn't personally lost something, they were about to.

This is a feeling ripe for exploitation. Despite the appearance of standing up in the face of power, conspiratorial tropes are also useful to those with political, economic and social status because they are typically about something happening to “us” because of an elusive “them” – “a virtuous group under threat from a nefarious enemy”. You can take on the position of victim without losing much of anything, and direct the vitriol in another direction.

We're living in an era where conspiratorial ideas have leached into public life thanks to politicians and the media. They help make them mainstream for political purposes, from fake claims about climate science, to raising doubts about the safety of vaccines. Rather than reflecting a diffuse style of political paranoia, as historian Richard Hofstadter famously wrote about the United States in 1964, contemporary conspiracy theories in Australia are often used by those with power as a political weapon against vulnerable groups – a cynical inversion of the power structure they supposedly reveal.

Mass sightings of mysterious drones lighting up the New Jersey skies in November 2024 triggered an online frenzy and had every conspiracy theorist leaving their bunker to claim we were being invaded by flying saucers.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received more than 5,000 drone tip-offs from worried citizens, describing them as objects "the size of cars" and sometimes flying low in formation.

"The truth is out there," concluded Mulder and Scully in The X-Files – but not, apparently, if you're asking the Pentagon, as the Mirror reports.

The US government quickly dismissed all UFO reports, claiming the lights were from manned aircraft. And the Federation of Aviation Authority (FAA) was forced to begrudgingly admit the drones were authorised research.

This attempt to suppress information by authorities is being investigated by a new show UFOs: Why Are They Here? on BLAZE.

"Time and time again you see cases where very credible witnesses see something inexplicable in the night sky. But the official statement is to minimise that eye-witness experience... which makes it look like they're covering it up," reports investigative historian Andrew Gough, who along with the documentary's team of UFO experts, historians and archeologists, helps connect the dots between the increasing numbers of detailed encounters recorded and what we think we know about alien life.

"There's much more to life than we understand. Somewhere out there is other life," he says.

World UFO Day commemorates the first and most important widely reported UFO sightings in June 1947, when pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed he saw nine shiny crescent-shaped flying objects travelling at high speed near Mount Rainier, Washington.

A few weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred. Those who believe say an extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed in the New Mexico desert and alien bodies or "debris" were recovered by the US Government.

"Roswell happened," argues Andrew. "Two weeks later the US Department of Defense is created and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is created. These things are created in a reaction to Roswell."

With our very busy skies in the last century, it's perhaps unsurprising that Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have been renamed the less dramatic Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).

Believe in UFOs or not, 3.7 million people in the US alone claim to have been abducted by aliens

Otherworldly encounters and unexplained disappearances investigated on the documentary include the Bradshaw Ranch in Arizona, which was acquired by the US government and sealed off after years of UFO sightings.

And the mystery of Northwest Flight 2501, which disappeared over Lake Michigan in June 1950. UFO historian Dr Matthew Hayes says it "was never really found, which is unusual".

Three years later in the same region, the Kinross incident was caught on radar when a fighter jet went missing chasing a UFO over Lake Superior in November 1983. It looked on the radar as if it had been swallowed by its target.

No wreckage was found. "Where did the aircraft go? Did it somehow merge with the ball of light? Did it come out the other side like it went through a portal and now is in another dimension?" asks Andrew.

The documentary reveals there are three areas in the world which boast more UFO sightings than anywhere else – the Lake Michigan Triangle, Arizona Triangle, and bizarrely – the Falkirk Triangle - an area of special interest between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Falkirk, considered by many to be the UFO capital of the world.

Archaeologist Natasha Billson notes: "These are places where there are also many military air bases and airports."

Scotland's first official UFO sighting was in November 1979, when forestry worker Bob Taylor parked his pick-up truck off the M8 – and found himself being ripped at by UFOs with metal spikes and dragged towards a spacecraft.

"Bob had no history of mental illness, he's never been into UFOs before. There's nothing to be gained from making it up. So why did he tell this story?" asks neuroscientist Dr Mazyar Fallah.

A police investigation found deep tracks at the scene. Investigative historian Tony McMahon explains: "They concluded that Bob had indeed been the subject of a particularly vicious attack, but by what?"

In November 1992 a close encounter on the A70 in Scotland saw friends Garry Wood and Colin Wright allegedly abducted and electrocuted by 6ft-tall aliens with four fingers.

The pair gave their testimony under hypnosis and passed a polygraph test. But philosopher Dr Rohit Dalvi says: "The weakness in this test is if you really believe something, it's going to be seen as true when you take the test."

Declassified files 20 years later show the Ministry of Defence conducted an investigation, but failed to reach a conclusion.

Another explanation for increased alien activity in these triangles is that they are sites of trans-dimensional vortexes.

One of these mysterious portals is Rosslyn Chapel on a Scottish estate within the Falkirk Triangle.

"It was founded in 1446 by a nobleman who wanted it to be a place where priests could pray for his family souls," explains archeologist Natasha. "From the outside it looks like a small stone church, but inside it is extraordinary.

"Every inch of the walls and ceilings is covered in intricate stone carvings. Stars, flowers, vines, angels playing instruments, and grotesque gargoyles. The most famous carving is The Apprentice's Pillar, which is a twisted vine-like design which some think looks like a DNA helix."

The tiny chapel appeared in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, and theorists believe there are engravings of sweetcorn and aloe vera, which were carved long before Christopher Columbus went to the New World and brought those plants back - adding to theories that this is the work of people who had encountered aliens.

"One of the most striking things you see in the ceiling are these carved blocks in rows," explains Tony. "One theory is that they are musical notes. By deciphering them you can play a piece of music. This represents an understanding of acoustics that was way ahead of the time the chapel was built.

"For people to have known that, they would have had to be informed by somebody with future knowledge."

But Natasha, while in awe of the carvings, scotches the idea that the chapel is a passage to another universe. "We are looking through a modern lens at medieval iconography at what we think might be sweetcorn or aloe vera, but that doesn't mean it is."

She also points out that some of the work could result from 19th century Victorian restoration of the ceiling.

The documentary also delves into petroglyphs (rock carvings) of strikingly similar images drawn by civilisations who had never met - reinforcing the theory that we've been visited by extraterrestrials for a very long time.

If you believe it Andres says: "You have to ask why did UFOs come here?" He wonders if our TV and radio broadcasts have reached aliens in space, saying: "Could it be that an alien civilization is answering back?"

In August 1977, someone – or something – did respond when the Big Ear Radio Telescope at Ohio State University, which monitors the sky for signs of communication, detected a very strong signal from deep space.

An astronomer was so impressed by the result, he circled the reading of the signal's intensity, 6EQUJ5, on the computer print-out, and wrote the comment "Wow!" which gave the signal its name.

"The Wow! signal is the holy grail for astronomers," says forensic engineer Robert Sparling. "It would be acknowledgement that we're not alone here."

Since 2012 we have been beaming our own message back – but we are still awaiting a reply!

Some people believe nuclear bomb tests in the 1960s detonated high into outer space have alerted aliens, prompting increased activity.

Archaeologist Natasha thinks instead of looking to the sky, we should be looking to our past for answers about extra terrestrials and UFOs.

"We're amazing now, so why were our ancestors not?" she asks. "We are completely in a different technological world right now. We've gone quite far from a flint tool, yet we still use flints as tools. There's this connection, just as there's hand painting, we still paint our hands on the wall, so did our ancestors tens of thousands of years ago.

"Sometimes people think it has to be otherworldly rather than just us."

Another possibly more dispiriting theory is the zoo hypothesis, which historian Tony explains, saying: "That is that we are essentially an animal in a cage as far as passing UFOs are concerned. And they're not really bothered unless we do something interesting."

 But Andrew wonders: "Maybe they also just want to know that they're not alone in the universe."

Things on Earth are already pretty chaotic at the moment and an alien invasion is frankly the last thing we need.

But according to some scientists, a potentially hostile alien threat could soon arrive on Earth after a mysterious object in space was recently spotted heading our way.

There have been plenty of predictions about 2025 being the year that the general public finally sees evidence of aliens, although some will have you believe that they've been hidden away in Area 51 for far longer.

Researchers Avi Loeb, Adam Hibberd and Adam Crowl spotted an extraterrestrial entity high above Earth and suggest that it could be potentially catastrophic if it turns to be spyware, although any aliens spying on our planet right now and spotting who is in charge may well decide to turn around and go home.

The entity was named 3l/ATLAS and scientists reckon it will approach Jupiter, Venus and Mars before eventually disappearing behind the sun around October, which seems like good news but it may actually just be reporting back what it's already discovered about the human race.

Loeb said: "This could be intentional to avoid detailed observations from Earth-based telescopes when the object is brightest or when gadgets are sent to Earth from that hidden vantage point."

The entity is described in the researcher's paper as 'potentially hostile' and suggest that we may soon require 'defensive measures to be undertaken', if it does prove to have maleficent intentions.

Loeb added: "The retrograde orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS around the Sun lies within 5 degrees of that of Earth... The likelihood for that coincidence out of all random orientations is 0.2 percent.

Advert

"It might have targeted the inner Solar System as expected from alien technology."

NASA also seem pretty confident that the interstellar object shouldn't bother us anytime soon, suggesting: "Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away.

"The closest it will approach our planet is about 1.8 astronomical units (about 170 million miles, or 270 million kilometres). 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around Oct. 30, 2025, at a distance of about 1.4 au (130 million miles, or 210 million kilometers) — just inside the orbit of Mars."

The researchers and other scientists have conceded that it's far more likely to be a comet, with Loeb suggesting: “By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet.

“This paper is contingent on a remarkable but, as we shall show, testable hypothesis, to which the authors do not necessarily ascribe, yet is certainly worthy of an analysis and a report.

“The hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to pursue, irrespective of its likely validity.”

Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina, agrees, adding: “All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system, just as countless billions of comets have been ejected from our own solar system.”

So, we can just stick to worrying about what's going on with the impending threat of WW3 and societal collapse for now, with the aliens probably sensible to delay their arrival until AI has already taken over the planet.

Felicia Day‘s Charlie Bradbury appeared in only 11 episodes of Supernatural over a number of a years: seven in the show's world as a quirky lesbian hacker genius and four as her Apocalypse World alter ego, an accomplished demon hunter, who also liked girls. Nonetheless, the sci fi/fantasy/web content creator stalwart was popular enough that many fans asked that Day become a cast regular. It helped that Charlie was almost considered a Winchester family member, and a particular favorite of Dean's (Jensen Ackles) — in both universes.

Day was interviewed in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special celebrating the iconic sci-fi show, where she shared her thoughts about both her love of SPN conventions around the world and her role on the iconic show.

What draws you back to the many Supernatural conventions?

Felicia Day: I started my career as a potential slayer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I was introduced to conventions and fan families very early. And the minute I did my first convention, sometime after Buffy, I knew that this is where I wanted to be. It feels like when your content means more to someone than just like passively entertaining them, it gives an extra level of fulfillment to an artist.

At the SPN conventions, what do your fans generally say to you?

I think what's wonderful about my character Charlie it that inspired a lot of people to either go into tech, come out to their parents, and be more confident as sort of a weird woman. Those kind of roles don't come along all the time. Charlie's an out-sized character; in the genre universe, I don't see a lot of characters like her even today on TV and I think that kind of resonates.

I've read on some fans sites that they really accepted Charlie, particularly because she wasn't going to be romantically involved with either of the Winchesters, Sam (Jared Padalecki) or Dean, but more like family.

I hear it said a lot that she was an honorary Winchester. There was a line that Dean said: “Charlie is the little sister we never wanted.” And that's really the dynamic that people really loved about Charlie and what I loved about it — because we were like a family on screen and also off screen.

The fans, especially those that come to the conventions, seem to be part of that extended family. Are the SPN conventions like family reunions for the cast?

They are! I love when I walk into the Green Room and I see my friends and we're talking and chatting either in a panel or in front of the fans behind the scenes. We're all just really happy to be together. I've been on a lot of TV shows where that's not the case. And I think it really stems from the tone that the leads on the show set. Jared and Jensen have done a great, great job of treating everyone equally and having that family feel.

What are some of your favorite memories from these conventions?

I can't tell you how many times I've heard, especially younger girls say, that “I'm confident in being who I am because of you.” I have an 8-year-old daughter and I'm seeing her kind of grow up being a little weirder than other people, too. We don't have a lot of role models like Charlie out there. And so if that can impact somebody's real life, the choices they make, the people they love, the confidence that they have being themselves, it's a blessing.

How old will your daughter be when she's allowed to watch her mom on Supernatural? 

I've actually been surveying fans whenever I see a teenager with them! I ask, “Hey, when did they start watching?” I think I've settled on 12. My kid is a real aficionado for spooky things, so she'd probably like it earlier, but no, she's seeing it when she's 12. [Laughs]

I briefly interviewed a father and his 13-year-old daughter on the convention floor. This was her second year at the convention with her dad.

Amazing, so he is a fan?

Yes, he was a weekly viewer and now, he said, he really enjoys binging the show with his kid.

There's nothing better than seeing a parent and a kid come up to me at the cons. It tends to be daughters, so it's mothers and daughters and fathers and daughters. There's nothing better than seeing that because it means that we're transcending generations. They don't make shows like Supernatural or Buffy or those kind of genre shows that are 22 episodes anymore, where you just want to sit down in front of the TV and see a family go through some adventures. We don't have that now. Everything's spectacle. Everything's eight episodes every three years, and it just doesn't have the same feel.

Jack Rowand/The CW

If you were to write a letter to the fans, what would you say to them?

I'd say thanks for keeping the show alive in your hearts. It means the characters live on, so thanks for spreading the word. Because every year the fan base seems to grow, which is a real blessing for us as artists. I'd love to revisit my character one day, and they might make that possible because they still love the show.

What was your reaction when you learned Charlie would violently die? It was a final death, which wasn't that common on Supernatural. How much time were you given to process that?

They told me, when they closed the deal, “You're dying in this episode.” That's what happened. I write a lot of my own stuff because I've been killed off many a TV show. [Laughs] At least I can control what I write, so I'll never kill myself off. But yeah, it was really hard. Supernatural was at a time of my life that I really needed to be on that set to be accepted and feel like I was part of a family. And you get attached and you want to be there more, and then you're told that you can't be there. But I know that I'm not a regular and I'm there to serve the bigger story they need. So, personally, it sucked, but professionally, I understood and I was there for it 100%.

But after that sad death in which you died bleeding out in a bathtub, you were called back!

That's the blessing of being in a genre show. I never want to be on just like a 9-1-1, because if I die, I can't come back. They brought me back from the Apocalypse World and I got to do some really interesting stuff. And yeah, Charlie lives on in many different ways, and that is such a compliment.

What's your all-time favorite episode?

Wow. Well, the Groundhog Day-like episode “Mystery Spot,” where Jensen dies in different ways during the same day, is one of my favorites as a viewer, but my favorite is the LARPing episode [“LARP and the Real Girl”] where Charlie got to fall in love and kiss a fairy. [Laughs] The set, the vibe, the costumes were just so fun. I tried to get the costume I wore from wardrobe, but they lost it. But when they were wrapping the show, they called and they were like, “Do you want any wardrobe? “And I said, “Great, I would love the LARPing outfit.” They couldn't find it, but I did get the original Charlie lion cat shirt and the Princess Leia shirt. So I do have some of the original wardrobe. I also was given, by producer Jim Michaels, the oil painting that was in the LARPing episode. So I have an oil painting of myself dressed as a queen that I'm not hanging in my house, but I do have it, which is kind of a fun memento.

Where is it?

In my storage unit. I used to have a huge storage unit full of fan art of myself. I decided that I needed to downsize and not pay that much money to for a box with things with my face on it anymore.

You said that you'd like to come back on some kind of Supernatural project, if that were to happen. If so and Charlie was in it, what would you like her to be doing?

I would be thrilled to be in it. I think she'd probably be teaching at like a community college and being a mentor. It would be one of those jobs where she could take the summers off and travel and also on the side maybe do a little anarchist hacking. Yeah, it would be really fun to revisit Charlie as a character, either the Apocalypse version of her or the OG version. There's a lot of story there that I would love to revisit.

Do you have a favorite on set memory?

There are so many wonderful moments. I can't tell you again how wonderful Jared and Jensen are in that everybody was equal on the set and you've been on a bunch of TV sets, so you know that everyone doesn't get treated equally a lot of the time. There's usually a hierarchy, you know, this person shouldn't talk to this person or this person has this job, so they're not as important as this other job. That wasn't the case on Supernatural. Everybody was doing a job together. That's how it should be because everybody contributes equally. Jared and Jensen just kept their feet on the ground and treated everyone like real people. I really admire that, and it really set the bar for me for everything I experience on sets now.

Would you describe what Supernatural has done for you, professionally and/or personally?

Charlie is important to me because she's important to the fans and we don't always get that with every role that we have. But the gift of that is pretty special and it makes it easy to be a little more picky in what I choose to do. I consider, “Is the role going to take you away from the things that you love to do in your life? Is it going to be something that you want to live and will mean something to those who see the show?” I'm lucky, I've had a lot of roles and most were written for me.

Was Charlie written for you?

Charlie was written for a “Felicia Day type.” Then, the showrunner, Sera Gamble, thank God, said, “Let's try to get her!” But it's because of the work I'd done on the web and writing my own shows that showrunners like on Eureka and Supernatural wrote me parts.

Supernatural is obviously a cult show and you can expound on that a little, but one could say that you are also a cult figure in your own way, no?

Yeah. I'll take that. I've been on a lot of cult shows. I've been in Buffy, Eureka, the web musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [also Adventure Time and Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return]. I also created my own [award-winning] web show, The Guild. So yes, I guess I'm one of those people. I just love creating things. I don't want to not make things just because somebody told me I can't make it. And again, it's my work outside the system, just like representing who I am and trying to say it's okay to be like this, that influenced people on Eureka, Supernatural, Buffy, and Dr. Horrible to an extent. All of those roles were created by creative people who liked what I did. I don't get things through auditions very often. It's just like other writers liking me,

Are you hoping you get a call for the Buffy sequel spinoff?

I can only cross my fingers. That would be a dream role because it's so interesting that they're doing this and passing Buffy on to new generations, some of whom already carry a torch for the original show. My dream is to be on a Star Trek or the new Buffy. But if I had to pick one show, it would be to bring Charlie back on Supernatural, because honestly, she's just a really special character.

	The Hulu comedy “Mid-Century Modern” star Nathan Lee Graham has landed the lead role in Margin Films' upcoming supernatural thriller “Destiny Jackson.”


	Graham is set to portray Isaac Washington, a detective character who joins forces with a couple whose 11-year-old child experiences terrifying dreams, convinced he's the reincarnated victim of a murderer.


	The project stems from the creative partnership of Dennis Escobedo and Quentin Lee, who share writing and producing duties, with Lee also taking on directing responsibilities. The pair's previous joint effort was the independently produced “Last Summer of Nathan Lee,” currently streaming on various platforms.

	“I have always wanted to play a detective with their many layers of emotions. Just think of Sam Spade, Sherlock Holmes, Jessica Fletcher, Columbo, and Shaft. Not to mention my love for all things Agatha Christie. Can you sense my excitement?” Graham said.




			Popular on Variety		







	Lee added: “Dennis and I are thrilled to be working with Nathan Lee Graham, as we believe he will bring an authentic, yet comically edgy dimension to the role of our detective protagonist.”


	While advancing “Destiny Jackson” through development, Lee secured recognition with a 2024 Canadian Screen Award for Best Comedy Special for “Comedy Invasion.” His upcoming slate includes helming “The Way You Dance” in British Columbia this autumn, featuring Tzi Ma and Kyle Toy.


	A decorated performer with Grammy and Obie honors, Graham brings three decades of entertainment industry experience to the role. His screen appearances span major studio comedies like both “Zoolander” films, “Sweet Home Alabama” and “Hitch,” plus the 2023 ensemble piece “Theater Camp.” Television audiences know him from series including “The Comeback,” “Scrubs,” “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” “Broad City” and Fox's short-lived “LA to Vegas.”

	











	Graham's theatrical resume includes creating roles in the Tony-nominated Broadway musicals “The Wild Party” and “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.” Recent stage recognition includes a 2024 Obie Award for embodying Queen Elizabeth I in Signature Theatre's “Orlando.” His “Mid-Century Modern” performance as Jerry earned him the Critics' Choice Association's 2025 Vanguard Award, recognizing both his acting and advocacy for LGBTQ+ representation.


	Writer Escobedo's portfolio encompasses feature scripts including “Bookworm,” “A Little Love,” “Advice For Teenage Outcasts” and “Last Summer of Nathan Lee.” His theatrical works “The Poet of Columbus Avenue” and “Charlotte Second Chance” have reached stages in New York, Los Angeles and beyond, with the former receiving development at The Smithsonian Institute. His formal training includes UCLA's Master Screenwriting Program.

Leon Davidson lived in White Plains, New York, and had the kind of résumé that made him hard to ignore. A scientist, engineer, and sci-fi writer, Davidson worked with IBM, Union Carbide, and even contributed to atomic research during one of the most secretive chapters in American history.

But behind the credentials and career highlights was a man obsessed with one question — and it had nothing to do with corporate tech or energy.

Why was the U.S. Government so desperate to convince the public their UFO story was final and truthful, when all he was doing was asking fair questions? And what did they know that they weren't saying? Davidson didn't just wonder — he went looking. What he found, and how the government responded, is the kind of story that doesn't fade with time. It lingers in the shadows of declassified documents and unanswered questions.

This is what they do. What they've always done. The U.S. government has historically gone to extraordinary — sometimes disturbing — lengths to control the UFO narrative. They've discredited witnesses, buried evidence, and intimidated researchers. They denied the existence of Area 51 for decades. They claimed Project Mogul was responsible for Roswell. They told military pilots to stay silent after mid-air encounters. Now, with the term "UAP" replacing "UFO" and official task forces formed under pressure, the story is evolving — but the pattern remains. Silence the voice. Control the narrative. And hope the public forgets. But people like Leon Davidson don't just vanish. They leave a trail. You just have to follow it.

For decades, the world has looked to the Nevada desert and wondered: Are we alone? The answer, at least as far as Area 51 is concerned, is likely yes — but the truth that replaces that fantasy is no less fascinating.

For decades, the barren expanse of Nevada's high desert has been home to one of America's most enduring mysteries: Area 51. To some, it's a military base cloaked in Cold War secrecy. To others, it's where the U.S. government hides evidence of extraterrestrial contact. But according to new revelations, the truth isn't just stranger than fiction—it was built on fiction.

It turns out the alien legends that swirl around Area 51 weren't just tolerated by the U.S. government—they were deliberately planted to obscure something very human, very real, and very classified.

In the 1980s, amid Cold War paranoia and the race for military dominance, the U.S. Department of Defense executed a bold psychological maneuver: it fed alien conspiracy theories to hide its most sensitive aircraft programs.

As detailed in a recent Wall Street Journal report, an Air Force colonel was ordered to infiltrate a bar near Area 51, where he casually handed the owner doctored photos of “flying saucers.” The intention wasn't entertainment—it was misdirection.

Soviet surveillance was intense, and officials feared that real leaks about stealth technology could compromise the U.S.'s edge. So they did the unthinkable: they let the public believe in aliens.

Years later, the colonel admitted to Pentagon investigators that the stunt was part of a broader effort to divert attention from the then-secret F-117 Nighthawk, America's first operational stealth fighter.

The thinking was simple: it was better to have the public chase flying saucers than to have the Soviets track jet designs.

Established in 1955 and hidden within the Nevada Test and Training Range, Area 51 was originally created to support the development of the Lockheed U-2 spy plane.

Over the decades, it has become the birthplace of revolutionary aircraft, including the SR-71 Blackbird, the A-12 Archangel, and the radar-evading F-117 Nighthawk.

Yet to the outside world, it became something else entirely.

The name “Area 51” originates from its map designation by the Atomic Energy Commission, although for a time it was known by the oddly inviting nickname “Paradise Ranch”—a marketing ploy by Lockheed to attract engineers and technicians to one of the most remote job sites on Earth.

Over the years, it became a proving ground for revolutionary aircraft, from the high-flying SR-71 Blackbird and A-12 Archangel to the radar-evading F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter.

But despite its prosaic beginnings, the base evolved into a cultural touchstone of secrecy and speculation.

For decades, the government refused to acknowledge the base at all. It wasn't until 2013 that the CIA officially confirmed the existence of Area 51, releasing documents related to the U-2 program in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by the National Security Archive. Even with this rare glimpse behind the curtain, much about the site remains classified.

But even that small window into the truth only deepened the allure. What else might still be hidden?

In 2022, the Pentagon established the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), a new unit tasked with clarifying the complexities of Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs).

The office had two main responsibilities: to assess the surge in UAP sightings—most of which were later identified as balloons, birds, or satellites—and to probe whether the U.S. government had ever secretly recovered alien technology.

To the disappointment of unidentified flying object (UFO) believers, AARO's findings were far more terrestrial.

Instead of uncovering hidden alien artifacts, they found evidence that the Pentagon had occasionally amplified UFO myths to obscure black-budget defense projects.

Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, AARO's inaugural director, reviewed decades of military files and discovered multiple instances where UFO myths had been deliberately seeded from within.

One example involved a bizarre internal hoax known as Project Yankee Blue, in which new Air Force recruits were told of a top-secret unit that studied alien aircraft.

The kicker? The unit didn't exist. The recruits were ordered to stay silent—many never realizing it was all a ruse. The practice persisted until the Pentagon formally shut it down in 2023.

Kirkpatrick's review also revisited a famous 1967 incident at a Montana nuclear base. Former Air Force captain Robert Salas claimed a UFO hovered over the site and disabled ten nuclear missiles. He said he was later ordered to keep quiet about what he saw.

But according to AARO's findings, the real cause may have been a failed electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test conducted to evaluate the base's vulnerability to nuclear disruption—an exercise Salas and others were never informed about.

Ironically, the disinformation campaign designed to protect U.S. military secrets ultimately sparked a cultural phenomenon too big to control. What was meant as a clever Cold War strategy evolved into a sprawling mythology of aliens, abductions, and government cover-ups.

Area 51 was designed to be impenetrable—both physically and, as it turns out, psychologically.

Shielded by layers of secrecy, the base is surrounded by a no-fly zone, off-limits access roads, cutting-edge surveillance, and a ready military security force that patrols the perimeter.

But the elaborate effort to cloak the base in mystery by feeding alien rumors may have worked too well. Instead of merely deflecting attention from classified military projects, the myth evolved into something far larger and more difficult to contain. The whispers of flying saucers and little green men took on a life of their own—embedding themselves in pop culture, conspiracy circles, and even political discourse.

By 2019, the fantasy had reached a surreal new height. A viral internet joke—”Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us”—spread like wildfire. Millions RSVP'd to the tongue-in-cheek event online, claiming they'd rush the gates and uncover the truth once and for all. However, what started as satire took a sharp turn when people actually began to show up. The Air Force issued warnings. Authorities tightened security. At least one person was arrested for trespassing.

The government had succeeded in obscuring its stealth programs behind a veil of science fiction. But in doing so, it gave birth to a legend that still fuels headlines, memes, and late-night conversations to this day.

So, are there aliens at Area 51? Probably not. But that doesn't mean what goes on there is any less fascinating.

What's known is that Area 51 has been critical to the development of some of the most advanced aerospace technology in U.S. history. What remains unknown is what still happens there—because even now, much of the base's activity is strictly classified.

And perhaps that's the most enduring part of the Area 51 story. The public's imagination filled in the blanks left by official silence. And in that space between fact and fiction, a modern myth was born—one carefully seeded by the very government that now claims to debunk it.

In the end, the aliens may have been a decoy. But the mystery? That was always real.

"Falling Angels," by John H. Thomas. (John Thomas/TNS)

In "Falling Angels," the third book in the Maxx King Thriller series, John H. Thomas pushes his high-octane storytelling to its most ambitious scale yet. The action opens in the chaos of Operation Anaconda, where elite operative Maxx King is betrayed, wounded and left for dead in the mountains of Afghanistan. As Maxx regroups with a Green Beret unit, he learns that the betrayal may be tied to something far more sinister than battlefield politics — a secret biological weapon called Thunderbird. Little does he know, but it's just the tip of a conspiracy iceberg involving clandestine extraterrestrial technology, rogue scientists, compromised politicians and shadowy global networks.

Meanwhile, Maxx's emotional journey — from protector of his loved ones to reluctant savior of humanity — grounds the story in compelling personal stakes.

The 25th year is a milestone for any event, and this Fair is the largest and longest running event of its type on the Oregon Coast, according to organizers.

Over 30 booths, in three areas of the church and outside, feature exhibitors showcasing rocks and minerals, jewelry, health & wellness products and services, psychics and mediums offering different kinds of readings, handmade crafts, authors with their books and much more.

Twelve seminars during the two-day event will enlighten and educate on a wide variety of topics. The popular Free Book Table offers books on health and wellness, gardening, spirituality and other topics, please feel free to take as many as you like. The Free Info Table has news you can use to enlighten yourself.

The Spirit Cafe in the Fellowship Hall is being run by Chubby Lil' Mermaid of Seal Rock who will be offering up their delightful goodies including soups and bagel sandwiches along with pastries, cookies, coffee and other beverages for sale.

This is a family friendly, handicap accessible event with free parking. The $5 Weekend Pass donation includes all the seminars.
