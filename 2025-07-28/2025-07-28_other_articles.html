                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>'Supernatural' Star Jensen Ackles Makes Bold Comment About His Character, Dean Winchester originally appeared on Parade. While speaking to Collider for a June 25 interview, Ackles, who starred as the demon hunter Dean, discussed filming the series for 15 seasons. Ackles spoke about his acting choices for Dean, who famously has difficulty expressing emotions. “I think his vulnerability was something that was heavily guarded in a lot of the first seasons," said the 47-year-old actor. "As the show went on, you got to kind of peel back a little bit of that vulnerability, and see that there's a young kid there who never had a childhood, who missed his father, who missed his mother, who fights for his brother. Ackles also shared he has a preference for playing complex characters, like Dean, on television shows, as opposed to movies. That's one of the reasons why I love doing television so much as opposed to features… You don't just have an hour and a half or two hours to do so. Ackles shared that his equally complex character, Detective Mark Meachum, on the new Prime series, Countdown, is somewhat similar to Dean. He explained while Mark has real-world issues, as opposed to Dean's constant fights with supernatural creatures, both characters face their problems with guns blazing. "There's some familiar aspects to those two characters. This story was originally reported by Parade on Jun 29, 2025, where it first appeared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trisha Paytas probably feels like a passenger on Ozzy Osbourne's “Crazy Train” as the internet continues to push conspiracies that her newborn baby, Aquaman, is the musician reincarnated. Suddenly, there was a collective sense of déjà vu. As her comment section filled with people joking “Welcome back, Ozzy,” it called to mind the fervor around her daughter Malibu, who was born the same day that Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022. “I was so out of my trolling era, and I was in such a good space spiritually,” Paytas told Rolling Stone in 2024. “The fact that my pregnancy got ruined by trolling — now, I guess, it's kind of funny and karmatic. In a follow-up TikTok, Paytas added: “I know reincarnation theories about my babies are just a meme, it's just what the internet does, but I'm not gonna lie — being 12 days postpartum sometimes make you feel a little cookoo. I'm like, wait, why does the internet keep wanting to put souls into my baby? Second of all, you guys, I don't know much about reincarnation, I just know that the soul has to be passed along.” GOP Sen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ideas that were once fringe are increasingly part of Australian public life. Ariel Bogle and Cam Wilson say they may not be about a singular event, but an overarching interpretation of how the world works She holds one side of a large banner that reads ‘GROOM DOGS NOT KIDS', showing pictures of poodles with ears dyed rainbow and pink. There are t-shirts imploring you to ‘think while it's still legal'. Another person holds a sign declaring their staunch opposition to a town planning initiative that's been erroneously linked to the rollout of a new surveillance regime, ‘Aussies SAY NO to 15 minute cities. It is May 2023 and almost everyone has a smartphone in hand. The sorry state of the world has an explanation both attractively simple and entirely complex: there are powerful and nefarious forces working secretly against us. Did Australian prime minister Harold Holt drown at sea or was he kidnapped and taken away in a Chinese or Soviet submarine? Are Masonic symbols hidden among landmarks in Canberra? Is the government hiding UFOs at Pine Gap? These aren't just questions that interest people at events like the Worldwide Rally. We're all primed to dabble in these kinds of stories, the clues and coincidences that add up to something altogether fascinating. They can simply be a fun group activity on the internet. For most people they won't become an all-consuming worldview or a call to action – for others, they do. There isn't a great deal of available research about who believes in conspiracy theories in Australia and why – it's a difficult concept to measure. Based on our reporting, believers defy a neat categorisation of interest or class, even as members of these groups fear “elites” who are conspiring against them, or categories of “outsiders” taking what they deserve. It's hard to say whether one country's population is more conspiratorial than another but there are conditions that often correlate with conspiracy belief, including perceptions of inequality and corruption. Some research suggests Australians aren't more conspiracy theory-prone compared with other countries. “Our results suggest that basic human motives may give rise to extraordinary beliefs for many ordinary people.” Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads In the United States, it's been argued that conspiracy theories about the “deep state” – claims that there is a “shadow government” in control no matter who is voted in – partly emerged from “excessive state secrecy and official deception”. Australia's institutions, too, are notoriously secretive and insular. The revolving door between politics and lobbying is well known. Anyone with even the most passing familiarity with our history knows how cruel the state can be, how it was built on violence and displacement, and how it can organise itself against the interests of the people it claims to protect. But when this suspicion tips into an unyielding dedication to stories that can rationally be disproven, when grievance is nursed and monetised, when fear becomes an end in itself, common ground rapidly disappears, and any evidence that does not align with these beliefs, no matter how compelling, is rejected. Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues. Sign up to receive it in your inbox every Saturday morning Whatever their prevalence or how deeply these beliefs are held, there's something disturbing at work here. Terms such as “QAnon” and “sovereign citizens” have gone from internet jargon to common parlance. They are monetised and made into elaborate cover for racism. In some cases, we see them take up weapons. Certainly, there are those whose experiences of living in Australia – a nation with a documented history of profound brutality to First Nations people, immigrants and other vulnerable groups – have created justifiable suspicion of those in power. Many of those we've spoken to have turned to these ideas after moments of profound disruption and tragedy, after they've fallen through the cracks. For others, it goes beyond scepticism into fantasy that does not lead anywhere useful. ‘How long before they put an AK-47 on it?' A grey-haired man materialises and tells the crowd to put aside their differences. It seems increasingly as though conspiracy theories are not about a singular event but an overarching interpretation of how the world works. They can create a sense of identity and group membership. At the Worldwide Rally for Freedom in 2023, like so many of the events we attended, no one seemed as if they were a single-issue protester – it was vaccines and child-predator cabals and a one-world government that would take all our freedoms one by one. Despite the appearance of standing up in the face of power, conspiratorial tropes are also useful to those with political, economic and social status because they are typically about something happening to “us” because of an elusive “them” – “a virtuous group under threat from a nefarious enemy”. You can take on the position of victim without losing much of anything, and direct the vitriol in another direction. We're living in an era where conspiratorial ideas have leached into public life thanks to politicians and the media. They help make them mainstream for political purposes, from fake claims about climate science, to raising doubts about the safety of vaccines. Rather than reflecting a diffuse style of political paranoia, as historian Richard Hofstadter famously wrote about the United States in 1964, contemporary conspiracy theories in Australia are often used by those with power as a political weapon against vulnerable groups – a cynical inversion of the power structure they supposedly reveal.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mass sightings of mysterious drones lighting up the New Jersey skies in November 2024 triggered an online frenzy and had every conspiracy theorist leaving their bunker to claim we were being invaded by flying saucers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received more than 5,000 drone tip-offs from worried citizens, describing them as objects "the size of cars" and sometimes flying low in formation. But the official statement is to minimise that eye-witness experience... which makes it look like they're covering it up," reports investigative historian Andrew Gough, who along with the documentary's team of UFO experts, historians and archeologists, helps connect the dots between the increasing numbers of detailed encounters recorded and what we think we know about alien life. "There's much more to life than we understand. Somewhere out there is other life," he says. World UFO Day commemorates the first and most important widely reported UFO sightings in June 1947, when pilot Kenneth Arnold claimed he saw nine shiny crescent-shaped flying objects travelling at high speed near Mount Rainier, Washington. A few weeks later, the Roswell incident occurred. Those who believe say an extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed in the New Mexico desert and alien bodies or "debris" were recovered by the US Government. "Two weeks later the US Department of Defense is created and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is created. These things are created in a reaction to Roswell." With our very busy skies in the last century, it's perhaps unsurprising that Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) have been renamed the less dramatic Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs). And the mystery of Northwest Flight 2501, which disappeared over Lake Michigan in June 1950. UFO historian Dr Matthew Hayes says it "was never really found, which is unusual". Three years later in the same region, the Kinross incident was caught on radar when a fighter jet went missing chasing a UFO over Lake Superior in November 1983. Did it somehow merge with the ball of light? Scotland's first official UFO sighting was in November 1979, when forestry worker Bob Taylor parked his pick-up truck off the M8 – and found himself being ripped at by UFOs with metal spikes and dragged towards a spacecraft. "Bob had no history of mental illness, he's never been into UFOs before. There's nothing to be gained from making it up. A police investigation found deep tracks at the scene. Investigative historian Tony McMahon explains: "They concluded that Bob had indeed been the subject of a particularly vicious attack, but by what?" In November 1992 a close encounter on the A70 in Scotland saw friends Garry Wood and Colin Wright allegedly abducted and electrocuted by 6ft-tall aliens with four fingers. The pair gave their testimony under hypnosis and passed a polygraph test. But philosopher Dr Rohit Dalvi says: "The weakness in this test is if you really believe something, it's going to be seen as true when you take the test." Declassified files 20 years later show the Ministry of Defence conducted an investigation, but failed to reach a conclusion. Another explanation for increased alien activity in these triangles is that they are sites of trans-dimensional vortexes. One of these mysterious portals is Rosslyn Chapel on a Scottish estate within the Falkirk Triangle. "It was founded in 1446 by a nobleman who wanted it to be a place where priests could pray for his family souls," explains archeologist Natasha. "Every inch of the walls and ceilings is covered in intricate stone carvings. Stars, flowers, vines, angels playing instruments, and grotesque gargoyles. The most famous carving is The Apprentice's Pillar, which is a twisted vine-like design which some think looks like a DNA helix." The tiny chapel appeared in Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code, and theorists believe there are engravings of sweetcorn and aloe vera, which were carved long before Christopher Columbus went to the New World and brought those plants back - adding to theories that this is the work of people who had encountered aliens. "One of the most striking things you see in the ceiling are these carved blocks in rows," explains Tony. "One theory is that they are musical notes. By deciphering them you can play a piece of music. "We are looking through a modern lens at medieval iconography at what we think might be sweetcorn or aloe vera, but that doesn't mean it is." The documentary also delves into petroglyphs (rock carvings) of strikingly similar images drawn by civilisations who had never met - reinforcing the theory that we've been visited by extraterrestrials for a very long time. He wonders if our TV and radio broadcasts have reached aliens in space, saying: "Could it be that an alien civilization is answering back?" In August 1977, someone – or something – did respond when the Big Ear Radio Telescope at Ohio State University, which monitors the sky for signs of communication, detected a very strong signal from deep space. signal is the holy grail for astronomers," says forensic engineer Robert Sparling. "It would be acknowledgement that we're not alone here." Some people believe nuclear bomb tests in the 1960s detonated high into outer space have alerted aliens, prompting increased activity. Archaeologist Natasha thinks instead of looking to the sky, we should be looking to our past for answers about extra terrestrials and UFOs. "We're amazing now, so why were our ancestors not?" "We are completely in a different technological world right now. There's this connection, just as there's hand painting, we still paint our hands on the wall, so did our ancestors tens of thousands of years ago. "Sometimes people think it has to be otherworldly rather than just us." Another possibly more dispiriting theory is the zoo hypothesis, which historian Tony explains, saying: "That is that we are essentially an animal in a cage as far as passing UFOs are concerned. And they're not really bothered unless we do something interesting."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But according to some scientists, a potentially hostile alien threat could soon arrive on Earth after a mysterious object in space was recently spotted heading our way. There have been plenty of predictions about 2025 being the year that the general public finally sees evidence of aliens, although some will have you believe that they've been hidden away in Area 51 for far longer. The entity was named 3l/ATLAS and scientists reckon it will approach Jupiter, Venus and Mars before eventually disappearing behind the sun around October, which seems like good news but it may actually just be reporting back what it's already discovered about the human race. Loeb said: "This could be intentional to avoid detailed observations from Earth-based telescopes when the object is brightest or when gadgets are sent to Earth from that hidden vantage point." The entity is described in the researcher's paper as 'potentially hostile' and suggest that we may soon require 'defensive measures to be undertaken', if it does prove to have maleficent intentions. The likelihood for that coincidence out of all random orientations is 0.2 percent. "It might have targeted the inner Solar System as expected from alien technology." NASA also seem pretty confident that the interstellar object shouldn't bother us anytime soon, suggesting: "Comet 3I/ATLAS poses no threat to Earth and will remain far away. 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest point to the Sun around Oct. 30, 2025, at a distance of about 1.4 au (130 million miles, or 210 million kilometers) — just inside the orbit of Mars." The researchers and other scientists have conceded that it's far more likely to be a comet, with Loeb suggesting: “By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet. “This paper is contingent on a remarkable but, as we shall show, testable hypothesis, to which the authors do not necessarily ascribe, yet is certainly worthy of an analysis and a report. Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina, agrees, adding: “All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system, just as countless billions of comets have been ejected from our own solar system.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Felicia Day‘s Charlie Bradbury appeared in only 11 episodes of Supernatural over a number of a years: seven in the show's world as a quirky lesbian hacker genius and four as her Apocalypse World alter ego, an accomplished demon hunter, who also liked girls. Nonetheless, the sci fi/fantasy/web content creator stalwart was popular enough that many fans asked that Day become a cast regular. It helped that Charlie was almost considered a Winchester family member, and a particular favorite of Dean's (Jensen Ackles) — in both universes. Day was interviewed in May at a Creation Entertainment convention in New Jersey for TV Guide Magazine's Supernatural Afterlife: 20th Anniversary Special celebrating the iconic sci-fi show, where she shared her thoughts about both her love of SPN conventions around the world and her role on the iconic show. What draws you back to the many Supernatural conventions? Felicia Day: I started my career as a potential slayer on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, so I was introduced to conventions and fan families very early. It feels like when your content means more to someone than just like passively entertaining them, it gives an extra level of fulfillment to an artist. At the SPN conventions, what do your fans generally say to you? I think what's wonderful about my character Charlie it that inspired a lot of people to either go into tech, come out to their parents, and be more confident as sort of a weird woman. Those kind of roles don't come along all the time. Charlie's an out-sized character; in the genre universe, I don't see a lot of characters like her even today on TV and I think that kind of resonates. I've read on some fans sites that they really accepted Charlie, particularly because she wasn't going to be romantically involved with either of the Winchesters, Sam (Jared Padalecki) or Dean, but more like family. I hear it said a lot that she was an honorary Winchester. There was a line that Dean said: “Charlie is the little sister we never wanted.” And that's really the dynamic that people really loved about Charlie and what I loved about it — because we were like a family on screen and also off screen. The fans, especially those that come to the conventions, seem to be part of that extended family. I love when I walk into the Green Room and I see my friends and we're talking and chatting either in a panel or in front of the fans behind the scenes. We're all just really happy to be together. I've been on a lot of TV shows where that's not the case. Jared and Jensen have done a great, great job of treating everyone equally and having that family feel. What are some of your favorite memories from these conventions? We don't have a lot of role models like Charlie out there. And so if that can impact somebody's real life, the choices they make, the people they love, the confidence that they have being themselves, it's a blessing. How old will your daughter be when she's allowed to watch her mom on Supernatural? I briefly interviewed a father and his 13-year-old daughter on the convention floor. There's nothing better than seeing a parent and a kid come up to me at the cons. They don't make shows like Supernatural or Buffy or those kind of genre shows that are 22 episodes anymore, where you just want to sit down in front of the TV and see a family go through some adventures. Everything's eight episodes every three years, and it just doesn't have the same feel. I'd say thanks for keeping the show alive in your hearts. Because every year the fan base seems to grow, which is a real blessing for us as artists. I'd love to revisit my character one day, and they might make that possible because they still love the show. What was your reaction when you learned Charlie would violently die? How much time were you given to process that? I write a lot of my own stuff because I've been killed off many a TV show. Supernatural was at a time of my life that I really needed to be on that set to be accepted and feel like I was part of a family. But after that sad death in which you died bleeding out in a bathtub, you were called back! That's the blessing of being in a genre show. They brought me back from the Apocalypse World and I got to do some really interesting stuff. And yeah, Charlie lives on in many different ways, and that is such a compliment. Well, the Groundhog Day-like episode “Mystery Spot,” where Jensen dies in different ways during the same day, is one of my favorites as a viewer, but my favorite is the LARPing episode [“LARP and the Real Girl”] where Charlie got to fall in love and kiss a fairy. “And I said, “Great, I would love the LARPing outfit.” They couldn't find it, but I did get the original Charlie lion cat shirt and the Princess Leia shirt. So I do have some of the original wardrobe. I also was given, by producer Jim Michaels, the oil painting that was in the LARPing episode. So I have an oil painting of myself dressed as a queen that I'm not hanging in my house, but I do have it, which is kind of a fun memento. I decided that I needed to downsize and not pay that much money to for a box with things with my face on it anymore. You said that you'd like to come back on some kind of Supernatural project, if that were to happen. If so and Charlie was in it, what would you like her to be doing? It would be one of those jobs where she could take the summers off and travel and also on the side maybe do a little anarchist hacking. Yeah, it would be really fun to revisit Charlie as a character, either the Apocalypse version of her or the OG version. Do you have a favorite on set memory? I can't tell you again how wonderful Jared and Jensen are in that everybody was equal on the set and you've been on a bunch of TV sets, so you know that everyone doesn't get treated equally a lot of the time. That wasn't the case on Supernatural. That's how it should be because everybody contributes equally. Jared and Jensen just kept their feet on the ground and treated everyone like real people. I really admire that, and it really set the bar for me for everything I experience on sets now. Charlie is important to me because she's important to the fans and we don't always get that with every role that we have. But the gift of that is pretty special and it makes it easy to be a little more picky in what I choose to do. I consider, “Is the role going to take you away from the things that you love to do in your life? Is it going to be something that you want to live and will mean something to those who see the show?” I'm lucky, I've had a lot of roles and most were written for me. Charlie was written for a “Felicia Day type.” Then, the showrunner, Sera Gamble, thank God, said, “Let's try to get her!” But it's because of the work I'd done on the web and writing my own shows that showrunners like on Eureka and Supernatural wrote me parts. Supernatural is obviously a cult show and you can expound on that a little, but one could say that you are also a cult figure in your own way, no? I've been on a lot of cult shows. I've been in Buffy, Eureka, the web musical Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog [also Adventure Time and Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return]. I also created my own [award-winning] web show, The Guild. I don't want to not make things just because somebody told me I can't make it. And again, it's my work outside the system, just like representing who I am and trying to say it's okay to be like this, that influenced people on Eureka, Supernatural, Buffy, and Dr. Horrible to an extent. All of those roles were created by creative people who liked what I did. I don't get things through auditions very often. It's just like other writers liking me, That would be a dream role because it's so interesting that they're doing this and passing Buffy on to new generations, some of whom already carry a torch for the original show. My dream is to be on a Star Trek or the new Buffy. But if I had to pick one show, it would be to bring Charlie back on Supernatural, because honestly, she's just a really special character.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leon Davidson lived in White Plains, New York, and had the kind of résumé that made him hard to ignore. A scientist, engineer, and sci-fi writer, Davidson worked with IBM, Union Carbide, and even contributed to atomic research during one of the most secretive chapters in American history. But behind the credentials and career highlights was a man obsessed with one question — and it had nothing to do with corporate tech or energy. Davidson didn't just wonder — he went looking. What he found, and how the government responded, is the kind of story that doesn't fade with time. It lingers in the shadows of declassified documents and unanswered questions. The U.S. government has historically gone to extraordinary — sometimes disturbing — lengths to control the UFO narrative. They've discredited witnesses, buried evidence, and intimidated researchers. They denied the existence of Area 51 for decades. They claimed Project Mogul was responsible for Roswell. They told military pilots to stay silent after mid-air encounters. But people like Leon Davidson don't just vanish. You just have to follow it. Check out Leon Davidson's: An Analysis of Air Force Project Blue Book Special Report #14 available on Amazon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, the world has looked to the Nevada desert and wondered: Are we alone? The answer, at least as far as Area 51 is concerned, is likely yes — but the truth that replaces that fantasy is no less fascinating. For decades, the barren expanse of Nevada's high desert has been home to one of America's most enduring mysteries: Area 51. To some, it's a military base cloaked in Cold War secrecy. To others, it's where the U.S. government hides evidence of extraterrestrial contact. But according to new revelations, the truth isn't just stranger than fiction—it was built on fiction. It turns out the alien legends that swirl around Area 51 weren't just tolerated by the U.S. government—they were deliberately planted to obscure something very human, very real, and very classified. In the 1980s, amid Cold War paranoia and the race for military dominance, the U.S. Department of Defense executed a bold psychological maneuver: it fed alien conspiracy theories to hide its most sensitive aircraft programs. As detailed in a recent Wall Street Journal report, an Air Force colonel was ordered to infiltrate a bar near Area 51, where he casually handed the owner doctored photos of “flying saucers.” The intention wasn't entertainment—it was misdirection. Soviet surveillance was intense, and officials feared that real leaks about stealth technology could compromise the U.S.'s edge. Years later, the colonel admitted to Pentagon investigators that the stunt was part of a broader effort to divert attention from the then-secret F-117 Nighthawk, America's first operational stealth fighter. Yet to the outside world, it became something else entirely. The name “Area 51” originates from its map designation by the Atomic Energy Commission, although for a time it was known by the oddly inviting nickname “Paradise Ranch”—a marketing ploy by Lockheed to attract engineers and technicians to one of the most remote job sites on Earth. But despite its prosaic beginnings, the base evolved into a cultural touchstone of secrecy and speculation. The office had two main responsibilities: to assess the surge in UAP sightings—most of which were later identified as balloons, birds, or satellites—and to probe whether the U.S. government had ever secretly recovered alien technology. To the disappointment of unidentified flying object (UFO) believers, AARO's findings were far more terrestrial. Instead of uncovering hidden alien artifacts, they found evidence that the Pentagon had occasionally amplified UFO myths to obscure black-budget defense projects. Dr. Sean Kirkpatrick, AARO's inaugural director, reviewed decades of military files and discovered multiple instances where UFO myths had been deliberately seeded from within. One example involved a bizarre internal hoax known as Project Yankee Blue, in which new Air Force recruits were told of a top-secret unit that studied alien aircraft. The recruits were ordered to stay silent—many never realizing it was all a ruse. Former Air Force captain Robert Salas claimed a UFO hovered over the site and disabled ten nuclear missiles. But according to AARO's findings, the real cause may have been a failed electromagnetic pulse (EMP) test conducted to evaluate the base's vulnerability to nuclear disruption—an exercise Salas and others were never informed about. Ironically, the disinformation campaign designed to protect U.S. military secrets ultimately sparked a cultural phenomenon too big to control. What was meant as a clever Cold War strategy evolved into a sprawling mythology of aliens, abductions, and government cover-ups. Area 51 was designed to be impenetrable—both physically and, as it turns out, psychologically. Shielded by layers of secrecy, the base is surrounded by a no-fly zone, off-limits access roads, cutting-edge surveillance, and a ready military security force that patrols the perimeter. But the elaborate effort to cloak the base in mystery by feeding alien rumors may have worked too well. Instead of merely deflecting attention from classified military projects, the myth evolved into something far larger and more difficult to contain. The whispers of flying saucers and little green men took on a life of their own—embedding themselves in pop culture, conspiracy circles, and even political discourse. By 2019, the fantasy had reached a surreal new height. A viral internet joke—”Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us”—spread like wildfire. However, what started as satire took a sharp turn when people actually began to show up. At least one person was arrested for trespassing. The government had succeeded in obscuring its stealth programs behind a veil of science fiction. But in doing so, it gave birth to a legend that still fuels headlines, memes, and late-night conversations to this day. But that doesn't mean what goes on there is any less fascinating. What's known is that Area 51 has been critical to the development of some of the most advanced aerospace technology in U.S. history. What remains unknown is what still happens there—because even now, much of the base's activity is strictly classified. And in that space between fact and fiction, a modern myth was born—one carefully seeded by the very government that now claims to debunk it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Falling Angels," by John H. Thomas. In "Falling Angels," the third book in the Maxx King Thriller series, John H. Thomas pushes his high-octane storytelling to its most ambitious scale yet. The action opens in the chaos of Operation Anaconda, where elite operative Maxx King is betrayed, wounded and left for dead in the mountains of Afghanistan. As Maxx regroups with a Green Beret unit, he learns that the betrayal may be tied to something far more sinister than battlefield politics — a secret biological weapon called Thunderbird. Little does he know, but it's just the tip of a conspiracy iceberg involving clandestine extraterrestrial technology, rogue scientists, compromised politicians and shadowy global networks. Meanwhile, Maxx's emotional journey — from protector of his loved ones to reluctant savior of humanity — grounds the story in compelling personal stakes. Please enable it in your browser settings.
