                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video is slowly but surely cementing its authority in the young adult genre. The streamer's incredibly popular adaptation of Jenny Han‘s The Summer I Turned Pretty returned for its third and final season earlier this month to stellar viewership. But make no mistake, YA will continue to be alive and well at Amazon. In fact, the series returns in the middle of what feels like a moment for Prime Video's YA slate, which has been growing slowly but surely over the past few years. The streamer is currently home to titles including We Were Liars, Motorheads, Maxton Hall and Overcompensating, with more on the horizon including Legally Blonde prequel Elle, series adaptations of Elle Kennedy's popular Off Campus college romance novels, and Rebecca Yarros' fantasy epic Fourth Wing. There are also titles in the works that aren't specifically YA but target a similar demo including The Better Sister, which launched in May, and upcoming works like The Girlfriend and Mike Flanagan's Carrie adaptation. There's a “sense of community we're trying to build at Prime Video that it's not just the destination to watch content, but it's a chance to connect with storytellers, creators and for audiences to build relationships with one another. So that's our ultimate goal, and we're seeing this summer the real fruits of those labors start to pay off,” he said. In the interview below, Sanders talks more about the YA strategy at Prime Video and shares updates on several anticipated titles including many listed above. DEADLINE: We knew TSITP was popular, but the numbers shared today truly are impressive. VERNON SANDERS: We knew that we had what we hoped was going to be a giant hit coming in Season 3. Credit to our PR and marketing teams who teamed up on a women-led campaign that started in spring and has spread through the entire summer. We were extremely excited to see the results on The Better Sister, which was a big hit for us. We have The Runarounds coming later this year. All of these were really strategically placed throughout the year. This women-led campaign has really sort of brought it all together. There was a giant event in New York where we brought the cast of not only our U.S.-led series and movies, but we also brought our international cast. We has Maxton Hall, which is another hit. We've really created what we think is this fan-led community, which is really sort of humming along. So I think smart scheduling, and also this fan/customer-led campaign, has really ignited us here. DEADLINE: YA has always been a very enduring genre, but in the streaming era it struggled to find its footing. Outside of just finding and bidding on good material, how do you build a library of titles in that space that feels cohesive and plants a flag establishing Prime Video as a streaming home for YA? SANDERS: I think we're unique in that Prime Video has, obviously, all the roots of that Amazon helped build. The company got started by selling books. Our relationships with readers and authors, I think, is quite unique. I think we may have stumbled upon a little bit of a recipe that's really worked for us. Great adaptations lead to more book sales. That leads to success for all of us. I think it's about the voice, and so it doesn't have to just be an author who is adapting or a writer who's adapting or a showrunner who's adapting. We're trying to find those folks who just have something to say and and have had some success really resonating with that audience. So whether it's Megan Park or Benito Skinner — we're super excited by the results we've seen by from Overcompensating. Julie Plec … Mike Flanagan is doing an incredible adaptation of Carrie. We love working with Reese Witherspoon and Lauren Neustadter on Elle, which we think is going to be something that's going to surprise everyone. So it's really about the voice and building community, and that's what we're focused on for this part of our strategy. I hope to see more from that show. We've got some Season 2 writers rooms happening on several of our spring and early summer launches. We were always proud of Overcompensating, [and] just the reception of it has really, really given us even more encouragement. SANDERS: That was probably wishful thinking for me at the time, and Jenny has stayed really focused to getting these seasons right. We're pursuing new and different things with Jenny right now. So once the full season is launched, we'll get into conversations, and we'll ask her to pick from the many things that she's surfaced. SANDERS: Well, that's one of the shows where the writers are hard at work, working on what a Season 2 would be. We've been really excited by the results we've seen there, and it's one of the shows that I hope will have some positive news to report soon. They're hard at work in presenting us with material on a Season 2, and there's been quite a clamor from fans of that show to keep the story going. DEADLINE: I also wanted to ask about Motorheads. That felt like a very new and different offering from Prime Video in the YA space, and I'm curious what drew you to it and what void it's helping fill in your content strategy? We were launching NASCAR this summer, and so having a show that actually spoke to fans of that genre [was an asset]. We are conscious of not wanting to repeat ourselves. What I've been excited to see on that show in particular is we've got such great completion rates. So folks who start that show tend to watch it all the way through, and that's a great sign. Anything you can tease on the sequel? SANDERS: The film team would kill me if I revealed anything, so I'm gonna leave that to them, but that movie was an inspiration for all of us on the series side. It was so well done, and we took a lot of lessons and cues from that in terms of what we were doing. DEADLINE: You also have Off Campus, another popular series. We should be getting our first cuts in the not-too-distant future, and that show is definitely going to be launching in 2026. DEADLINE: As we are discussing the current state of YA at Prime Video, what does the future look like? What should we expect in the next five or so years? SANDERS: As I said, this is a part of our strategy. We're also focused on young men, and we've had a lot of success with animation and some of our big tentpoles [have been] a real beacon for young male audiences. But for young women, I think it's not only wanting to build a great library that if someone comes in for a show, they are sort of brought into a whole world of options and great stories that has all the elements. It's got a more smorgasbord of genres inside that. But I think the thing I'm most focused on, thanks to the teamwork between our marketing teams and our PR team, is this sense of community we're trying to build at Prime Video that it's not just the destination to watch content, but it's a chance to connect with storytellers, creators and for audiences to build relationships with one another. So that's our ultimate goal, and we're seeing this summer the real fruits of those labors start to pay off. DEADLINE: I know this one is probably early stages, but since you mentioned it, how are things on Fourth Wing? SANDERS: We don't have news to report yet, so I won't be breaking anything here, but we're hard at work. We love our relationship with Rebecca Yarros, who has been incredible, and we're going to get this one right. So that would be my promise to the fans.

Alex Warren's “Ordinary” adds an eighth week at No. The song has spent all its weeks on top consecutively, having become his first leader on the chart. Concurrently, Warren's album You'll Be Alright, Kid vaults 19-5 on the Billboard 200, becoming his first top 10 on the ranking, after it was expanded with 10 songs, including “Ordinary.” Elsewhere in the Hot 100's top 10, “Golden,” from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters and by HUNTR/X, the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, rises 4-2 for a new high. 1 “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, at No. 4, sparks history for the singer-songwriter on the Hot Country Songs chart, where it leads for a 10th week. It marks his record-breaking fourth song to reign for 10-plus weeks, surpassing Florida Georgia Line's three. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 2, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 29. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 20.7 million official streams (up 6% week-over-week),  74 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 1%) and 6,000 sold (down 12%) in the United States July 18-24. 1 on Radio Songs; and drops to No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, where it has led for nine weeks. “Golden” by HUNTR/X, the trio of EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI, surges 4-2 for a new Hot 100 high. It simultaneously tops Streaming Songs for the first time, rising a spot with 25.7 million streams, up 12%, marking the Hot 100's top gainer in streaming for a fourth consecutive week. “Golden” becomes the first song by an all-woman group to lead Streaming Songs since the chart began in 2013. “Golden,” from the hit Netflix animated film KPop Demon Hunters, also jumps 109% to 3.7 million in radio audience — it debuts at No. 35 on the Pop Airplay chart — and 10% to 4,000 sold. (A remix of the song by David Guetta was released Friday, July 25, and will count toward next week's charts.) Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100, and helps him make history on the Hot Country Songs chart, where it rules for a 10th week. The song, which topped the Hot 100 in its debut week in May, becomes his record-breaking fourth song to lead Hot Country Songs for 10-plus weeks, surpassing Florida Georgia Line's three. 3 on the Hot 100 a week after it debuted at No. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay (10.5 million, up 145%).

Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 6-8 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” rises 11-9 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March.

Now, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played his sister on the famed show, has weighed in. Sadly, he drowned, and his official cause of death is listed as accidental asphyxia. A post shared by Keshia Knight Pulliam (@keshiaknightpulliam) Notably, Malcolm-Jamal wasn't only an actor. It is believed that the video was from a performance at City Winery in Atlanta. Many online believe the two girls are Keshia and Malcolm's respective daughters, but this has not been confirmed. Keshia Knight Pulliam also posted the clip to her Instagram story. Following this, she shared her reasoning for not commenting on Malcolm-Jamal Warner's passing sooner. She wrote, “Thank you for every text, call, and all of the love that you have sent my way…” She went on, “I've just needed a moment.” Of course, this is understandable as it seems the two remained close in the decades after “The Cosby Show” came to an end. Malcolm-Jamal Warner and Keshia Knight Pulliam both starred on “The Cosby Show” throughout its run. As mentioned, the two remained close in recent years. According to USA Today, Keshia Knight Pulliam was even a guest on an episode of his “Not All Hood” podcast. This was about a month before his tragic passing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With his latest dispatch from the far reaches of Pandora, director James Cameron is pulling the Sully clan out of the pool and tossing them in the fire, showing a different and much more flamable side of his fantasy world. The trailer for Avatar: Fire And Ash delivers plenty of both, as well as new creatures, characters, and beautiful views of his digital paradise. The film formerly known as Avatar: The Seed Bearer may no longer bear seeds, but it does show off a very different and equally impressive side of the fantastic planet. Led by Varang (Oona Chaplin), an Ash Na'vi in a red and black headdress, the Ash People go to war with Pandora's Forest and Water tribes. Sadly for our old friends, Varang says that their goddess, Eywa, has no dominion here. Isn't it nice to see our boy raised by Na'vi once again? There are also brief glimpses of Tulkun. Still, we know people want to look at the pretty pictures, and who could blame them? The trailer continues to utilize 3-D in ways that others have given up on. 25 years into his bizarre and immensely profitable venture, he shows no signs of slowing down.

She completed her look with sneakers, wired earbuds, and a slouchy bag. In a July 11 feature, Teen Vogue declared Suri has nailed “cool-girl” summer dressing, and praised her for incorporating the “clean girl” aesthetic, a TikTok term used to denote sleek simplicity, without becoming basic. magazine, the stylish teen started college at Carnegie Mellon University in August 2024. Holmes posed with Joshua Jackson in July 2025 to promote their film “HAPPY HOURS” wearing unique frayed two-tone denim pants, after opening up to Vogue in the spring about one of her go-to “outfit formulas” for the season. I usually wear them with a long skirt or baggy pants, so it feels very comfortable,” said the “Dawson's Creek” actress. But Katie Holmes also appreciates an occasion to get dressed up. Katie Holmes famously dated her “Dawson's Creek” costar Joshua Jackson from 1998 to 1999, per Grazia. Now, fans are thrilled to see the pair side-by-side again as they work on their upcoming film, which Bustle says is a “love story.” The photo Holmes posted with Jackson, under which she wrote she “so very grateful” to be working on the project, garnered a quarter of a million likes in three days and greatly excited fans. “JOEY AND PACEY FOREVER,” wrote one, referencing the pair's “Dawson's Creek” characters. Deadline says Holmes is “set to write, direct, and star” in “Happy Hours,” which will be a feature film trilogy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon,” Trump said when asked about the prospect while meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. Last week, the Justice Department met with Maxwell — who is serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking and other charges related to her and Jeffrey Epstein's abuse ring — in an effort to determine if she has “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims.” The move is part of an effort by the Trump administration to appease members of the MAGA base furious over the administration's refusal to release large troves of evidence related to the Epstein case. Trump gave a similar answer to reporters at the White House on Friday when asked about the possibility of a pardon for Epstein's longtime accomplice: “I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I haven't thought about.” Trump also told reporters on Monday that he had never had “the privilege” of going to Epstein's private island, Little Saint James, where the disgraced financier and convicted sex trafficker, who died in prison 2019, allegedly invited wealthy associates to party and have sexual encounters with underage girls. “A lot of people in Palm Beach were invited to his island,” Trump said. “In one of my very good moments, I turned it down. The president claimed that he had fallen out with Epstein — his friend for many years — not because he was a predator with a fixation on underage girls, but because the financier had poached his staff. He did it again, and I threw him out of [Mar-a-Lago], persona non grata.” The notion that Trump is even considering a pardon for Maxwell has sparked backlash from Epstein accusers, as well as some Republican lawmakers. “She didn't just procure girls for Epstein, but she participated in their abuse — I think that's an important thing for people to understand,” Epstein abuse survivor Annie Farmer said on Saturday in an interview with ABC News. Farmer added that if Maxwell were to be released from prison, it would be “devastating” not only to her but “for so many people involved in this case.” I think she should have a life sentence at least.” GOP Sen. Refuses to Admit Bush, Not Obama, Was President During Epstein's Plea Deal Trump Rages About Windmills and Whales, Claims He Sent Aid to Gaza But No One Said 'Thank You' “So again, not my decision, but I have great pause about that, as any reasonable person would,” he added of the prospect of pardoning Epstein's accomplice.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new era of Who history began earlier this month with the launch of the Song Is Over farewell tour in Italy. He took over from Zak Starkey after a bizarre and protracted battle that played out in public, and placed Devour in a pretty awkward position. “It really is a strange contradiction of emotions to have the greatest moment of my professional career also be one framed with some sadness and shadowed by someone else's loss,” Devours wrote in a message to fans in May. He continued: “In my world, there are no bigger shoes to fill than those behind Pete and Roger. A big part of the responsibility is playing parts that were largely originated by Moon, which is no easy task for any drummer. Keith Moon — May 25, 1978 @ Shepperton Studios in Surrey, EnglandJust four months before Moon's death, the Who gathered at England's Shepperton Studios to play a brief set for director Jeff Stein. He was prepping a documentary about the Who's history, The Kids Are Alright, and felt there weren't adequate versions of “Baba O'Riley” and “Won't Get Fooled Again” in the film vault. Moon was in suboptimal health at this point and was winded when they wrapped up with “My Generation,” but Stein begged them to do “Won't Get Fooled Again” one more time. It feels unfair to judge Moon on his literal final performance of anything, and there are certainly better live renditions of the song from his younger years, but he still dug deep and largely nailed the solo. Kenney Jones — Dec. 17, 1982 @ Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, CanadaThe Who could have pulled a Led Zeppelin when Moon died and dissolved the band. But they decided to soldier on with Small Faces/Faces drummer Kenney Jones just months after Moon's death. The new lineup made one unfairly maligned album, 1981's Face Dances, one appropriately maligned album, 1982's It's Hard, and then decided to call it quits after an expansive farewell tour. (Yes, it's now 43 years later and they've just kicked off another farewell tour. The main set ended with “Won't Get Fooled Again.” You can't see what Jones is doing since vintage images of the Who flash on the screen during this drum solo, but you can hear that he does his best to replicate Moon's original part. It lacks some of the power and finesse of the master recording, but expecting anyone to play like 1971 Keith Moon isn't fair. The Who Begin Post-Zak Starkey Era at ‘Song Is Over' Tour Launch Pete Townshend on the Who's Split With Zak Starkey: 'It's Been a Mess' Simon Phillips — Aug. 24, 1989 @ Universal Amphitheater in Los Angles, CaliforniaTo varying degrees, the Who laid the groundwork for power pop, arena rock, punk, and even progressive rock. When they came back in 1989 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Tommy, and make oodles of money, they jettisoned Jones and brought journeyman drummer Simon Phillips into the fold. Simply put, Daltrey was never totally happy with Jones, and Townshend loved working with Phillips in the Eighties on his solo albums and occasional live show. When the tour hit Los Angles, they invited special guests Steve Winwood, Patti Labelle, Billy Idol, Phil Collins, and Elton John to join them for a complete performance of Tommy. The second set focused on hits from other eras, wrapping up with “Won't Get Fooled Again.” Phillips speeds up the drum solo and adds his own flourishes. It largely works, and we give him a lot of credit for not simply redoing Moon's original part, since Phillips is more than capable of doing that. The Who got by just fine with four members in their heyday. But Daltrey had recently toured with Ringo Starr's son Zak on drums, and he slid seamlessly into the Who. Starkey grew up on the Who's music, even learned to play the drums alongside Moon, and knew every nuance of their catalog. This was a stacked bill that also included David Bowie, Elton John, Billy Joel, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, and Paul McCartney. And Starkey's “Won't Get Fooled Again” drum solo is majestic. Scott Devours — July 20, 2025 @ Anfiteatro Camerini in Piazzola sul Brenta, ItalyThere are nice, clean ways for major rock bands to part with longtime drummers. We may never know exactly why the Who fired Starkey earlier this year, un-fired him, and then fired him again. And now Devours from Daltrey's solo band has the job. GOP Sen. Refuses to Admit Bush, Not Obama, Was President During Epstein's Plea Deal Trump Rages About Windmills and Whales, Claims He Sent Aid to Gaza But No One Said 'Thank You' Elon Musk's Tesla Diner Is the Cybertruck of Restaurants (It was a punishingly hot night, and Daltrey had leg cramps.) Devours had a lot of pressure on him at this moment, but he delivered a powerful drum solo that kept to the original tempo. There will always be a special place in our hearts for Starkey, but this was impressive. He's said in recent years that he loathes playing this song, and especially hates delivering the scream every night, but we give him a lot of points for continuing to handle it himself, and not pass it off to a background singer.

When Disney showed the trailer to a select group of press last week — before a planned rollout alongside “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” which opened on Friday, and after a very brief leak of the first look earlier this month — the studio generously played it three times in a row. Each time, my reaction was the same: this looks amazing, but what the heck is going on here?

Who are the so-called Ash people aligned with? What sort of neat animals do they have? And while this trailer does give us some good looks at this band of Na'vi, including their sooty village and their quite fierce leader, the big questions remain, plus a new one: are they actually fighting the Sully family and their aquatic Metkayina clan? The brief glimpses we get at them hint that, at least during certain parts of the film, they are indeed fighting the Sully fam, even taking to the skies on their own be-winged animal pals in service to battle. In January, Cameron told Empire a bit more about the film, including some quite relevant notes on the Ash leader, Varang (played by Oona Chaplin). (You can get a good look at Varang and the Ash village in two concept art images shared above and below, provided by Disney.) “Varang is the leader of a people who have gone through an incredible hardship. She will do anything for them, even things that we would consider to be evil,” the filmmaker said. “One thing we wanted to do in this film is not be black-and-white simplistic. A teaser clip shared at the event ended with one of these Ash people warriors threatening Sigourney Weaver's character by saying, “Your goddess has no dominion here,” which is also how this trailer ends. So, no, things don't sound like they've always been sunshine and flying dragons for the Ash people. The film also stars Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Jack Champion, Britain Dalton, Trinity Bliss, and Bailey Bass. It was filmed alongside “Avatar: The Way of Water” from 2017 to 2020. Walt Disney Pictures will release “Avatar: Fire and Ash” in theaters on Friday, December 19.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of The Fantastic Four: First Steps. The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Marvel Studios' Hail Mary to reinvigorate interest in its diminished cultural behemoth, makes all the right moves. It even sidesteps the franchise's longtime villain problem with a well-known and very big baddie. Marvel was figuring out how to do this in real time, but it became a fixture of the franchise and a way to keep fan excitement up as the credits rolled. But more recently, with so many TV shows and movies to sift through, and so many increasingly obscure characters to look up, the stingers lost their luster. Over the last half-decade, these stingers hit one dead end after another. Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) hasn't been seen since he, Wong (Benedict Wong), and Katy (Awkwafina) went to karaoke—to say nothing of Wenwu's (Tony Leung) supposed successor, Xu (Meng'er Zhang). After ditching those three, Marvel introduced fans to Harry Styles' Starfox for still unexplained reasons. This may have been cleared up on Disney+, where, for all anyone knows, a Clea Strange limited series is wrapping up. Recently, though, Marvel has been Invisible-Woman-clear about where this is going. The mid-credits moments from its last two movies are scenes that will likely appear in Avengers: Doomsday, tying that upcoming film directly to Marvel's First Family. The Fantastic Four: First Steps‘ mid-credits scene follows up on the one from Thunderbolts*; like how Nick Fury's (Samuel L. Jackson) pager guided viewers from Infinity War to Captain Marvel, seeing the Fantastic Four's Multiversal Ship pop up in Thunderbolts*‘ prepares us to head back to the swinging '60s. Building off that, First Steps‘ stinger, shot by the Russo brothers on the set of Doomsday and set four years after Galactus' defeat, shows Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) finding Doctor Doom playing with her son. Smash cut: “The Fantastic Four will return in Avengers: Doomsday.” It's a thoroughly effective, if predictable, tease, and with Marvel's next adventure, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, a year from theaters, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige needed a more forceful hook than usual. Even before that, though, Marvel put all its chips on Doom. The Russos were returning to direct Doomsday, and ex-Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. would come back to star as the film's antagonist, Doctor Doom. By heralding Downey's return a year and a half early, fans already knew his version of the character was in the mix. First Steps‘ stinger even generates some last-minute anticipation as Sue approaches him. Marvel didn't shell out for Downey to actually appear in the 15-second cameo, so those questions will have to wait until the next issue, true believers. Still, in an era when Marvel leaves more dangling threads than it snips, it's a relief to leave the theater without scratching your head and rushing to Wikipedia. Although the Fox acquisition somewhat replenished Marvel's stock of A-list characters, particularly by bringing in the Fantastic Four and X-Men, it still needs to rebuild trust with its audience through clear setups and payoffs. It also has to teach new fans how this works; the kids born the same year as Iron Man will be voting next year. Marvel took for granted how invested people were in its universe and, more importantly, how much time they had to spend in it. Merely adding an A-lister or obscure character to the MCU isn't enough.
