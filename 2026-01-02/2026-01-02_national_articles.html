                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nigerian police said on Friday the driver of the vehicle involved in a crash that injured British former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and killed two of his close friends was charged with four counts. Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, appeared before the Sagamu Magistrate Court on Friday in connection with the accident on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State Police Command said in a statement. It told Reuters Kayode was charged on four counts, including causing death by dangerous driving. Reuters was not immediately able to contact Kayode or a legal representative. Kayode has not commented publicly on the case. Joshua, 36, sustained minor injuries when the Lexus SUV he was travelling in collided with another car on Monday. Two of his friends and team members, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, died in the crash. Preliminary findings suggested the car was speeding and attempted a wrongful overtaking maneuver before hitting a stationary truck, the FRSC has said. Joshua, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, was taken to hospital for checks and remains stable, his promoter Matchroom Boxing said. President Bola Tinubu expressed condolences to Joshua and the victims' families, calling the incident a “tragic accident.” The crash came just over a week after Joshua knocked out American social media star Jake Paul in the sixth round of a bout in Miami. Joshua is expected to fight fellow Briton Tyson Fury later this year.</p>

President Barack Obama, right, talks with former President Bill Clinton while playing a round of golf at Andrews Air Force Base Sept. 24, 2011, at Andrews Air Force Base, Md. WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years. “It's amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hangar and support facilities. Trump toured the base by helicopter before Thanksgiving with Nicklaus, who has designed top courses the world over. Other golfers, though, describe Andrews' grounds as in good shape, despite some dry patches. Online reviews praise the course's mature trees, tricky roughs, and ponds and streams that serve as water hazards. The first president to golf at Andrews was Ford in 1974. Thomas began working there a couple years later, and was general manager from 1981 until he retired in 2019. “It's a Cecil B. DeMille production every time,” said Thomas, who had the opportunity to play rounds with four different presidents, and with Biden when he was vice president. He said the commanders in chief generally enjoyed their time out on the course in their own unique ways, but “they all like to drive the cart because they never get an opportunity to drive.” “It's like getting your driver's license all over again,” Thomas laughed. That tally includes days when Trump was playing courses his family owns in Virginia, around 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the White House, and near his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where he's spending the winter holidays. It also includes 10 days Trump spent staying at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where his schedule allowed time for rounds of golf. Andrews' military history dates to the Civil War, when Union troops used a church near Camp Springs, Maryland, as sleeping quarters. “President Trump is a champion-level golfer with an extraordinary eye for detail and design,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement. “His vision to renovate and beautify Joint Base Andrews' golf courses will bring much-needed improvements that service members and their families will be able to enjoy for generations to come.” Trump has said only that it will require “very little money.” Outside the White House, Trump has led building projects at the Kennedy Center and wants to erect a Paris-style arch near the Lincoln Memorial, and has said he wants to rebuild Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia. On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Trump administration ended a lease agreement with a non-profit for three public golf courses in Washington — which could allow the president to further shape golfing in the nation's capital. When the president is golfing, Andrews officials block off nine holes at a time so no one plays in front of him, allowing for extra security while also ensuring consistent speed-of-play, Thomas said. They're usually reserved for active or retired members of the military and their families, as well as some Defense Department-linked federal employees. Thomas remembers playing a round with the older President Bush, a World Golf Hall of Fame inductee known for fast play, while first lady Barbara Bush walked with Millie, the first couple's English Springer Spaniel. George W. Bush also played fast, Thomas said, and got additional exercise by frequently riding his mountain bike before golfing. When he wasn't golfing at Andrews, Obama tried to recreate at least part of the experience back home. He had a White House golf simulator installed after then-first lady Michelle Obama asked Thomas how they might acquire a model that the president had seen advertised on the Golf Channel. Thomas gave her a contact at the network. Obama famously cut short a round at Andrews after nine holes in 2011 to hustle back to the White House for what turned out to be a top-secret review of final preparations for a Navy SEAL raid on the compound of Osama bin Laden. But, while Thomas was golfing with presidents, he said he never witnessed play interrupted by an important call or any major emergency that forced them off the course mid-hole. “If there was rain coming, they'd get the weather forecast before we would,” Thomas said.</p>

Fox News correspondent Garrett Tenney discusses the increase in threats at Somali-run daycare centers in Minnesota and the federal intervention by the Trump administration on ‘Special Report.' The expression comes from the 1938 play "Gaslight" in which a devious husband lowers the lights in the house each evening, while insisting to his wife that she is imagining it, in an attempt to drive her mad and take her money. Regarding the new Minnesota state flag, let's be clear about one thing: It absolutely does closely resemble the national flag of Somalia as well as several Somali regional flags. One reason we know this is the case is that, not only did people immediately notice, but left-wing media started "debunking." At right, the new Minnesota state flag. At left, the Somali national flag. Here is what PBS News had to say in January 2024 as the flag was adopted: "It's a stretch to say the final version bears much resemblance to the Somali national flag, which is a solid light blue with a white, five-pointed star right in the center. The state Democratic Party chairman issued a news release taking one GOP lawmaker to task for fueling the spread of the misinformation on social media." In a state with the nation's largest Somali population, the Democrats adopted a new state flag that obviously looks like Somali flags, several of which include almost every detail, from color scheme to chevron. Are we honestly supposed to believe that throughout the entire process of picking the flag nobody noticed that it looks remarkably similar to the Somali flag that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey regularly waves around while dancing on stage? You can't walk six blocks in the Twin Cities without seeing Somali flags, on murals and in shop windows. The thought that nobody saw this obvious connection, that it simply never occurred to anyone except racists looking for trouble not only strains credulity, it runs it through a high-powered shredder. This is the Minnesota state flag that was replaced by one some say resembles the national flag of Somalia. (Mohamed Ibrahim/Report for America via AP, File) Tim Walz, who reveled in the flag change, and other Democrats would admit it was at least a coincidence, then they would still almost certainly be lying, but not gaslighting. Instead, these liberals are making us look at a Minnesota flag that demonstrably is just like the Somali flags and forcing us to say, in pure Orwellian style, that we are the crazy ones and 2 + 2 = 5. This is all very much in line with the fact that we are not supposed to notice that the Gopher State's massive $9 billion fraud scandal centers around the Somali community. Since they believe that the attention on these issues is rooted racism, to cover the stories, even if they are true, is to abet that alleged racism. Tim Walz is facing calls to resign from GOP lawmakers in his state. I am here to tell you that you are not crazy or a racist for observing the obvious about the Minnesota flag, and that those who tell you it never occurred to anyone during the design and selection process are just flat-out lying. As usual, there is money involved. And boy, is there a lot of money involved in the Minnesota gaslighting the nation is going through today. The American people are not going to be told they shouldn't believe their lying eyes anymore. Everyone who looks at the Minnesota flag and the flags of Somalia can clearly see they are related, and we are done pretending we don't. If there is a positive to come out of this massive scandal, it is that voters will no longer simply look away from fraud because noticing it in a specific group might be racist. And what's more, we will not be gaslit over Minnesota's Somali-themed state flag for one more moment.

In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, emergency services personnel work to extinguish a fire following a Russian missile attack in Kharkiv, Ukraine, Friday, Jan. 2, 2026. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday appointed the head of Ukraine's military intelligence as his new chief of staff, a move that comes as the U.S. leads a diplomatic push to end Russia's nearly 4-year-old invasion. Announcing the appointment of Gen. Kyrylo Budanov, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needs to focus on security issues, developing its defense and security forces, and peace talks -- areas that are overseen by the office of the president. Zelenskyy had dismissed his previous chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, after anti-corruption officials began investigating alleged graft in the energy sector. The president framed Budanov's appointment as part of a broader effort to sharpen the focus on security, defense development and diplomacy. “Kyrylo has specialized experience in these areas and sufficient strength to achieve results,” Zelenskyy said. Budanov, 39, said on Telegram his new position is “both an honor and a responsibility — at a historic time for Ukraine — to focus on the critically important issues of the state's strategic security.” Zelenskyy appointed Foreign Intelligence Service head Oleh Ivashchenko to replace Budanov as GUR chief. Budanov is one of the country's most recognizable and popular wartime figures. He has led Ukraine's military intelligence agency, known by its acronym GUR, since 2020. A career military intelligence officer, he rose through the defense establishment after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. He also took part in special operations and intelligence missions linked to the fighting with Moscow-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine before the full-scale invasion of February 2022. Budanov has become a prominent face of Kyiv's intelligence effort, regularly appearing in interviews and briefings that mix strategic signaling with psychological pressure on Moscow. Under Budanov, the GUR expanded its operational footprint, coordinating intelligence, sabotage and special operations aimed at degrading Russian military capabilities far beyond the front lines. Ukrainian officials have credited military intelligence with operations targeting Russian command structures, logistics hubs, energy infrastructure and naval assets, including strikes deep inside Russian territory and occupied areas. “Unlike Yermak, he has both experience in this field and has worked in a relevant position,” Reiterovych said, adding that the GUR also has had certain contacts with Russia on issues such as prisoner exchanges. Svetlana Petrenko, spokeswoman of Russia's main criminal investigation agency, the Investigative Committee, said those killed in the village of Khorly, where at least 100 civilians were celebrating New Year's Eve, included two minors, while 31 people were hospitalized. A spokesman for Ukraine's General Staff, Dmytro Lykhovii, denied attacking civilians. He told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne on Thursday that Ukrainian forces “adhere to the norms of international humanitarian law” and “carry out strikes exclusively against Russian military targets, facilities of the Russian fuel and energy sector, and other lawful targets.” He noted that Russia has repeatedly used disinformation and false statements to disrupt the ongoing peace negotiations. U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that he, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner had a “productive call” with the national security advisers of Britain, France, Germany and Ukraine “to discuss advancing the next steps in the European peace process.” The U.S. efforts has faced a new obstacle earlier this week, when Moscow said it would toughen its negotiating stand after what it said was a long-range drone attack against a residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin in northwestern Russia early Monday. In his New Year's address, Zelenskyy said a peace deal was “90% ready” but warned that the remaining 10% — believed to include key sticking points such as territory — would “determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live.” At least 19 people in the eastern city were injured, including a 6-month-old, said regional administration head Oleh Syniehubov. The Russian Defense Ministry denied launching any strikes with missiles or other airborne weapons on Kharkiv on Friday and suggested, without offering evidence, that the damage could have been caused by the detonation of ammunition at a weapons depot. Earlier Friday, Russia conducted what local authorities called “one of the most massive” drone attacks at Zaporizhzhia. At least nine drones struck the city, damaging dozens of residential buildings and other civilian infrastructure but causing no casualties, according to Ivan Fedorov, head of the regional administration. The Russian city of Belgorod was hit by a Ukrainian missile, according to regional Gov. Two women were hospitalized after the strike, which shattered windows and damaged an unspecified commercial facility and a number of cars in the region that borders Ukraine, he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decade after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates led a joint military campaign to curb Iran's influence in Yemen, the two allies now find themselves pitted against each other there. The Arab world's most powerful nations have entered an unprecedented public spat over Yemen, a strategically located and impoverished nation with a history of unresolved conflicts. This week, Saudi Arabia struck a UAE shipment carrying combat vehicles bound for Yemen in an unprecedented military escalation before accusing Abu Dhabi of “highly dangerous” actions and endangering the kingdom's national security. But over the years, disagreements surfaced between rival Yemeni factions whose competing agendas unintendedly exposed a rift between the two Middle Eastern allies, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Here's how Yemen's war has morphed into a proxy conflict involving erstwhile allies: In 2014, they orchestrated a swift takeover of Sana'a, with some popular backing, seizing control of the government. With sustained Iranian arms supplies and support, they emerged as Yemen's most cohesive military and political entity, controlling most of the country's northwestern border with Saudi Arabia, and holding critical Red Sea coastline, including access to vital maritime corridors. Over time, the Houthis evolved into one of Tehran's most disruptive regional proxies, launching missile strikes on Saudi Arabia and as far as Israel. They endured a prolonged Saudi-led military campaign, which ultimately failed and led to the Houthis securing a de facto truce in 2022. Yemen's internationally recognized government, operating under the Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), was established in 2022 to unify fragmented factions against the Houthis; it commands a loose coalition of regular military remnants, tribal militias, and Sunni Islamist groups in the center and south of the country. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia has conducted extensive air and naval operations, with limited ground troop deployments to prop up the government and counter the growing threat on its southern border. The UAE's backing of southern separatists seeking independence directly conflicts with Saudi Arabia's support for a unified and stable Yemen at its border. After years of stalled efforts to end the civil war, UAE-backed forces launched a rapid offensive in early December, seizing control of oil-rich provinces – at times from Saudi-backed forces – leading to deadly clashes. Tensions peaked this week when Saudi-led coalition airstrikes targeted a UAE shipment of vehicles at southern Yemen's Mukalla port, accusing Abu Dhabi of endangering Saudi national security. The UAE had since announced a withdrawal of its forces from Yemen. In line with its approach of urging calm and de-escalation, the UAE concluded the presence of its counterterrorism forces,” a UAE government official said in a statement. On Friday, tensions further escalated as Saudi Arabia deployed its navy off Yemen's coast shortly after Riyadh-backed forces launched what they called a “peaceful” ground offensive to retake areas from the UAE-backed southern separatists. Saudi Arabia hasn't commented on the matter. Farea Al-Muslimi, a research fellow at London's Chatham House think tank, said the unprecedented escalations “reflect fundamental disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi over the future political structure of Yemen and the balance of influence within it.” “These actions mark a critical turning point, signaling a volatile and dangerous phase in Yemen's fractured alliances,” Al-Muslimi said. Internal divisions and civil wars driven by ideological differences have plagued modern Yemen for over a century. North Yemen gained independence from the Ottoman Empire after 1918, while South Yemen remained under British control until independence in 1967. The two states remained divided for about 23 years until unification in 1990, followed shortly by a civil war in 1994, in which southern separatists were defeated, leaving unaddressed grievances that contribute to ongoing conflicts. Recurring conflicts have left the nation – strategically located south of Saudi Arabia with access to key maritime corridors – heavily impoverished, highly unstable, and well-armed, as regional powers vie for influence. “The Houthis are likely to view the growing rift between two of their principal adversaries with considerable advantage, observing as former coalition partners – who jointly fought and failed to defeat them – now turn against one another,” Al-Muslimi noted. “How western governments will respond to escalating tensions between two of their most important regional partners remains uncertain, but the implications for regional stability and for Yemen's already fragile political landscape are profound,” he added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A respected dentist and his wife were gunned down in their upscale Ohio home while two young children were inside, authorities said, as the killer remains on the loose. The bodies of Spencer Tepe, 37, and his wife, Monique Tepe, 39, were found Tuesday after a welfare check at their home in the 1400 block of N. 4th Street, Columbus police said. “Two small children were also found in the residence unharmed,” police said. Officers found no obvious signs of forced entry, and no firearm was found at the scene, CNN affiliate WSYX reported. Police have not released any details about a possible suspect or motive and are asking the public for any information on the case. Their direction is not surprising, CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said. “If there's no gun, there would have been no way to do murder-suicide,” she said. The owner of the practice where Spencer Tepe worked called 911 on Tuesday morning when Tepe uncharacteristically missed work. “He is always on time, and he would contact us if there was any issues,” Dr. Mark Valrose of Athens Dental Depot told dispatchers. This is very out of character for him. We can't get in touch with his wife, which is probably the more concerning thing.” An officer responded at 9:22 a.m., but did not get an answer, WSYX reported, citing police records. Colleagues also drove to the Tepes' home, and one friend heard children crying inside. Either of two scenarios for how the crime unfolded seems to be most likely, Kayyem said: a “stranger at the door who just happens to kill this couple, or some narrative that might explain why they were targeted.” Columbus police have not responded to CNN's questions about a motive for the killings or whether the couple was targeted. “Given the fact that this doesn't happen often, and there was no signs of forced entry/burglary, you're going to look at people who they may have known or people who knew where they lived, unfortunately, and begin there,” she said. But the … national data suggests both how uncommon this is as well as the likelihood that there may be someone who knew them who was involved with this.” Athens Dental Depot announced its closure for the rest of this week. “It is with heavy hearts that we share the sudden passing of our dear colleague and friend, Dr. Spencer Tepe, as well as his wife Monique,” the office posted Thursday on Facebook. “He will be deeply missed by our team and the many patients he cared for over the years. Our thoughts and sincerest condolences are with their families and loved ones during this very difficult time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATHENS, Greece (AP) — More than 300,000 inactive university students have been removed from the rolls in Greece, cutting the country's official student population by nearly half, authorities said Friday. The move marks the end of a decadeslong practice — formally abolished in recent legislation — that allowed extended enrollment to facilitate lifelong learning and lengthy breaks for work. “Student status is not valid for life in any modern European university,” Education Minister Sofia Zacharaki said. “We want degrees with value, which reflect effort, skills and passion.” Ministry officials said that about 35,000 people successfully applied for reenrollment in 2025. The country's active student population stands at just over 350,000, studying at 25 public higher education institutions, according to 2024 data from the Hellenic Authority for Higher Education. Undergraduate degree programs at state universities are normally funded by the government. Until recently, only public universities offering state-recognized degrees have operated in Greece. Education Ministry officials said that dormant students — those who had interrupted their studies — didn't impose any direct financial burden on universities, but created administrative difficulties. “With updated student lists, universities gain the ability to plan more precisely,” Deputy Education Minister Nikos Papaioannou said. “That is a prerequisite for improving academic quality, daily operations and the criteria used to evaluate Greek universities in international rankings.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump and Iranian officials traded threats after he threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters. Iran has been racked by protests over the past several days around deteriorating economic conditions in the country, made worse by a growing water crisis and severe sanctions against Tehran. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” he warned in a post on Truth Social, signing off with his name in all caps. “With the statements by Israeli officials and @realDonaldTrump, what has been going on behind the scenes is now clear,” he wrote in a post on X. Several people have already been killed in the protests, with Tehran admitting several deaths and human rights groups tallying anywhere from five to eight deaths by Friday. One of the most controversial deaths was Amirhesam Khodayarifard, who died in Lorestan province under unclear circumstances. Tehran claimed he was a member of the government's Basij militia and killed by protesters, while human rights groups claimed he was a protester killed by security forces, and that Tehran was pressuring his family to falsely declare him a member of the Basij militia. Iran has been plagued by crippling social instability for the past few years, with massive protests breaking out almost annually. The protests have also brought sympathy from some officials, however. The reform-minded President Masoud Pezeshkian went so far as to tell reporters on Thursday, “If people are unhappy with us, we are the ones at fault.” The protests are occurring amid broader discussion between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over whether to launch new strikes against Iran to disrupt its nuclear or ballistic missile programs.</p>

Former Trump impeachment lawyer David Schoen weighs in on Fani Willis's defiant testimony and President Donald Trump considering denaturalizing certain American citizens on 'The Ingraham Angle.' A massive fraud scandal tied to taxpayer-funded daycare, Medicaid and social services programs in Minnesota — involving potentially billions of dollars in suspicious billing — is prompting renewed scrutiny of whether some naturalized Americans obtained U.S. citizenship under false pretenses and whether denaturalization could now be used more aggressively. Immigration authorities have confirmed they are reviewing whether fraud uncovered in Minnesota could provide the legal basis to revoke U.S. citizenship from naturalized individuals who concealed or misrepresented material facts during the immigration process. Denaturalization is legally constrained, requires individualized civil court proceedings and historically has been used sparingly. Attorney David Schoen said it remains legally viable but under extraordinary circumstances. He said on Fox News the process would likely trigger "significant" court challenges but "it is legally possible. In an extraordinary circumstance, we'd have to know the facts." Quality Learning Center in Minnesota was found at the center of an alleged childcare fraud scandal in the state. Schoen emphasized that immigration law already provides clearer mechanisms for removing noncitizens, particularly lawful permanent residents who violate the law, describing denaturalization as a far more extraordinary step requiring fact-specific scrutiny. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on "Fox & Friends" that the administration is "not afraid to use denaturalization," and confirmed that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the State Department are "looking at" whether citizenship could be revoked in connection with those of Somali origin in the Minnesota fraud probe. DHS confirmed it is actively reviewing immigration and naturalization cases involving migrants from 19 countries of concern, including Somalia, to determine whether any individuals obtained U.S. citizenship through fraud that could warrant denaturalization. "Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization," DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Fox News. DHS stressed that denaturalization is governed by strict legal standards and applies only under limited circumstances. President Donald Trump weighed in on the Minnesota investigations Wednesday, sharply criticizing the state's handling of fraud and linking the scandal to illegal immigration in a Truth Social post. "Much of the Minnesota Fraud, up to 90%, is caused by people that came into our Country, illegally, from Somalia," Trump wrote. "Lowlifes like this can only be a liability to our Country's greatness," he added. "Send them back from where they came, Somalia, perhaps the worst, and most corrupt, country on earth." Federal prosecutors say their investigation has expanded to suspicious billing across 14 Medicaid-funded programs, where providers billed about $18 billion since 2018. A preliminary assessment cited by prosecutors suggests "half or more" of that amount could be fraudulent. The widened probe builds on yearslong scrutiny of Minnesota following some of the largest benefit-fraud cases ever prosecuted in the state, including a pandemic-era food aid scheme involving roughly $250 million in alleged losses. Federal officials say those cases exposed systemic weaknesses in oversight that may extend across multiple aid programs. Quality Learning Center manager Ibrahim Ali denied any fraud took place, despite a recent report by independent journalist Nick Shirley. Republican lawmakers argue that fraud on such a scale raises broader questions about whether individuals involved were truthful throughout the immigration process — and whether citizenship should shield offenders who obtained it through deception. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., called for the deportation of all Somali immigrants involved in fraud cases in Minnesota. If they're here illegally, deport them immediately; if they're naturalized citizens, revoke their citizenship and deport them quickly thereafter. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow has previously criticized the current citizenship test as "too soft," calling for deeper civics knowledge and more rigorous English evaluation throughout the naturalization interview. Historically, the federal government has pursued only a small number of denaturalization cases each year. Civil liberties groups warn that expanding its use could raise due-process concerns, teeing up a potential legal battle. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

Aaron MacLean, Hudson Institute fellow, analyzes Iran's deadly protests, President Trump's warning to the regime and whether U.S. pressure could tip Tehran toward change. President Donald Trump warned early Friday that the U.S. would intervene if Iran started killing protesters. Writing on Truth Social, the president said if Iran shoots and "violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue." Trump's warning comes as demonstrations triggered by Iran's deteriorating economy expand beyond the capital and raise concerns about a potential heavy-handed crackdown by security forces. At least seven people — including protesters and members of Iran's security services — have been reported killed during clashes, according to international reporting. Ali Larijani, a former parliament speaker who serves as the secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, pushed back on Trump's post, writing on X that, "With the statements by Israeli officials and Donald Trump, what has been going on behind the scenes is now clear. "The American people should know — Trump started this adventurism. They should be mindful of their soldiers' safety," Larijani added. The threat came after Iran launched an attack on Al-Udeid, the American airbase in Qatar, in June 2025. Located southwest of Doha, it serves as a hub for logistical operations for the U.S. mission to fight ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, arrives in Beirut, Lebanon, on Sept. 27, 2025, to attend a memorial service for Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. At the time, Iran vowed to retaliate against the U.S. after American B-2 bombers dropped 14 bunker buster bombs on three Iranian nuclear sites. In the recent Iranian demonstrations, some of the most severe violence has been reported in western Iran, where videos circulating online appeared to show fires burning in streets and the sound of gunfire during nighttime protests. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us.... The unrest marks Iran's most significant protests since 2022, when the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody sparked nationwide demonstrations. Officials say the current protests have not yet reached the same scale or intensity, but they have spread to multiple regions and include chants directed at Iran's theocratic leadership. Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has signaled a willingness to engage with protesters, but the administration faces limited options as the country's economy continues to deteriorate. Iran's currency has sharply depreciated, with roughly 1.4 million rials now required to buy a single U.S. dollar, intensifying public anger and eroding confidence in the government. State television reported the arrests of several people accused of exploiting the unrest, including individuals it described as monarchists and others allegedly linked to Europe-based groups. Authorities also claimed security forces seized smuggled weapons during related operations, though details remain limited. Iranian protests force nationwide shutdown as President Masoud Pezeshkian closes businesses and offices across 21 provinces amid mounting public anger. The demonstrations come amid heightened regional tensions following a 12-day conflict with Israel in June, during which the United States bombed Iranian nuclear sites. However, talks have yet to resume, as both Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned Tehran against reconstituting its nuclear capabilities — adding further pressure on Iran's leadership as protests continue.

Georgia quarterback Gunner Stockton (14) dives into the end zone for a touchdown against Mississippi during the first half of the Sugar Bowl NCAA college football playoff quarterfinal game, Thursday, Jan. 1, 2026, in New Orleans. NEW ORLEANS (AP) — With Trinidad Chambliss making stunning plays at pivotal moments, Mississippi is doing fine without Lane Kiffin. Chambliss passed for 362 yards and two touchdowns, and Lucas Carneiro kicked a 47-yard field goal with 6 seconds left to put No. “A lot of people did doubt us before the season and they still doubted us when our coach left,” Chambliss said. Next up for Ole Miss is a semifinal matchup with Miami at the Fiesta Bowl. “We've got a lot of good coaches,” Golding said, referring in part to assistants who have agreed to join Kiffin at LSU, but who've been permitted to remain with the Rebels through this postseason. “A lot of guys have been going through a lot of things but they've been here for the kids the whole time,” Golding continued. “And this is a special group of kids.” “It was an incredible college football game,” Georgia coach Kirby Smart said. “It's what the CFP was built for, to have battles like that. And that was basically every conference game we had this year.” While Carneiro's late kick was the decisive score, Ole Miss was awarded a safety on its final kickoff when Georgia's return team tried a cross-field lateral that hit the pylon with 1 second left. “I'm sick that we lost, and there's things I would love to go back and do differently,” Smart said. “But I'm just so proud of the way our guys competed.” 3 seed) rallied to tie it, first driving for Gunner Stockton's 18-yard TD pass to Zachariah Branch before Peyton Woodring's short field goal tied it with 55 seconds left in regulation. Chambliss responded by setting up the winning kick with a 40-yard pass to De'Zhaun Stribling on third down from Mississippi's 30-yard line. A few plays later, Carneiro, who'd already broken Sugar Bowl records with field goals of 55 and 56 yards, connected again and sprinted triumphantly toward the Ole Miss sideline as the Rebels jubilantly swarmed around him. “They're never scared and they don't panic, and that's what I love about this group,” Golding said of his players. Twice, Chambliss appeared to be running for his life to avoid sacks, retreating well behind the line of scrimmage and changing direction before finding school yard-type completions during a 75-yard scoring drive that ended with Lacy's second touchdown. “I mean, he does an unbelievable job of not (taking) sacks and making plays with his legs.” Stockton twice completed passes moments before absorbing heavy hits, both of which took him off his feet and one of which looked like unpenalized head contact that left him flat on his back. Both QBs also converted fourth-down passes to keep alive scoring drives when their team trailed. But after Ole Miss had taken a 27-24 lead, Georgia again ran an offensive play on fourth down in its own territory and Stockton was sacked by Suntarine Perkins. Georgia took its first lead at 7-6 on Stockton's 12-yard run. The lead changed again on Stockton's short keeper — one play after being flattened by what appeared to be an illegal hit to the head by linebacker Tahj Chambers as the quarterback released a 26-yard completion to Cash Jones. Lacy fumbled on Mississippi's next series, and the ball bounced straight to Daylen Everette, who ran 47 yards untouched for his first-career touchdown to make it 21-12. Ole Miss: While Kiffin put this Rebels team together and led it to an 11-1 regular season, his departure for LSU — traumatic as it may have been for Ole Miss fans — hasn't stopped the team from forging ahead under Golding. The former Rebels defensive coordinator is now 2-0 in his head coaching career, with both victories coming in the CFP. Ole Miss: The Rebels brace for a 10th-seeded Miami squad that has staged back-to-back CFP upsets. Georgia: Opens its 2026 season at home against Tennessee State on Sept. 5.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy — our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,” California DMV Director Steve Gordon said in a statement. “We are hopeful that our collaboration with the federal government will give [the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration] confidence in our updated processes to allow California to promptly resume issuance of nondomiciled commercial driver's licenses.” Illegal immigrants who were previously issued commercial driver's licenses will now have an additional two months to reapply for the document and retake their exams. In May, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy implemented new guidance to enforce the English language proficiency requirement for truck drivers as part of a broader federal effort to ensure they can read and follow road signs. According to the DOT, a previous investigation by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration uncovered “significant failures” by California, New Mexico, and Washington to mark drivers “out of service” for English language proficiency violations. The Trump administration threatened to pull millions of dollars of federal funding from blue states, including California, New Mexico, and Washington, unless the states adopted and enforced English language proficiency requirements for commercial drivers. A number of fatal traffic incidents involving illegal immigrants granted commercial driver's licenses have surfaced nationwide. Singh had ignored a road sign that showed no U-turns were permitted at the place where he attempted to make an illegal U-turn. In recent months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has gone after these commercial truck drivers. In November, the DOT announced that California would have to revoke thousands of “illegally issued” commercial driver's licenses.</p>

(AP) — When Indiana met Oregon in October, the game served as the best test yet of whether the Hoosiers were a one-year wonder or a program that was here to stay.

Terrill) A pair of Big Ten blowouts in Thursday's quarterfinals — Indiana 38, Alabama 3 and Oregon 23, Texas Tech 0 — set up Oregon-Indiana, Part 2 in the national semifinals at the Peach Bowl next Friday. “Why would it be too big for them? '” Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti said after his team passed its latest big-time test. Miami quarterback Carson Beck, right, is hugged by former NFL player Michael Irvin following the Cotton Bowl College Football Playoff quarterfinal game against Ohio State Wednesday, Dec. 31, 2025, in Arlington, Texas. It will be a matchup between Hurricanes QB Carson Beck and the Rebels, who are now 2-0 since the abrupt departure of coach Lane Kiffin. The top-seeded Hoosiers (14-0) opened as a four-point favorite in their rematch with No. This blowout win over the Crimson Tide might have been Indiana's most impressive performance since the win at Oregon. In that one, Ducks defensive back Brandon Finney, who had two interceptions and a fumble recovery against Texas Tech, returned an interception for a touchdown to tie the game at 20 early in the fourth quarter.

(AP Photo/Lynne Sladky) The most intriguing matchup in this game isn't hard to find. Quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza of Indiana Dante Moore of Oregon are projected as the top two picks on many 2026 draft boards. Mendoza is trying to join a rarified list of quarterbacks (among them, Jameis Winston, Cam Newton and Matt Leinart) who have won the Heisman and the national title in the same season. Oregon is coming off a defensive domination of Texas Tech. The Ducks created four turnovers that led to 13 points. Moore, meanwhile, was held in relative check, throwing for 234 yards and no scores. “Let's go to the doctor, let's figure out what kind of medicine we have to take for the next game. Mississippi quarterback Trinidad Chambliss (6) warms up before the Sugar Bowl NCAA college football playoff quarterfinal game between Georgia and Mississippi, Thursday, Jan. 1, 2026, in New Orleans. The 10th-seeded Hurricanes, who beat Ohio State on New Year's Eve, haven't faced Mississippi since 1951. But this is a matchup steeped in the modern-day realities of college football. Beck, the Miami quarterback, played at Georgia last season, but an injury in the SEC title game ended his season and sent his draft stock plummeting. Over in Oxford, the drama of Kiffin's departure for a job at SEC-rival LSU overshadowed the best season in program history, but didn't stop the chase for for a title. “We've got a great group of people in the building,” said coach Pete Golding, who took over for Kiffin. Going against Beck will be Ole Miss QB Trinidad Chambliss, who led Division II Ferris State to the national title last year. He is now two wins away from taking the Rebels to a Division I crown. “Our grit,” he said when asked how Ole Miss has overcome its obstacles this year. “We just want to win, play football and have fun with our brothers.</p>
