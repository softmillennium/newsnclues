                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani's supporters at his inauguration share their hopes for the new administration. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation. spoke with many Mamdani supporters, including a high school student and Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, about what the day represented to them, their hopes for the new administration and how it could set a model for progressives across the country. “Organized people will always be more powerful than organized money,” said Diana Moreno, a fellow democratic socialist who is running for Mamdani's vacant seat in the New York State Assembly. Copy may not be in its final form. AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. We'll hear in a minute from his fellow socialists, Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, who swore in Mamdani on the steps at City Hall. But first, thousands of New Yorkers turned out in below-freezing temperatures and police barricades to be part of Mamdani's inauguration, with many joining a block party with a marching band. 's María Taracena spoke to some of them. I'm running for Assembly to succeed Zohran Mamdani in the Assembly, because we know that he cannot do this alone. And I'm so thrilled to be part of that movement. I'm not doing it alone as an individual. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: For many around the country, New York is sort of a symbol of the power of organizing, after Mayor Mamdani won the election by a landslide. And Zohran has shown us that we can do this. And the reason why I'm here is because this literally is such a unique opportunity to show the entire country what it looks like when you have billionaires out the way and you have someone in control who is accountable to the people. A lot of people think that Zohran Mamdani is a once-in-a-generation talent, and I think he's an incredible person, and I back him all the way. But the reality is that there are so many Zohrans throughout the entire country, but they get outspent. And so, if Americans can see a model of what equitable leadership really looks like, it can empower other Zohrans to come out the fold. I am a teenager here in New York City. And throughout Mayor Mamdani's campaign, two things that I'm really proud that I was able to do is, one, go out and canvass, be out there on Election Day to make sure that we get those last-minute voters in to get the outcome that we have today. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: You're here with your friends. ARIEL SEGURA: I mean, like, again, I think it's just like Mr. Mamdani, as compared to other politicians that, you know, just say things that are kind of persuasive, he's really listening to the people, and he's really getting those issues that we see on a day-to-day basis. I mean, fast and free buses, I take the bus at least once a month in my neighborhood. When it comes to universal child care, I know that I, as a kid, I had to stay with other family members that my parents had to pay. It was a struggle for them to do these things, and I watched these issues in my day-to-day life. MARÍA INÉS TARACENA: Mahmoud Khalil, you were released from ICE detention a few months ago earlier this year. You're now at the inauguration of New York City Mayor Mamdani. What does this moment mean for you? MAHMOUD KHALIL: I mean, it's a great moment. I'm very optimistic to raise my child, who was born when I was in detention, to raise him under the mayorship of Mamdani. It's a great moment for all of us. It means that standing up for human rights, standing up for Palestinian rights wouldn't mean that you don't get elected. And this is what other politicians in this country should understand, that Palestine is no longer a liability for their platform, that they actually should speak out for Palestine. I will — I will commit to you that we will freeze the rent, that we will make universal child care available to everybody, that we will make buses fast and free.” It was a politics of solidarity, a politics of mutual commitment and a politics of optimism in a moment when there is so much darkness surrounding us.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The man accused of being the Washington, DC, pipe bomber will remain in jail until he faces trial, a federal judge ruled Friday. The decision to keep Brian Cole Jr., who allegedly placed explosives outside the Democratic and Republican National Committee buildings on January 5, 2021, was made two days after a hearing in which prosecutors argued that Cole would pose a danger to others if he were released and allowed to live with his family. Judge Matthew Sharbaugh wrote that: “The sudden and abrupt motivation behind Mr. Cole's alleged actions presents concerns about how quickly the same abrupt and impulsive conduct might recur.” Sharbaugh said the speed at which Cole was able to allegedly assemble the bombs “suggest he can prepare dangerous explosive devices in short order, over a matter of hours, not necessarily days or weeks.” Sharbaugh added too that he shared concerns with prosecutors about how Cole allegedly deleted evidence and continued to purchase alleged bomb making parts after Cole allegedly placed the two bombs near the Republican and Democratic National Committee buildings. Could Brian Cole Jr. claim Trump's Jan. 6 pardons cover him? A former Jan. 6 prosecutor says that's the argument he'd make Cole's attorney argued he should be released into his grandmother's custody. Cole's grandmother took the stand herself, promising to “make any adjustments that I need to make” to keep him out of trouble, adding that she had already placed cameras around the exterior of her home inside a gated community. His defense attorney also stressed that Cole has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, two factors that should be considered for both his mindset in committing the alleged crimes and for his ability to navigate being in jail. Further complicating the matter is that the Justice Department has secured an indictment against Cole that had not yet been accepted by a judge. Sharbaugh explained during the hearing that a grand jury in the local Superior Court in Washington, rather than the federal court, had handed up an indictment against Cole, and that he was watching a separate case with a similar issue move through the appeals process to determine what to do in Cole's case. CNN's Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report. This story has been updated with additional details.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Victoria Jones, the daughter of the actor Tommy Lee Jones, has been found dead in a San Francisco hotel. Jones, 34, was discovered in the early hours of New Year's Day, according to TMZ, which cited law enforcement sources. “Our units responded to the scene, performed an assessment and declared one person deceased,” said a spokesperson, who added that the local police department and medical examiner's office then took over. The cause of death is not yet known. As a child, Jones acted alongside her father in films such as Men in Black II and The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, and she also appeared in the TV series One Tree Hill. When promoting The Three Burials, Tommy Lee Jones said of his daughter: “She's a good actress, has her SAG [Screen Actors Guild] card, speaks impeccable Spanish. He also said that as a teenager, she had balked at the early starts required on film sets. “She had to get up at 5am for her part,” he told the New Yorker. “One morning, she wouldn't get out of bed. Then, without telling me, the production staff went over and woke her and rushed her out to the set just in time.” Tommy Lee Jones, 79, won an Oscar and Golden Globe for his role in The Fugitive and has also acted in films such as JFK, Lincoln, In the Valley of Elah and No Country for Old Men.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Probe underway: Sparklers on champagne bottles that came too close to the ceiling likely caused the Swiss ski resort bar fire that killed at least 40 people during a New Year's party, officials said today. Swiss prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible criminal responsibility. • Families wait for news of loved ones: Multiple people are missing, including a teenager who was celebrating the new year with friends. Authorities say identifying those killed could “take several days.” Around 119 people from nine European countries were injured in the blaze in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. • Chaotic scenes: New videos showed terror and chaos as the fire broke out inside the tightly packed bar and people rushed to escape. Laetitia Brodard-Sitre's son, Arthur, texted, “Happy New Year, Mum, I love you,” just after midnight on New Year's Day — and she hasn't heard from him since, she told Reuters today. Standing near the scene of the tragic Switzerland resort bar fire, she told the news agency her son was going to celebrate turning 17 and had “reserved a big table with his friends. Many of the victims have severe burns and remain unidentified. “But while waiting for that, I am here. The owners were interviewed not as suspects but to gather information, the canton's attorney general Beatrice Pilloud said, adding that investigators have not yet identified any criminal responsibility. Le Constellation is owned by a French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, according to the Commercial Register of Central Valais. Records also show a bar-restaurant in Crans-Montana named Le Senso and a traditional restaurant offering Corsican and Swiss dishes named Le Vieux Chalet in nearby Lens are owned by a couple named Jacques and Jessica Anne Jeanne Moretti. Investigators are examining whether Le Constellation complied with fire regulations and looking at access to fire escapes and fire extinguishers as well as the number of people present at the bar, according to Pilloud. “There will also be a consideration whether or not, under such circumstances, any individuals have potential criminal responsibility. If such is the case, and if these individuals are still alive, then a file and an investigation will be opened for homicide through negligence, causing fire through negligence, and bodily harm through negligence,” Pilloud said. Eight French citizens are still unaccounted for in the aftermath of the deadly fire in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said today. “At this stage, we know that 14 French nationals have been injured and are being cared for,” Barrot said in a post on social media. “Eight of our citizens have not yet been located.” Barrot urged against public “speculation” regarding the condition or whereabouts of fire victims until officials provide more information. The minister added that eleven victims would arrive at hospitals in France “by this evening,” including three Swiss citizens. “Needs will be reassessed on a daily basis, and we will continue to assist our neighbors for as long as necessary.” Le Constellation bar in Switzerland's Crans-Montana ski resort had a fire exit but most people inside the venue would have struggled to find it after fire broke out, a regional security chief said as he answered questions regarding the building's inspection during a press conference Friday. “It seems that most people try to leave through the main exit, but this public place also had a fire exit,” Valais security director Stéphane Ganzer told journalists. He continued, “But as you can understand, when there is an instance of flashover where you have so much smoke that it's impossible to see to move, the majority of people, one would imagine, failed to find the fire exit.” She added, “As things stand today, given we have only had a few hours of the investigation in place, I can't tell you whether or not it has been installed with or without regulation.” Out of those 55 injured people, “13 have been able to go home, which is some good news,” Eric Bonvin, general director of the regional Valais Romand hospital, said in a news conference Friday. Seven are currently being treated by the surgery services. Meanwhile, 28 people who were initially treated there have been transferred to other hospitals in Switzerland or abroad. Authorities have cautioned that the figures may evolve, because the figures relate to individuals who have been formally identified. Images widely circulating online from the New Year's blaze show bar staff in motorcycle helmets perched on others' shoulders, holding champagne bottles with sparklers amid a tightly packed crowd inside Le Constellation. The sparklers appear to have ignited what experts believe is acoustic paneling – material used to improve sound quality and a potential fire hazard that one independent fire consultant described as “plastic petrol.” Swiss Chief Prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said in a news conference Friday that all evidence pointed to the sparklers causing the fire. The deadly fire at a ski resort bar in Switzerland was likely caused by sparklers in a champagne bottle that came too close to the ceiling, chief prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud told journalists. “As things stand, everything points to the fire starting from sparklers or flares placed in champagne bottles that came too close to the ceiling, which very rapidly led to a flashover fire.” Of those injured, 71 are Swiss nationals, police chief Frederic Gisler said at a news conference on Friday. A further 14 of the patients being treated have not yet had their nationality confirmed, Gisler added. Around 50 patients injured in the ski resort fire have been or will be transferred to hospitals in other European countries for specialist treatment, Chief of Health Department of State Council Mathias Reynard told journalists on Friday. “Around 50 injured were transported or will be transported to European countries to specialized centers for burn victims,” he said. He added that there had been communications with France's health minister, and that patient transfers “have already begun to French hospitals.” Swiss health authorities had also received an “offer of help to take care of injured patients,” from Italy, with patients to be transferred to the north of Italy, Reynard said. A ceremony to grieve the victims of the ski resort fire in Switzerland will be held in Crans-Montana on January 9, a Swiss health chief has said. Chief of Health Department of State Council, Mathias Reynard, said this will be an opportunity for the community to “come together and grieve together.” “I didn't see the fire, but I saw all the bodies on the streets … They were with white sheets over them, these people were dead already, and then you saw the young people, because it's all young people,” Edmund Coquette told CNN-affiliate RTL Germany, in Crans-Montana, on Friday. It always has been like that,” he added. In a post on X, Ignazio Cassis wrote, “We are deeply grateful for the strong support and assistance provided by our neighbouring countries, as well as for the many messages of solidarity from the international community, as response efforts continue and families await news of their loved ones.” Earlier today, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said that cooperation with Swiss authorities had been “very positive.” A cafe offering coffee and pastries during the day, Le Constellation has two bars and a dedicated shisha smoking area, according to the website. Police said earlier the fire broke out around 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Day. One of Switzerland's most exclusive locales, Crans-Montana is famed for its year-round sunshine, which it owes to its position on a south-facing plateau in the Rhone Valley. The area – 1,500 meters above sea level – has sweeping Alpine vistas stretching from the Matterhorn to Mont Blanc, one of Europe's highest peaks. Tourists are drawn to its understated glamor, with high-end shopping and fine dining as well as extensive ski slopes and a lively apres-ski scene. Crans-Montana also has a lengthy history as an important stop on the professional skiing circuit. Crans-Montana is also a prominent fixture in the annual alpine skiing World Cup for both men and women. Inside, a trickle of activity as authorities continue their investigations, outside the bustle of the world's media and a steady stream of locals and tourists passing by in ones and twos to lay flowers or just take a moment at the site of this village's most tragic night. One couple vacationing from Dijon, France, stood quietly in the street, eyes wet with emotion, their prayers rolling off their lips. Minutes later, tears streamed down the face of one man, as he fell to his knees meters from the spot where his son may still lie. After more than a day without news, he was drawn back to the bar, chasing any hint of the fate of his son, his brother told CNN. The use of fireworks inside Le Constellation ski resort bar in Crans-Montana, though small-calibre, was irresponsible, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told journalists on Friday. “Certainly the use of fireworks, even though small-caliber ones, in a place like this seems to be a an irresponsible choice,” he said at a news conference, adding that he had been informed by the public prosecutor that dozens of interrogations have been taking place to determine responsibility for the deadly fire that broke out in the early hours of New Year's Day. “We need to seek the truth, but first of all, we need to save human lives, and at the same time, we need to understand who is responsible for all this and who who is managing this establishment,” Tajani said. He added that cooperation with Swiss authorities had been “very positive.” Witnesses have reported that the fire was caused by sparklers placed in champagne bottles. New videos show terror and chaos as a fire broke out Thursday inside Le Constellation bar, which was packed with people celebrating New Year in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana. Thick smoke billows out as the window opens. Shouts fill the bar as people can seen panicking and pulling themselves out of windows, while others pile down a set of stairs toward the street outside. Multiple people can be seen lying motionless on the ground outside the bar in a fourth video, as bystanders attend to them. It appears by this point that emergency crews have arrived on scene as blue flashing lights can be seen in the footage. One person can be seen on the ground covered in blankets, others are sitting down around them inside a building. Fresh details are starting to emerge about the victims of the deadly New Year's Day blaze in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, as condolences continue to roll in. Meanwhile, a 19-year-old trainee soccer player from French club FC Metz has suffered burns to 30% of his body, his agent said. Fire experts weigh in: Fire expert Glenn Corbett told CNN that confusion can affect people's escape from burning buildings and pointed to a study of the deadly 2003 Rhode Island club fire, which showed that escaping in under two minutes was crucial to survival. Stephen MacKenzie said the tiles were a “known issue” when it comes to fire safety. Medical response: More than a dozen beds have been made available in French hospitals for severe burn victims, the French health minister said. Five victims have so far been hospitalized at the Geneva University Hospitals in Switzerland. Families hit by grief and hope: A mother has described the agonizing 30-hour wait for news regarding her missing son Arthur, who attended the New Year's party. The mother said she had searched several hospitals, and of the 10 other people her son was celebrating with, only one person has been accounted for. “There are still three injured that have not been identified, and they might be Italian,” Tajani said to reporters on his arrival to the Swiss resort, adding that six Italians remain missing and 13 of those injured are Italian. “This is the data we have, the Swiss have less data because until they have certified the identities, they cannot and do not want to release numbers,” he added. He added that the Italian Civil Protection has sent a helicopter to Switzerland with medical staff and will be sending more doctors to support the emergency response effort.</p>

Racketeering charges against 61 people indicted as co-conspirators in the Stop Cop City movement were dismissed on December 30, marking a significant victory for those facing prosecution in the years after the movement's peak. The dismissal comes after more than two years of attempted prosecution that sought to convict protesters who opposed Atlanta's sprawling police training facility, known as Cop City, as an organized criminal enterprise. The original indictment was brought in 2023 and targeted dozens of people that the state described a vast and coordinated criminal group that opposed not only Cop City but police and the government as a whole. In the years since, activists and organizers have faced uncertainty as the state has delayed trials, changed prosecution tactics and made procedural missteps. But Tuesday's news came as a breath of fresh air for those facing charges. “When we got the oral decision in September we celebrated, we were so relieved and so happy,” Xavier de Janon, a lawyer representing former RICO defendant Jamie Marsicano and member of the People's Law Collective, told Unicorn Riot. “When we got the written order yesterday it was like reliving those moments.” Under Georgia law, the attorney general can only pursue RICO charges like the ones brought against Cop City opponents in matters of people or groups “dealing with or for the state.” At the September hearing prosecuting attorney Chris Carr argued that the protesters were, in fact, “dealing with the state” as a result of their activity towards state employees and property. It argues that any time the state is an alleged victim of a crime, the definition of “deal with” is satisfied. Accordingly, Farmer did not accept Carr's argument that Cop City opponents were dealing with the state, and warned that such an interpretation could lead to overly zealous prosecutions in the future. In September lawyers argued that the same language appears in the state's arson laws and that those charges, which appear in the same indictment, should be thrown out too. Farmer agreed that the arson charges were likely brought in error along the same lines as the RICO charges, but didn't issue a decision in his written order. “The RICO has been dismissed, we'll see what happens next week,” de Janon said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sales at Elon Musk's company slump after Donald Trump's withdrawal of EV subsidies Electric car sales have continued to grow in the past two years, but the rate of growth has been slower than expected. Electric carmakers have been forced to cut prices aggressively, and governments around the world have rolled back targets on the shift away from petrol. The US president has also removed emissions regulations that incentivised electric car production. An average compiled by Bloomberg had suggested that Tesla would deliver 441,000 vehicles during the quarter, but Tesla took the unusual step before the new year of publishing its own consensus estimate for the first time, apparently in an effort to guide investors that sales were expected to be lower. Trump's anti-EV policies came despite Musk donating more money than anyone else to the victorious 2024 presidential election campaign and briefly running an effort to cut government costs. It was the second consecutive decline in annual sales for Tesla. Yet even as sales have fallen it remains by far the world's most valuable carmaker, with shares valued at $1.4tn – more than the next 30 carmakers combined. Musk has consistently claimed that autonomous capabilities will set Tesla apart from rivals, and it has started operating a limited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. However, it will still face competition on that front. Several Chinese carmakers and tech companies already have comparable technology, including an offering from BYD called “God's Eye” that is now included even on its cheapest cars. BYD's electric car sales rose by 28% during the year despite a weaker performance in December. Its business already produced more cars overall than Tesla when counting hybrids. The Shenzhen-headquartered manufacturer has overtaken Tesla during single quarters before. However, its battery electric production pulled away from its US rival in 2025, even as it faced intense competition from Chinese rivals. That came despite an uptick in sales of plug-in hybrids, combining a smaller battery with a petrol or diesel engine, in some markets from consumers worried about their ability to charge. BYD also more than doubled its sales of commercial vehicles, including electric buses and lorries, to 57,000.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once host to a poisonous gas research facility, Okunoshima is now an Instagram-friendly tourist destination A single rabbit scampers out, wholly untroubled by its two-legged visitors. A short walk along the coast takes visitors deep into rabbit territory on Okunoshima, one of 3,000 islands in Japan's Seto Inland Sea. Half a dozen of the animals chase away another as it attempts to join them in a communal meal of Chinese cabbage. The scene unfolds in front of smiling, camera-toting tourists barely able to believe their proximity to Okunoshima's fabled – but troubled – furry residents. The rabbits are dependent on visitors and volunteers for food. For all its natural beauty and popularity as a tourist destination, Okunoshima – uninhabited except for staff working at the solitary hotel and its guests – faces an uncertain future, and so do its four-legged inhabitants. In the early 1970s, a nearby elementary school released a small number of rabbits on the abandoned island, hoping they would bring it back to life. In 2024, nearly 200,000 people visited Okunoshima, drawn by its eminently Instagram-friendly coastline and the promise of entering a rabbit paradise. An interest in wartime history first brought Koji Yamamoto to Okunoshima five years ago. But it is the rabbits that keep him coming back. “This is my 30th time here,” the retiree says as he watches grey rabbits gratefully devour the pellets he has put out for them. “There isn't much natural vegetation, so I thought it would be a good idea to come regularly and feed them, especially during the winter when there aren't many tourists.” Experts have not ruled out a genetic link between the rabbits experimented on in wartime and those that roam Okunoshima today. “Even if an individual rabbit survived [the wartime experiments] it would have been very difficult to continue its lineage. But I can't say 100% no, and it's a story that people like to believe could be true.” Kaneko's study of hundreds of droppings revealed that the rabbits have diverse DNA characteristics, suggesting that animals have been left on the island on multiple occasions, possibly by people hoping to give unwanted pets a new home. Unable to compete with larger animals for dwindling crops of natural food, the rabbits are now entirely dependent on visitors and volunteers for sustenance, according to Kaneko. “They depend on people for food, and that's not good. “The rabbits look happy enough in social media posts, but they have an increasingly precarious existence.” Yamamoto will not leave his spot until the rabbits have eaten every last morsel. “You have to stay with them until they've finished, otherwise other animals come and help themselves,” he says. Last year, their chief tormentor was Ryu Hotta, a 25-year-old who was given a suspended prison sentence after being found guilty of abusing multiple rabbits by kicking them or inserting scissor blades in their mouths. Media reports said the carcasses of 77 rabbits were discovered on Okunoshima between November 2024 and January last year, although it was not clear how many had died as a result of abuse. “About 85% of people who visit Okunoshima come to see the rabbits and give this place a miss,” says Kazuhito Takashima, who manages the Poison Gas Museum, where exhibits include uniforms worn by plant workers and photos of the disfigurements they suffered after exposure to dangerous chemicals. “Most Japanese people have no idea about the poisonous gas facilities … we didn't learn about this kind of thing at school.” Its connection with poisonous gas ended 80 years ago, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have problems … they are just of a different kind.”</p>

Electricity bills for millions of utility customers are skyrocketing across the U.S. while the number of households facing extreme utility debt is mounting. Overseeing all this is a powerful regime of investor-owned utilities that dominate our energy system. These for-profit corporations own and control the basic infrastructure we all depend on. Their executives and shareholders profit by raising electric rates or skimping on maintenance. And now, private equity firms are gunning for utilities. But over the past few years, a vibrant movement for public power has emerged and grown. Public utilities in the U.S. are not new, and recent campaigns — from Tucson to Milwaukee, from San Diego to Ann Arbor — seek to expand and improve on this precedent, creating a truly democratic public utility system that serves human needs over profits. A notable victory for public power came with the 2023 passage of New York's Build Public Renewables Act, and a campaign for public power in New York's Hudson Valley has been gaining momentum. Lee Ziesche is a climate justice organizer, co-chair of the Tucson Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), and a core organizer in Tucson's public power campaign. Matt Sehrsweeney is a climate justice organizer and Metro DC DSA member who co-chairs We Power DC, Washington, D.C.'s campaign for public power. This roundtable has been lightly edited for length and clarity. IOUs are obligated to maximize their profits for their shareholders, which usually means raising rates as high as possible. If we want to address the climate crisis at the speed that is necessary, we need utilities that are responsive to climate goals. It's hard to imagine modern life without electricity. Given this, it's quite odd that the financial sector and shareholders have so much power over our electricity. In the U.S., about three out of four power customers are served by an investor-owned utility. These private monopolies prioritize profits, which is antithetical to high quality, affordable, and clean electric service. Publicly owned utilities are focused on high quality, affordable, and sustainable electricity. Public power also offers community control over things like rate design and infrastructure siting and ways to get to net zero. Public power offers the promise of bringing a more systemic, holistic approach to decarbonization. Why is public power a core struggle for the left specifically? Lee Ziesche: Public power is a way to actually improve the lives of working-class people. This is a chance to show people that socialism can work. We've talked to many people who aren't socialists but whose bills are so high that they're ready to support a socialist solution. People need electricity to survive, especially in places like Tucson, where we have extreme heat. Sehrsweeney: These campaigns also represent an attempt to expand small-d democracy in our everyday lives. It's about enhancing local democratic control over everyday institutions that provide basic public services. What are some important lessons you've learned from campaigning for public power? Sehrsweeney: Harnessing peoples' latent anger against utilities is crucial. People are fed up with rising electricity bills. Capitalizing on that anger has been a key part of our campaign. “It's not a natural fact of life that our bills have to go way up. Our government should be intervening to prevent these rate hikes.” Politicizing rate hikes has been an entry point for getting people involved. It's not a natural fact of life that our bills have to go way up. Our government should be intervening to prevent these rate hikes. We've pressed regulators and politicians to do their job. Rate hikes have been an important organizing site for us. Tucson Electric Power (TEP) filed for another rate hike this summer, so we put up posters around town featuring a grim reaper that say “Will you survive another TEP rate hike?” You should also be ready to make politicians a little uncomfortable. You have to build the power to challenge them and, if necessary, primary politicians who aren't on board. DSA chapters waged multiple primary challenges across New York State, and we've done the same here in Tucson. Our politicians often have cozy relationships with these powerful utilities. The public power campaign in New York was really impressive. Ziesche: We built a huge statewide coalition that reflected all of New York to win the Build Public Renewables Act. A lot of the organizing originated from DSA chapters, and we got environmental justice groups and labor on board. Thousands of people did things like submitting comments or calling the governor when we needed it. We made gigantic Venmo boards showing the donations that elected officials received from utilities or fossil fuel companies. Sehrsweeney: In D.C., the parts of the city hardest hit by rising electricity prices and energy shut offs are predominantly Black, poor and working-class wards. Over 50 percent of Pepco's low-income customers are in utility debt. The folks most likely to be evicted are also the folks most likely to face energy shut offs. Ziesche: Our public power campaign in Tucson merged this summer with a fight against a massive Amazon data center. We know that Amazon Web Services works with Palantir to target immigrants. [Note: Since this interview was conducted, Amazon pulled out of the data center project, though developers are still trying to advance it.] We've also done multiple events with the Tucson Tenants Union. Overall, we're trying to approach our organizing more like a tenants union. How do we actually build enough power together as customers? If TEP won't sell us back our grid at a fair price, maybe the people of Tucson can go on a bill strike and collectively stop paying our bills. What about public power campaigns and the labor movement? Most unionized workers in the power sector are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which tends to have a more conservative outlook that doesn't necessarily embrace alternative forms of ownership. But I think these challenges can be overcome. Investor-owned utilities are under shareholder pressure to increase profits through rate hikes and cutting costs. This will become more acute as private equity enters the utility industry on a large scale. The good wages and benefits that many power industry workers have long enjoyed are poised to change. There's an opportunity for public power campaigners to make the case to unions that public ownership shouldn't be seen as a threat. Public power can actually be a way of maintaining and even improving the standards for workers and their unions. Ziesche: In New York, getting labor, especially the IBEW, to a neutral position was important, and they actually now support building renewable public energy. Sehrsweeney: The goal of public power can also feel unattainably large. So you need to break things down into steps toward long-term goals. Figuring out how to translate these wonky issues into something that people can understand is also important. We recently produced a white paper report on municipalization in D.C. that goes through how Pepco has failed people and has recommendations on how a public utility would be better. This study built our credibility and made legislators take us more seriously. It's also a challenge to get taken seriously when you're first starting out. Public power seems like a radical thing to some people. But this is actually the common sense solution. Vaheesan: The resource issue is a major obstacle to successful public power efforts, which entail taking on some of the most powerful corporate interests. On one side, you have investor-owned utilities with tens of millions of dollars to spend against municipalization, and on the other side you have a small group of hard working, dedicated volunteers who are also badly outgunned. Also, power systems are complex and highly technical. We need to hammer home that public utilities are a well-established institutional form. Around 54 million people in the U.S. get their electricity from publicly owned utilities. It's a proven model, and we need to keep repeating that. What's making you feel hopeful or optimistic right now? Sehrsweeney: At a time when the federal landscape for climate policy is so bleak, it makes sense for organizers to focus locally. Vaheesan: I feel a renewed sense of possibility because of what's happening in places like D.C. and Tucson and the mid-Hudson Valley. After many decades, public power is on the agenda again. This is a real moment of opportunity to push for public power at the state and local level and to lay the groundwork for eventual federal support. The energy affordability issue is not going away. If we're serious about energy justice and affordable rates, building public power is really the only way forward. Public power used to be the stuff of popular politics. If we do the organizing, advocacy, and public education now, we could be in a good position in three to five years to push for a major expansion of public power again. Those conversations give me a lot of hope. Also, those of us waging different public power fights are getting connected nationally as a movement. There's a new organization, Public Grids, that's bringing people together. It's incredibly hard to take on a gigantic corporation, but together we're showing that the entire system across this country is not working. Your one-time gift today will be matched immediately.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With global EV sales rising 28 per cent last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival. The annual deliveries figure raises ‍questions ​about whether Tesla can stabilize its core auto business following two consecutive years of sales declines, even as it pivots to futuristic projects such as robotics and self-driving cars to justify its steep valuation. “I ‌think the market remains focused ‍on the robotaxi business, where Tesla is testing its Cybercab in Austin," said Seth Goldstein, senior ‍equity research analyst at Morningstar. Tesla's fourth-quarter ‌figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by ⁠a rush to lock in U.S. EV tax credits before they expired ​at the end of September, followed by a sharper slowdown as incentives rolled off. Tesla said it ⁠delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October–December quarter, down from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles or a 12.3 per cent drop, according to Visible Alpha. ‌Analysts polled by Visible Alpha ‍had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles, marking ‍the company's second consecutive annual decline. BYD said ​sales outside of China climbed to a record one million vehicles in 2025, up about 150 per cent from 2024. The company has said it aims to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target. Tesla in October launched stripped-down “standard” versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about US$5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options. Even as ‌vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4 per cent in 2025, boosting Musk's wealth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kirill Budanov, chief of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence (designated in Russia as a terrorist and extremist), has accepted Vladimir Zelensky's offer to lead his office, as Budanov himself said. I continue to serve Ukraine," he wrote on Telegram. Dmitry Litvin, Zelensky's communications adviser, said earlier that formal procedures regarding Budanov's appointment had already begun. On November 10, Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) announced Operation Midas to uncover a major corruption scheme in the energy sector. Timur Mindich, a businessman and Vladimir Zelensky's friend, was dubbed the coordinator of the criminal scheme. The offices of Mindich, Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later dismissed from office, and the Energoatom company were searched. According to investigators, those involved in the criminal scheme laundered at least $100 million. On November 11, NABU filed the first charges, including Mindich as the head of a criminal organization, as well as former Deputy Prime Minister and ex-Minister of National Unity Alexey Chernyshov, a close ally of Zelensky. On November 17, reports indicated that head of Zelensky's office Andrey Yermak might also appear in the Mindich case files under the pseudonym Ali Baba. His apartment was searched on November 28, and Zelensky fired him later that day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Igor Pomerantsev, a veteran radio broadcaster, poet, and former Soviet dissident, during Meridian Czernowitz 2021 in Chernivtsi, Ukraine, in September 2021. This is why, in a world where authoritarianism appears to be on the rise, a free press is more important than ever. Few understand this reality better than Igor Pomerantsev, a veteran radio broadcaster, poet, and former Soviet dissident. Having spent decades working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) and the BBC after being exiled from the Soviet Union, he has witnessed firsthand how authoritarian regimes attempt to control narratives and silence dissent. He reflected on his own path to dissent in the Soviet era, why he describes the Russian state as a “cult of death,” and the lessons today's dissidents must learn as authoritarianism gains ground worldwide. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. I remember back in Munich, during the administration of (former U.S. President Bill) Clinton, our budget was drastically cut. We were essentially like refugees, forced to leave Munich for Prague — where (then Czech) President (Vaclav) Havel generously offered us a building (to continue working in), practically for free, for just one crown. The next attempt to suffocate us came under (former U.S.) President (Barack) Obama in 2016, when we were cut off from shortwave broadcasting. For decades, people across the former Soviet Union had relied on us through shortwave radio. There was a silver lining to this transition, but ideally, we should have been able to maintain shortwave while also expanding into new formats. And so, you see, this depriving us of oxygen has been happening for a long time. Now, however, we are simply being shut down outright. But among our listeners were many decision-makers. Some have criticized us for not reaching a “broad enough” audience, but we were never meant to be a pop music station. Yes, mass audiences often prefer simpler content, but that was never our mission. You were labeled by the Soviet authorities as a “dissident.” For those of our audience who are unaware of your background, could you just talk about how that came to be? Igor Pomerantsev: I think I first became a dissident when, during an interrogation by the KGB, they told me: “You are a dissident.” Before that, it had never occurred to me to think of myself that way. In a normal situation, you don't wake up one day and declare, “I am a splinter” — you simply live in your country as one among millions. My initial reaction was, of course, completely negative. I didn't want to be a splinter, an outcast. Take, for example, the great Ukrainian literary critic and poet Ivan Svitlychny. Poems like his can seem almost iconoclastic, but in their depth, they were political as well. In my case, I didn't choose it. I was labeled, stamped as a dissident. People sometimes refer to the “dissident movement,” but in reality, it was not a movement at all. First, I couldn't accept the existence of political prisoners in my own country. Most people in the Soviet Union didn't care — they were too focused on their own lives. I knew that two camps, in Mordovia and the Perm region, were filled with political prisoners. You'd turn on the television, and it was nothing but lies — a personal insult, really. At university, you were forced to sit through absurd lectures on “The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.” Most people ignored it, but some were more sensitive to it. Some couldn't just let it wash over them. At that time, in the 70s, Ukraine had about 3.5 million Communist Party members — mostly adult men. Some were active, some were passive, but the fact remained: if you were a party member, you couldn't just dismiss it as a passive act. Their conformity wasn't just personal — it shaped the entire society. From childhood, people were already being brainwashed through school, universities, propaganda, media — everything. Instinctively, we all needed to survive — not just physically, but existentially, intellectually, spiritually. I was a young writer, just starting out, and for me, reading all kinds of literature was essential. That was my first step toward becoming a dissident. And for me, as a writer, books were my life. They tried to suffocate my existence by accusing me of reading and spreading so-called anti-Soviet literature. It kept me intellectually and mentally intact. There were different kinds of dissidents — nationalist, patriotic, democratic. I would describe myself, and a small circle of my friends, as something else entirely. We were like characters from Albert Camus, the French philosopher who championed responsible individualism. That's the whole point — to stand apart. In my own circles, there were also the so-called “bourgeois nationalists” — a ridiculous term in the Soviet Union, where there was no actual bourgeoisie. And through Samizdat, I learned that in Leningrad, there were even Russian fascists who considered themselves dissidents. But for me, it was about something else. Later, I wrote an essay called “The Right to Read” that was published in the Partisan Review. As a young writer, what mattered most was having access to books — whether I loved them or hated them. The choice had to be mine, not dictated by men with pistols. That's how my real conflict in Kyiv began. Though, in fact, the first one happened earlier, at Chernivtsi University, where I was a student. I was lucky enough to get my hands on a policy document from the Czechoslovak Communist Party — at the time, a surprisingly liberal text. Not only that, but it had been published in Ukrainian, since Rusyns in Slovakia read Ukrainian. That's what led to my first interrogation. Every Soviet university had a so-called “special department” staffed with two or three KGB agents. That's how I got to know them personally. Igor Pomerantsev: As a writer, I'll speak about literature, not politics, because that's where my expertise lies. Even then, writers were among the first victims of Russian censorship. Take, for instance, the journalist and satirist (Nikolai) Novikov — he was arrested and tried for his magazine. Many of Russia's most important literary figures, even the classics, found themselves in some way victimized by their confrontation with the state. But the state, built on death and fear, instinctively rejects literature's free spirit. While some might see him as problematic today, he was sentenced to death. Even (Ivan) Turgenev, a respected figure who preferred to live in France and Germany, faced repercussions. I could name many more writers, but the point remains: If you weren't a complete conformist — if you were creative and free — you were in some way discriminated against or repressed. I'm speaking about literature here, while political scientists would focus on history. But when I think about the Russian state, I see that it is grounded in a cult of death. Some cultures are built around death, even if not exclusively. For example, the Aztecs had a culture of sacrifice, with blood flowing daily through their empire. This wasn't simply a primitive thirst for death; it had its rituals, heroes, and monuments. The Kyiv Independent: It seems we live in a world where authoritarianism is once again on the rise. Igor Pomerantsev: There was a classic Samizdat pamphlet in the Soviet Union that gave specific instructions on how to behave during an interrogation. For example, it taught you how to handle questions from interrogators that were outside the official law or codex. Some of the details were quite valuable. And if they mentioned someone like Ivanov so-and-so, you could respond by asking, "I know many Ivanovs, could you show me a photo of him?" There were all sorts of little tricks to help navigate the situation. But there's also a certain kind of "prison wisdom." So, when you ask me what kind of lessons I can share from my dissident past, they are very practical ones. Any individual of a certain integrity must simply keep reading, be curious about the world, and think for themselves — it is that simple.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Firefighters lay flowers on Friday near the sealed-off Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, where a devastating fire ripped through a ski resort bar during New Year's celebrations.Baz Ratner/The Associated Press Initial investigations ‍suggest that the fire that tore ​through a New Year's Eve party at a bar in the Swiss resort town of Crans-Montana began when ‘fountain candles' attached ⁠to champagne bottles were carried aloft too close to ‌the ‍ceiling, the local ‍prosecutor said on ‌Friday. Swiss police confirmed that about 40 people died in the blaze at Le Constellation and 115 were injured. On Friday morning, the first victim was identified as a rising Italian golfer named Emanuele Galeppini, 16. The blaze turned Le Constellation into an inferno about 90 minutes after midnight on New Year's Eve. A photo circulated on X showed a small patch of flames forming directly above outstretched arms carrying bottles with sparklers inserted in them. A video that appears to be taken moments later shows a young man trying to beat back the spreading flames on the ceiling with a white jacket or T-shirt as loud music played. Subsequent video clips and photos show panic and chaos, as revelers tried to escape through a single staircase, described by those at the bar as “narrow,” and made it upstairs, pouring or plunging onto the street. The skin on her bare shoulders and arms was red. Contains disturbing content: Eyewitness video shows a fire taking hold in the ceiling at Le Constellation bar at Crans-Montana, Switzerland on New Year's Eve. During a press conference on Thursday afternoon, local attorney-general  Ms. Pilloud had said investigators were examining whether a “flashover” – the sudden ignition of combustible material – triggered an explosion. “There are a lot of circumstances to clarify, several hypotheses were put forward,” she said at the time. Firefighters describe a flashover – also known as rapid fire progress – as the moment when a localized burn suddenly envelopes an entire enclosed space as heat radiation raises temperatures quickly and flammable gases ignite. At that point, almost everything in the room is burning. People comfort each other outside the Le Constellation bar on Friday. “All this work needs to be done because the information is so terrible and sensitive that nothing can be told to families unless we are 100-per-cent sure,” said Mathias Reynard, head of government for the Valais canton. About 40 killed, 115 injured in fire at Swiss ski resort bar during New Year's celebration, police say Swiss emergency services mobilized 42 ambulances, 13 helicopters and 150 medical staff to deal with the crisis. Some of the victims were flown to hospitals in Italy and other countries because the Valois hospitals were overwhelmed or not equipped to treat severe-burn victims. By Thursday evening, mourners had left mounds of flowers and tributes near Le Constellation to remember the victims. The lounge had a capacity of 300, according to the Crans-Montana website, and videos and photos made it appear that it was packed. It attracts wealthy, international visitors, many from Italy and France. Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, said on Thursday that six Italians were missing and 13 were in hospital being treated for burns. Global Affairs Canada on Thursday said it was not aware of any Canadian victims. People bring flowers and letters near the Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on Friday.Antonio Calanni/The Associated Press One of them, Axel Clavier, 16, told reporters that there was “total chaos” inside the bar and that one of his friends died. He did not see the fire start, he said, but remembers seeing waitresses enter the room with sparklers stuffed into champagne bottles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Volodymyr Zelensky has offered Kyrylo Budanov, the military intelligence chief, to take charge of the President's Office on Jan. 2. "Now, Ukraine needs more focus on security issues, the development of the Defense and Security Forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track in negotiations, and the President's Office will serve primarily to fulfill such tasks," Zelensky said. "For me, it is an honor and a responsibility to focus on critically important issues of the strategic security of our state at a historic time for Ukraine," he said. The move follows a major reshuffle that saw the dismissal of Andriy Yermak, Zelensky's long-time chief of staff, in late November. The change occurred amid Ukraine's largest corruption scandal, signaling a shift in leadership dynamics. Lieutenant General Budanov, 39, has led Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) since 2020. Under his leadership, HUR has evolved into a formidable force during Russia's full-scale invasion. Under Budanov, the Military Intelligence conducted operations within Russia and the Ukrainian territories Moscow holds, operated drone units responsible for hitting targets over 1,000 kilometers away, and coordinated the International Legion and a number of other brigades fighting at the front. A lawmaker from Zelensky's Servant of the People party, who spoke with the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity, believes that Budanov's appointment may signal that the widely discussed peace plan will not yield results given the Russian stance. "We need to prepare for a long, exhausting struggle. Lawmakers and experts argue that it's not as important who becomes the new head of the President's Office, but its future influence. Lawmakers from the president's party who spoke with the Kyiv Independent approved Zelensky's choice, yet questioning why Budanov agreed to take on this role. Although Budanov has never announced plans to pursue a political career, he is regularly featured in opinion polls and ranks among the top presidential contenders, behind only Zelensky and Ukraine's Ambassador to the U.K. Valerii Zaluzhny. According to a recent poll conducted by Socis, Budanov would secure 5.7% in the first round. In a hypothetical runoff between Zelensky and Budanov, the latter one would defeat Zelensky with 56% of the vote against 44%. "It all depends on how Budanov will position himself going forward — whether he will be willing, once he moves into the cabinet, to let go of his political ambitions," he told the Kyiv Independent. "Right now, serious changes and reforms are needed. If the president doesn't understand this, then Budanov's role will be reduced to becoming the second Yermak."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 6 in 10 say they share a lot of common interests and concerns with other people of their generation, according to a late-summer CNN survey. “My generation is one of the first ones looking at an economy that will be worse for us than for our parents,” said Gabriel, a 21-year-old college senior from California who participated in the survey and said he felt a strong political connection to others his age. It's not just young Americans who feel that way: most in every age group think they have a lot in common with their generation. In fact, those 65 and older are actually 10 points likelier than adults younger than 35 to say that their generation is politically relevant to them. Americans' attachment to their respective generations, however, doesn't exist in a vacuum. About 1 in 5 Americans said they felt politically connected across all three sets of demographics tested in the survey – generation, gender and race – with nearly half (46%) saying they felt politically connected to others across more than one demographic. “Everyone identifies with a ton of different social groups at different times – throughout the day, even,” said Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona who studies political identity. People's connection to some facet of their political identity is often strongest when that aspect is under threat, research has found. But sharing a generation doesn't mean agreeing politically or even agreeing on whether those generational ties are important. Partisanship also plays a major role: In CNN's poll, that sense of connectedness is weaker among Americans whose partisan views diverge from the positions most common in their group. Adults younger than 35 who feel a strong sense of generational connection, for instance, are mostly Democrats or Democratic-leaning, and more than half said they were angry about President Donald Trump's policies and frustrated by politics more broadly. By contrast, those older than 65 who felt a generational connection were far more Republican than those who didn't. But women who feel a sense of gender solidarity are far more Democratic-leaning than those who don't; while the pattern is reversed  among men. Those White Americans who do say they share political connections with others of their race are largely GOP-aligned – 63% belong to or lean toward the GOP – while most Black and Latino Americans who feel a sense of racial connection are aligned with the Democratic Party. A few other differences by political connection emerge in the survey. Both younger and older Americans who felt connected to their generations, though, were more likely than those who didn't to say that they could think of a political figure who spoke for people like them. For people of color, that pattern is reversed. While far fewer people of color see diversity as threatening, it's a view more commonly held by those who don't feel a connection by race (28%) than it is by those who do (13%). Some Americans, meanwhile, may not feel that any aspect of their own background matters much politically at all: About one-quarter said they didn't feel politically connected to others along any of the three factors we asked about in the poll. That sense of disconnect was particularly prevalent among those who are also disconnected from politics in other ways: “true” political independents who don't lean toward either party,  and people who said they didn't pay attention to politics at all.</p>

TEHRAN, January 2. /TASS/. The US interference in Iran's internal affairs is tantamount to destabilizing the entire Middle East and will lead to the crushing of Washington's interests in the region, Iranian Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani said in response to US President Donald Trump's threats to support protesters in the country.

"We consider the positions of the protesting merchants separate from those of the destructive elements, and Trump should know that American interference in this internal issue is equivalent to chaos across the entire region and the destruction of American interests," the Iranian security official wrote on his account in the X social media platform.

Trump wrote earlier on January 2 on his Truth Social media platform that "If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue."

Larijani said that this post made clear who was the instigator and tried to destabilize the situation in Iran.

"The American people should know that was Trump who started the adventurism. They should look after their soldiers," the Iranian security official said.

On December 29, protests by merchants started in the center of Tehran due to a plunge in the Iranian national currency. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian instructed the interior minister to build a dialogue with the protesters and also announced reforms in the country's banking and financial sectors.</p>

"According to operational reconnaissance data, the Kiev regime deployed Birds of Madyar militants to the right bank of the Kherson Region. These are what we can call terrorists - drone operators. Considering the special cynicism and cruelty of the terrorist attack in Khorly and a strike on a car in Tarasovka that killed a child, precisely the Madyar unit can be the direct perpetrator of this crime," the governor said. The Kherson Region governor said on January 1 that the Ukrainian military had launched a targeted drone strike on a cafe and hotel situated on the Black Sea coast in Khorly where civilians had gathered to celebrate the New Year. One drone carried an incendiary mixture that caused a fire in the caf·. According to the Russian Investigative Committee's data, at least 100 civilians were inside the caf· together with the staff at the time of the strike. The attack killed 27 people, including two minors. Thirty-one people, among them five children, were taken to medical institutions with injuries of various severity. Investigators have launched a criminal probe on counts of a terrorist attack.</p>
