                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Oscar-shortlisted live-action short film A Friend of Dorothy has dropped on Disney+. Their friendship starts when his football lands in her garden. The story was inspired by a real-life friendship between actor-turned-director Knight, his husband, and their late neighbor. The cast also includes Stephen Fry and Oscar Lloyd. Oscar Short Films Shortlists Include Pics Supported By Emma Thompson, Domhnall Gleeson, Jennifer Lewis, Miriam Margolyes & Zar Amir Lee Knight On Creating An Endearing Queer Friendship Story Starring Miriam Margolyes In 'A Friend Of Dorothy' JJ helps Dorothy with difficult household tasks and provides companionship to his octogenarian neighbor, whose husband has passed away and son lives abroad. Her mercenary grandson is the only family contact she has, and JJ becomes a firm friend. Billed as “a story about loneliness, connection and unexpected friendship,” the film premiered at Raindance and has since been on a solid festival run. Its release on Disney+ allows it to break out beyond the festival circuit and reach a mainstream audience. “I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Academy for shortlisting A Friend of Dorothy in the Best Short Film category,” said Knight. It is deeply encouraging to see stories of companionship, acceptance and authentic living recognized on the global stage.” His Filthy Gorgeous Productions banner made the film in association with A Marlow's Production, Double Dice Films and Namesake Films. James Dean (The Stolen Girl), Scottie Fotré and Max Marlow produced. The roster of exec producers included Stephen Daldry and Sonia Friedman. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Assassin's Creed is described as a high-octane thriller centered on the secret war between two shadowy factions — one set on determining mankind's future through control and manipulation, while the other fights to preserve free will. 'Stranger Things 5': Duffer Brothers Unpack Emotional Series Finale From [SPOILER]'s Death To That 40-Minute Epilogue, Those Needle Drops & A Spinoff Hint 'Stranger Things' Pays Homage To Its Origins In Emotional Series Finale The series follows its characters across pivotal historical events as they battle to shape humanity's destiny.

This is a second series regular casting for Crawford in a high-profile, IP-based upcoming drama series, along with HBO's Game of Thrones prequel A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, on which she portrays Tanselle. Showrunners Roberto Patino and David Wiener executive produce Assassin's Creed alongside Gerard Guillemot, Margaret Boykin, Austin Dill, Genevieve Jones for Ubisoft Film & Television, and Matt O'Toole. With more than 230 million units sold, the Assassin's Creed franchise is one of the bestselling series in video game history. Australian-born Crawford got her break as a main cast member on the 2023 Hulu limited series Tiny Beautiful Things, playing lead Kathryn Hahn's daughter.

Alessandra Ambrosio is no stranger to a killer beach look.

The Victoria's Secret model is ringing in the new year in Brazil, where she took a dip in a statement-making swimsuit Thursday.

Tapping boyfriend Buck Palmer as her photographer once again, the 44-year-old posed by the water's edge in a ruffled Chloé one-piece ($890) with a plunging neckline.

Featuring a delicate floral pattern — better seen once the suit was submerged in the water — the look was an ultra-feminine take on the supermodel's swim style.

Ambrosio began her sunny photo shoot with a bright red sarong tied around her waist, though she ditched it once jumping into the waves.

Ambrosio knows her angles, and was seen staring straight into Palmer's camera lens when leaping into the ocean, only to turn around and capture some selfies of the couple as a pair.

Ambrosio accessorized with aviator shades and a full suite of jewelry, including drop earrings, layered necklaces and a bracelet stack on her left wrist.

The night before, she shared images of her New Year's Eve party on the beach, where she wore a sheer, asymmetrical mesh Ammi dress ($810) embellished with sequins and rings.

“Feliz 2026 ✨🤍❣️🥂🎇 HNY,” Ambrosio captioned her celebratory post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Drake has been accused of participating in a racketeering conspiracy built around the online casino Stake. It further alleges that he is funnelling proceeds—via Stake's unregulated “tipping” system—to a third party, in Australia, to invest in bot farms that illegally boost Drake's streaming numbers. Eyeing a possible (and highly contentious) legal loophole, Stake circumvents the online-gambling ban by selling “play money” that comes with free tokens. If a judge deems the practice to be illegal, Drake and Ross could be liable for promoting Stake.us, even if their own areas of residence permit online gambling. It signed an endorsement deal with Drake in 2022 worth a reported $100 million a year; he has since undertaken frequent livestreams of online gambling sessions and giveaways. This past August, Drake seemingly fell out with the platform after having withdrawal attempts blocked. The matter appeared resolved in October when he posted a video staging his discovery of a $1 million balance restored to his account. The bot-farming aspect of the lawsuit doubles as an attack on Stake's “tipping” function, which allows users to transfer funds between accounts—a common feature of online casinos. Two plaintiffs, LaShawnna Ridley and Tiffany Hines, filed the class-action lawsuit on behalf of those affected in Virginia, claiming Drake's promotion helped lure them onto Stake. They are seeking at least $5 million in damages, based on two violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and one of the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. This is not the first lawsuit alleging that the platform is breaking U.S. gambling laws, or even the first implicating Drake: A Missouri complaint filed last October alleges that Drake and Ross misrepresented Stake.us as a harmless “social casino,” rather than an illegal gambling platform. That suit claims Drake and Ross further mislead their followers by hosting gambling livestreams directly funded by Stake, rather than out of their own pockets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicole Kidman is stepping into 2026 with grace and optimism, sharing a heartfelt message on social media that underscores her focus on family, healing and the future as she navigates life following her divorce from country star Keith Urban. On New Year's Eve, Kidman, 58, posted a photo to Instagram showing her arm-in-arm with her teenage daughters, Sunday Rose, 17, and Faith Margaret, 15, as they gazed out over a scenic Sydney waterfront with fireworks lighting the night sky. The image — peaceful and intimate — was paired with a simple yet meaningful caption: “Looking forward into 2026 xx.” The message resonated with fans as a clear symbol of positivity and intention as she embarks on a new chapter. This holiday season marked Kidman's first Christmas and New Year's Eve since filing for divorce from Urban in September 2025 after nearly 19 years of marriage. The split, widely reported last fall, was officially attributed to irreconcilable differences, and the former couple have since worked to maintain an amicable co-parenting arrangement for their daughters. “She just wanted to celebrate Christmas at home,” the source added. Kidman's caption — brief yet poignant — reflects a broader approach that many observers have noted: she's facing her transition with resilience and optimism. Rather than allowing the narrative to center on the end of a long marriage, she is choosing to emphasize what lies ahead, both personally and as a mother.

Jordan, Adam Sandler, Jeremy Allen White, Wagner Moura and Mark Hamill, all in the hunt for their first Oscar nomination, bond over what it took to make it in this crazy industry. The seven men who gathered for THR‘s Oscar season Actors Roundtable — Frankenstein's Jacob Elordi, The Life of Chuck's Mark Hamill, The Smashing Machine's Dwayne Johnson, Sinners' Michael B. Jordan, The Secret Agent's Wagner Moura, Jay Kelly's Adam Sandler and Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere's Jeremy Allen White — don't share very much in common. Five are American (Hamill, Johnson, Jordan, Sandler and White), one is Australian (Elordi) and one is Brazilian (Moura). Their ages span from 20s (Elordi, 28) to 70s (Hamill, 74). Down to Puck: Why Women Are Going Wild for 'Heated Rivalry' But as they sat down together at The Sun Rose West Hollywood in mid-November amid a wave of mutual admiration — “I've always wanted to meet you,” gushed Johnson, one of Hollywood's biggest stars, to Hamill, whom he first “encountered” decades ago as Luke Skywalker — they all shared two things: (1) Each gave a career-best performance in a 2025 film, and (2) None has ever received so much as an Oscar nomination. For at least some of them, the latter will soon change. Dwayne, nobody before you had made the jump from pro wrestling to A-list movie stardom. Was a pivot to acting always planned? DWAYNE JOHNSON I think it was planned by something more powerful than me, but also, I wanted to grow and to challenge myself, and transitioning into Hollywood was something that I definitely wanted. With my first movie, The Mummy Returns, we were shooting in the Sahara Desert, and I was so sick — I went over there and probably ate something that I shouldn't have — and it was 110 degrees, but I was freezing and wearing a blanket. He calls “Action!” We have our scene. And when he said, “Cut!” I went, “This is what I want to do for the rest of my life.” MICHAEL B. JORDAN At that age, you take rejection personally — I did, anyway, and used it as a healthy chip on my shoulder to motivate myself to continue to work hard and stay locked in. Mark, how did you wind up in L.A. at 17? MARK HAMILL My dad was in the Navy, so we were constantly moving — I went to nine schools in 12 years — and the last place we got transferred to was Yokohama, Japan. I graduated from Yo High and then came to Hollywood. I don't have to be in the show. In the back of my head, I was like, “It'd be fun to do a serious movie someday” — my grandma used to say, “You're the next James Caan!” And then Paul [Thomas Anderson] wrote Punch-Drunk Love for me and kind of invited me into this world. Wagner, you were very successful in Brazil before becoming internationally known via Narcos. WAGNER MOURA Narcos was a big thing — everywhere I'd go in the world, people would go, “Pablo Escobar!” But I never wanted to come here and “try Hollywood.” What makes me different and maybe special for films is the fact that I'm not from here. I never understood actors who would try to lose their accents. But when I started coming here, people would ask, “Would you be able to play this character with a standard American accent?” And I was like, “No.” First because I'm not able to (laughs), but second because I thought that's kind of wrong. Jeremy, you were going to be a dancer. JEREMY ALLEN WHITE I transferred into a middle school that specialized in performing arts and joined the dance program there, but I didn't think the teacher was taking dance seriously enough, so I joined the drama program. I liked that as a 12-year-old — it felt fun to commit myself to something in such a serious way. I then went to a performing arts high school. I thought my life was going to be in New York doing theater and a Law & Order every once in a while to pay the rent. I auditioned for this show [Shameless] with Bill Macy for Showtime, a John Wells show, and moved to L.A. when I was 18, right out of high school, and had this 11-year training camp with great actors and great writing. We have a sports injury to thank for Jacob being here. JACOB ELORDI I did Seussical, the musical,when I was 13, as a way to deal with rambunctious behavior — they put me into this thing — and then I realized acting was a way you could find some kind of peace. Where I grew up in Australia, you weren't really a person unless you played sports, so I did that and enjoyed it enough. But then I broke my back when I was 16 — we were lifting weights too early — and I remember laying on the floor and kind of laughing because I'd been doing rehearsals for a play at school at the same time, and the rugby coach and I had just had a conversation about me needing to choose one or the other. I was kind of like Troy Bolton in High School Musical. Wagner, 20 years after meeting someone at the Cannes Film Festival, that same person wrote for you and directed you in the part of a lifetime. MOURA I met Kleber Mendonça Filho in Cannes when I was there with Lower City, a Brazilian film, and he was there as a critic. Then in 2012, I saw his feature Neighboring Sounds and said, “This is one of the greatest Brazilian films ever! I have to work with this guy!” But it took a long time. What really brought us together was politics. We got together and were like, “How can we react to what's going on here?” And then The Secret Agent [which is set in the '70s but speaks to recent Brazilian history, too] happened. Jacob, you were off playing a POW in the limited series The Narrow Road to the Deep North when Andrew Garfield dropped out of Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein just nine weeks before it was to shoot. ELORDI I was in the middle of shooting these death camp sequences when I heard about it, but when Guillermo sends you something, you need to respond immediately. I like what Michael said about, “What's yours is yours and what's not is not.” But this was the first time that after reading a screenplay, I was like, “No, this has to be mine.” You're the fifth-highest-grossing actor of all time. The 40 films in which you've starred have collectively taken in slightly less than $14 billion worldwide, or an average of $349.7 million. And within the past year, you had two movies open at No. 1 at the box office in the same month, something no other actor or actress had achieved in 27 years. But for a number of years, you've felt frustrated with your career. JOHNSON (Sheepishly) Lunch is on me, boys. But I reached a point seven or eight years ago where I had this little voice behind my rib cage. I think we all have it — sometimes it whispers to us, and sometimes it's really resounding — and that voice for me was asking, “What's more?” I'm obsessed with the idea of trying. Yes, “What's yours is yours, what's not yours is not yours,” but also, I believe in setting an intention and taking a step toward the thing that you want because the universe has this way of meeting you halfway. JOHNSON The big movies are fun to do. But I had this obsession to do something for me. I started asking myself, “Am I living my dream, or mine plus a lot of other people's and entities' around me?” I met Mark Kerr in the late '90s as he was becoming “the Smashing Machine,” and I saw his [2002] documentary [of the same name] and thought it was really moving. I let that be my guiding light creatively, and it allowed me to tap into an artistry I was looking for — to challenge myself: “Oh, there's the cliff? We don't know what's on the other side? Jeremy, Bruce Springsteen had never cooperated with a narrative film about his life before he authorized Scott Cooper to make one, and they both wanted you to star. Take us into how you processed that. WHITE There are some actors who feel like they can do anything, that they can show up and figure it out. And we had just six months to prepare. But then it was that thing of, “Am I going to shy away from this challenge or am I going to jump and see what happens?” It was a leap of faith. JORDAN Did you find it helpful that you had the resource directly at your disposal, to kind of pull from him? WHITE In the beginning, I spent a lot of time with Bruce — he was very gracious and generous with his time. But then he was on set almost every day, which was something that we did not speak about prior. And I was just like, “Oh, nooo.” (Laughs.) ELORDI I saw pictures of that and felt for you. HAMILL I get vicarious flop sweat just thinking about it. ELORDI Did you ever feel like you could have an argument with him and say, “I don't think he would do it that way?” (Laughs.) Michael, you've starred in every one of Ryan Coogler's features going back to Fruitvale Station and through the Creed and Black Panther films. I assume that reteaming brings an added level of comfort? But also, Sinners is the first movie I've done since directing for the first time [2023's Creed III], so I had a new set of eyes on set, trying to spot ways that I could be helpful to Ryan. And he's helpful to me — he knows me very well and knew that this one was outside of my comfort zone but thought it was a challenge that I needed and knew that I was looking for a challenge. The fact that he wanted me to play twins … That comfortability between me and Ryan — being able to talk through things and push each other — brought the best out of me. Mark, ever since the first Star Wars trilogy, you've gravitated toward things that allowed you to show other sides of yourself, including collaborating with Mike Flanagan on the 2023 limited series The Fall of the House of Usher and now this film. HAMILL When you do something well in Hollywood, they want you to do that over and over again because it's a proven entity. It wasn't like they were saying, “Please come here and do theater!” When I got into voiceover, I thought, “Where has this been all my life?” Because they cast with their ears, not their eyes, and you're able to play parts you'd never get in a million years if you were on camera. The second time he called me, he said, “I have something you might be interested in that's based on a Stephen King novella.” Based on Mike's reputation and Stephen King's, I was expecting the supernatural epic of all time, but The Life of Chuck is a life-affirming portrait of a young man at four different stages of his life. If it weren't for Mike, I think I'd still just be doing voiceover because the older you get, the less you care — this is something you all have to look forward to! I shouldn't put it that way. Adam, Noah Baumbach said he wrote the part of movie star Jay Kelly's sweet manager for you because the character reminds him of you. SANDLER I became very friendly with Noah after The Meyerowitz Stories. He's funny as hell, a meticulous director, very thoughtful, wants you to get it right, gives you time to get it right — he's not moving on until everyone's happy. He for some reason thinks I'm a wonderful guy. ELORDI I watched it with my manager. Adam, you've said that with Hustle and Jay Kelly, part of the draw for you was getting to play a character who cares so much about someone else. And then, even when you go home at night, you're going, “I've got to be a little bit more like that.” JOHNSON That's the beauty, I think, of what we do. It forces us to look at ourselves. I'd love to hear how it shaped your performance. ELORDI It gave me the freedom to be completely expressive. When I spoke to Guillermo the first time, he said, “This isn't a prosthetics process. The time that it takes is what you need to become this thing that's other.” When the Creature is newborn, from head to toe was about 10 hours. When he has clothes on, it was five hours. If you could have 10 hours every day to get ready for the day, it would be the greatest blessing. You learn the screenplay inside out, and then you can put it down and spend another three hours thinking about it, and then not thinking about it. JOHNSON I didn't have five or 10 hours. We were four hours every day in the makeup chair … I'd look up every 30 minutes and something would be different. There was a version of Mark Kerr that could have required six or seven hours, a complete transformation. Benny [Safdie, the director] said, “Do you feel like you'll discover something about yourself playing this role?” I said, “We haven't even shot a frame of film yet, and I feel like I've already discovered a lot about myself.” And he goes, “If that's the case, I'm going to make sure I can see your eyes and still see Dwayne in there somewhere. When you discover stuff about yourself, I want to feel it.” When on your 2025 film did you feel most in danger of failing? SANDLER When you see in the script that your character is crying out of control, you go, “Fuck, man.” I don't get excited for those. But there were like three or four of those in this movie. The week before I'd go, “Fucking Wednesday's going to suck. How the fuck am I going to cry?” I thought we'd shoot it at the end. But much earlier than that, Guillermo said, “Tomorrow we're going to do the forgiveness scene. I hadn't figured out how to emote as this thing. And I didn't know what the voice was yet. WHITE It's just to make us feel better. MOURA Sometimes, just show up and do it! Which of your lines is most often quoted back to you? I forget it's from Happy Gilmore, so people scream “Jackass” at me, and I'm like, “What the fuck? JOHNSON It would have to be “You're Welcome” [the song he sings in Moana]. MOURA “Plata o plomo?” [A Spanish line from Narcos that translates to “Silver or lead?”] HAMILL Mine is, “May the Schwartz be with you.” Thanks, Mel Brooks!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys, Peter Gabriel & Paramore have also charted enduring No. More than 300 songs have peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, and despite not hitting No. The Beatles, Bee Gees, Rolling Stones, Beach Boys and Aretha Franklin all boast notable No. 26 Hot 100 hits among their iconic catalogs, which include a record 20, nine, eight, four and two leaders, respectively. 26 single, noted in the list below, would've peaked four spots higher if not for a fab four other songs of theirs in its way the week that it reached its high, amid early Beatlemania.) 26 Hot 100 hits kicked off especially lengthy chart careers, including LeAnn Rimes in the ‘90s and Paramore in the ‘00s. Meanwhile, over on the Billboard 200 albums chart, noteworthy No. 26-peaking collections include John Denver and the Muppets' warm and fuzzy (literally) A Christmas Together, P!nk's debut, Can't Take Me Home, and 2022's Elvis soundtrack. On Hot Country Songs, Kenny Rogers spun “The Greatest” to a No. On Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, Jay-Z's “99 Problems” hit a No. On Hot Rock & Alternative Songs, Foo Fighters' recent radio ruler “Asking for a Friend” has reached No. Summer 1958 (when the Hot 100 premiered) was big for summer-themed hits. As this song was making its splash, it was joined in the top 40 by Eddie Cochran's eventual top 10 “Summertime Blues” and The Four Preps' “Lazy Summer Night.” “He immediately sees their potential,” noted Dean Harmeyer of Heritage Auctions, which in 2015 sold the band's first contract (for $90,000). Following this pop-rock track, the trio would rocket to No. 1 on the Hot 100 with its next six singles (a record streak among groups), as Saturday Night Fever fever took hold. The song preceded “How Deep Is Your Love,” “Stayin' Alive,” “Night Fever,” “Too Much Heaven,” “Tragedy” and “Love You Inside Out.” The breezy song is one of the band's 35 top 40 Hot 100 hits, and its highest-charting entry (No. In 2025, the group — lead singer Aimee Mann, Michael Hausman, Robert Holmes and Joey Pesce — reunited for its first show in more than 30 years at the Cruel World festival in Pasadena, Calif. “And by the way, everybody's great,” Mann mused. “Like, everybody just developed into a sweet, nice person. And not that they weren't before, but it's nice when people don't calcify into their worst selves.” In 1985, Air Supply's “Power of Love (You Are My Lady)” reached No. In 1986, Jennifer Rush's version of the ballad, which she co-wrote, hit No. Branigan's version took the composition to the top 40 — six years before Celine Dion's interpretation reigned for four weeks. The band's debut single arrived on the Hot 100 as “Hold On to the Nights” (by “Edge of a Broken Heart” co-writer, producer and then-EMI labelmate Richard Marx) was continuing its run after becoming his first No. Marx wrote in his 2021 memoir, Stories To Tell, that he had a 48-hour window in which to produce the track for the group. “Looking back,” he shared, “I still can't believe everybody just took the leap of faith that I'd not only write the right song but be able to produce it in a matter of hours.” It's been featured on multiple movie soundtracks, with a new placement at the end of the fun 2025 film Good Fortune, starring Aziz Ansari, Sandra Oh, Keke Palmer, Keanu Reeves and Seth Rogen. Alan Light, whose résumé includes Rolling Stone and SiriusXM, told Billboard of the song (also a No. 1 hit on Hot Rap Songs) in 2019, “The lyrics were different for that time, coming out of Public Enemy and N.W.A [being] ascendant, which had a real sense of hip-hop as storytelling — Black America's CNN — and then there's De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest, which gave a sense of hip-hop as a lyrical form. I'm not saying it was in opposition to that, but these were clearly party records. Otis Redding co-wrote the song and his version became a posthumous No. The song introduced Kadison's trademark piano pop. Follow-up “Beautiful in My Eyes” did even better, reaching No. “LeAnn Rimes, who's kicking up a bit of a fuss with her debut single, stopped by our offices to chat,” Chet Flippo wrote in the May 25, 1996, Billboard, the week that the then-13-year-old Rimes made her chart debut as “Blue” entered Hot Country Songs, where it would go on to hit No. “The song,” the then-Nashville bureau chief continued, “was written by longtime Fort Worth, Texas, DJ Bill Mack for Patsy Cline. Rimes does indeed have a big voice in the Cline tradition. Her last two top 40 entries each reached No. “This wildly energetic foursome (two gals, two guys) from the Netherlands is pretty much a household name throughout Europe, where this infectious pop gem has been a constant on radio and in clubs,” read a Billboard review of the single in January 1999. It praised the song's “sugar-soaked sing-along chorus,” correctly predicting that “people who embraced Aqua's ‘Barbie Girl' and Los Del Rio's ‘Macarena' will be lining up for this latest slice of energetic pop.” The week that it hit its Hot 100 high, the ballad also began a three-week reign on Hot Country Songs. The band's breakthrough hit also reached No. The team-up, Lamar's second Hot 100 entry, after “Swimming Pools (Drank)” (a No. Eight months after Fallon became host of NBC's The Tonight Show, he reached the Hot 100 with this novelty track born on his day (night) job. Having a song chart is just crazy,” he beamed, with his Billboard history including two No. “I didn't even know that this would be a song. Will.i.am came on the show and said he loves ‘Ew,' this character where I'm a 15-year-old girl, just listing things that I think are … ‘ew!' The song has no other goal than to make you smile.” One of her 16 top 40 Hot 100 hits, it rose to the top 10 on the all-format Radio Songs chart. The Peas' comeback hit — their first top 40 Hot 100 single since 2011 — also dominated Hot Latin Songs for 24 weeks. The Nigerian artist's introductory hit was first released in 2019 and surged when it went viral, helped by remixes. Originally, “no one took it seriously because it wasn't a fast song,” he told Billboard in 2021. He shared that he was in love while making the record, whose title in his native Igbo language means “small love.” “Emo Afrobeats is a way to express myself, my emotions and my sound and still have a groove to it,” he said.

Their choice mirrors a long-running Hollywood tradition that stretches from cookbook legends to Oscar winners. In an interview with Larry King, Child shared how she actually felt about the chain: “It's awfully good.” So good that she famously kept a list of In-N-Out locations near her home in her purse. In a recent interview with Airmail, Garten explained her go-to order while traveling for book tours. Child and Garten's preference aligns them with several celebrity chefs who have publicly named In-N-Out as their favorite fast-food burger, including Alton Brown, Gordon Ramsay, and Bobby Flay. The restaurant has also become closely tied to awards season in Los Angeles. According to Jimmy Kimmel, the tradition is especially common on Oscar night. Speaking to People in 2024, Kimmel explained why the burger chain has become a go-to destination. “You get very hungry, so In-N-Out is definitely the award show tradition.” He added, “Nothing against McDonald's, but on award show night, it's In-N-Out.” Over the years, several celebrities have gone viral for late-night visits to In-N-Out after major award shows. Giamatti later referenced the moment during his Critics' Choice Awards speech, telling the audience, “I didn't think my week could get any better than going viral for eating a cheeseburger.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

Este Haim Marries Jonathan Levin in New Year's Eve Ceremony Yungblud Announces Darker 'Zombie' Collaboration With Smashing Pumpkins: Here's When It Arrives That soft viewership result didn't reflect what was a “successful night,” say reps for the Kennedy Center. “Comparing this year's broadcast ratings to prior years is a classic apples-to-oranges comparison and evidence of far-left bias,” Roma Daravi, vp of public relations for the Kennedy Center, said in a statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter. “The program performed extremely well across key demographics and platforms, despite industry and timing disadvantages, including a Tuesday air date two days before Christmas.” According to THR, Nielsen Live + Same Day Panel + Big Data reported the special averaged 4.1 million viewers, representing a 26% drop in viewership year-on-year. “With overall television usage down roughly 20 percent year over year, the broadcast still tied for the #1 spot among adults aged 25–54, alongside a live NBA doubleheader,” Daravi adds. Efforts to rename the Kennedy Center, reportedly approved by its board, could face legal hurdles. It would take an act of Congress to change that now. In February 2025, Trump abruptly fired members and installed himself as chair, writing in a post on Truth Social at the time, “At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN.” Celebrities who have disassociated themselves from the Kennedy Center this year include Rhiannon Giddens, Issa Rae, Renee Fleming, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds. The landmark musical Hamilton and play Eureka Day soon cancelled performances at the center, while jazz supergroup The Cookers pulled out of a planned New Year's Eve concert, and musician Chuck Redd scrapped a Christmas Eve performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“His Majesty united so many different people because the only path forward is together,” Winslet says in a new trailer released Thursday. His Majesty's Harmony philosophy is our guiding principle at The King's Foundation, and it's fantastic to have the opportunity to share this thinking with a wider audience.” Per the official press release, The King's Foundation, which was created in 1990, “works to build sustainable communities and transform lives through teaching practical heritage skills and leading green community regeneration projects.” King Charles' documentary comes on the heels of his cancer journey. In December, Charles gave an emotional update on his battle. The prerecorded message aired during Channel 4's Stand Up To Cancer broadcast, with King Charles noting he will continue receiving care, on a reduced schedule, as doctors move into a more precautionary phase. “I know from my own experience that a cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming,” he added. “Yet I also know that early detection is the key that can transform treatment journeys, giving invaluable time to medical teams — and, to their patients, the precious gift of hope.” “I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life, even while undergoing treatment,” the king continued. The monarch then urged others to find out whether they are eligible for cancer screenings. “A few moments of minor inconvenience are a small price to pay for the reassurance that comes for most people when they are either told either they don't need further tests, or, for some, are given the chance to enable early detection, with the life-saving intervention that can follow.” “This December, as we gather to reflect on the year past, I pray that we can each pledge, as part of our resolutions for the year ahead, to play our part in helping to catch cancer early,” he concluded. Along with King Charles, his daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, also revealed she was being treated for cancer in March 2024. “The last nine months have been incredibly tough for us as a family. Life as you know it can change in an instant and we have had to find a way to navigate the stormy waters and road unknown.”</p>
