                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Argentina secured a win over Spain in the 2026 United Cup opener, led by Solana Sierra and Sebastian Baez. Sierra's three-set victory and Baez's dominant performance gave Argentina a strong start in Group A. Argentina aims to advance out of the group stage for the first time in three tournament appearances. Argentina earned the first team win of the 2026 United Cup in Perth on Friday, defeating Spain behind singles victories from Sebastián Báez and Solana Sierra. 66 Sierra clinched the win for her country in Group A with a 6-4, 5-7, 6-0 triumph over Jessica Bouzas Maneiro after Baez defeated Jaume Munar 6-4, 6-4 in the first tie of the competition. "I [felt] really good on the court," Sierra said to reporters. To close off the strong afternoon, Argentina's mixed-doubles duo of Maria Lourdes Carle and Guido Andreozzi secured the sweep with a 7-6 (6), 6-2 win over Spain's Yvonne Cavalle-Reimers and Inigo Cervantes. Argentina is hoping to advance out of group-stage play for the first time in three tournament appearances, and its opening win was driven by its second-highest and highest-ranked players in the ATP and PIF WTA Rankings, respectively. As the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz season gets underway in Australia, Sierra's grit in particular stood out over 2 hours and 2 minutes, as she regrouped after losing a 5-2 second-set lead and turned the match back in her favor. Sierra was two points away from a straight-sets victory twice in the second set, having 30-30 serving at 5-3, and on return at 5-4. But when all was said and done, she needed three sets to top the World No. 41 and earn her third career win over a Top 50 opponent. She lost just eight points in the third set after dropping five straight games to lose the second. "I just tried to focus on my game. I was doing really good, then at 5-2 in the second set, I was not playing too good," she said on-court after her second tour-level win over a player from Spain. "I'm super happy to start the year competing and representing Argentina. 45 Baez defeated Munar to give Argentina a 1-0 lead over Spain. “I really enjoyed this moment, enjoyed the time on court, so happy to [have] won this point for Argentina,” he said. In the second set, the Argentine showed great composure again by breaking back, immediately after losing serve, for a 4-3 lead. He saved four of the six break points he faced in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I am happy because I am recovering from some pain and some injuries from the past two years. 46 Mariano Navone on his way to the title in Rio last February.
