                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitVentures, a Nasdaq-listed tech company, today announced the official launch of its Digital Assets segment, a unit focused on crypto mining and digital asset operations, including staking, node services, and ecosystem partnerships. As part of the expansion, the company has entered into purchase and hosting agreements to acquire multiple fleets of Bitmain mining machines with approximately 0.5 MW of power capacity. Deployment will begin in phases from January 2026, with full operations anticipated in the first quarter, the company stated. BitVentures said it plans to pursue a diversified mining strategy targeting Bitcoin and select altcoins, using energy-efficient, high-specification machines to maintain resilience under volatile market conditions. Lawrence Wai Lok, CEO of BitVentures, described the launch as a proof-of-concept deployment and said the company intends to scale operations in phases, laying the foundation for future expansion into other services. Shares of BitVentures (BVC) climbed 8% intraday on Friday, per Yahoo Finance. BitVentures, formerly known as Hywin Holdings and later Santech Holdings Limited, previously operated a China-based wealth manager, Hywin Wealth, through a variable interest entity structure. Hywin Wealth was once China's leading independent wealth manager and a major distributor of real-estate-backed investment products. In June 2024, the company terminated its VIE arrangement with Hywin Wealth, fully exiting its wealth and asset management businesses. Sign in to your account</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian-U.S. national who hacked crypto exchange Bitfinex and stole nearly 120,000 bitcoin said he has been freed from prison early thanks to the bipartisan prison-reform law signed by President Donald Trump. Ilya Lichtenstein, 38, had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a money laundering conspiracy charge and admitting to the hack of crypto assets now valued in the billions of dollars. But late Thursday night, a post on Lichtenstein's official X account declared, "Thanks to President Trump's First Step Act, I have been released from prison early." "I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can," Lichtenstein's post said. "To the supporters, thank you for everything. A Trump administration official told CNBC on Friday morning that Lichtenstein "has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies." Lichtenstein's wife, Heather Morgan — who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen funds — shared Lichtenstein's message on her own X account, saying, "The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart." Morgan's tweet, posted two minutes after Lichtenstein's, included a photo of the couple smiling for a selfie. Lichtenstein's sentence included credit for time he already served in custody following his arrest in 2022, more than five years after Bitfinex was hacked. As of Friday morning, a search for Lichtenstein's name using the federal government's inmate locator website returned one result showing Lichtenstein is scheduled to be released on Feb. 9. The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Morgan, 35, a rapper who releases music under the name "Razzlekhan" and also went by "The Crocodile of Wall Street," was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration shortly after Lichtenstein received his prison sentence. But on Oct. 26, Morgan posted a video of herself saying she had been released early. "It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter," she said. An email to Morgan's manager was not immediately returned. The legislation aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population through a series of reforms, including by establishing a "a risk and needs assessment system" that gives some inmates the chance of early release into home confinement. It is unclear whether Trump or the White House had any direct involvement in Lichtenstein or Morgan securing an early prison release. But the announcements from the bitcoin hacker and his wife follow a number of high-profile cybercrime-related pardons and commutations that have been doled out by the crypto friendly president since his return to office. One day after his inauguration, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road. In October, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of major crypto exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last year in crypto will be remembered for many things, but one notable trend — particularly late in the year — was the selloffs that occurred nearly every day during  U.S. trading hours. It's not much to go on just yet, but on 2026's first official trading day, a change could be afoot as crypto prices are actually rising while American markets are open. Ether ETH$3,119.50, solana SOL$131.08 and XRP$1.9901 are seeing advances closer to 4%. Bitcoin miners turned AI infrastructure firms are sharply higher across the board, with Hut 8 (HUT), CleanSpark (CLSK), TeraWulf (WULF) sporting 10% gains, and Cipher Mining (CIFR) and IREN (IREN) each higher by 8%. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market. Internet Computer climbs back to $3 as short-term momentum improves ICP pushed above the $3 level on rising activity, holding recent gains as traders reassess near-term direction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stock in Michael Saylor's Bitcoin treasury company Strategy was up 1.22% in early trading today, giving the company a brief period of relief. At that point, the stock would be sold off by many investors because there is no point in owning a stock whose value is based on Bitcoin if the stock is worth less than the Bitcoin. The stock has been sitting above this danger zone since November. That on its own is a perilous position. But if the company's mNAV (“market-to-net asset value”) falls below 1 then the stock potentially enters a new world of pain. If that value is worth less than 1 then the case for owning Strategy stock becomes harder to argue. Saylor, as usual, has been tweeting bullishly about MSTR shares, including this chart showing that “open interest” (investor positions that have not been closed out) are the equivalent of 87% of the company's market value. He also posted an AI-generated picture of him taming a polar bear. Below the level of mNAV at 1 lies another dangerous threshold for Strategy: the average price at which Strategy has historically accumulated Bitcoin. Over the years, that price was about $74,000 per coin. If the price were to fall below $74K it would imply that Strategy's Bitcoin stash was worth less than what Saylor has paid for it. Strategy fans would argue that might be a time to buy—if the stock was worth less than its Bitcoin then the price per share might rise to meet the price of Bitcoin; it might rise even more if Bitcoin resumed its march higher. But that, again, would be a sore test for traders who are not true believers. Why hold a stock that is worth less than the underlying asset it represents?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum and XRP are two of the largest cryptocurrencies, and their market capitalization is one of the clearest ways to compare their values. Ethereum is firmly entrenched as the second-largest cryptocurrency, while XRP is following closely behind, although it was recently overtaken by BNB in market cap rankings. This disparity naturally leads to a valuation exercise that many investors revisit during periods of interest: how much would each XRP token be worth if its market cap matched Ethereum's, both at current levels and at Ethereum's all-time high? XRP, on the other hand, is trading at $1.88, holds a market cap of about $113.8 billion. Using MarketCapOf's circulating-supply-based calculation, XRP would trade at approximately $6.04 if its total valuation matched Ethereum's current market cap. In relative terms, XRP is shown to be valued at roughly 0.31x of Ethereum's market capitalization. The comparison is purely mathematical and does not factor in changes to supply. It only shows how much additional capital would be required for XRP to stand on equal footing with Ethereum as things stand today. Ethereum's peak market cap, which was recorded during its all-time high price of $4,946 in August, is around $583.8 billion. Under this scenario, XRP is valued at roughly 0.20x of Ethereum's all-time high market capitalization. An investor holding 1,000 XRP today would see that position valued at about $1,880 at current prices, around $6,040 if XRP matched Ethereum's present market cap, and $9,640 if it reached Ethereum's peak valuation. That institutional angle has become increasingly relevant following the launch of Spot XRP exchange-traded funds, which have begun pulling in fresh capital from both professional and traditional investors. Matching Ethereum's current or peak market capitalization places XRP in the $6 to $9.64 range. These figures are notably lower than some of the double-digit and triple-digit targets above $100 proposed by a few crypto analysts. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tom Lee, chairman of ether ETH$3 119,50 treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR), urged shareholders to approve a board proposal for a sharp increase in the company's authorized share count. That's what we want the total max shares to be,” Lee said. Lee argued that BitMine's share price has increasingly tracked ether since the company pivoted last year to make ETH its primary treasury asset. Lee framed the proposal within a broader thesis that Ethereum will play a central role in Wall Street's push toward tokenized financial markets, pointing to public comments by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink about blockchain-based market infrastructure. Lee reminded shareholders that they have until Jan. 14 to vote on the proposal, with BitMine's annual shareholder meeting scheduled for Jan. 15 in Las Vegas. KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market. While South Korean financial officials acknowledged the need for new rules, disagreements over stablecoins delayed a broader crypto framework.

CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes said, “We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com's blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity.” The company said record dates — the cutoff used to determine who qualifies — and other details will be announced in the new year, and that the tokens are not expected to represent an ownership interest, may not be transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash. Investors focus on whether a token can be traded, what rights come with it, and how regulators treat it versus traditional securities. Broader markets were steady-to-firmer ahead of the open, with U.S. stock futures higher in early premarket trading, according to Dow Jones and FactSet data. The token plan adds a new catalyst that is easy to market to retail investors, while leaving big questions unanswered. Traders will be watching for the record date and the operational details that decide who receives tokens when shares are held at brokerages. Stock-lending mechanics matter too, because distributions typically go to owners of record rather than borrowers. The next key issue is whether the token ends up functioning as a tradable asset or more like a loyalty reward. Language in Trump Media's announcement underscored that the token is not meant to be an equity-like claim, and the company stressed limits around transferability and cash conversion. Investors will parse any follow-up disclosures for how those terms are implemented in practice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock deposited 1,134 BTC and 7,255 ETH into Coinbase. It also comes as $2.2 billion in crypto options expire. This development also comes amid the expiry of $2.2 billion crypto options today, which also has the market on edge. Arkham data shows the asset manager transferred 1,134 BTC ($101 million) and 7,255 ETH ($22 million) to Coinbase, likely to offload these coins. SoSoValue data shows that the Bitcoin ETFs recorded a daily net outflow of $348.10 million on the last day of last year, while the Ethereum ETFs saw a daily net outflow of $72.06 million. The outflows from these funds continue to add significant selling pressure on Bitcoin and Ethereum. The BTC ETFs have recorded daily net outflows in eight out of the last nine trading days. A recent CryptoQuant analysis warned that sustained outflows from BlackRock's fund and other ETFs could push Bitcoin below the psychological $90,000 level. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that BlackRock's BTC and ETH transfers come amid the expiry of crypto options today. As CoinGape reported, $2.2 billion in Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana options expire today, with the max pain point for the BTC options at $88,000. On-chain analytics platform Glassnode noted in an X post that the ETF flows still show no renewed demand for Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, a positive for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is that BTC long-term holders have stopped selling even as BlackRock and other issuers continue to see outflows from their crypto ETFs. The total crypto market cap is also up on the day, rising above $3 trillion, with coins like PEPE posting significant gains.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her work has appeared in leading publications including The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, CoinDesk, Bitcoin... Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has once again stirred crypto markets after updating his profile photo on X to a Milady NFT helping push the collection's floor price up nearly 30% within 24 hours. Data from Coingecko NFT marketplaces show Milady Maker's floor price climbing to around 1.07 ETH, with both trading volume and sales rising sharply following the profile change. Milady is back.Ethereum did a lot in 2025: gas limits increased, blob count increased, node software quality improved, zkEVMs blasted through their performance milestones, and with zkEVMs and PeerDAS ethereum made its largest step toward being a fundamentally… Milady is back,” Buterin wrote, before pointing to a series of technical upgrades completed last year, including higher gas limits, expanded blob capacity, improvements in node software quality, and major advances in zkEVMs and PeerDAS. He describes these milestones as some of Ethereum's most important steps toward becoming a more powerful and scalable blockchain. Buterin used the post to reiterate Ethereum's broader mission, arguing that the network should not focus on short-term narratives or speculative trends, but instead serve as a foundational layer for a freer and more open internet. He highlights the importance of decentralized applications that operate without fraud, censorship, or third-party interference, continue functioning even if their original developers disappear and protect user privacy. Such applications, he said, should remain stable regardless of political, corporate, or ideological shifts. Launched in August 2021, Milady Maker is a collection of 10,000 neochibi-style NFTs on Ethereum created by the Remilia Collective. Since then the ecosystem has continued to expand through new tokens, community initiatives and cultural events. As members of the Milady community often note many NFT projects failed by trying too hard to explain themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Moto Finance, a financial technology company, has raised $1.8m in pre-seed funding from Cyber Fund and Eterna Capital to advance its blockchain-enabled savings account and credit card platform. Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise. Moto Finance was founded by Shimon Newman and Ramses Kamanda, who were both previously at Squads, which is reportedly the largest protocol by value secured on Solana. Newman and Kamanda departed Squads to pursue their aim of applying DeFi infrastructure within regulated consumer-facing products. “With backing from Cyber Fund and Eterna Capital, we are on track to build a platform that empowers users to earn meaningful returns on their assets, enjoy premium benefits that matter in everyday life, and participate in the financial upside provided by decentralised finance within a trusted and compliant network.” The Moto platform integrates a high-interest savings account with a Visa Infinite credit card, enabling users to deposit funds, earn interest, and spend globally via their Moto card. According to company statements, users can earn interest on deposited funds and receive cashback rewards through yields sourced from insured mechanisms supported by DeFi protocols. The platform's reward structure is divided into three tiers based on deposit levels. The tiered model is designed to offer uniform cashback while increasing interest rates with higher participation. Moto Finance situates its offering as an alternative for those seeking integrated financial experiences amid persistent low average savings rates in the US banking sector, which remain near 0.6%. By unifying spending, saving, and earning functions into a single digital product, the company targets individuals who may otherwise use unconnected financial services. Following the close of this funding round, Moto Finance intends to progress with product development, strengthen its engineering and compliance teams, continue work on regulatory infrastructure, and prepare its platform for broader market entry. According to the company, the investment arrives at a time when demand for alternatives to conventional savings accounts and credit products is increasing among consumers interested in digital asset-based solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In response, the Flow team initiated a blockchain pause that lasted until 10… This precautionary measure, though necessary, coincided with the maturity dates of several NFT-collateralized loans, leaving borrowers unable to make repayments or transfer assets. Flowty, a prominent NFT lending protocol on the network, reported that 11 such loans reached their due dates during this downtime. Only one was settled automatically through a pre-set autopay feature, while eight went into default. Even after the network resumed basic operations, persistent issues with token swaps and other functionalities hindered users' ability to acquire necessary funds for repayments. To mitigate further complications, Flowty announced on December 30 that it would temporarily halt all loan settlements starting at 2:15 p.m. Under this policy, any loans maturing during the ongoing recovery phase will neither default nor fully settle; instead, they will stay active in a suspended state, often referred to as “limbo.” Lenders will forgo additional interest accumulation on these paused positions, and borrowers—even those with adequate resources—cannot close out loans to retrieve their collateralized NFTs. Flowty cited the need to prevent unfair defaults caused by technical limitations outside users' control, especially given the unique and often irreplaceable nature of NFTs used as collateral. Additionally, to reduce risk exposure, Flowty has suspended the creation of new loans and delisted all active offerings from its marketplace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media & Technology Group Corp shares climbed in the last regular session, closing up 5.4% at $13.25 on Dec. 31. U.S. markets were closed on Thursday for the New Year's Day holiday. The move put fresh attention on DJT's strategy pivot, as the Truth Social parent leans harder into financial products to keep investors engaged and broaden revenue streams beyond its core social-media business. It also comes at a moment when Washington has become more supportive of crypto firms, even as digital-asset prices have pulled back, leaving crypto-linked names sensitive to headlines and sentiment shifts, Reuters reported. The company said each “ultimate beneficial owner” — the end investor holding shares through a broker — would be eligible for one token per whole DJT share, and said the tokens are not expected to be transferable or exchangeable for cash. Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said, “We look forward to utilizing Crypto.com's blockchain technology and improving regulatory clarity to implement this first-of-its kind token distribution.” SEC In a separate Form 8-K dated Dec. 30, Trump Media furnished a release announcing five Truth Social-branded exchange-traded funds — ETFs, baskets of securities that trade like a stock — launched on the New York Stock Exchange under its Truth.Fi brand. The initial lineup includes TSSD, TSFN, TSIC, TSES and TSRS, and the company said it plans to roll out additional ETFs in 2026, including digital asset-based funds made available through Crypto.com's broker-dealer, Foris Capital US LLC. ETF launches typically live or die on assets under management, and traders will watch early inflows, trading spreads and liquidity for evidence the products can scale beyond the initial publicity. DJT's latest rally still sits inside a wide trading band: the stock ranged from $12.82 to $13.80 in the last session, while its 52-week range spans roughly $10 to $43. Unlike a cash dividend, the token's value to shareholders depends on the company's reward structure and on operational details such as how brokers handle eligibility, record dates and distribution mechanics. Investors will also track early trading in the new Truth Social ETFs and any follow-up SEC filings that clarify product terms, risks and timing. For now, DJT remains a headline-driven trade tied to crypto sentiment, policy signals and company updates.</p>
