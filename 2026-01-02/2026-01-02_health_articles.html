                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) used to be a rare pregnancy condition, but it now affects roughly 14,000 pregnancies annually, posing a major cause of maternal death. Yet why it happens is still not well understood. Placenta accreta occurs when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall, and doesn't detach after birth, often resulting in life-threatening bleeding and a need for a hysterectomy. The strongest and most common risk factor is a previous cesarean delivery, as scarring from prior cesarean births can change how the placenta attaches in future pregnancies. New research led by UCLA Health suggests that how this scar tissue heals could be the key to better understand how PAS develops, who is at risk and why the placenta attaches abnormally. The study, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, used surgical specimens, a mouse model, and a lab-grown "accreta-in-a-dish" system to explore how collagen structure, when it becomes tangled or irregular, instead of neatly aligned, contributes to abnormal placental attachment. Through advanced 3D imaging, researchers found that tangled or irregular collagen at old uterine scars breaks down the normal boundary between the uterus and placenta, creating a permissive environment for abnormal placental attachment, and creating a high-risk delivery. Researchers collected samples from 13 patients with PAS and 10 with accreta risk factors but without PAS, taking tissue from where the placenta stuck and where it did not. Their findings showed that persistent inflammation and immune cells called macrographes interfere with normal scar remodeling, leading to abnormal collagen architecture that promotes abnormal placenta attachment. This work helps explain why some patients with prior cesarean develop placenta accreta while other do not and points to new ways we might identify risk earlier, before pregnancy or early in gestation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new University of Toronto-led study has discovered a possible biomarker linked to multiple sclerosis (MS) disease progression that could help identify patients most likely to benefit from new drugs. We think we have uncovered a potential biomarker that signals a patient is experiencing so-called 'compartmentalized inflammation' in the central nervous system, a phenomenon which is strongly liked to MS progression. Roughly 10 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with progressive MS, which leads to a gradual worsening of symptoms and increasing disability over time. Patients initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS, the more common form of the condition, can also go on to develop progressive MS. "We have immunomodulatory drugs that can modulate the relapsing and remitting phase of the disease," says Valeria Ramaglia, a scientist at the University Health Network's Krembil Brain Institute and an assistant professor of immunology at Temerty Medicine. "But for progressive MS, the landscape is completely different. Ramaglia, who co-led the study with Gommerman, notes that until their study, the research field did not have a good model that replicates the pathology of progressive MS. Using their mouse model, they also observed a roughly 800-fold increase in an immune signal called CXCL13 and significantly lower levels of another immune protein called BAFF. By treating these mice with BTK inhibitor drugs - which are currently being tested in clinical trials to target progressive MS - the researchers mapped out a circuit in the brain that led to grey matter injury and inflammation. They also found that BTK inhibitors restored CXCL13 and BAFF levels to those seen in healthy mice. These results led the researchers to hypothesize that the ratio of CXCL13 to BAFF could be a surrogate marker for leptomeningeal inflammation. Thus far, BTK inhibitors have seen mixed results in clinical trials with people with MS. Ramaglia says that without an easy way to detect leptomeningeal inflammation, the trials likely enrolled participants who did not have this feature and were unlikely to benefit from the drug. Any positive results from people with compartmentalized inflammation would then be diluted. "If we can use the ratio as a proxy to tell which patients should be treated with a drug that targets leptomeningeal inflammation, that can revolutionize the way we do clinical trials and how we treat patients," says Ramaglia. As she builds her own research program at the Krembil Brain Institute, Ramaglia is continuing to collaborate with Gommerman to explore how the CXCL13-to-BAFF ratio can be used to advance precision medicine for people with MS. Ramaglia is also planning to look at CXCL13 and BAFF levels in people with early MS to see if it can predict who is likely to develop progressive MS later. She credits her time as a research associate in Gommerman's lab as playing a key role in helping her become an independent investigator. "Jen's lab was a huge stepping stone for me. She gave me the space and independence to build my own research." Lymphotoxin-dependent elevated meningeal CXCL13:BAFF ratios drive gray matter injury.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cesarean delivery (C-section) rates continue to rise worldwide, experts at NYU Langone Health are highlighting a surgical technique that may help lower the risk of long-term complications. The endometrium-free closure technique (EFCT), described in a new article published online in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, focuses on how the uterus is closed after a cesarean delivery to support better healing. After a cesarean delivery, some patients develop small pockets or dents in the scar where the uterus was opened. These scar defects can cause symptoms like irregular bleeding, pelvic pain, or infertility. In some cases, they can also increase the risk of complications in future pregnancies, including placenta accreta spectrum. Even small refinements in surgical technique can have meaningful impacts on reproductive health. With EFCT, surgeons carefully identify this lining and avoid stitching through it. Previous studies have shown fewer and smaller scar defects when this lining is not included in the closure, as well as thicker, healthier tissue where the uterus was repaired. Although previous research has compared different closure styles, this paper points out that precision and correct alignment of the uterine layers appear to matter most. As C-section rates continue to increase worldwide, evidence-based refinements in technique are critical. This approach has potential to improve long-term reproductive outcomes and future studies should be conducted to assess its impact."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cleveland Clinic researchers have discovered that bacteria inside cancerous tumors may be key to understanding why immunotherapy works for some patients but not others. Two new studies, published simultaneously in Nature Cancer, reveal that elevated levels of bacteria in the tumor microenvironment suppress immune response, driving resistance to immunotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. By identifying bacteria as a key barrier to treatment, we're opening the door to new strategies for patient selection and targeted antibiotic therapies, potentially improving outcomes for those who don't benefit from immunotherapy." The research team, led by Dr. Chan, Daniel McGrail, Ph.D., assistant staff in the Center for Immunotherapy & Precision Immuno-Oncology, and Natalie Silver, M.D. In the first paper, Dr. McGrail analyzed genetic data from patient tumor samples, revealing that higher bacterial levels – not specific strains – weaken immune response. Dr. Silver confirmed these findings in preclinical models: antibiotics reduced tumor size and improved immune response, while adding bacteria made tumors resistant to immunotherapy. The team also worked with Renata Ferrarotto, M.D., from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to study the relationship between bacteria and treatment responses in head and neck cancer patient clinical trial samples. "Immunotherapy is a promising treatment option for patients with head and neck cancer, but the majority unfortunately do not respond," Dr. Silver said. This can help us identify patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy, with the goal of avoiding unnecessary risk and exposure. Ultimately, we aim to develop targeted interventions that restore the effectiveness of immunotherapy in for patients who do not initially respond." In the second paper, Dr. Chan led a data analysis of the Javelin HN100 Phase III clinical trial, which tested whether adding anti-PDL1 immunotherapy to standard chemoradiotherapy improved outcomes for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. While neutrophils are essential for combating bacterial infections, in cancer they can suppress the immune system needed for immunotherapy to work effectively. Building on these discoveries, Dr. Silver launched a clinical trial funded by the American Cancer Society and VeloSano, a Cleveland Clinic fund-raising movement to beat cancer, to test whether antibiotics can lower tumor microbiome levels and boost immunotherapy response in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Meanwhile, Dr. McGrail is studying how bacteria influence cancer development and why some tumors harbor more bacteria, aiming to develop new therapeutic strategies, and Dr. Chan is exploring how bacteria may induce DNA mutations in tumors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Within tumors in the human body, there are immune cells (macrophages) capable of fighting cancer, but they have been unable to perform their roles properly due to suppression by the tumor. KAIST researchers have overcome this limitation by developing a new therapeutic approach that directly converts immune cells inside tumors into anticancer cell therapies. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on the 30th that a research team led by Professor Ji-Ho Park of the Department of Bio and Brain Engineering has developed a therapy in which, when a drug is injected directly into a tumor, macrophages already present in the body absorb it, produce CAR (a cancer-recognizing device) proteins on their own, and are converted into anticancer immune cells known as "CAR-macrophages." Solid tumors—such as gastric, lung, and liver cancers—grow as dense masses, making it difficult for immune cells to infiltrate tumors or maintain their function. As a result, the effectiveness of existing immune cell therapies has been limited. CAR-macrophages, which have recently attracted attention as a next-generation immunotherapy, have the advantage of directly engulfing cancer cells while simultaneously activating surrounding immune cells to amplify anticancer responses. However, conventional CAR-macrophage therapies require immune cells to be extracted from a patient's blood, followed by cell culture and genetic modification. This process is time-consuming, costly, and has limited feasibility for real-world patient applications. To address this challenge, the research team focused on "tumor-associated macrophages" that are already accumulated around tumors. They developed a strategy to directly reprogram immune cells in the body by loading lipid nanoparticles—designed to be readily absorbed by macrophages—with both mRNA encoding cancer-recognition information and an immunostimulant that activates immune responses. In other words, in this study, CAR-macrophages were created by "directly converting the body's own macrophages into anticancer cell therapies inside the body." When this therapeutic agent was injected into tumors, macrophages rapidly absorbed it and began producing proteins that recognize cancer cells, while immune signaling was simultaneously activated. As a result, the generated "enhanced CAR-macrophages" showed markedly improved cancer cell-killing ability and activated surrounding immune cells, producing a powerful anticancer effect. This study presents a new concept of immune cell therapy that generates anticancer immune cells directly inside the patient's body," adding that "it is particularly meaningful in that it simultaneously overcomes the key limitations of existing CAR-macrophage therapies—delivery efficiency and the immunosuppressive tumor environment."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly identified and rare genetic variant slows the growth of mutated blood stem cells, researchers report, and it reduces the risk of leukemia. The findings offer insight into why some people are naturally more resistant to clonal expansion and age-related blood cancers despite acquiring risky mutations. As tissues age, they quietly accumulate many mutations that can drive cancer. In the blood-forming, or hematopoietic, system, such mutations often appear in otherwise healthy individuals as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a process in which certain blood stem cell (HSC) clones gain a growth advantage over non-mutated clones, allowing them to expand steadily over time. However, not all those with CHIP develop disease, and some mutant stem cell clones remain stable or even diminish over time, suggesting that inherited and/or environmental factors can restrain or slow CH. To investigate this, Gaurav Agarwal and colleagues performed a GWAS meta-analysis on data from more than 640,000 individuals to search for inherited DNA variants that protect against CH. Agarwal et al. identified a noncoding regulatory variant, rs17834140-T, that substantially lowers the risk of CHIP and reduces the likelihood of developing blood cancers. Using gene-edited human HSCs, Agarwal et al. discovered that rs17834140-T disrupts a binding site for the endothelial transcription factor GATA-2. This interference reduces MSI2 expression in HSCs, which further suppresses an entire network of genes that mutant stem cells rely on for competitive growth. Notably, the authors also found that this same gene network is unusually active in HSCs carrying high-risk cancer mutations and in children with acute myeloid leukemia, where it was associated with reduced survival. "The ability to predict disease risk at the individual level is a long-standing goal of modern medicine," write Francisco Caiado and Markus Manz in a related Perspective.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and AlveoliX have developed the first human 'lung-on-chip' model using stem cells taken from only one person. These chips simulate breathing motions and lung disease in an individual, holding promise for testing treatments for infections like tuberculosis (TB) and delivering personalized medicine. Air sacs in the lungs called alveoli are the essential site of gas exchange and also an important barrier against inhaled viruses and bacteria that cause respiratory diseases like flu or TB. Researchers have been working to recreate the battle between human cells and bacteria in the lab by building a 'lung-on-a-chip': small units of human lung on a plastic chip containing tiny channels and compartments. Until now, these 'lung-on-chip' devices have been made of a mixture of patient-derived and commercially available cells, meaning they can't fully replicate the lung function or disease progression of a single individual. In a study published today in Science Advances, the team at the Crick developed a new lung-on-chip model that contains only genetically identical cells derived from stem cells from a single donor. These epithelial and endothelial cells are separately grown on the top and bottom of a very thin membrane in a device manufactured by biotechnology company AlveoliX to recreate an air sac barrier. This stimulates the formation of microvilli, a key feature of alveolar epithelial cells to increase surface area for lung functions (image). Eventually, five days after infection, the endothelial and epithelial cell barriers collapsed, showing that the air sac function had broken down. Max Gutierrez, Principal Group Leader of the Host-Pathogen Interactions in Tuberculosis Laboratory at the Crick and senior author, said: "Given the increasing need for non-animal technologies, organ-on-chip approaches are becoming ever more important to recreate human systems, avoiding differences in lung anatomy, makeup of immune cells and disease development between animals and humans. "Composed of entirely genetically identical cells, the chips could be built from stem cells from people with particular genetic mutations. This would allow us to understand how infections like TB will impact an individual and test the effectiveness of treatments like antibiotics." TB is a slow-moving disease, with months between infection and the development of symptoms, so there's an increasing need to understand what's happening in the unseen early stages. We were successfully able to mimic these initial events in TB progression, giving a holistic picture of how different lung cells respond to infections. We're excited that the new model could be applied to a huge range of research, such as other respiratory infections or lung cancer, and we're now looking at refining the chip by incorporating other important cell types."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New measurements from Milan's city airport reveal how everyday airport operations, not just jet exhausts, quietly release industrial chemicals into the air we breathe, reshaping how aviation pollution is understood. Study: Tracking the source: First evidence of Benzothiazoles in outdoor airport aerosol. Particulate matter (PM) with a diameter of 10 micrometers (PM10) in the atmosphere is a significant carrier of benzothiazoles (BTH), contributing to air pollution. Flying is a significant part of modern life, and its role in transportation is only set to grow. However, it is also recognized as a contributor to environmental harm through air pollution. While exhaust-related pollution has been studied in the past, including the emission of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides, little is known about non-exhaust pollutants, such as Tire Wear Particles (TWPs). TWPs are tiny particles constantly shed from the tires of land vehicles and aircraft as they run across the hard pavement. They end up as microplastic pollution in water, soil, and air, with 83 tons being released from Frankfurt Airport alone in 2019, solely due to aircraft tire wear. Their organic composition remains unclear, even though they contain not only rubber polymer but also additives that can be hazardous to the environment. For instance, TWPs can release BTH, organic compounds used to produce antifreeze, de-icing solutions, pesticides, and in other major industries, including steel, paper, and textiles. They are irritant, corrosive, and acutely toxic to living organisms. BTH levels have been used to trace non-exhaust road traffic emissions; however, they have not been used to trace TWPs from flying aircraft. This study is the first of its kind. The study was conducted at Milano Linate Airport, based on outdoor PM10 concentrations measured in February and March 2023. This is significantly lower than the levels reported in some heavily polluted international airports, including one in China. In addition to measuring eight types of BTH in the airport aerosol, the investigators also measured major ions and organic acids found in PM10 to understand the trends of each molecule type. The findings indicate that the Linate airport area serves as a significant local source of benzothiazole components in outdoor atmospheric PM10. These include BTH, 2-amino-benzothiazole (BTH-NH2), 2-methyl-benzothiazole (BTH-Me), 2-methylthio-benzothiazole (BTH-MeS), 2-mercapto-benzothiazole (BTH-SH), and 2-benzothiazole-sulfonic acid (BTH-SO3H). This could be because the airport became busier in March relative to February, although TWPs are too small to increase the mass of PM10 significantly. Very high nitrate levels were observed, mainly from the conversion of nitrogen oxides emitted from the airplane engines to nitrates, coupled with nitrate-polluted air in the city environment. Such secondary reactions appeared to be common in the airport area. The measurements of these chemicals varied regularly over the week, peaking on Friday and Saturday and dropping on Tuesday. This suggests a relationship with airport activity rather than the actual flight activity, as arrivals and departures do not follow this trend. In particular, BTH-SO3H and BTH-NH2 levels were closely correlated, indicating their common source, probably the airport. Another group of BTHs all peaked on the same two days, indicating that not all BTHs arise from the same source. Some, like BTH-MeS, may be a biodegradation product of BTH-SH. Airborne sodium, chloride, and magnesium levels were relatively abundant, possibly derived from antifreeze or de-icing products, since Linate airport is 130 km from the nearest seashore. Using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), a chemometric method, the scientists found that the measurements fell into three clusters of BTH, each associated with distinct activities. One cluster was linked to airport activity, specifically the number of vehicles or airplanes in operation. Another cluster was related to de-icing or anti-icing procedures at airports. The third cluster was associated with medium-range transport. This emphasizes that exhaust emissions are not the primary source of BTHs. However, the risk of occupational exposure to BTHs at this airport was low. This unique study examined eight chemicals related to tire wear in outdoor PM10 air at an airport. It showed that Milano Linate Airport acts as an important local contributor to BTHs in the air, similar in composition to the aerosol in cities with heavy traffic. However, the risk of hazardous exposure to BTHs at this airport was low. Dr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large population data from Iran show that body weight and iron intake help statistically explain the depression–headache link, while physical activity plays a supporting, indirect role rather than a direct one. Study: Mediating effects of physical activity, BMI, and dietary iron intake on the relationship between depression and chronic headaches. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined whether dietary iron intake, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity help account for the association between depression and chronic headaches using model-based statistical mediation analyses. The findings indicate that the association between depression and chronic headaches is partially mediated by higher BMI and lower dietary iron intake, but not by physical activity as an independent pathway within the specified analytical model. Depression is a common and disabling mental health condition that affects mood, cognition, sleep, and quality of life. It is a major contributor to global disability and is particularly prevalent in South Asia and the Middle East, including Iran. Chronic headaches affect a large proportion of adults and frequently co-occur with depression, suggesting a close and complex relationship. However, the biological and behavioral mechanisms linking depression to chronic headaches remain insufficiently understood. Biopsychosocial theories highlight the interplay between psychological factors, physiological processes, and lifestyle behaviors in chronic headache disorders. Several modifiable factors are correlated with both depression and chronic headaches. Depression has been linked to disrupted iron metabolism and lower dietary iron intake, which may increase vulnerability to headaches. Individuals with depression are also often less physically active and more likely to have higher BMI, both of which are established risk factors for chronic headache disorders. Although previous studies have independently connected depression to physical activity, BMI, and iron intake, it remains unclear whether these factors statistically mediate the relationship between depression and chronic headaches. Researchers analyzed cross-sectional data from the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) cohort, part of a larger population study conducted in western Iran. Participants were adults aged 35–65 years who had lived in the region for at least nine months per year. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using standardized electronic questionnaires that captured sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history, depression status, and headache frequency. Physical activity was assessed using validated questionnaires and expressed as metabolic-equivalent task-hours. Dietary iron intake was estimated using validated food-frequency questionnaires and the Iranian Food Composition Table. Depression was identified through a psychologist's assessment or self-reported antidepressant use. The analysis included 9,918 adults with a mean age of 47.3 years. Most participants were female, married, and had relatively low educational attainment. The majority did not have depression or chronic headaches. Participants, on average, had moderate physical activity levels, were overweight by BMI criteria, and consumed approximately 20 mg of dietary iron per day. Individuals with depression differed significantly from those without depression in BMI, physical activity, iron intake, and chronic headache prevalence. Correlation analyses showed that depression was significantly associated with higher BMI, lower physical activity, lower dietary iron intake, and a greater likelihood of chronic headaches. Age, sex, marital status, and education were included as covariates. Depression showed a significant direct association with chronic headaches and indirect associations through higher BMI and lower iron intake. Physical activity was not independently associated with headache occurrence after accounting for other pathways. Physical activity contributed indirectly through its associations with BMI and iron intake rather than acting as a direct mediator. The findings suggest that depression is associated with chronic headaches through both direct associations and indirect, statistically modeled pathways involving body mass index and dietary iron intake. Strengths include the large population-based sample, standardized measurements, and simultaneous modeling of multiple mediators. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which prevents causal inference, and reliance on self-reported data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even within the healthy range, small differences in blood sodium were associated with measurable changes in brain excitability, offering new insight into how subtle physiology may shape neural function in healthy adults. Study: Plasma sodium levels are related to resting motor threshold in healthy humans. Specifically, lower sodium concentrations within the normal physiological range were associated with increased cortical excitability. These findings suggest that the precise ionic composition of human blood may be associated with stable neurobiological characteristics, although the data reflect associations rather than causal effects. Modern neurobiology research posits that mammalian, and by extension human, brains operate on a delicate balance of charged ions, particularly sodium, calcium, and potassium, that translocate in and out of cells to generate electrical impulses. This process, termed electrolyte homeostasis, is highly critical for life, evolutionarily conserved, and tightly regulated. When this balance is severely disrupted, such as in cases of hyponatremia, the consequences are often physiologically catastrophic, including seizures and other neurological crises. Previous research has established healthy boundaries for electrolyte concentrations, which are believed to be sufficient to maintain cortical excitability, and these are commonly assessed using indirect neurophysiological measures. More recent research challenges this view, suggesting that even slight between-individual variability in ionic concentrations may influence learning, memory, and susceptibility to neurological conditions. Prior attempts to verify these effects have produced conflicting results, often due to small sample sizes, methodological limitations, and insufficiently controlled exploratory analyses. The present study aimed to determine whether variation in electrolyte levels among healthy individuals is associated with differences in brain electrical activity. Blood samples were collected to measure plasma concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and phosphate. Cortical excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation, a non-invasive technique that induces small electrical currents in the brain via a magnetic coil placed over the scalp. Resting motor threshold was calculated by stimulating the motor cortex region controlling hand muscles and adjusting stimulation intensity until the minimum strength required to elicit a muscle response in at least half of the attempts was reached. Analyses revealed a statistically robust association between plasma sodium levels and cortical excitability. A significant positive correlation was observed between sodium concentration and RMT, indicating that lower sodium levels were associated with lower motor thresholds and therefore higher excitability. All participants had sodium levels within the standard clinical reference range of 136 to 143 mmol/L. Adjusting for age and sex did not materially alter these findings, supporting the robustness of the association while not implying causality. These findings provide preliminary evidence that slight differences in blood sodium concentration, even within the normal range, are associated with differences in resting motor threshold. The authors hypothesize that lower extracellular sodium may subtly influence membrane electrophysiology by affecting sodium channel dynamics or tissue conductivity, thereby altering the effective magnetic field during stimulation. Future studies incorporating experimental manipulation of sodium levels, individualized electric field modeling, and longitudinal designs are needed to determine whether sodium levels directly influence cortical excitability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a new study in the journal Science Bulletin, researchers at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University have discovered a new way that aggressive breast cancer cells escape the immune defenses. This discovery also reveals a potential weakness that could make these tumors highly sensitive to existing immunotherapies. It has been known that many cancer cells have high levels of DNA damage, and bits of DNA can leak into the cell cytoplasm. However, researchers show that some tumors fight back using a specific molecule called FAM83H-AS1. This molecule acts like a switch, hijacking the body's alarm system. This shift helps the cancer build an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, allowing it to grow. The same inflammatory process that protects the tumor also causes it to produce high levels of a protein called PD-L1, a key drug target for cancer immunotherapy. The research indicates that patients with tumors overexpressing FAM83H-AS1 could be ideal candidates for these existing treatments. It is very likely that this region harbors important, yet-to-be-discovered oncogenes." Man-Li Luo, study principal investigator, Professor and Deputy Director of Medical Research Center, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University While lncRNAs vastly outnumber protein-coding genes in the human genome, their functions are often poorly understood, overshadowing their potential significance. Despite clear evidence linking its overexpression to poor prognosis in a wide range of cancers, the molecular machinery driving its role in tumor progression has remained elusive. The team of researchers discovered that FAM83H-AS1 is frequently amplified and highly active in tumor tissues. High levels of this RNA molecule are linked to reduced anti-tumor immunity and poorer survival rates in breast cancer patients. Researchers reveal that FAM83H-AS1 hijacks a critical alarm pathway known as cGAS-STING. Instead of triggering a potent anti-tumor interferon response, high levels of FAM83H-AS1 shift the pathway's signaling toward an NF-κB-driven pro-tumor inflammatory response. This switch effectively disarming body's natural defenses, turning immune attacks into cancer-fueling inflammation. These findings establish FAM83H-AS1 as a key oncogene within the chromosome 8q24 region. The term "gene desert" is a desert only for protein-coding genes, not for functional non-coding elements like this pivotal lncRNA. There are more "dark forests" of non-coding regulation waiting to be explored in the genomes. Given that the overexpression of FAM83H-AS1 has been linked to poor prognosis in many cancers, the researchers believe its immune evasion mechanism may not be limited to breast cancer. Their work also points directly to a therapeutic insight-tumors characterized by FAM83H-AS1 overexpression or the consequent NF-κB activation may be particularly vulnerable to checkpoint blockade therapy. cGAS-STING activation mediated by FAM83H-AS1/HMGB1 elicits NF-κB-dependent immune evasion in breast cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For millions suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), managing flare-ups often involves powerful drugs with significant side effects. The research team from Huazhong University of Science and Technology and Tongji Hospital developed a "splenic nerve wireless stimulator" (SpNWS). The key innovation is that the entire device – its electrodes, interconnects, and wireless power receivers – is constructed from a specially engineered conductive hydrogel. The biggest challenges for long-term neural interfaces are mechanical mismatch and fibrosis caused by rigid implants. Our hydrogel device seamlessly conforms to delicate nerves, operates without batteries, and communicates wirelessly through the skin, which minimizes long-term damage and rejection." Zhiqiang Luo, corresponding author of the study In a rat model of chronic colitis, the SpNWS device was implanted and activated wirelessly for 20 minutes daily. The treatment led to remarkable recovery: reduced colon damage, less weight loss, and restored intestinal structure. Crucially, after five weeks, the device showed excellent biocompatibility with no significant scar tissue encapsulation, a common problem that leads to the failure of conventional implants. This work establishes a versatile platform for "electroceutical" therapy. The soft, wireless design could be adapted to interface with various nerves to treat a range of conditions, from rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes to metabolic disorders, ushering in a new era of bioelectronic medicine. Chronic neurostimulation of splenic nerve enabled by hydrogel-bioelectronics for wireless electroceutical immunomodulation therapy. GLP-1 agonists are pivotal in obesity care, promoting weight loss and addressing related health issues, with a focus on personalized, holistic treatment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lenia Watson-Burton, a 37-year-old U.S. Navy administrator, expected that cosmetic surgery would get rid of stubborn fat quickly and easily — just as the web advertising promised. Instead, she died three days after a liposuction-like procedure called AirSculpt at the San Diego office of Elite Body Sculpture, a cosmetic surgery chain with more than 30 offices across the U.S. and Canada, court records show. Cosmetic surgery chains setting up shop in multiple states depend heavily on advertising to attract customers: television, print, social media influencers, even texts hawking discounted holiday rates. The pitches typically promise patients life-changing body shaping with minimal pain and a quick recovery. Yet there's no federal requirement that surgery companies post evidence supporting the truth and accuracy of these marketing claims. No agency tracks how frequently patients persuaded by sales pitches sustain painful complications such as infections, how effectively surgeons and nursing staff follow up and treat injuries, or whether companies selling new aesthetic devices and methods have adequately trained surgeons to use them safely. In 2023, Watson-Burton's husband and six children and stepchildren sued Elite Body Sculpture and plastic surgeon Heidi Regenass for medical malpractice, alleging that the thin cannula the surgeon used to remove fat perforated Watson-Burton's bowel, causing her death. The suit also accused Elite Body Sculpture of posting false or misleading advertising on its website, such as describing the clinic's branded procedure AirSculpt as "gentle on the body" and stating: "Our patients take the fewest possible risks and get back to their regular routine as soon as 24-48 hours post-operation." Watson-Burton was one of three patients who died after having liposuction and fat transfer operations performed by Regenass from October 2022 to February 2023, court records state. Families of all three women sued the surgeon, who denied wrongdoing in legal filings. Two other wrongful death cases are pending, including a suit by an Ohio woman who alleges her mother relied on promises on Regenass' website that the operation in California would be safe with a quick recovery. Neither Regenass nor her attorneys responded to repeated requests for comment. Emails and phone calls to Elite Body Sculpture's Miami headquarters were not returned. State and federal authorities do have the power to prohibit false or misleading medical advertising of all types, though enforcement is spotty, particularly when promotions pop up online. That means patients must do their own homework in evaluating cosmetic surgery marketing pitches. "While consumers should be able to trust that ad claims are substantiated because the law requires them to be, the reality is that it pays for consumers to bring a skeptical eye," said Mary Engle, an executive vice president at BBB National Programs. Founded by cosmetic surgeon Aaron Rollins, Elite Body Sculpture says in Securities and Exchange Commission filings that it offers a "premium patient experience and luxurious, spa-like atmosphere" at its growing network of centers. The publicly traded company, based in Miami Beach and backed by private equity investors, markets AirSculpt as being "much less invasive than traditional liposuction" and providing "faster healing with superior results." The ads say that AirSculpt "requires no scalpel, or stitches, and only leaves behind a freckle-sized scar!" A lawyer for Rollins, Robert Peal, responded to an email but didn't comment. Many AirSculpt patients opt to have fat that is removed from their stomachs or other places injected into their buttocks, often called a Brazilian butt lift. Since March 2023, at least seven patients have filed lawsuits accusing Elite Body Sculpture of running misleading advertising or misrepresenting results, arguing, among other things, that they felt more pain or healed much more slowly than the ads led them to believe they would, court records show. The Watson-Burton family argued in their lawsuit that some marketing claims about AirSculpt were simply not true. That feature didn't protect Watson-Burton, who paid $12,000 for the operation, hoping for a "quick and timely recovery" before a scheduled U.S. Navy deployment, according to the lawsuit. Rather than being gentle on the body, AirSculpt was "extremely painful, highly invasive, unsafe, required more than a short 24-hour recovery period and could and did damage internal organs," according to the suit. Surgeons noted her injuries included three perforations of the small bowel and sepsis. An autopsy report cited complications of the cosmetic surgery, ruling she died after becoming "septic following intraoperative small bowel perforation." Her death certificate lists the cause as "complications of abdominoplasty." In court filings, Elite Body Sculpture said Watson-Burton had "experienced an uncommon surgical complication." It denied any liability or that its ads made misrepresentations. Social media pitches and web advertising also led Tamala Smith, 55, of Toledo, Ohio, to Regenass for liposuction and a fat transfer, court records state. Smith was dead less than two weeks later, one of two other women who died following elective operations Regenass performed from December 2022 to February 2023, court records show. She chose Regenass after viewing the doctor's Instagram page, according to a lawsuit filed by Smith's daughter, Ste'Aira Ballard, who lives in Toledo. The ads described the surgeon as an "awake liposuction and fat transfer specialist," while her website assured patients they would feel minimal pain and be "back to work in 24-48 hours," according to the suit. During the three-hour operation on Feb. 8, 2023, at Pacific Liposculpture's Newport Beach office, Regenass removed fat from Smith's abdomen and flanks and redistributed it to her buttocks, according to the suit. Smith called the office at least twice in subsequent days to report pain and swelling, but a staffer told her that was normal, according to the suit. When Ballard couldn't reach her mother, she called the hospital only to learn Smith hadn't turned up for her overnight shift for two days. The hospital called police and asked for a welfare check at the extended-stay hotel in Glendale, California, where Smith had been living. An officer discovered her body on the bed "surrounded by towels and sheets that are stained with brown and green fluids," according to a coroner's report in the court file. A countertop in the room was "covered in medical paperwork detailing post-operative instructions from a liposuction clinic," according to the report. Ballard said she learned of her mother's death when she called Smith's cellphone; a police officer answered and delivered the devastating news. Ballard said she still has not gotten over the shock and grief. "It bothers me because how does someone that dedicated their life to save other people's lives end up deceased in a hotel, as if her life didn't matter?" She believes her mother, a registered nurse, would not have gone to the surgeon had she known someone had died after an operation Regenass performed at the Pacific Liposculpture San Diego office. Terri Bishop, 55, a truck driving instructor who lived in Temecula, California, died on Dec. 24, 2022, about three weeks after undergoing liposuction and fat transfer at Pacific Liposculpture, a company with a history of run-ins with state regulators. Pacific Liposculpture did not respond to requests for comment. The company also argued that Ballard waited too long to file suit. Bishop, who had a history of smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure, died from "arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease aggravated by viral pneumonia (Influenza A H1 2009)," according to a Riverside County medical examiner's report made part of the court record. The family disagrees and is arguing that Bishop died from blood clots, a known complication of surgery. "I don't think they were straightforward with the risk and complications that could occur," Ballard said. Ballard filed a complaint against Regenass with the California Medical Board, which the board is investigating, according to documents she provided to KFF Health News and NBC News. She also hopes the investigation will shake loose more details of what happened to her mother. Concerns about sales pitches for cosmetic surgery date back decades. Witnesses testifying at a June 1989 congressional hearing held by a subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee in Washington heard a litany of horror stories of patients maimed by surgeons with dubious training and credentials. Subcommittee Chairman Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said patients were victimized by deceptive and false ads that promised a "quick, easy and painless way to change your life — all through the cosmetic surgery miracle." Calling for reform, Wyden added: "So, cosmetic surgery consumers are largely on their own. All these years later, there's far more territory to police: an onslaught of web advertising, such as splashy "before and after" photos, online posts, and podcasts by social media influencers and others courted by surgery companies in a costly effort to attract business. Under Federal Trade Commission guidelines, medical advertising must be "truthful, not deceptive, and backed up by competent and reliable scientific evidence," according to Janice Kopec of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. Any claims that are "suggested or reasonably implied" by ads also must be accurate. Most cosmetic surgery sites offer little or no such support for specific claims — such as recovery times or pain levels — on their websites. "There is no requirement that the substantiation be made available to consumers, either on a website or upon demand," Engle, who is also a former FTC official, said in an email. The law permits "puffery," or boastful statements that no person would likely take at face value, or that can't be proved, such as, "'You've tried all the rest, now try the best,'" Engle said. Where to draw the line between acceptable boasts and unverified claims can be contentious. Spitzer argued that Athēnix touted its "micro-body-contouring" technique as "safer" than traditional liposuction and offered "outstanding results with less pain and downtime" without backing that up, according to the suit. "There is no study or evidence to support these statements and no scientific consensus about the use of these new techniques," Spitzer argued. While there's little indication that local or state authorities are stepping up scrutiny of cosmetic surgery advertising, federal authorities have signaled they intend to crack down on dubious advertising claims made by drug manufacturers. In a letter sent to drug companies in September, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary wrote that "deceptive advertising is sadly the current norm" on social media platforms and that the agency would no longer tolerate these violations. To prove medical negligence, injured patients generally must show that their care fell below what a "reasonably prudent" doctor with similar training would have provided. In their defense, surgeons may argue that complications are a risk of any operation and that a poor outcome doesn't mean the doctor was negligent. Some lawsuits filed by injured patients add allegations that advertisements by surgery chains misled them, or that surgeons failed to fully explain possible risks of injuries, a requirement known in medical circles as informed consent. She underwent a $15,000 AirSculpt procedure at Elite Body Sculpture's clinic in Wayne, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. After an hour's drive home, Meehan said her skin felt like it was burning and she called 911. Scott Hollenbeck, immediate past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, said recovering from liposuction in a day "seems unrealistic" given the bruising and swelling that can occur. "The idea that you could return to work 24 hours after effective liposuction seems like extremely bad advice," Hollenbeck said. Ads that promised patients minimal discomfort also have come under attack in patient lawsuits. More than 20 other medical malpractice cases reviewed by KFF Health News made similar allegations of unexpected pain during operations at cosmetic surgery chains using lidocaine for pain relief in "awake liposuction." One patient suing Elite Body Sculpture in Cook County, Illinois, alleged she "was crying due to [the] severe pain" of an operation in September 2023. The defendants have not filed an answer in court. The practice didn't respond to a request for comment. Engle, the former FTC official, said that while claims of discomfort are somewhat subjective, they still must be "truthful and substantiated," such as supported by a "valid, reliable clinical study of patients' experience."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Red blood cells are essential for oxygen transport and immune function in the human body. When these cells become abnormally shaped, they can indicate serious health conditions, including diabetes, malaria, hereditary blood disorders, and vascular diseases. Currently, medical diagnosis relies primarily on optical microscopy, which requires fluorescent staining and manual inspection by trained experts. This traditional approach suffers from significant limitations: it is time-consuming, subjective, poorly reproducible, and often misses subtle changes in individual cells. Other advanced techniques like electron microscopy and super-resolution imaging can visualize cells at the nanoscale but are expensive, operationally complex, and still require staining. There is an urgent clinical need for rapid, objective, and label-free methods to analyze red blood cell deformations at the single-cell level. A research team led by Prof. Nan Zeng at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School has now developed an innovative solution using polarized light technology. The system shines polarized light at cells and captures their unique polarization signatures. By combining theoretical modeling with machine learning algorithms, the researchers extracted six specific polarization feature parameters that quantitatively describe cell size, shape, refractive index, and surface characteristics. The team validated their approach by testing red blood cells under various stress conditions that mimic disease states. Results showed that the polarization parameters could effectively distinguish between normal cells and those with abnormal deformations. Furthermore, when analyzing mixed blood samples containing both healthy and abnormal cells, a Random Forest classifier using these parameters achieved over 94% accuracy in determining cell type proportions. The technology offers several key advantages: it requires no staining or complex sample preparation, can analyze hundreds of cells per minute for high-throughput screening, and provides objective, quantitative measurements rather than subjective visual assessments. This label-free approach could be readily adapted for routine blood screenings in hospitals and clinics, potentially enabling earlier disease detection, more accurate diagnosis, and better monitoring of treatment responses for blood-related disorders.
