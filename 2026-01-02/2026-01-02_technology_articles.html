                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A microwave-sized factory in space has generated plasma for the first time, bringing us one step closer to manufacturing materials in microgravity for use on Earth. Space Forge successfully activated the manufacturing furnace on board its first satellite, ForgeStar-1, reaching temperatures of 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 degrees Celsius) in low Earth orbit, the company announced this week. With its groundbreaking feat, the company established the needed conditions to produce semiconductor materials in space and further develop its orbital factory. As space becomes more accessible, so do the many ways we can benefit from sending and operating satellites in orbit. In-space manufacturing leverages the unique orbital environment to create advanced materials, ones that bypass gravity-induced defects on Earth. Space Forge's recent plasma demonstration is an industry first, and it confirms that the extreme conditions needed for crystal growth can be created in low-Earth orbit. “Generating plasma on orbit represents a fundamental shift,” Joshua Western, CEO and co-founder of Space Forge, said in a statement. “It proves that the essential environment for advanced crystal growth can be achieved on a dedicated, commercial satellite—opening the door to a completely new manufacturing frontier.” The company aims to manufacture materials for semiconductors, which can have multiple applications on Earth, such as electronics, communications infrastructure, and transport. “This sort of semiconductor would go on to be in the 5G tower in which you get your mobile phone signal… it's going to be in the latest planes,” Western said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The era of Stranger Things as we know it came to an end on New Year's Day. But, as we know all too well, shows that are too successful to end go the route of spinoffs, and Stranger Things is no exception. Outside of its animated series, the Duffer Brothers have shed the tiniest bit of light on what their show's spin-off will center on. In a new interview with Variety, in which the Duffer Brothers tried their damndest to keep the spirit of Stranger Things‘ ambiguous ending ambiguous, they were pressed on what they were cooking with a mysterious MacGuffin introduced in Vecna's backstory during the final episode. Afterwards, he opens the briefcase and discovers a red glowing rock that corrupts his body. The dying words of said man are a warning: “You must resist it. Despite how overly long the final episode of Stranger Things was, clocking in with a two-hour-plus run time, who the mysterious man was, why he was carrying a briefcase with a red rock, and who was after said man were all left up in the air. When pressed by Variety to clarify what that rock was all about, Matt Duffer struggled with how to describe it with clarity. When Variety offered the phrase “spinoffy,” Matt acquiesced, apologizing for how tight-lipped they've been about where the series will go in its inevitable spinoffs. I do want to explain, just because people's expectations go in certain directions: The spinoff is going to delve into that and explain that, and you're going to understand it,” Matt Duffer told Variety. So it's not a deep exploration of the Mind Flayer or anything like that. It's very fresh and very new, but yes, it will answer some of the loose threads that are remaining.” Ross Duffer followed up by giving a progress report on the Stranger Things spin-off, revealing that they're already working on it. Matt piggybacked on his brother's reply, saying that the Stranger Things spinoff will act as a fresh start for them, providing the series creators a clean slate to work with “completely new characters, new town, new world, new mythology.” So for all those folks holding out hope for the Duffer Brothers to provide some closure over whether The Right Side Up hard confirms or not the fate of its core cast, you're going to have to hold on to the ambiguity of its ending and decide for yourself which fate works best for you. Among the more immediate Stranger Things spinoff projects coming to Netflix, Stranger Things: Tales From '85, a 3DCG animated series set between seasons two and three, is slated to premiere on the streamer later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nature gives rise to fascinating adaptations, which can sometimes lead to organisms living in some strange situations. The relationship between bark beetles, spruce trees, and a type of fungus is a case in point. According to a new study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the bark beetles protect themselves from fungal infections by leeching off the trees' stored antibiotic compounds. Examining the ways each organism has adapted to its neighbors could help scientists create organic treatments for parasites, the researchers said. Spruce bark beetles (Ips typographus) are a common pest that burrows deep into a tree, siphoning away nutrients. Although bark beetles are rarely aggressive enough to actually kill a tree, their presence can threaten those weakened by natural or human-made disasters. What's more, “little can be done to control most bark beetles once trees have been attacked,” according to a report by California's Integrated Pest Management Program. Then there is the fungus, Beauveria bassiana. This fungus is neither the tree's nor the beetle's friend; as a pathogenic species, it can infect both organisms. To find out, the team performed detailed chemical analyses of the antibiotic chemicals produced by spruce trees to fight off fungal infections. Surprisingly, that involved a sophisticated process in which the insects converted these chemicals into even more toxic substances, with greater protective ability against fungal attacks. “We did not expect the beetles to be able to convert the spruce's defenses into more toxic derivatives in such a targeted way,” Ruo Sun, study lead author and a biochemist at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology Jena in Germany, said in a statement. It's quite unlikely that any organism involved in this system knowingly keeps the others at bay, but it's certainly a naturally derived solution to pest control, according to the paper. For instance, scientists could take inspiration from the fungus to create more effective pesticides. Some fungal strains “had naturally infected and killed [the beetles],” Sun said. As such, identifying these strains became the central goal of their research, she added. Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meson creator Jussi Pakkanen says Debian's decades-old bug handling workflow is discouraging maintainers and slowing fixes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A dispute has flared up inside the Debian project after a veteran maintainer criticized the Debian's bug tracking system as outdated and increasingly unworkable for modern software development. The comments, made by Meson build system creator and Debian maintainer Jussi Pakkanen on December 22, argue that Debian's reliance on email-based bug control is actively discouraging contributors and leaving bugs poorly maintained. Pakkanen, who maintains Meson packages in Debian, said the project's Bug Tracking System still requires developers to manage bug states by sending specially formatted emails to control addresses. While Debian provides a web interface for viewing bugs, actions such as closing, reassigning, or adjusting severity are typically performed via email commands rather than through a modern authenticated web UI. Even when fixes are available upstream, in his view, the system creates unnecessary overhead for maintainers and increases the likelihood that bugs remain open or misclassified long after they should have been resolved. He also raised concerns about security and auditability, noting that anyone who understands the email syntax can submit control messages, with optional rather than mandatory authentication. Not everyone agrees with Pakkanen; some developers argue that email provides a stable, standardized interface that does not depend on centralized web services, or account management. Requests for a full-featured web-based interface to manage Debian bugs are not new. Debian's own bug tracker archives show that similar proposals date back to 2000, with some marked as “wontfix” on the grounds that email-based control was sufficient and more resilient. Pakkanen has not called for Debian to abandon its current bug tracking workflow, however, suggesting instead that an incremental approach in which a web service generates the same control emails behind the scenes could be implemented. This would preserve compatibility with the current backend while offering maintainers a usable interface. Over time, Debian could tighten controls on direct email submissions once a viable alternative exists, Pakkanen says. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The best source of media for this project are DVDs and Blu-rays that you already own. Check your local laws before doing so, but you should be able to rip your discs using a tool such as Handbrake. We also have a full guide on how to rip your discs to digital files. So let's build our own media server! For this, you will need a USB drive formatted as NTFS, along with your media sorted into folders. I tend to organize my media into the following: With the media already on the USB drive, let's get it connected to what will become our Plex server. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Locate the drive's name, label and UUID using blkid. In my case, the device name was /dev/sda1, its label was “Files,” and the UUID was “2EB36FFA4908D959.” Make a note of these details. On my Raspberry Pi the drive was /media/pi/Files. Set the permissions for the folder so that it is accessible to anyone. Yes, this is bad security practice for production servers, but for a small home media server, we can mitigate the risk. Remember to change the path to match the location of your media files. Unmount the drive and then remount using NTFS to test that the process works. Remember to replace the device name and the mount point with values that match yours. Remember to change the UUID and /media/pi/Files mount to match the results from Step 2. On the Raspberry Pi, open a browser and visit the Plex Media Server download page. Click on the dropdown and select the version you want to download, in this case, Linux. I'm using the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS, so I chose the Armv8 download. If you are adapting this how-to to run on an Intel- or AMD-based machine, select the 32- or 64-bit version for your architecture. Open a terminal and install the downloaded Plex package, which will be in your Downloads folder. Wait for the installation to complete. This will give Plex access to drives and other devices. The -I is a capital i. On another device, on the same network, open a web browser and go to the IP address of your Plex server, followed by port 32400 and then /web. Here is what my URL looked like. Start the Plex setup process and then name your server. Create a library of movies, this will point to the location of the USB drive that has all of your media. Click Done to finish the installation. Plex's user interface is familiar to anyone who has used a streaming service. In the free version that we are using, it also gets the advertisements right to your eyeballs. There are plenty of free streams to watch, but we're really here for our content. Let's take a look around the user interface and get to know Plex. Main menu: Here we can look through our watchlist, live TV shows, movies & shows. Just above is the “hamburger menu” to go in depth on your configuration. Filters: Filter the content to show trending, what friends are watching, and activity. This includes user accounts, libraries, and we can even cast our Plex viewing to a compatible device. Libraries: The mounted USB disk full of our movies is linked to from here. Here we can see the advertised content. As you can see, my library is pretty light, as this is a test setup. You've just made your own streaming service, one that will share your DVD and media library to devices across your home. You can use the web interface to watch your movies, or use one of the many Plex client apps for Smart TVs, phones, consoles, and Amazon's Alexa. Les Pounder is an associate editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Users have posted photos of damaged 3D printers, but Bambu Lab says the issue has already been fixed. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Concerns are being raised within the 3D printing community regarding the Bambu Lab A1 after a recent video by YouTuber Grant Posner (3D Musketeers) revealed a possible safety issue. Posner has seen an alarming number of A1 printers with charred or melted cases, which suggests that the A1's AC power distribution board may be operating above normal temperatures, posing a risk of fire. Posner claims this thermistor is being pushed too close to its rated limits. Posner hosts the popular Print Fix Friday series on YouTube, where he analyzes 3D printing fails and offers practical advice. Meanwhile, Redditors on another thread suggest that Posner simply has an ax to grind with Bambu. During a recent 3D Musketeers livestream, Posner examined an A1 printer with a thermal camera and clocked the NTC thermistor at 140° C, which he said was unacceptable for an electronic component. After doing further research, Posner found out that the NTC thermistor is rated for 200C. “While the component in question is rated for the temps we have directly measured,” Posner said, “it is clear there are some issues with part quality, consistency, or local power that are causing machines to catastrophically fail.” We reached out to Bambu Lab for a statement on the melting A1 printers. A representative was quick to acknowledge the issue, but insisted that failure rates were extremely low (around .052%), directly connected to preventable power surges, and were fixed in Q3 of 2025 when the NTC was removed and the board redesigned. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The company stressed that no fires have been reported and that all Bambu Lab printers comply with applicable safety standards and use flame-retardant materials. As a result, the risk of fire is considered extremely low.” Bambu Lab said safety issues are taken very seriously and that an engineering team “conducted a detailed analysis of the affected units. We observed that these cases often correlate with regions and time periods experiencing severe thunderstorms, though other sources of grid surge cannot be fully excluded.” Posner said that he has been in contact with Bambu Lab, and despite his conversation with the team at Formnext, he still believes the printer is a fire hazard and should be recalled. He suggests that anyone with an A1 should place a fireproof paving stone underneath the machine. Bambu Lab told us that all 3D printers, like any valuable household electronic device, should be used with a surge protector to prevent damage from power spikes. The 3D printer was subject to an official recall we reported on in January 2024. Denise Bertacchi is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US, covering 3D printing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clicks Technology, a company known for making physical keyboards for smartphones, is launching two new devices ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week. That is, the company believes its market will be people who do a lot of actual work on their devices — meaning messaging, emailing, working with documents, or other things where using a physical keyboard could be an advantage. While it offers a screen for viewing and responding to messages, the Communicator doesn't provide access to addictive social media apps or games. Instead, the company partnered with the maker of an Android launcher, Niagara Launcher, to provide access to messaging apps and productivity tools like Gmail, Telegram, WhatsApp, and Slack. The phone's standout feature is its Signal Light, a light-up button on the side of the device that can be customized with different colors and light patterns to indicate when you've received messages from certain people, groups, or apps. You can press on this button, known as the Prompt Key, to dictate messages when you're in a text field, or otherwise take a quick voice note, if not. The company is teasing the possibility of integrating AI applications with this button — like note takers, voice recordings, or AI agents — but nothing like that is yet available. Like Clicks' other products, the Communicator features a tactile keyboard with ergonomic keys designed for faster typing. The device also includes other old-school features, like a 3.5mm headphone jack, physical SIM card tray (in addition to an eSIM), expandable microSD storage (up to 2TB), and a tactile switch for turning on or off airplane mode. The phone itself comes in Smoke, Clover (dark green), and Onyx. The device will be offered at $399 for early bird customers who place a $199 deposit before February 27. Customers who pay the full early bird price of $399 upfront will receive two additional back covers. The phone is expected to ship sometime later this year. Clicks CEO Adrian Li noted in an announcement that the company has shipped more than 100,000 of its earlier keyboards to customers in over 100 countries. Clicks Communicator is a natural evolution of that idea,” he stated. The company's other new product is a slide-out keyboard that can be attached to smartphones, tablets, or even used with smart TVs, to save you from the tedious on-screen typing with your remote control. The keyboard is powered by a built-in 2,150 mAh battery and attaches to phones via MagSafe or Qi2 magnetic connections. It can also be used with existing phone cases, the company claims. Multiple slider positions allow the keyboard to accommodate different phone sizes, and it can be attached when the phone is held in either portrait or landscape mode. When used with tablets, TVs, or other smart devices, like AR/VR headsets, the keyboard is used independently from the device it's paired with. Similar to other Clicks keyboards, the Power Keyboard offers tactile buttons, and its settings can be customized using the Clicks mobile app for iOS and Android Clicks debuts its own take on the BlackBerry smartphone, plus a $79 snap-on mobile keyboard Meta just bought Manus, an AI startup everyone has been talking about Sauron, the high-end home security startup for ‘super premium' customers, plucks a new CEO out of Sonos NY Governor Hochul signs bill requiring warning labels on ‘addictive' social media</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For tracking other stats, including diet and sleep, you do need a third-party app as well—but there are lots of apps to choose from, and you don't have to buy an extra fitness tracker to set your health and well-being goals. Of course there are benefits to wearables: They can constantly monitor data such as heart rate, and they're easier to strap on for a morning jog. But it's still worth being aware of what your phone can do on its own—and weighing whether you need a smartwatch or fitness tracker before investing in one. You can enter readings for all of these categories manually, so if you're prepared to put in the time, you can build up a comprehensive picture of your health. The number of steps you take each day is something your iPhone can track using its built-in motion sensors. To see the data being pulled in by your iPhone, which can also include walking speed and walking distance, tap your profile picture (top right), then Devices, then select your iPhone from the list. Select any item in the list to see the data that's been pulled in, and tap Edit if you need to delete some or all of it. The situation on Android phones is a little more complicated. There is a built-in tracking tool called Health Connect but it's rather buried. However, it can't track anything on its own—it needs to interface with other apps. Considering Google owns Fitbit, and the Fitbit app comes installed on many Android phones, it can be thought of as a native app at this point. It can interface with Health Connect, and count your steps without a separate tracker. You can manage Health Connect links from the same screen. Once your phone is added, it will start logging steps and distance, and piping the data into your Fitbit app. With Samsung Galaxy phones, you can use the Fitbit app, or you can use the Samsung Health app, which comes preinstalled. As far as automatic tracking goes, this is mainly for steps, but other data can be added manually too (and the app can send data to Health Connect). So while your phone can't track these metrics on its own, all you need is another app to do the job—and you still get all your health and fitness data in one place on your handset. You get detailed read-outs of sleep stages and timings, and it's another app that can pipe data into Health Connect. It'll work with your phone by default, and you can just tap Record from the main screen to start an exercise activity. To manage the devices and other apps connected to Strava, head to the You tab, then tap the gear icon (top right) and Manage apps and devices. Strava will sync with the Health app on iOS, so you can view all your Strava data through that way too, though at the time of writing Strava hasn't added support for Health Connect on Android. Even something like heart rate can be monitored, through apps such as Cardiio (iOS) and Heart Rate Monitor (Android). Obviously it's not as comprehensive as a tracker doing real time monitoring, but it does mean there's no need for an extra device. If there's a metric that you're particularly interested in monitoring, there's a good chance you'll be able to find an app for it, and most of them will work with the built-in tools on your iPhone and Android phone. You also have the option of using a wearable in tandem with your phone and its apps, if you only want to wear one some of the time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This allows it to partially evade immunity acquired through previous infection or vaccines, making people more susceptible to infection. Genetic analysis by the UK Health Security Agency has revealed that 87 percent of H3N2 viruses detected since late August 2025 are subclade K. The term “super flu” is not necessarily scientifically accurate. For 11 consecutive weeks, more than 50 percent of the country recorded high epidemic levels, an anomaly that led to 287 child deaths. According to the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, of the 23 H3 virus strains collected in Japan between September and November 5 that could be analyzed, 22 were subclade K. As a result, it is possible that population immunity to the virus was reduced. In fact, with the 2024 influenza pandemic in Australia at its highest level since 19 years, it would not be surprising to see a similar trend in the Northern Hemisphere. The vaccine for the 2025-26 season is based on the conventional J.2 lineage (subclade), which has different antigenicity from subclade K. However, early data from the UK has confirmed that 70-75 percent of vaccinated children and 30-40 percent of adults did not end up visiting the emergency room or being hospitalized after infection. This means that even if the antigenicity is not completely identical, the vaccine remains effective in preventing severe illness. Vaccination is recommended from October to November before the epidemic, and the effect appears about two weeks after vaccination. It is particularly recommended for people aged 65 and over, people with underlying medical conditions, pregnant women, children aged 6 months to 5 years, and medical workers. In daily life, it is effective to thoroughly wash and disinfect your hands, and wear a mask when in crowds. If symptoms appear, it is best to wait at least 12 hours after the onset of fever before visiting a medical institution. Anti-influenza medication is most effective when taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, and Xofluza and Tamiflu are considered effective. People should refrain from going out for five days after the onset of symptoms and two days (three days for children) after the fever has subsided, and should make sure to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. For this reason, it is essential to respond calmly based on scientific understanding rather than fear. In fact, the risk of developing severe symptoms can be significantly reduced by combining vaccination with basic infection control measures. Because this is a rare situation in which there are consecutive high-severity seasons, making responsible choices based on accurate information will help protect the health of society as a whole.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tip stealing thing felt very similar to one thing I noticed last night during NYE was certain friends who used uber more had to pay higher for the same rides as me who never uses the app. There's so much data singling both drivers and consumers out to maximize returns, it's crazy That's why you always pit the techbros against each other and have at least 2 competing apps that you distribute your rides across. It was removed from all but one, so no mods of any community were able to verify identity (stuck in automod queue for some). This is what made it feel fake to me. This alleged business is likely much larger and naturally siloed. Intent is not a success criteria, and things are always subject to change so why bake it into the code? Sounds like a terrible idea.What would make way more sense is asking the dev team to expose configuration and stats. Dashboards are not suspicious because they are genuinely useful to the entire business, not just some evil inner group trying to squeeze a few percent. What would make way more sense is asking the dev team to expose configuration and stats. Dashboards are not suspicious because they are genuinely useful to the entire business, not just some evil inner group trying to squeeze a few percent. It necessarily has to be need-to-know and decisions have to be based on dry explanations where the intent isn't clear at all unless you're sitting in on many meetings across many teams. I question where some people have worked that are commenting. In fact, one of the better ways for an engineer to be labeled as "not independent enough for advancement" is a lack of curiosity about what you're building, because the lack of curiosity limits the engineer to a very narrow scope of work.If you're the builder working on an evil mastermind's evil lair, you may not be told, specifically, that you're building a piranha pit. But they will have to disclose that it they need a pit, which is also a freshwater aquarium with a means of keeping large carnivorous fish alive. Also that there has to be a hidden trap door big enough for a human to fall through when a button is pushed.And even if it is given a codename like "the justice room" or something, during the months of design and building no doubt some people will slip up and call it "the piranha pit" in your presence.

I don't think we're talking about the same topic at all. It sounds like OP is so curious that they made the whole thing up, and I think you might be out of touch with businesses that have plenty of tech workers, but aren't a tech company (most businesses around the world). Nothing in that article reads implausible to me, both that they were building things like "desperation score" (probably not called that, probably called something like "commitment" or something) and that any reasonably intelligent and curious engineer would have understood what he was building. If I was going to do some kind of exposé of my employers I'd at least include some semi-obfuscated screenshots to add some credibility to any claims I might make. Sure, things like that can be faked but it at least would require more effort to do all that (and make them appear credible) vs just a bunch of raw claims. (I also don't think it's a great idea to judge claims based on how believable you personally find them.

Nah, I wouldn't be surprised if the companies pocket the tips, but this story smells. It isn't at least for Wolt, which sells it as "delivery direct to you from the restaurant", rather than the delivery driver also doing other deliveries in parallel. This is quite easy to confirm given the realtime tracking of driver (and your food not being cold because they stopped at another restaurant on the way and had to wait 20 minutes). I live in an urbanish area, and if i don't set Priority Delivery then there's probably a 2 in 3 chance I'm stuck in a queue with "waiting on other delivery to complete".About the only way to get my food while it's still warm enough to eat (because few of these drivers use heat bags) is to set priority delivery. No 'waiting on other delivery' messages, not even blips of disconnectedness while the driver fulfills orders from other apps. Just straight to me.This fee, I find, works better than tipping. Incentives are completely messed up for gig deliveries. About the only way to get my food while it's still warm enough to eat (because few of these drivers use heat bags) is to set priority delivery.

Likely saves us good amount of money in subtle ways.

Always tip in cash and never through the appDon't use priority delivery Also, why did the URL not change to old.reddit? No I will not tip in app, that is obviously a scam. No sensible food delivery company would do such a thing - it's a scandal waiting to happen - so the maximum number of companies that would ever do such a thing is either zero or one. Therefore claiming they're called “human assets” in the database would instantly uniquely identify the company and the company could then correlate with recent resignations and sue the crap out of this individual for violation of the NDA that they are making very clear they're aware of and are knowingly violating.Any sensible engineer would know all of this and would not divulge such a conspicuously specific tidbit. No matter how drunk they are.Therefore, nothing else this person says is credible. Therefore I call bullshit on the whole thing.

Even during the Kalanick era, when “move fast and break things” was operational doctrine, you would not have seen internal naming this careless. The real question is why the practices look different now.Growth stage vs. profitability stage.Uber in 2013-2016 was optimizing for growth. Uber in 2025 is optimizing for profitability. When Uber was in growth mode, the company had optionality. Infinite capital and public goodwill meant the growth team could deploy aggressive guerrilla tactics to enter new markets, absorb the legal consequences, and move on. The expected value calculation favored action.Profitability-stage Uber has no such luxury. You're directly degrading the livelihoods of your own platform participants. The reputational and regulatory exposure is immediate and personal.This brings me to Spain.When Spain blocked Uber from operating, we did not wait for lawyers to navigate the legal system. I watched this happen in real time.Here's what we actually built:The goal was simple: keep the Uber app functional for Spanish drivers and riders despite the government blocking our server IPs at the network level. We needed a system that could rapidly distribute new, unblocked IP addresses to every app in the country without requiring an app store update.The solution was a Lua interpreter embedded in the Uber app paired with a gossip protocol for peer-to-peer distribution. It was essentially a remote code execution backdoor into our own app, which was both brilliant and terrifying in hindsight. When a user opened the app, it would fetch and execute Lua scripts that contained the latest routing logic and server whitelist.The workflow once it was live: when Spain blocked a batch of our IPs, our infrastructure team would publish a new IP whitelist. That list would seed into the gossip network, where each active Uber app became a node, sharing the updated configuration with other nearby apps. Within hours, millions of devices had the new routing information. The Lua script would compile the updated whitelist and redirect all trip service requests to the unblocked servers.The tech stack was essentially a censorship-circumvention system: Lua for remote code execution, gossip protocol for decentralized distribution, and a dynamically compiled IP whitelist that the app used to route around the blockade. Same playbook Tor uses for bridge distribution or how Telegram distributes proxy servers to users in Iran and Russia.The Spanish government quickly realized they had exhausted their options. We forced the outcome, Uber was unbanned, and operations resumed legally.Here's the part that matters: it was illegal, but the illegality accrued to Uber's benefit without harming users. The other makes you a landlord squeezing tenants. What's worth examining is not whether Uber engaged in questionable practices.
