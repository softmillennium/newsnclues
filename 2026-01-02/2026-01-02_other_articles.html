                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Someone had touched me on my upper arm. There was no one else in the room. The day before I left Macon, I met a paranormal investigation team called Macon Beyond who acknowledged that they too had endured a lot of eerie experiences at the 1842 Inn. In fact, I could watch their paranormal investigation of the property, and others, in their investigative video series focused on Macon's haunted history. The idea for the Macon Beyond video series came from host and Hollywood actress, Carrie Genzel, known for her roles in Supernatural, Jennifer's Body, and Smallville. “I had pitched the idea to Visit Macon about showcasing these incredible historical places that we have here but telling it from a paranormal lens and jumping into the ghosts, legends, and lore of the city,” Genzel says. Although Genzel had ghostly experiences since she was five, she isn't a paranormal investigator and needed a team to help her explore Macon's haunted spaces. Ten years ago, Genzel met Morrighan Lynne, a psychic empath and spiritual medium, in Dallas, Texas, on another paranormal project. Lynne and her husband Jonathan Morgan, a paranormal investigator, reached out to Genzel the week of her pitch with news that they were moving to Macon. “She goes in the next meeting [with Visit Macon] and is like, ‘I have my team.' We didn't know anything about it,” Lynne explains. I'm like, this is the weirdest, most synchronistic moment. “Unfortunately, Hollywood and some TV shows have a reputation of antagonizing, going for like the high sensation. As the host of Macon Beyond, Genzel opens each video with historical information and lore, as well as interviews with the owner or employees of the location. “I try to do the research so that I have an idea of who may be there or who we might be talking to [in terms of spirits, to] sort of fill in what [Lynne and Morgan] may be picking up,” she says. As the lead investigator, Morgan brings paranormal equipment like ghost boxes that scan frequencies, thermal cameras that note changes in temperature, and Rem pods, electromagnetic tools that light up and beep if an otherworldly presence is near. Lynne, a psychic empath and spiritual medium, takes on the role of communicating between the dead and living. Other times she may hear music from the past or physically feel something the spirits want her to feel. “The spirits were a little apprehensive because I don't think people investigate in this area. They weren't sure what to do with us at first,” Lynne explains. She first used her skills with a paranormal investigation team in Dallas and has been honing them ever since. Lynne's approach to each historic location is different than the rest of her team. I don't even want to know where we're going until we're pulling up into the driveway,” she explains. Once at a location, Lynne speaks to the spirits present, learning their names or what happened to them, often sifting through Macon's long history to better understand what spirits are communicating. This isn't easy considering Macon has been inhabited for over 17,000 years, is the ancestral home of the Muscogee Nation, and was an active region during slavery and the Civil War. The most exciting moments in the Macon Beyond video series occur when team members have ghostly experiences that overlap. “In our Hay House episode, I visually saw a dark orb come at me, break off to Morrighan, and she got dizzy. He was in another part of the house at that time,” Genzel explains. “But he caught on his equipment on that same floor, a dark orb that looked exactly like what I saw. For Genzel, Morgan, and Lynne, the Macon Beyond project has allowed them to explore Macon's history and learn more about the other side. “Nobody wants to be forgotten and those that have passed on, they don't want to be forgotten either, so it's a great way to continue to tell their stories and share them with another generation of people,” says Genzel. Most excitingly, the Macon Beyond videos are attracting paranormal tourists to a virtually untapped paranormal destination on par with Savannah and New Orleans in terms of activity. Marisa Rodgers, VP & Chief Marketing Officer of Visit Macon shares that “the Macon Beyond video series and its approach to blending the paranormal with history has already seen such strong streaming numbers and impressions. This doesn't surprise Morgan who encourages paranormal tourists intrigued by the video series to make a trip: “Macon is very active, especially from some other cities that I've lived in or visited.” Macon Beyond will be sharing more paranormal investigations in 2026 and will likely offer travelers the chance to join them for an investigation, too (they hosted an incredibly successful investigation event that I attended in October 2025 at the Burke Mansion). Till then, take a trip out to Macon for your own paranormal experience. “For those that have a little bit of investigative nature to them, Macon is a fun place to come and explore and learn some new stories, haunts, and lore,” says Genzel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Netflix's most iconic series wrapped up its long journey with a highly anticipated finale, but the audience response turned out to be more surprising than expected. Instead of dominating viewing charts, the much-talked-about release found itself competing with a very different kind of show, one built on humour, conversation, and familiar faces. The final episode of Stranger Things Season 5 became available for Indian viewers on January 1 at 6:30 am. The series, which has enjoyed massive popularity for nearly a decade, marked its conclusion with an intense showdown in Hawkins. Fans had waited years to see how the story of Eleven and her friends would finally end. The latest episode from Season 4 featured members of the Indian women's cricket team, bringing sports stars and comedy together in a format that strongly appealed to Indian audiences. Guests included Harmanpreet Kaur, Richa Ghosh, Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Deepti Sharma, Renuka Singh, Harleen Deol, Radha Yadav, Pratika Rawal, and head coach Amol Mazumdar. How does Bill Skarsgard's IT: Welcome to Derry finale outshine Noah Schnapp, Millie Bobby Brown's Stranger Things Season 5: Volume 2 and 3? Yuzvendra Chahal, Rishabh Pant, head coach Gautam Gambhir to feature on THIS show, the name is... New episodes of the comedy talk show are released every Saturday at 8 pm. Over time, the show has hosted a wide range of well-known personalities from cinema, sports, music, and business, making it a consistent crowd-puller for Indian viewers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A world famous psychic has offered her predictions for what awaits a bunch of celebs as we enter 2026 and for some, the tea leaves are stirring up a bunch of chaos. Before we look into the future à la Raven Baxter, it's worth mentioning that all these predictions should be taken with a grain of salt — or more accurately, enough salt to rim a spicy marg. First cab off the rank was Kylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet, the bizarre yet alluring It-couple whom Morgan predicts will break up sometime this year. “They're not going to stay together,” Morgan claimed, despite the pair shutting down long-running split rumours as recently as last month. Going a step further, Morgan foresaw that “'there's already someone new in [Chalamet's] life”, and while you might think, based on recent news, that it's Susan Boyle, the psychic had a specific description of the alleged new lady in the actor's life. “He's got someone around him that is a bit like a goth and quite small, possibly with piercings,” Morgan told the Daily Mail. Morgan claimed that Jenner and Chalamet are still sticking together for the time being to show face “for the cameras” and to continue “whatever they feel they're fulfilling with their brand”, but I have a sneaking suspicion Kris Jenner's gingerbread house would disagree. Moving on to fellow celeb couple Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, Morgan foretold of a major life event that will befall the pair in 2026 — in the form of not one, but two (!) It could be twins and she'll have daughters,” Morgan said. Swift has spoken openly about her desire for children in the past, with her imminent nuptials — and an accidental Instagram reshare by Donna Kelce — only further fuelling the speculation about a possible Swift-Kelce brood. While she stopped short of naming who'll be taking their martini shaken, not stirred, Morgan did predict the actor playing James Bond will be blonde. “I think it's somebody with fair hair,” Morgan claimed, adding that the actor will have “fairer” hair than rumoured James Bond frontrunner Callum Turner. Turner is one of multiple names that has been circling the coveted role — alongside Tom Holland, Jacob Elordi and Theo James — but apparently none of those dark-haired heartthrobs will be 007 if Morgan's predictions are to be believed. Perhaps the least surprising prediction pertained to Donald Trump, who Morgan claimed will spark some kind of global meltdown in 2026. Given what we know of the US President, that sounds like less of a prophecy and more of a promise, but Morgan said Trump's antics will reach a tipping point this year. “Something huge [is] going to happen in America. Exactly what Trump will do is anyone's guess, but given the clusterfuck that is his second term, truly nothing would surprise me, even if it was whipped by the all-knowing tarot cards. As a That's So Raven superfan, I can say with confidence that some of these predictions feel accurate, but I'm also holding space for all of them being proved wrong as we enter 2026. After all, who could've predicted that in 2025, a pop star would've gone to space before dating a former prime minister, without even mentioning a kiss cam that tilted the world on its axis? At this point, he's so deep in movie, TV and celebrity culture that he's at risk of getting trench foot. You can find him concealing his feet on Instagram @tomdisalvo.</p>
