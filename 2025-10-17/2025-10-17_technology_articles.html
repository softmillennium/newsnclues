When Intel and Microsoft announced their plan to build a 'custom processor' on Intel's 18A fabrication process in early 2024, neither of the companies even hinted at the purpose of that silicon, leaving a lot of space for guesswork and interpretation by industry observers. So far, Intel Foundry has officially landed only one major external customer for its 18A manufacturing technology, which is Microsoft. But while we tend to think about Microsoft as a cloud and software giant, the company has quite a potent hardware development (or at least hardware definition) team that builds custom silicon for a variety of data center applications, including Cobalt CPUs, DPUs, and Maia AI accelerators, just to name some. As it turns out, one of Microsoft's next-generation AI processors will reportedly be made by Intel Foundry. If true, the deal would give Microsoft access to a US-based chip supply chain that isn't as exposed to the capacity constraints that we see with both chip manufacturing and advanced packaging at TSMC. Additionally, the deal could be seen as favorable to Microsoft in other ways, given the US government's investment in Intel. For the lack of details, we can only speculate which of the next-generation Maia processors will be produced by IF, but this would be a big development for Intel. Hence, if they are on track to be produced at Intel Foundry, then the company's 18A (or 18A-P with 8% higher performance) fabrication process is projected to be good enough not only for Intel itself (which is on track to ramp its Xeon 6+ 'Clearwater Forest in 2026), but also for its foundry customers. Microsoft's original Maia 100 processor is a massive 820 mm^2 piece of silicon that packs 105 billion transistors, and which is larger than Nvidia's H100 (814 mm^2) or B200/B300 compute chiplets (750 mm^2). While the lion's share of Microsoft's Azure offerings for AI run on Nvidia's AI accelerators, the company is investing a lot to co-optimize its hardware and software to achieve higher performance while increasing efficiency and thus lowering the total cost of ownership. As such, Maia is an important project for Microsoft. Of course, Microsoft could partition its next-gen AI processor into several smaller compute chiplets linked through Intel's EMIB or Foveros technologies, but that could impact performance efficiency, so we are most likely talking about a big die or dies close to the reticle size of EUV tools, which is 858 mm^2. In addition, Microsoft could embed spare compute arrays or redundant MAC blocks into next-gen Maia layout to enable post-manufacturing fusing or repair, which is what companies like Nvidia do with their designs.

Pottery Northwest, which offers ceramics workspaces, classes, exhibitions, artist talks, and more, plans to open in fall 2026 under a 10-year lease. That 36-year-old Seattle institution moved from a 100-year-old building on Capitol Hill into Amazon's re:Invent tower to occupy 14,000 square feet across two floors. Amazon provided Gage with more than $7.5 million in rent assistance over 10 years, and the company offset a significant portion of the cost of construction and space improvement. PNW does say on its website that it's launching a $2.1 million fundraising campaign “to fund the construction and activation of our new home.” “The new facility strengthens Seattle's creative economy by expanding opportunities and is a stable foundation for long-term community building,” Ed King, executive director of PNW, said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. While most battery startups chase lithium, a new Seattle company is betting on an abundant alternative: sodium. Sodium-ion batteries also have significantly longer lifespans and are less likely to catch fire than lithium-ion alternatives. But co-founder and Chief Product Officer David Bell said his startup aims to shrink that power gap. “We want to solve that energy density problem,” he said. The company is developing an improved “hard carbon” material that's used in sodium battery anodes. Another strength, Bell said, is the sodium-ion batteries can be made using the same manufacturing line that works for lithium-ion batteries. Companies in China and South Korea are already repurposing some of that infrastructure for sodium applications. Emerald is targeting several growing applications for sodium-ion batteries: Emerald incorporated in March and is using University of Washington resources to develop its technology, including CoMotion Labs and the Washington Clean Energy Testbeds. The company is part of a regional battery hub that includes Group14 Technologies, Ecellix, Sila and others. The startup is bootstrapped and received funding from two universities that helps pay for student employees. Battery companies face intimidating headwinds as many U.S. clean energy supports are being unwound by the Trump administration and given the costs associated with large-scale materials manufacturing. Sodium-ion battery startup Natron shuttered in September despite having $25 million worth of orders for its Michigan factory. Emerald faces competition from Peak Energy, Nanode Battery Technologies and Unigrid — though the companies are pursuing different strategies to improve performance that Bell predicts will be more costly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>T-Mobile has turned the wireless industry on its head with an offer that sounds too good to be true: free iPhone 17 devices for practically anyone who walks through their doors. Whether you're a loyal customer or someone fed up with your current carrier's inflated prices, T-Mobile is handing out Apple's latest flagship phones at zero cost. And if you're bringing the entire family along, T-Mobile will give you up to four lines of unlimited service for just one hundred dollars per month, with each line qualifying for its own complimentary iPhone 17. This isn't a limited-time offer gimmick meant only to pull in a few customers before reverting back to stealth mode: T-Mobile's got the infrastructure and faith backing such aggressive promotions because they run the fastest network in America, according to Ookla's Speedtest Intelligence data. Their first quarter 2025 readings revealed T-Mobile's decisive lead over the competition in speed and total performance. The company's been methodically growing its coverage area with 5G and adds towers and bandwidth that yield concrete improvements you can expect the moment you begin to use your brand-new device. T-Mobile's ambitions extend beyond traditional cellular coverage with their T-Satellite service, which leverages orbital technology to reach locations other providers simply cannot access. This innovation ensures strong signals even in remote areas where competitors' networks fade into uselessness. The economic benefits add up quickly for switchers: T-Mobile claims existing customers from competing networks can save up to twenty percent each month with a switch to an Experience plan. Those plans include in-flight Wi-Fi and Magenta Status benefits among others, but the large benefit remains in that no-cost iPhone 17 in the palm of your hand with your monthly fees lowered.</p>

There's an entirely logical reason why authoritarians undermine truth and truth-generating social systems.The #1 goal of an authoritarian leader is to acquire maximum concentrated power relative to other people. Everything else is secondary.One of the main ways someone's power can be undermined is by many people combining their small individual powers into a single coherent group. They have a larger set of facts which they already naturally agree on.Therefore, to undermine that coordination, every authoritarian regime in history has sought to undermine institutions and people that aim to discover and disseminate facts about reality.Being an edgelord who repeats known falsehoods plays into that.

I would guess it is implied, to support such an interpretation, but it is not stated explicitly, and from what is written, it sounds like people who believed in conspiracy theories (or were otherwise skeptical of mainstream views) were in fact unhappy to go along with prevention measures and annoyed by the mainstream coverage, which is not surprising at all.

Are we upset that carriers and handset manufacturers adopting 5G wasn't put up for a vote? Did adoption of 5G cause some great harm to people? Even NPR (which skews liberal) has given a much more nuanced[1] interpretation of the numbers. Obviously Trump's claim is hyperbolic and inflammatory (per his MO), but the sentiment does seem to resonate with at least some folks in DC, particularly ones that moved there in the early 2010s (when crime was at an all-time low). “Crime is at the highest level it's ever been” That pattern will be true in nearly every city you look at. We are not at all time highs or even close in most cities. Or, ya know, maybe a rise in the lethality of crime in a society already one of the most profoundly violent in the world has too little hyperbole associated with it.But when Greta Thunbery uses hyperbole that's politcal rallying to a cause and colition building for a serious threat. But when trump mobilizes resources for police funding in cities with absurd levels of violence, now anyone who endorses this must be really an authoritarian dupe who delights in being mislead. But when trump mobilizes resources for police funding in cities with absurd levels of violence, now anyone who endorses this must be really an authoritarian dupe who delights in being mislead.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WhatsApp is attempting to solve its spam problem by putting a curb on how many messages individual users and businesses can send to unknown people without getting a response. While the app started as an easy way to send messages to personal contacts, over time, it has become more complex with groups, communities, and business messaging. All messages users and businesses send to others will count against this new per-month limit, unless they get a response. For instance, if you meet someone at a conference and send three messages, that counts against the limit. WhatsApp hasn't said what the limit will be, as it's testing different limits during this time. However, when a business or an individual is about to hit the limit, the app will display a warning to those users with a pop-up showing the count, so they can avoid getting blocked from sending messages. Over the last year, WhatsApp has tried to curb some of this spammy behaviour through tools and guardrails. This way, they can receive updates or get support from a business without getting spammed. Earlier this year, WhatsApp started experimenting by putting a limit on the number of broadcast messages users and businesses can send to others. The company said that it has started expanding this experiment in more than a dozen countries, including India, one of the company's biggest markets with over 500 million users.

It's a pricey wireless extender, but the Deco BE65-Outdoor delivers on performance. Excellent performance, especially with a wired backhaul 6 GHz band took some trial and error to connect Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Earlier this summer, I purchased a TP-Link Deco BE25-Outdoor Wi-Fi 7 extender to expand coverage in my backyard. I found performance to be excellent, as I witnessed a more than 2x improvement in 5 GHz throughput and a nearly 5x improvement in 2.4 GHz throughput. Since that time, TP-Link sent us a Deco BE65-Outdoor to review, which is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 extender, rather than the dual-band Deco BE25-Outdoor. That added band and performance also means that the Deco BE65-Outdoor is more expensive, with an MSRP of $299.99 versus $149.99 for the BE25-Outdoor I had been using. The Deco BE65-Outdoor is similar in design to the BE25-Outdoor: It's a tall, white cylinder with a black base that unscrews to reveal the ports inside for connectivity and power. A rubber gasket prevents moisture and dirt from entering the chassis. Inside the unit, you'll find two 2.5 GbE LAN ports that support Power over Ethernet (PoE), and a power port for the included 9-foot cable. The Deco BE65-Outdoor measures 4.23 × 4.23 × 6.93 inches and weighs 3.48 pounds. The first step for setting up the Deco BE65-Outdoor was to find a suitable place to mount it outside. This time around, I opted to mount the unit in my backyard on a tree. The tree is roughly 25 feet away from the main router in my Deco BE63 Wi-Fi 7 mesh network. Given that this was just a temporary setup for review purposes, I grabbed a 50-foot extension cord from the garage and plugged one end into an exterior wall outlet and the other end into the Deco BE65-Outdoor's power cord. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. TP-Link makes it incredibly simple to add a satellite to your existing network via the Deco app. When the app opened, I immediately received a prompt saying that the Deco BE65-Outdoor had been found. I found this odd, because the Deco BE65-Outdoor and my living room Deco BE63 satellite are both roughly 25 feet away from the main Deco BE63 router – and the living room node has additional walls and floors in its path. After some trial and error (and an assist from TP-Link), I discovered that the Automated Frequency Coordination (AFC) mode, which is required for outdoor 6 GHz band usage, was not enabled. Attempting to turn it on continued to give me an error message, so I tried rebooting the router several times. Finally, I performed a firmware update to get the unit up to par with the rest of my mesh network. I also decided to throw in a third scenario, connecting the Deco BE65-Outdoor to the Deco BE63 living room node using a wired backhaul. This is the best-case scenario for wireless performance. For my test system, I used an HP OmniBook X (Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite) laptop with a Qualcomm FastConnect 6900 Wi-Fi 6E wireless card. I then used my trusty iPerf3 server, which, in this instance, was connected via a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet connection to my Deco BE63 router. With that said, the numbers speak for themselves regarding performance. The TP-Link Deco BE65-Outdoor is a premium wireless satellite that can be used with the company's Deco mesh systems. Performance across the board on my back porch and in my back yard was dramatically faster when using the Deco BE65-Outdoor versus my “base” Deco BE63 mesh network. I saw upwards of a 10x improvement on the 2.4 GHz band and significant gains on the 5 GHz band. The option to use a wired backhaul further strengthens data throughput. If all you're hoping to do is expand wireless coverage to your outdoor areas, the Deco BE25-Outdoor should be wholly sufficient for your needs. But if you want a “spare no expense” wireless node that is second to none in performance, the Deco BE65-Outdoor is hard to ignore. Brandon Hill is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A spokesperson for U.S. Border Patrol has finally issued a statement about the antisemitic social media video that the agency posted in August, but was just deleted this week. And in typical Trumpian fashion, the statement is incredibly whiny. Border Patrol, which is part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, first posted a 13-second video to Instagram and Facebook back in August that used audio from the 1995 Michael Jackson song “They Don't Care About Us.” Specifically, the agency used a portion of the song that includes the slurs “Jew me” and “kike me.” And anyone in 2025 who would use that audio, especially just that portion of the song for a very short video, knows exactly what they're doing. The Border Patrol video was posted months ago but went largely unnoticed by the broader public until Tuesday, when white supremacists on X started to post about it approvingly. The video was even pinned to the Border Patrol's Reels section when Gizmodo viewed it on Tuesday night, meaning that they really wanted people to see it. It had racked up 3.4 million views at that point before being deleted. We saved a copy of the video, which you can see below. Border Patrol deleted the videos from Instagram and Facebook on Wednesday morning, but Gizmodo was unsure whether it was the immigration agency that deleted them or perhaps Meta. After all the attention the video attracted, it seemed plausible that it had been deleted by Facebook moderators for hate speech violations. “We deleted the post and will update with different music. ET: A few hours after this article was published, CBP press officer Tammy Melvin sent Gizmodo another email with the same exact statement, this time attributed to Tricia McLaughlin. If that sounds like an odd tone to be coming from an official government spokesperson, you'd be right. I've been a reporter for over a decade, and I've never had government officials respond to emails in the way that they have since President Trump took power this past January. And to send that kind of terse and snippy message without acknowledging the antisemitism of the video or why it had been posted in the first place is extremely weird. It's particularly weird when DHS is sharing fascist propaganda daily, often with racist messages. Last month, Gizmodo emailed the agency to inquire about a bizarre video that DHS had distributed, which featured video and music from Pokémon. The response: “To arrest them is our real test. It might have been cutesy fun coming from some shitposter on the internet. But these are the folks who carry guns and deport people to countries where they've never lived. President Donald Trump is currently working to purge the country of immigrants, and his agents don't seem to care much about telling the truth. People who work for DHS and ICE have frequently been caught lying in recent months. And they always seem to be incredibly whiny in the process. For example, a video of a teenager being violently arrested in Chicago went viral last week, and most people were horrified. But DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin insisted the video was “from a year ago,” a claim that was being made by far-right accounts on X. McLaughlin also claimed that the people in the video weren't even ICE. Both claims are lies, as the people who were arrested were reportedly protesting and monitoring ICE, according to the Chicago Tribune. But it's not illegal, and it's not grounds for an arrest, violent or otherwise, unless you live in an authoritarian country. But everything else the DHS spokesperson was trying to claim was just nonsense pushed by random right-wing trolls on X. Why would McLaughlin just blast out misinformation to the world like that? That part is unclear, but she seems to do it a lot. Like when she recently said a 13-year-old arrested by ICE had a gun (he did not) or that a Chicago woman shot by CBP had driven herself to the hospital (she did not). According to DHS, the woman who was shot by a CBP agent, 30-year-old Marimar Martinez, supposedly rammed her car into the agents, though she says they rammed into her. What's more, McLaughlin released a statement shortly after Martinez was arrested, insisting that she was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon” and that an agent acted “defensively” by shooting her. We've since learned from news reports that Martinez had a legal concealed carry license for a gun that never left her purse, according to FOX 32. All of the lies and shady maneuvers make it very hard for the average person to believe what they're hearing. On Thursday, a woman in Washington, DC, was acquitted of assaulting an FBI agent during a protest outside the DC Jail back in July. So when they finally brought lesser charges, it seemed likely that she'd be convicted. The FBI agent who claimed she was assaulted, Eugenia Bates, didn't turn over text messages until the last minute, and one of the messages was missing, according to local news outlet WUSA. To put it bluntly: Americans are now in a position where they really can't believe anything the federal government says. Whatever you thought of the feds before Trump took power again, there was a general belief among most Americans that agencies like the FBI or DHS would try to tell the truth. Given the road we're currently going down as a country, with masked men terrorizing hard-working people, it's not clear why anyone would ever do that again.

New Geekbench listings spotted by Tech Info reveal that the performance in single-core scores is enough to rival Intel's Ultra 9 285K and breeze past AMD's 9950X3D. As is to be expected, it struggles in multi-core against those models, but the results show the potential of Apple's latest silicon and the surely-inevitable Pro and Max variants of this new chip. That's with the same 10-core base configuration on either device, but the MacBook does have active cooling and a much thicker chassis that can prevent thermal throttling and allow the chip to boost higher, sustaining that for longer periods of time. It's easy to see why a fully-fledged "pro" laptop would outperform a thin (albeit overkill) tablet, even though they carry the same quality silicon under the hood. Apple never actually discloses clock speed numbers in its tech specs, but in the Geekbench listings, we see that the iPad Pro's M5 ran at 4.43 GHz, while the MacBook Pro's M5 topped out at 4.61 GHz. Compared to PC chips, the M5 is only behind a few single-core listings on Geekbench, if we count the best results, which makes sense considering how there's literally only one M5 MacBook Pro score right now, so it's quite cherry-picked. This also serves as your disclaimer for taking all these numbers with a grain of salt, since the sample size is simply too low at the moment to jump to any conclusions. Intel's Core i9-14900KS scores 4,457 points in the single-core test, making it 4.6% faster. However, this could change with the higher spec'd 14-core M5 that hasn't been tested yet, and we'd assume the M5 Pro and M5 Max will certainly help level the playing field in this regard. The table above uses numbers from Geekbench's processor benchmark database to paint a more accurate picture, alongside the extreme differences we mentioned earlier.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Squarespace wants you to build a website with AI. Its Blueprint AI feature began life as a guided website design system in 2023, but, like many things these days, it was revamped with artificial intelligence. I'm a fan of Squarespace's website builder largely due to its bold templates, intuitive backend, and surprising power. Thankfully, the company doesn't sacrifice those tenets with Blueprint. It feels less like an AI website builder and more like a tailoring tool, something that can recognize the goals of your site and give you a starting point rather than forcing you to scroll through templates or, worse, start from scratch. It took me just a few minutes to create a website with Blueprint that was totally functional, without giving up the flashy design pillars Squarespace is known for. It starts with a topic: What is the website you're trying to make? Squarespace gives you a list of topics to select from when you start with Blueprint AI, and there are a surprising number of options. You get top-level categories like photography and music, but after entering enough random queries, I stumbled upon everything from civil engineering to therapy services. Squarespace largely uses these points to generate copy for your site. Although you can take any Blueprint website out into the full Squarespace editor, the core of your site is designed on a single page. Squarespace asks which sections you want to include, recommending those that fit your goals, and builds a one-page website with them. It's a process on rails, never deviating too far outside of the boundary set by Squarespace's designers, even with AI at the helm. After your main page is set up, you can add additional pages, though without the option to swap between different layouts. There's plenty to explore in the Squarespace editor later, but Blueprint AI gets you to the editor with a clearer view of what your site is and what it should look like. Squarespace likes to highlight its award-winning templates, and they look great, but often only within specific contexts. Blueprint can combine elements from other templates in a way that makes sense, while also filling your website with content generated by AI. It's much faster than strong-arming a template into something functional. Although Squarespace describes Blueprint as an AI website builder, it isn't some separate tool that lives independently of Squarespace's main website builder. When you're done creating your website, you'll be booted into the Squarespace dashboard, where you can further customize your site, change the design template, manage your SEO settings, and so much more. Being able to use the standard website builder is what makes Blueprint stand out. For my website, I created a faux online retail store called Goofy Garments, and I didn't have to change much in the editor. I switched to a slightly different layout for the website headers, changed the font in one section that was difficult to read, added a login page, and I was done. Make no mistake, the AI-generated copy wasn't perfect, and the AI-generated images of generic clothes look like they were, well, created by AI. But I'm able to put everything together much faster. Rather than thinking about image spacing, font sizes, and linking buttons up properly, everything is ready; I just need to drop in what I need. Blueprint even set up a handful of preset product listings that were ready to go with images and a description. You'll likely spend far more time away from the editor. The specific sections of Squarespace you interact with will depend on what type of website you're building, but what I appreciate about Squarespace is that it doesn't lean too heavily in one area at the cost of another. The email campaigns section gives you a handful of templates for different emails you can send out, while the products tab gives you a checklist for connecting a payment processor and filling out fulfillment details. Whatever you're trying to do, it feels doable, not overwhelming, which is a surprisingly difficult thing to nail with the inherent complexity of a website builder. Still, something is lost in mixing and matching these different design elements. The final product looks unique with enough customization, but I never saw anything as bold or individual as one of Squarespace's templates. When you can't find something, Blueprint is a godsend. Blueprint will give you a beautiful-looking website (you can see the images of the site it created for me throughout this article), but it still needs to operate within certain limitations. Massive headers, unique fonts, and oblong image frames won't work with any design, and Blueprint is designed to work no matter what you throw at it. You lose some of the individualism found in Squarespace's templates with Blueprint, favoring function over form. Blueprint AI lives within Squarespace's existing subscription plans; it's not a separate feature. All of Squarespace's plans support ecommerce, but the more expensive offerings come with lower credit card and transaction fees. You're able to upgrade at any time, thankfully, and Squarespace offers a prorated price for annual plans. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

LEGO sets have evolved far beyond childhood toys into sophisticated building experiences that challenge adults while delivering stunning display pieces. The LEGO Star Wars R2-D2 set captures one of the most iconic droids in cinematic history with impressive detail, and right now it's down to $79 on Amazon from its usual $99 price. With 1,050 pieces, it beautifully captures R2-D2's signature dome-shaped frame and mechanical nature. Build time is several hours, and it achieves that Zen flow state that comes with line-following and seeing an object take form piece by piece. LEGO designers nailed the proportions and color blocking so non-Star Wars fans will recognize this little robot on sight. These functioning portions incorporate play value into static display. His remote third leg comes off the body much like in the films which allows you to display him in either travel mode or stationary setting. Accessories such as an attachable periscope and several tools have a snap-on/snap-off capability that allow you to recreate a given scene from the films or tailor his look according to your mood. The set includes a bonus that makes this deal even sweeter: a LEGO minifigure of Darth Malak that was released as part of LEGO's 25th anniversary Star Wars celebration. Darth Malak comes from the Knights of the Old Republic video game era which makes him a deep-cut reference that longtime fans will appreciate. There's also a small R2-D2 LEGO figure included, plus an information plaque that adds museum-quality presentation to your finished display. With the 9-inch scale, he's substantial enough to make an impact but doesn't require specialized display space. Construction holds up to frequent adjustments in the direction of the head or positioning of the legs without pieces breaking off, although this's only suitable for non-abusive play such as with most all traditional action figures. LEGO Star Wars sets hold value very well, and character-based builds like this R2-D2 will generally appreciate in value after it's no longer stocked off the assembly line.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The once untouchable bourbon business has seen many big brands abruptly retreating, with sales of Bulleit down 7 percent and Wild Turkey down 8 percent in the first half of this year. Brands like Kentucky Owl and Garrard County Distilling have filed for bankruptcy. Uncle Nearest, one of the “it” bourbon brands of the past few years, went into receivership in August. All of that is a long way to say that the present makes for an awfully inauspicious time to launch a new Kentucky distillery, but for bourbon veterans David Mandell and John Hargrove, cofounders of Whiskey House, industry chaos equals opportunity—thanks in part to a massive investment into tech to bring an often antiquated industry into the 2020s. Whiskey House has the bones of a classic distillery, but it operates more like a modern food manufacturing plant, leaning heavily into automation, sensor-based control, and real-time analytics, all of which guide every aspect of production. Mandell says the scale at which technology is being used here has never been done before in the spirits industry. Ryan Poe, distillery senior manager at Whiskey House, walks among fermenter tanks. If you've never toured a whiskey distillery, the experience can be uncommonly old-fashioned. While newer distilleries thrive on automation, many still tout their “by hand” operations as a defining characteristic, a heritage that gives them street cred. Many distilleries are downright smug about the lack of computers or even climate control in any facet of their operations—even if this means things don't always go according to plan. Easily preventable errors are chalked up as a cost of doing business, perhaps adding to the romance of whiskey-making while draining the budget. Mandell says that while the influence of a seasoned master distiller is great, there's a real risk in eschewing technology when it comes to the finished product. In fact, that distillery may not exist at all. For example, you can't visit Redemption Whiskey's distillery, because there isn't one; the brand sources all its stock from MGP Ingredients in Indiana. There are two primary ways to get whiskey without distilling it yourself. Sourcing usually involves buying barrels that have already been made by someone else. Contract distilling happens when whiskey is distilled to order for a client's specifications. Bardstown made (and still makes) its own whiskeys, but like many distillers it also produces for others on contract. These contract distilling services are where the fast money is made. Whiskey produced today won't be sold until it's properly aged—for years—but unlike consumers, contract customers have to pay up front. Bardstown has been able to thread the needle and do both sides successfully—though without its thriving contract production business and the hiring of Hargrove (who now leads the Whiskey House production team) to fix some quality issues, Mandell implies that Bardstown might not have been so fortunate in its early days. Aerial view of the rickhouses at Whiskey House. In fact, WIRED's visit marked the first time a reporter had been invited in, where we were given full access to its operations, engineering team, and tech stack. (Full disclosure: Whiskey House covered the travel expenses for my trip to its facility.) What immediately strikes you when walking through the five-story, 110,000-square foot facility is how pristine it is, how uninhabited it feels. Distilleries can often be messy, chaotic spaces, filled with scurrying staff. But each 12-hour shift at Whiskey House usually includes just seven people, only three of whom are active in production. Whiskey House is clean like a hospital but loud like the factory that it is, capable of cranking out a maximum of 120,000 barrels of whiskey a year that get started in massive, three-story fermentation tanks. The few production staff members on site spend most of their time behind sprawling displays that visualize insights from Whiskey House's model predictive control systems, responsible for monitoring every aspect of operations. Temperature gradients across plates in the column still, vapor-liquid equilibrium dynamics, reflux ratios, and more are all tracked and logged in real time. Operators use these sensors and analysis software to make decisions rather than relying on the intuition upon which an old-guard distiller might lean. A centralized data exchange allows any system in the plant to communicate with any other, so if something goes amiss, it can be spotted immediately and from anywhere. “Thanks to our design and our technology, we can achieve the quality and consistency of production of a massive system, while having the flexibility to produce custom runs, all turning out the highest-quality distillate,” he says. Though barely a year old, Whiskey House now has 35 customers and is making whiskey for brands including Calumet Farms, Redwood Empire, High N' Wicked, and Clyde May's—none of which may be household names, but all of which are well known in the bourbon enthusiast world. More importantly, behind each label is a very different product, and that was part of the sell for Whiskey House: Absolute customizability, unlike what any other distillery can offer. Customers can choose the ingredients that go into their whiskeys. In just over a year, Whiskey House has made spirits for its customers using 56 different mash bills, the blend of grains, yeast, and other nutrients that ferment before being distilled. At one point, it produced 11 of those mash bills in the facility over a two week span. That may not sound impressive to you, but most distilleries have no capacity for such variety. To put it in perspective, since 1954 Maker's Mark produced whiskey with only one mash bill—until 2025, when it added a second. For Heather Greene, CEO of Texas bourbon producers Milam & Greene, Whiskey House provides options, and it does so on her terms. Milam & Greene produces whiskey in multiple states and frequently blends barrels from all of them, but, as Greene puts it, they're her barrels no matter where they're made. “It's like using someone else's kitchen,” she says. Greene contracts with both Bardstown and Whiskey House and says that both are giving her “fantastic whiskey” that aligns with her exacting expectations, though it will be at least three more years before Whiskey House's juice has aged enough to be bottled. “Whiskey House can create the exact profile that's unique to this brand,” she says. “We're really able to create something really beautiful, something with providence and a sense of place and identity.” Distillation is only one piece of the puzzle; Whiskey House customers don't just have control over production inside the distillery, they also have web-based insight into their products after they are barreled and placed in one of the facility's three onsite rickhouses. A typical distillery will keep tabs on barrels manually, with batch numbers and production dates scribbled on the barrel head by hand and all of it tracked via spreadsheet. Whiskey House's barrels are each marked with a QR code, printed with a custom wax ink that won't degrade in the heat of the rickhouse over multiple years before being fed into its database. QR codes are printed on each barrel in custom wax ink that won't degrade over time. Whiskey House can locate any barrel and monitor rickhouse conditions immediately, all thanks to a virtual rickhouse visualization driven by, you guessed it, hundreds more sensors in each building. Whiskey House can even monitor the evaporation of whiskey lost to the “angel's share” inside each barrel thanks to an embedded sensor, virtually as it happens. Workers can maintain a real-time view of whiskey production with cameras, sensors, and analysis software. Subject matter expert AIs are being built to oversee production and make suggestions to engineers about areas where process improvements can enhance efficiency. Henley says his team is about a year away from getting his AI programs out of the lab and into production. Meanwhile, the American whiskey market continues to writhe as it attempts to find its new normal—though issues like retaliatory tariffs and boycotts and ongoing concerns over the health impacts of alcohol aren't helping provide stability. “There are certainly challenges in the industry right now,” he says. “There's too much production capacity in the contract market and too few customers to sustain all of it. Our focus is on consolidating the best customers into Whiskey House, the brands that need this kind of focused, custom production. He stresses that the next five years are going to be rough for bourbon producers due to a massive oversupply of barrels without buyers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what's less known is that Doubao also has an overseas counterpart: Cici. It was released around the same time and features a nearly identical female cartoon avatar as its app icon, except Cici's has longer hair than Doubao's. The app is region-locked and not available in either China or the United States, which explains why it's even more obscure than Doubao. But ByteDance has been quietly marketing Cici to users in the United Kingdom, Mexico, and several Southeast Asian countries. Meta's Ad Library shows that Cici was running over 400 different ads in Mexico in October, most of which boasted about the model's ability to solve math problems and the fact that it's completely free to use. It's also currently running ad campaigns in the UK and Philippines. On TikTok, creators in those countries have shared dozens of sponsored videos about Cici using hashtags like #ciciai. Thanks to that marketing push, downloads of the Cici app have seen a noticeable increase recently. According to Cici's privacy policy disclosure, it relies on technology from several other ByteDance-owned platforms, like the photo editor PicPic and coding assistant Coze. (ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED.) The design of Cici's mobile app looks identical to Doubao's, too. Since TikTok took off, ByteDance has struggled to produce another app with the same global impact. But without the Chinese internet regulations that block competition from Western AI players, ByteDance will have to go head-to-head with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Neither Google nor OpenAI have mastered the kind of dopamine-driven engagement that ByteDance built TikTok on,” says Dermot McGrath, a Shanghai-based investor and technologist. But Cici will face its own unique challenges outside China. The global AI app industry is more fractured, and users are making choices about which platforms to download based on their own cultural context and economic habits. ByteDance is also still viewed in many countries as an extension of the Chinese government, which has led to concerns about data security and political propaganda. “Unless they can navigate the geopolitical landscape or partner with Western companies,” ByteDance's advantages in the market may remain “largely confined to China and maybe other Asian markets,” McGrath says.

The lead develops a layer that keeps it from dissolving into water (much like aluminum develops an oxide layer) and won't hurt anyone as long as the water source doesn't pull a Flint. Anecdotaly, a landlord tried to rent me an apartment with lead. When I tested the water and it came back positive with lead. They changed water suppliers during a budgetary crisis.From the Wikipedia article:> In April 2014, during a financial crisis, state-appointed emergency manager Darnell Earley changed Flint's water source from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (sourced from Lake Huron and the Detroit River) to the Flint River. Officials failed to apply corrosion inhibitors to the water, which resulted in lead from aging pipes leaching into the water supply, exposing around 100,000 residents to elevated lead levels. [8] A pair of scientific studies confirmed that lead contamination was present in the water supply. [11] It later signed a 30-year contract with the new Great Lakes Water Authority (GLWA) on November 22, 2017. Crucially, the water treatment chemistry needs to remain consistent.

Even handwaving the expense and issues of that - did you just replace "lead" with "microplastics"? There is a concentration of it where it becomes harmful.>dependent on things the landlord doesn't controlThey have the ability to filter water. Remineralization post-filters are purely for better taste (subjective of course). I'm not buying this claim that all caves contain lead (throughout Europe, at least). Europe is not a wonderland for lead mining. It seems to show that Homo sapiens evolved with quite a lot of lead exposure, while H. neanderthalis did not - so they didn't need our "immunity" to lead.Finally,> “If all humans have this newer mutation in all corners of the world, very strong genetic pressure must have selected for it in our species.”Or, it was present in the bottleneck die-off of H. sapiens 800kya, and hasn't mutated since.

Or, it was present in the bottleneck die-off of H. sapiens 800kya, and hasn't mutated since. That at least does underline the importance of this genetic difference. We were also taught to run the cold tap until it got really cold (indicating that fresh water from the mains was coming out) before drinking from it.Weirdly, I remember that we had our water pipes replaced with plastic and the heating system modernised when the house was renovated in the late 80s, but we still persisted with those habits afterwards...Australian friends still get super upset with me for wasting so much water - they have water conservation drummed into them from an early age, so tend to see running the tap even for a second or two too long as being some sort of terrible sin.

Also the hot water sits in a tank (in most homes) full of scale and may just taste worse. I replaced my hot water heater and supply pipes myself, so it has no more lead than the cold. They're currently tearing up my street to replace the lead in supply lines, so... everything will hopefully improve here. Once the sacrificial anode is used up (maybe 1% of people actually replace their anode when needed), the tank begins corroding.Hot water is for washing things, cold water is for consumption. (No I don't mean lead poison them, I mine figure out what they are like without lead.) Now, how can I get my family tested for lead exposure? I use this form sometimes myself in a dialogue, as it fits that context. But as an isolated story title, I invariably end up reading the whole sentence several times, trying to parse it. People lazily remove words until it fits instead of reworking the whole thing sometimes. There is no warning or feedback for any of this, you're just expected to notice and edit your post after the fact. > In 1991, together with Claire Ernhart, Scarr was involved as an expert witness on behalf of the lead industry in the lawsuit United States v. Sharon Steel Corp., on the opposite side of Herbert Needleman who was testifying for the U.S. Justice Department owing to his research on the relationship between lead exposure and IQ. Scarr received money from the lead industry for consulting services which creates a conflict of interest.> Scarr retired to Hawaii in 1997, where she learned scuba diving, even obtaining a rescue diver certification. She also traveled "a lot, especially on cruise ships"Jesus Christ.
