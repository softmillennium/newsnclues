                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. women's national team forward Trinity Rodman has been diagnosed with an MCL sprain, per Washington Spirit coach Adrián González. "She's doing good... Obviously, an injury is not always a good situation, but it's not as bad as it could be. Grade one MCL sprains can heal in three weeks or less, with The Athletic reporting Thursday that Rodman is expected to undergo three weeks of rehabilitation before all parties reevaluate her status. A three-week timeline would rule her out for Washington's final two regular-season matches, but would potentially allow her to play some role in a playoff quarterfinal. The Spirit have clinched a playoff berth and will host that match, but the date of that game is yet to be announced. Per González, the Spirit have not set a timetable for Rodman's return. "We are going to take this day-by-day," said González. "Every player is completely different, and we want to support her, obviously. Right now, to be honest, I cannot anticipate [her timeline]." The Athletic's report noted that Rodman would withdraw from the USWNT's upcoming camp, which would have been a first call-up since April. U.S. Soccer has yet to confirm that news, though three upcoming friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand all fall within the three-week rehab timeline. A persistent back injury has disrupted Rodman's 2025, with the California native appearing in only 15 of the Spirit's 24 NWSL matches this season (starting nine times). However, Rodman returned from the summer break having seemingly put the back injury in her rear-view mirror, and has been in excellent form. Despite her limited involvement, Rodman has scored seven goals for Washington this season across all competitions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cole Palmer is set to spend six more weeks on the sidelines, with Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca admitting he was "wrong" about his injury return in November. The 23-year-old, who inspired the Blues to last season's Conference League and Club World Cup triumphs, has seen his campaign derailed by a persistent groin injury that hasn't healed. After firing in 18 goals across all competitions in Chelsea's trophy-laden campaign, which followed up a sensational 25-goal debut season, Palmer looked destined to build on his status at Stamford Bridge. His groin troubles have restricted him to just three Premier League appearances and a single Champions League outing, leaving a glaring void in Chelsea's attack. The Blues had initially believed Palmer was closing in on full fitness, with whispers of a return in early November. Yet Maresca has now revealed that the situation is far worse than he first thought and that his initial optimism was misplaced. In a candid press conference on Friday, Maresca didn't try to sugarcoat the situation and informed: "I was wrong [about Palmer]. Unfortunately, he needs to be out for six more weeks. Cole Palmer still figures to be part of England's World Cup plans if he can stay healthy. Palmer's setback isn't just bad news for Chelsea, but another headache for England boss Thomas Tuchel, who has been eager to integrate the attacker into his squad ahead of the World Cup next summer. His prolonged absence now means he's almost certain to miss the November internationals against Serbia and Albania, leaving his place in the squad under threat. Tuchel didn't hide his concern when addressing the issue. "First of all, the most important thing is that he can play without pain because the groin issue is a very dangerous one to become chronic," Tuchel said in a press conference. There is also with him no problem at all [for me]. Maresca gave a sobering update on the rest of his squad before Chelsea's Premier League clash at Nottingham Forest. "Levi [Colwill] and Liam [Delap] are still out," he added. "Unfortunately Benoit [Badiashile] will be out until December, a muscle problem. Moi [Caicedo], Enzo [Fernandez] and Pedro [Neto] did not take part in the session yesterday. During the international break, much of Chelsea's first team stayed behind at Cobham for rehabilitation work. Fernandez returned early from Argentina duty, Caicedo wasn't called up for Ecuador, and Joao Pedro sat out Brazil's matches as a precaution. It's been a constant cycle of recovery and readjustment for Maresca, who admitted that Palmer's prolonged absence now creates a tactical puzzle that won't be easy to solve. "First of all, to replace Cole, it's difficult," Maresca admitted. The ones we have, in Cole's position against Liverpool was Malo Gusto. It depends on the game plan we have. We don't have another player like Cole. Following Maresca's update, Palmer's absence is expected to stretch across a crucial run of fixtures. The England international will sit out games against Ajax, Sunderland, Wolves (twice), Tottenham, Qarabag, Burnley, Barcelona, and Arsenal. The club is prioritising his long-term health over any short-term boost, especially with a packed festive schedule looming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Coca-Cola Company in North America has awarded a $2.5 million gift to the University of Notre Dame's Urban Poverty and Business Initiative (UPBI). The games will take place from June 11 to July 19, 2026. As a partner of the FIFA World Cup 26, Coca-Cola is partnering with community groups, colleges and youth leadership programs across the country to drive economic growth and inclusion, help the next generation of leaders unlock their potential, and make positive and long-lasting contributions to local communities that extend beyond the tournament. “We are thankful to Coca-Cola for this gift, which will allow us to grow the Urban Poverty and Business Initiative network and significantly increase the number of disadvantaged entrepreneurs we serve,” said Mary Gallagher, the Marilyn Keough Dean and professor of global affairs at the Keough School. By expanding into new cities, we are not only supporting entrepreneurs, but also strengthening local economies and communities.” Currently operating in 55 cities throughout the U.S. and across the globe, UPBI serves more than 3,000 business owners per year, many of whom are facing adverse circumstances or economic hardship. With support from Coca-Cola, the program will broaden that scope to include 13 additional cities — 11 in the United States and two in Canada. This expansion will include the host locations of Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Seattle and San Francisco, as well as Toronto and Vancouver. “Through Coca-Cola's support, we will be able to provide a turnkey training system of business skills and best practices to new partners, which can then be shared with small business owners in their own communities,” said Michael Morris, professor of the practice who specializes in entrepreneurship and social innovation. The UPBI program equips partner organizations in each city with the model, structure, curriculum, content, tools and guidance to effectively create and launch their own entrepreneurship programs. Using an activity-based approach that centers on 80 steps to a sustainable business, the program is modeled on the belief that for every step it can help an entrepreneur take, he or she will be enabled to take two or three more on their own. Coca-Cola's gift will enable Notre Dame to establish relationships with new key individuals and organizations in host cities, receive commitments from lead partners in each city to join the UPBI partnership and implement its model, and ensure each city implements all components of the UPBI approach. “Hence, we are rewarding progress in moving their business ventures forward,” Morris explained. Notre Dame's McKenna Center seeks to better understand the critical role of global business in reducing poverty, underemployment and inequality by striving to stimulate economic growth and develop markets in communities struggling with those issues. “Our experience is that entrepreneurship can truly provide a pathway out of poverty, which can be empowering for both individuals and communities alike,” Morris said.

Of all factors explaining the chasm between Manchester United and Liverpool right now, not one can compare with the differing approaches to appoint their latest managers. Liverpool were compelled to hire Arne Slot after consulting a highly sophisticated data model developed by a Harvard-educated physicist. United, meanwhile, recruited Ruben Amorim largely because of the vibes.

United love a good narrative, and the way that Amorim had revived Sporting CP's fortunes by delivering a first league title in 19 years was highly appealing to a club at a loss as to how to rise again after more than a decade of decline after Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The club's main decision-makers, Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Omar Berrada, wanted a young charismatic coach on the rise and in Amorim they saw shades of Mikel Arteta and Pep Guardiola. 

Every time Ratcliffe has discussed Amorim, he has lauded his personality, describing the Portuguese as "intelligent" and "thoughtful" while speaking fondly of their chats over coffee at the Carrington training ground, where the co-owner tells the coach "where it's going wrong, and he tells me to f*ck off." 

What was lacking in United's thought process when they hired Amorim, however, was a thorough analysis of the most intriguing thing about him: his loyalty to the 3-4-3 system. Liverpool, by contrast, saw Amorim's formation fixation as a massive red flag and turned away from him and towards Slot.

Slot might be enduring his most difficult period as Liverpool boss as his side prepare to welcome their arch rivals to Anfield on Sunday after three successive defeats, but overall he has proved to be a brilliant hire. Quite unlike Amorim, who has created an even bigger mess than the one he inherited when he took charge of the Red Devils 11 months ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sports Interactive has secured a licence with FIFA ahead of a revamped International Management module in Football Manager 26. The ability to lead a national team was among the planned omissions from the series' last game, which was ultimately cancelled, and fans have been wondering whether they will get the chance to try their hand at an international job in a World Cup year. Thanks to a new multi-year agreement with FIFA, the possibilities for international management have been expanded, with officially branded FIFA competitions set to be included in FM26 for the first time. All teams involved in the World Cup will be fully licensed, including kit graphics, and will be playable across all devices in a content update which will arrive next year. Meanwhile, FM26 Mobile (Netflix) will include international management from launch. Football Manager 🤝 @FIFAcom Official FIFA tournaments debut in #FM26, with a revamped International Management module arriving in a free future content update ahead of FIFA World Cup™ 2026. Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said: “Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio. “Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. “To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we're delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. Those who have preordered from official retailers will get access to an Advanced Access Beta, the date of which is yet to be confirmed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinity Rodman will miss USWNT's October camp Bailey Holiver / Imagn Images Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman will miss the U.S. women's national team's friendlies against Portugal and New Zealand next week due to a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain she suffered on Wednesday during the Spirit's 4-0 Concacaf Champions Cup win over CF Monterrey Femenil. She could still possibly return this year, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation. Rodman underwent initial scans on Thursday, which revealed a grade one sprain. She had previously missed nine NWSL games this year due to an ongoing back injury that has impacted her since her rookie season in Washington. Hayes has not yet made a decision on her replacement. One option could be to pull a player from the recently announced U-23 squad, which will be training at the same location in Pennsylvania next week. Rodman went down in the 37th minute of Wednesday's match while going up against Monterrey defender Daniela Monroy. Rodman attempted a tackle that resulted in her remaining on the ground for several minutes. She was officially replaced in the 41st minute by teammate Brittany Ratcliffe. Rodman had recently enjoyed a return to form, earning September's NWSL Player of the Month and has scored five goals and recorded two assists in 15 appearances this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The past few years have produced a major paradigm shift in South American football; having won just one of the previous five Copa Libertadores editions, Brazilian teams have since won each of the last six Libertadores titles, with four of the last five finals producing an all-Brazilian clash. Jorge Jesus blazed the trail for Portuguese managers after a flawless year in charge of Flamengo, with the Rubro-Negro winning the 2019 Brasileirão title as well as their first Libertadores trophy in 38 years. Suddenly, every team wanted to get their hands on the next top Portuguese manager. After earning promotion to the top-flight in 2021, Botafogo have since hired Portuguese coaches Luís Castro, Bruno Lage, and Artur Jorge, with the latter guiding Botafogo to their first-ever Copa Libertadores title as well as their first league title since 1995, before departing at the start of 2025 and being replaced by fellow Portuguese coach Renato Paiva. Botafogo kicked off the tournament by beating Seattle Sounders 2-1 in their own backyard, before facing off against newly crowned kings of Europe, Paris Saint-Germain in the Rose Bowl. Having won each of their last six matches, including a 5-0 thrashing of Inter in the UEFA Champions League Final, all signs pointed to PSG demolishing their Brazilian opponents; instead, Igor Jesus would open the scoring before halftime and pave the way for a historic 1-0 victory. Despite losing to Atlético Madrid in their final group stage match, Botafogo secured a spot in the Round of 16 against Palmeiras, where Paulinho's 100th-minute winner saw Palmeiras prevail in Philadelphia, subduing Paiva to his eighth defeat as Botafogo manager (all by a 1-0 margin). It was one too many for Botafogo's American owner John Textor, who removed Paiva from his position. “My experience at Botafogo was wonderful,” stated Paiva in an exclusive RG interview. We managed to turn Botafogo's stadium into a fortress and didn't lose a single game at home, but the owner believed that Botafogo shouldn't have been eliminated by Palmeiras. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: my dismissal, after everything that happened, says much more about the person who fired me than it does about me and my work.” We had gone nine matches unbeaten, reached the Copa Libertadores knockout rounds and were six points behind Flamengo (now 12). There was no football justification for this dismissal, and, therefore, all of Brazilian football, which includes these directors, players, and the media were completely surprised by what happened. Born on March 22, 1970, in Pedrógão Pequeno, Portugal, Paiva dreamed of becoming a professional footballer and started excelling for his city's youth teams, but after turning 16 in the 1986/87 season and being forced to move up to the U-17s, Paiva was forced to choose between going to training in the morning or going to school in the morning. But whilst Paiva was forced to put these ambitions on the backburner, he never lost sight of football's importance. He played at the amateur level, devoured footballing magazines like Onze Mondial, and pursued a coaching career, eventually getting his first big break in 2004 after joining Benfica's newly refurbished academy as the assistant manager of their Juvenil B squad. It was here in Seixal where Paiva helped to mold a plethora of future stars like Bernardo Silva, João Félix, Renato Sanches, Gonçalo Ramos, Ederson, João Cancelo, and Rúben Dias, managing the club's U-14s, U-16s, U-17s, and U-19s before finally getting his start in professional football in January 2019 with Benfica B in the Portuguese second tier. According to a recent study by CIES, Benfica boasts the most profitable academy in world football, having generated €516 million in transfer revenue from youth products over the past decade, well ahead of second-placed Ajax (€376 million). They've done so thanks to a tweak in their youth strategy that has seen them prioritize talent development over winning matches. “I joined in year zero of the academy…my colleagues and I even helped in the construction by going to the site and explained how we wanted things to be, it's an academy built according to our vision. He gathered everyone together, and said: ‘From now on, Benfica's concern will not be winning youth championships, it will be developing players. “We tried to find a balance between developing the player but also winning, and we managed to do that for a long time; I have three national titles and six regional district titles. But when you're arriving at the club at eight in the morning and leaving at eight at night, you had plenty of time to gather information, to plan and develop methodologies, and that was a crucial step for the stability and development of Benfica's coaches. Eventually, Paiva started itching for a new adventure outside his comfort zone. When Benfica opted to replace manager Bruno Lage with Jorge Jesus in the summer of 2020, Paiva realized that it was time for change and departed his post at Benfica B to try a new adventure in South America. Paiva enjoyed a successful debut season in top-flight football, leading Independiente Del Valle to the first Ecuadorian Serie A title in the club's 63-year history and also helping to shape Willian Pacho, who has since gone on to become a starter in PSG's Champions League-winning backline and arguably the brightest young central defender in world football. He departed after 17 months to take charge of Mexican side León, where he lasted just six months before resigning from his post. He was out of work for precisely eight days before Brazilian side Bahia announced him as their new manager on December 6, 2022, with Paiva leading the club to the Campeonato Baiano, only to resign from his post after nine months at the helm. “When Toluca won the championship, several Mexican journalists, several Toluca players and directors, as well as the president, sent me messages about their first title in 15 years, telling me ‘It's very much yours.' When we got to Toluca, Toluca was in thirteenth place, out of the playoffs, and in six months, we managed to put them into third place. “There is no doubt that it was a year in which we left the seeds of football in that team. That's when we began to build the title that Toluca won, because it was largely due to our work, not only in the way the team played, but also in the squad we managed to build, signing several quality players like Alexis Vega, Paulinho, Jesús Gallardo, and Luan.” Paiva returned to Brazil and was hired as Botafogo manager on February 28, 2025, replacing his compatriot Artur Jorge after the latter's departure to Qatari outfit Al-Rayyan SC. He kicked off his tenure with a 0-0 draw at Palmeiras in league play and a 1-0 loss at Universidad de Chile in the Libertadores, before stringing together back-to-back wins and then succumbing to three defeats and a draw. In an even-keeled battle across 120 minutes, which saw both sides register one big chance apiece, with Palmeiras registering 19 shots to Botafogo's 16, the Verdão's superior individual quality and depth as well as veteran experience in knockout competition, proved the difference for Palmeiras. This isn't true: I had to adapt to the lack of players and the many injuries I was dealing with. If I didn't make those adaptations, I wouldn't have achieved the results needed to make it to the Club World Cup. This is the first time I'm going to say this: He fired Renato because Renato did not betray his convictions. Fortaleza looked set to kick off his tenure with a win against his former side Bahia, only for Rodrigo Nestor to pull level in the 80th minute and secure a 1-1 draw. The Leão do Pici would bounce back with a 3-1 win vs. RB Bragantino, only to succumb to two wins and two draws, before falling to a 2-1 defeat at Fluminense and being eliminated from the Copa Libertadores Round of 16 by Vélez Sarsfield, followed by a 1-0 loss to Mirassol. The final straw came on August 31 after suffering a fourth consecutive defeat vs. Internacional, with Paiva being relieved of his duties after just 10 matches in charge. At 55, he's well aware that he still has plenty of unfinished business in the coaching industry, but right now, he's just focused on recharging his batteries, having rejected offers to manage in Egypt, Colombia, Paraguay, and Portugal over the past few weeks. I had never been fired in 23 years – I left Bahia, Toluca, and León of my own free will, and suddenly, I was fired by Botafogo in June and Fortaleza in September. I understand that I must reflect together with my technical staff, reflect on what we did, reflect on more or less hasty decisions, more or less analysis, and deliberate: ‘Okay, what's the next project? And what kind of projects are they presenting me with in these past few months?” They were also invitations from projects with some instability that didn't really speak to me and say ‘I'm going to join this project' because maybe they wouldn't give you time and you'd get fired again.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HOLLISTON – Daniel De Moura did not choose his favorite player at random – he has something in common with Neymar: they are both international soccer players who have close ties to Brazil. De Moura, a Holliston High senior, was officially named on Tuesday to the U.S. Men's Deaf National Team that will compete in next month's Summer Deaflympics in Tokyo. He previously competed for Team USA at last year's Deaf Pan American Games in Canoas, Brazil, where the Americans placed third to clinch a spot in Japan. At eight months old, he was diagnosed with meningitis. He soon had surgery to install cochlear implants, which, according to the Mayo Clinic, “use a sound processor that fits behind the ear and pulls in sounds from outside the ear. Not even a year old and he made history. “I believe I am the youngest ever to get that surgery done at Boston Children's Hospital,” said De Moura, whose hearing is normal with the implants. Before attending Holliston High, De Moura went to a private school with other deaf children. “It definitely came with a lot of challenges growing up, especially around people who didn't know what it was,” he said. While Holliston coach Jay Dupuis said De Moura will be missed, the chance to play for your country is too good to pass up. “It has been great to see him grow as a player over the past few seasons. The energy and passion he brings is contagious.” In Tokyo, the Americans will play Ukraine on Nov. 16 before facing Senegal two days later. USA lost to Senegal 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the 2023 World Deaf Football Championships, a match De Moura did not play in but remembers well. “It was a tough game, but we're going to get them this time,” he said. Those games are scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 26 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium in East Hartford, Connecticut. The 1 p.m. USA-Germany contest will be broadcast live in English on truTV and HBO Max, and in Spanish via Telemundo Deportes Ahora. The USWNT will play Portugal at 4 p.m. (TNT, truTV, HBO Max, Universo, Peacock). “Being paired with the U.S. Women's National Team, broadcast live on national television, is more than a spotlight — it's a breakthrough,” Men's Deaf National Team head coach Everett Palache said in a press release. De Moura has one goal and one assist for the Panthers this fall, and has created plays that led to penalty kicks when taken down in the opponent's penalty box. “A lot of people like to ask questions, but in reality, I believe I'm like the same as everyone else,” he said. “I just have a piece of tech on my ear that may set me apart, but I know deep down I'm on the same level and it doesn't hold me back.” He wants to share his experience with the next generation. “I want to be an outlet like that for people,” De Moura said. “I want to show kids with hearing loss that it can't hold them back; it can only make them go further.” Tim Dumas is a multimedia journalist for the Daily News.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Colin Udoh reveals the role he played in 'helping' Nigeria secure a World Cup play-off place after their 4-0 win over Benin. South Africa's 3-0 win over Rwanda that booked them a place in the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico was not only a strong footballing performance but also a symbol of the resilience that coach Hugo Broos has instilled in the team. Bafana Bafana faced a self-made crisis heading into the final game, as they trailed Benin by two points at the top of Group C. After relinquishing top spot by having their March win over Lesotho overturned for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena, they dropped two more points in a 0-0 draw with Zimbabwe on Saturday. However, Benin 's 4-0 defeat by Nigeria left Bafana with a fighting chance: Victory over Rwanda was all they needed to progress. That match led to the departure of his predecessor, Molefi Ntseki, and the Belgian's subsequent appointment as head coach. Almost five years later, he has delivered on his mission to overhaul Bafana Bafana's belief in their own abilities -- with his focus on youth paying off. I couldn't understand it," Broos told ESPN in 2021 after making early progress in changing the results and culture of the team. "So then I started to see who was playing. There were so many players of 27, 28, 29 years old. "I said: 'Yes, that's right, but if you do not play the younger players, then when are they going to have experience?' "So, therefore, I started also with young players who had quality. That process has now paid dividends, with a dominant performance led by young players who were cool, calm and collected from the first whistle to the last. Bafana led 2-0 at halftime, courtesy of a long-range Thalente Mbatha strike and a curling finish by Oswin Appollis, before Evidence Makgopa's 72nd-minute header sealed the win that saw South Africa qualify for their fourth World Cup -- and their first since they hosted the tournament in 2010. Broos, alone, cannot take credit for the development of players such as Mbatha, Appollis and Makgopa -- Orlando Pirates stars in their mid-20s -- but the former Cameroon head coach, who won the 2017 AFCON against all odds, was a driving force for South Africa's nationwide shift in attitudes towards young players. Then at Baroka FC, Makgopa had not been fancied to lead the line at international level, but Broos took a chance on him and it paid off. Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns -- the two dominant clubs in South Africa over the past decade -- also deserve their fair share of credit. Sundowns have invested heavily under the ownership of Confederation of African Football president Patrice Motsepe, who bought a controlling stake in 2003 and then the remaining shares the following year. Off the back of a disappointing spell in charge of Bafana Bafana, a reinvigorated Mosimane led Sundowns to their first CAF Champions League title in 2016 -- only the second by a South African club; Pirates previously won it in 1995. None could quite match the financial might of Sundowns, but Pirates improved their talent development and recruitment structures -- and their streamlined squad has closed the gap on a Sundowns side now struggling with fatigue and player discontent after the FIFA Club World Cup, a tournament that saw them impress on the global stage but face struggles keeping their players away from prying eyes elsewhere in the world. Broos has often encouraged Bafana Bafana players to move overseas, but facing an injury crisis heading into a decisive qualifier, he started with an entirely locally-based XI. South Africa started five Sundowns players -- Ronwen Williams, Khuliso Mudau, Aubrey Modiba, Mokoena and Thapelo Morena -- five Pirates players -- Mbatha, Appollis, Makgopa, Nkosinathi Sibisi and Sipho Mbule -- and one from TS Galaxy, Khulumani Ndamane. That, alone, speaks volumes of the quality in South Africa's club football. What is new -- first and foremost -- is the apparent end of the days when South African players were viewed as too comfortable and pampered to win when the going got tough.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers The FIFA Club World Cup trophy is displayed during a news conference at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Monday, April 14, 2025. More than 1 million tickets have already been sold for next year's World Cup, FIFA said in its first update on numbers since the official start of sales began earlier this month. FIFA said people from 212 different countries and territories have already purchased, even though only 28 of the 48 spots in the field have been filled. Rounding out the top-10 countries in terms of tickets purchased already: England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina and France, in order, FIFA said. “As national teams across the globe compete for a place at the historic FIFA World Cup 26, I am thrilled so many football-loving fans also want to be part of this watershed event in North America,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a release. He added, “It's an incredible response, and a wonderful sign that the biggest, most inclusive FIFA World Cup in history is capturing the imagination of supporters everywhere.” FIFA also announced that its resale site has opened — and tickets for the World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, were available there at prices ranging from $9,538 to $57,500 per seat as of Thursday afternoon. FIFA did not reveal any specific figures about how many tickets have been sold for certain matches or offer any breakdowns by host site. It also has not issued a grid of list prices for tickets, as it has for each previous World Cup since at least 1990. FIFA's announcement came after President Donald Trump said earlier this week he may consider relocating World Cup matches set to be played in suburban Boston and other locations his administration deems unsafe. An international friendly match between defending World Cup champion Argentina — featuring Lionel Messi — and Puerto Rico was moved from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, because of lagging ticket sales that some believe were in response to the immigration crackdown. The buyers who purchased the tickets in this first round of availability were selected out of 4.5 million applicants in a lottery that took place last month. The entry period for the next draw will open to fans on Oct. 27, FIFA said, noting that single-match tickets to all 104 games, along with venue- and team-specific tickets, will be released. It is unknown how many of those seats will be available for sale to the public. Almost all seats for the vast majority of matches were set at a much higher price. Fans with the option to purchase could choose seats in one of four categories; Category 1 is what FIFA officials call the best seats, Category 4 is somewhere around the tops of stadiums. Ticket costs are expected to fluctuate as soccer's biggest event utilizes dynamic pricing for the first time. A third phase, termed a random selection draw, will start after the final draw of teams on Dec. 5 determines the World Cup schedule. FIFA has said tickets also will be available closer to the tournament “on a first-come, first-served basis.” Los Angeles Lakers guard — and Real Madrid fan — Luka Doncic was announced on Thursday as the latest ambassador for the World Cup matches that will be played in Southern California next year. “Los Angeles is a great city full of amazing people who love to play and watch every sport. I can't wait for the World Cup and it's an honour to help bring people together through a sport that connects so many cultures around the globe.” Please abide by our community guidelines   for posting your comments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With FIFA's rotation system favoring North America and Oceania, the door may open for another World Cup on US soil in the not too distant future. Forty-eight teams, 104 matches, three countries, and 16 host cities will come together for a historic, innovative, tri-continental tournament. And it's possible the United States could once again host the world's biggest sporting event sooner than anyone imagined – with just 12 years in between. If FIFA maintains its regional rotation model, only Oceania (OFC) and Concacaf (North America, Central America and the Caribbean) would be eligible to host in 2038. That's because the 2030 World Cup will be shared by three confederations – UEFA (Portugal and Spain), CAF (Morocco), and Conmebol (Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, which will each stage one of the three opening matches to commemorate the centenary of the tournament). Although the rotation policy is no longer officially enshrined in FIFA rules – having been “discontinued” after South Africa hosted in 2010 – the federation continues to apply it in practice. Russia hosted in 2018, and 12 years later the tournament will return to Europe, suggesting an unwritten rule of skipping at least two editions before the same region can host again. By combining three confederations for 2030, FIFA effectively benefits Concacaf despite the short gap since 2026. Meanwhile, Conmebol – with only three games in 2030 – would not be eligible again until 2042. The Athletic first floated the idea after FIFA's most recent Congress, held in May 2025 in Asunción, Paraguay, home to Conmebol's headquarters. Since Oceania lacks the infrastructure to host a full-scale World Cup, except for what New Zealand could offer, FIFA might repeat a structure similar to 2030 – a World Cup spanning an ocean. The concept would pair New Zealand and the United States, separated by almost 6,000 miles, connected by a Pacific corridor to shorten travel distances. The plan envisions possible venues in Fiji and Hawaii. Both nations have proven hosting records – New Zealand with the 2015 Under-20 World Cup and the 2023 Women's World Cup (alongside Australia), and the US with decades of major-event experience.
