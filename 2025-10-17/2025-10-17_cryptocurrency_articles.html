                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin is close to giving up all of this year's gains, dragged lower since renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China sparked a reversal in the digital assets market. The world's largest cryptocurrency (BTCUSD) has declined about 7% since Monday, according to research platform Messari. The drag in bitcoin prices is reflected in the shares of stocks linked to it. Bitcoin treasury Strategy (MSTR), crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) are all down at least 5% in the past five days. At around $107,000, bitcoin's 14% year-to-date return is now roughly in line with the S&P 500's. Trade worries last week sparked a historic purge in the crypto market, upending the bitcoin-as-safe-haven narrative and severing the link between it and gold, whose recent climb to record highs is driving American consumers to cash in. Gold, Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni wrote earlier this week, "is the new bitcoin." Trade tensions have taken some of the air out of bitcoin's sales, pulling the price of the cryptocurrency back from recent record highs. Still, some crypto experts see reasons why the climb could start again. Bitcoin has pulled back from recent record highs, which some observers note is not uncommon: Some past highs have also been followed by substantial pullbacks. Still, with bitcoin seemingly once again viewed more like a risk asset than a safe haven, experts are considering crypto-specific factors to project the next move for prices. Ben Cowen, founder and chief of quantitative market analysis provider Into the Cryptoverse, is eyeing technical indicators such as bitcoin's 50-week moving average, which is currently around $100,000. "There's still a reason to be optimistic as long as bitcoin is holding above the 50-week moving average," said Cowen in a recent episode of the Milk Road podcast. Cathie Wood's Ark Invest and Fidelity—which are behind the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) and the Fidelity Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), respectively—recently published quarterly reports for the digital asset, highlighting possible near-term positives. Ark's report pointed toward indicators—public companies boosted their holdings by 40% this year, and crypto derivatives markets are healthy—it sees as bullish for bitcoin. "Although short-term volatility is always possible, the confluence of strong on-chain metrics, institutional demand, and macroeconomic support suggests continued upside potential," Fidelity wrote." Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, issuer of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), expects the crypto market to shrug off the latest rout because no major crypto player keeled over, blockchains handled the stress test with no issues, and professional investors have "largely ignored" it. "Crypto may be a little jittery in the near term," Hougan wrote. "Altseason Dreams vs Reality — What the Data Actually Shows w/ Benjamin Cowen." Three Questions After the Flash Crash."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. As fervor around stablecoins grows from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, one of the most high-profile new crypto projects has drummed up a massive coffer of funds to back its ambitious plans. Tempo, a payments-focused blockchain developed by the fintech giant Stripe and the blockchain venture firm Paradigm, has raised $500 million in fresh funding in a Series A round led by venture giant Greenoaks and Joshua Kushner's Thrive Capital, according to five people familiar with the matter. Sequoia, Ribbit Capital, and Ron Conway's SV Angel also participated, according to one of the people. Paradigm and Stripe did not contribute capital to the round. Stripe, Paradigm, Greenoaks, and SV Angel declined to comment. Thrive, Ribbit, and Sequoia did not respond to a request for comment. Tempo is just the latest crypto play from Stripe. And, in June, Stripe said it intended to buy the crypto wallet company Privy for an undisclosed sum. And Bridge cofounder and CEO Zach Abrams said on Tuesday that his Stripe-owned startup submitted an application for a national bank trust charter to comply with the Genius Act, recently signed-into-law legislation that establishes regulatory guardrails for stablecoin issuers. Tempo, however, represents Stripe's most ambitious project as it seeks to compete with long-established blockchains such as Ethereum and Solana that process stablecoin transactions. Stripe partnered with Paradigm to roll out the initiative, and Paradigm's managing partner Matt Huang—who also sits on Stripe's board—is leading Tempo. The date of its launch remains unclear, and Tempo has not signaled whether it will release its own crypto token. The company previously announced that it will remain stablecoin agnostic, meaning different tokens can be used to pay the “gas” fees, or small payments required to process transactions. Stripe's Tempo isn't the only planned blockchain from a large corporation. Since January, financial firms like the online brokerage Robinhood and the stablecoin behemoth Circle have released plans to start up blockchains of their own. Blockchains are essentially networks of servers that process crypto transactions. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

According to the regulator, participation in select competitions on the platform that offer monetary benefits is only possible “in exchange for a monetary stake,” ultimately providing rewards via random draw or similar procedures. Further information about the criminal complaint and proceedings are not being shared at this time, Gespa Director Manuel Richard told Decrypt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>October 17, 2025 – In a monumental strategic pivot, OpenSea, once the undisputed titan of the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) market, has officially transformed into a comprehensive multi-chain crypto trading hub. OpenSea's pivot has catalyzed a notable resurgence in its platform activity and had a mixed, yet largely positive, impact on the broader digital asset markets. This surge underscores the immediate traction of its multi-chain aggregation model. The broader NFT market, which had experienced a sharp dip in early October 2025 with total market capitalization falling from $6.2 billion to $5 billion due to external macroeconomic pressures (like a U.S.-China trade tariff shock), showed remarkable resilience. This rapid rebound, coinciding with OpenSea's aggressive strategy and a generally strong performance from Bitcoin, injected cautious optimism into investors. Blue-chip NFT collections, such as CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), and Pudgy Penguins, have shown renewed prominence, with PFP (Profile Picture) collections experiencing a 187% quarter-over-quarter rise in trading volume. Notably, Pudgy Penguins' market value surpassed that of BAYC, with its floor price increasing by 539% since launch. OpenSea's model of aggregating liquidity from various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like Uniswap and Meteora across its 22 supported blockchains aims to enhance liquidity for both fungible tokens and NFTs. The upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) for OpenSea's native $SEA token, scheduled for October 2025, has significantly incentivized user activity, with anticipation of a short-term price spike upon launch. The Web3 community has met OpenSea's multi-chain aggregation pivot with a dynamic blend of cautious optimism and active engagement throughout October 2025. Following an initial market dip, the NFT market's swift recovery helped solidify belief in the sector's long-term viability, fostering a more positive narrative around OpenSea's ambitious expansion. A significant driver of community discussion has been the impending launch of OpenSea's native $SEA token, with its "Treasure Chests" rewards program, which concluded on October 15, 2025, heavily incentivizing users to link Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) wallets for eligibility in the anticipated airdrop. This campaign sparked considerable excitement, with users actively strategizing to maximize their potential rewards. However, community discussions also reflected some debate, particularly concerning the criteria for airdrop eligibility – whether to prioritize historical users or current engagement. OpenSea's acquisition of mobile wallet company Rally in July 2025 and its vision to build an "onchain everything app" with cross-chain and AI features are seen as strategic moves aligning with this evolving narrative. The effects on related DeFi protocols, NFT projects, and Web3 applications have been notable. Blue-chip NFT collections have regained prominence, indicating renewed investor confidence. In DeFi, OpenSea's integration with decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and Meteora enhances its offerings, while the introduction of "NFT Strategy tokens" combines NFTs with DeFi principles for automated trading strategies. For the broader Web3 landscape, OpenSea's vision to become a comprehensive "Web3 home" that enables easy trading of any asset across various chains and wallets is seen as critical for fostering widespread adoption, simplifying the user experience and providing a tangible mechanism for digital ownership. OpenSea's strategic pivot in October 2025 is not merely a change in business model; it's a significant indicator of the crypto market's maturation and evolving demands. The enhanced trading flexibility across 22 blockchains will likely attract a broader user base, intensifying competition among existing NFT marketplaces and decentralized exchanges. The resurgence of interest in blue-chip NFTs, fueled by OpenSea's gamified incentives and AI-powered tools, could also continue. Long-term, this move is poised to fundamentally reshape the crypto and NFT ecosystems. OpenSea's abstraction of underlying blockchain complexities will facilitate a more seamless and interconnected Web3 experience, crucial for mainstream NFT adoption in gaming, DeFi, and the metaverse. Increased cross-chain interoperability will drive the development of essential infrastructure like bridges and protocols, breaking down existing blockchain "silos." Digital asset valuations may become more stable, influenced by functionality and reach across diverse ecosystems. Regulatory clarity globally, especially concerning NFTs as potential securities, will shape market confidence. OpenSea's planned new mobile app, designed for intuitive, self-custodial cross-chain trading, also holds significant potential to lower entry barriers and expand market reach. For projects, embracing multi-chain compatibility and focusing on utility are now strategic imperatives. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, the key takeaway is the platform's expanded capabilities, offering seamless trading of NFTs, memecoins, and fungible tokens across 22 blockchains. The impending $SEA token launch, with its associated incentives and airdrop programs (for which EVM wallet linking by October 15, 2025, was crucial), is a central component of this strategy, aiming to reward active users and foster a vibrant ecosystem. OpenSea's revised fee structure, with a portion channeled into reward pools, further underscores its commitment to user engagement. The long-term significance of this pivot cannot be overstated. By diversifying beyond its NFT-centric origins, OpenSea aims to achieve greater stability and reclaim market leadership against fierce competition. The vision of OpenSea as a "Web3 home" where any asset can be traded across any chain or wallet, regardless of user experience, speaks volumes about its ambition to drive mainstream integration. The effectiveness of its AI-powered tools, the continuous expansion of its blockchain support, and any further developments in the global regulatory environment for digital assets will also be crucial indicators of its long-term success and impact on crypto adoption.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“You hearing about this CoinCheck thing?” The voice belonged to a source at the Financial Services Agency, someone who'd watched Japan's cryptocurrency industry grow from a curiosity into a multi-trillion-yen juggernaut. More than Half a billion dollars, gone. He was calling me as a courtesy. Four years earlier, another cryptocurrency exchange had collapsed under similar circumstances: Mt. Gox, once the world's largest Bitcoin trading platform. It had filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after revealing that 850,000 bitcoins—worth about $470 million then—had disappeared from its systems.It was the world's largest bitcoin exchange at the time, run not by a Japanese executive but by an odd Frenchman named Mark Karpeles. But now it was January 26, 2018, and Japan was about to learn a hard lesson about digital money and who gets held accountable when it disappears. At exactly 2:57 AM, hackers penetrated CoinCheck's systems and began systematically draining the exchange's hot wallet of NEM cryptocurrency. NEM is a type of cryptocurrency (short for New Economy Movement) that operates on its own blockchain. It was designed for fast, low-cost transactions and smart asset management — similar to Bitcoin, but with extra features for businesses and developers. The hot wallet is a term for a digital wallet connected to the internet, used by exchanges to store and send cryptocurrency quickly. It's convenient for daily transactions, but also more vulnerable to hacking than an offline “cold wallet”. You don't want to leave it full of money. The breach was surgical in its precision. The attackers had gained access weeks earlier through a sophisticated “phishing” campaign that compromised employee credentials. In a matter of hours, 523 million NEM tokens—worth approximately ¥58 billion ($534 million at the time)—vanished into the digital ether. But here's the crucial detail that would define everything that followed: CoinCheck didn't notice the theft until nearly nine hours later, when customers began reporting they couldn't access their accounts. The technical details tell the story of a company that had grown too fast with too little regard for security. CoinCheck was storing massive amounts of cryptocurrency in “hot wallets”—systems connected to the internet and vulnerable to attack. Industry best practice called for keeping most digital assets in “cold wallets,” offline storage systems that hackers couldn't reach. But cold wallets were inconvenient for high-frequency trading, and CoinCheck prioritized speed over security. The hackers exploited this weakness with military precision. They used a technique called “transaction malleability,” manipulating the NEM transaction records to make it appear as though legitimate transfers were taking place while they drained the exchange's reserves. What followed was a master class in crisis management, Japanese-style. Within hours of discovering the breach, CoinCheck executives were bowing deeply before television cameras, apologizing to their customers and the nation. But here's where the story gets interesting—and pay attention because it shows how Japan's two systems of justice become visible to anyone willing to look. CoinCheck's response to the hack was swift, comprehensive, and expensive. The company used its own capital to reimburse all 260,000 affected customers, paying out the full ¥58 billion in damages. They cooperated fully with police investigators and financial regulators. They hired external security firms to audit their systems and implement new safeguards. CoinCheck was eventually acquired by Monex Group, a major financial services company, and rebuilt itself into one of Japan's leading cryptocurrency exchanges. The company's executives faced no criminal charges. The hack was treated as a business failure requiring business solutions, not a criminal matter requiring criminal punishment. But that wasn't the last time a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange would get whacked. The DMM Bitcoin hack that May saw ¥48.2 billion ($482 million) in cryptocurrency stolen–probably by North Korean hackers from what is sometimes called the TraderTraitor group, part of the larger Lazarus organization. One of the things that made DMM Bitcoin interesting was that the firm derived their capital from pornography. Its parent, DMM (founded by Keishi Kameyama), made its early fortune in adult entertainment and digital media before branching into e-commerce, web services, and later financial offerings. They still make money from such film offerings  like  VR: Seduced by the Mysterious Shine of Black Pantyhose Beautiful Legs—Zero Distance Sniffing… When DMM launched its cryptocurrency exchange arm in 2018, it leveraged that corporate infrastructure and capital—but that does not automatically mean its funding was illicit or nefarious. Employing some top Japanese talents, they turned their new venture into a thriving business. North Korean hackers, posing as recruiters, sent sophisticated spear-phishing emails to employees of companies managing DMM Bitcoin's cryptocurrency wallets. One employee, thinking he was participating in a job interview process, clicked on a malicious link that installed malware on his computer. When they finally struck, they manipulated the user interface to hide their activities from the multiple people required to authorize large cryptocurrency transfers. What appeared to be routine maintenance became a massive theft. The company scrambled to contain the damage, froze services, and pledged to reimburse customers using support from the broader DMM group.By late 2024, the damage was severe enough that DMM Bitcoin announced it would liquidate or wind down operations, and transfer customer assets to another platform. But here's what's remarkable: DMM Bitcoin, like CoinCheck before it, was treated as a victim rather than a criminal enterprise. The company shut down operations and returned customer funds. They recruit legitimate IT workers who infiltrate cryptocurrency companies using false identities, building backdoors into systems from the inside. They've perfected the art of “social engineering”—manipulating people rather than just attacking computer systems. But regardless of how sophisticated the attacks become, the response in Japan remains consistent in most cases of corporate malfeasance: Japanese companies and executives are treated as victims deserving protection and support, but foreign operators face criminal liability and prosecution. The contrast between these two cases and  Japan's most famous cryptocurrency case couldn't be more stark. The first big cryptocurrency heist was in 2014 Gox, located in Tokyo, was once the world's largest Bitcoin trading platform. It suddenly filed for bankruptcy in February 2014 after revealing that 850,000 bitcoins—worth about $470 million then—had disappeared from its systems. Gox's CEO, Mark Karpeles, claimed hackers were responsible for the missing cryptocurrency. Gox faced regulatory scrutiny and customer outrage. But that's where the similarities ended, because Mt. A Japanese prosecutor who has written a book about the excess of the prosecutor offices in Japan once wrote, , “I was taught that yakuza (Japanese mobsters) and foreigners have no human rights.” Apparently, he wasn't the only prosecutor that felt that way. Mark Karpelès, a French man, who was fascinated by Japan since his teenage years, wasn't what you'd call a criminal mastermind. He was more of a man who could get lost inside his own code and forget there was a world outside the screen. Chubby, pale, and soft-spoken, he had the look of someone who'd spent most of his life indoors, talking more to machines than to people. He wore geek-culture like armor—anime T-shirts, the occasional grin that said I'm smarter than I look—and in a way, he was. When he landed in Tokyo in the summer of 2009 with a cat named Tibane and set up his company called Tibanne Ltd., he didn't have much more than curiosity and a steady Wi-Fi connection. But curiosity, when combined with hubris and a few hundred thousand bitcoins, can be as dangerous as nitroglycerin. He was the kind of guy who could dismantle a toaster to learn how it worked, then forget where the springs went. Gox was that toaster—except it held half a billion dollars' worth of virtual money and more user passwords than anyone cared to count. Mark turned what had been a failed trading card site for Magic: The Gathering  into the world's largest bitcoin exchange. Gox is short for Magic The Gathering (Cards) Exchange. Of course, making a financial platform out of a site that was originally used to buy and sell the equivalent of magic-themed Pokemon cards might not have been the greatest idea, but it worked. For a while, he was the high priest of crypto—an unlikely messiah running an empire out of a cramped Tokyo office with exposed wires and leftover pizza boxes. He even planned to open a Bitcoin Café downstairs from the exchange. “A place for believers,” he told me once. Somewhere in the wires, millions of bitcoins had vanished. Everyone else just wanted their money back. Gox finally collapsed in February 2014, it took the hopes of a generation of digital dreamers with it. Protesters outside the office holding cardboard signs and rage in their eyes. He offered the press coffee and reassurances. Somewhere between negligence and naivety lay the truth, and Mark was right in the middle, blinking like a bear just woken from hibernation. He wasn't a villain, at least not the mustache-twirling kind. He was the kind of man who believed he could fix anything with enough code, enough caffeine, and maybe another cat. But Japan's police didn't share that faith. Gox was a case I would follow for five years. It was my entry into the world of cryptocurrency. Over time, I went back and forth wondering whether Mark was innocent or guilty. That I am calling him by his first name should tell you that I did certainly grow to like him. Before Mark's arrest, I warned him what was coming. They will parade you past a crowd of reporters. You'll be held at least twenty-four hours. Then you will be turned over to the prosecution. They'll probably ask for ten days more of detention, claiming you're a risk. They'll do that again and get ten more days. And if you don't confess, they'll rearrest you, and the whole process starts over again.” Mark, eating a piece of cinnamon toast, assured me he was still talking with the police. That's the last image people will have of you for a long time to come. The press will be there to photograph it. The advice I gave him came from over 20 years spent covering crime in Japan. I explained that Japanese prosecutors hate to take on anything less than a slam-dunk case—that's why they have a 99 percent conviction rate. In Japan's criminal justice apparatus, the working motto isn't innocent until proven guilty—it's guilty until proven guilty. Suspects are held in isolation, interrogated without lawyers present, fed terrible food, and subjected to psychological pressure designed to break their will. The police can arrest someone on minor charges and keep re-arresting them on new charges, extending detention indefinitely. It's a system where confessions are everything, and the police will use every psychological tool to extract them—even from the innocent. They came for him on the humid morning of August 1, 2015, after kindly calling ahead—as if to say, “Get dressed, we're arresting you for your own good.” He greeted them wearing a blue T-shirt that read “Effortless French” and a Monokuma baseball cap, half-white, half-black. And he didn't follow my advice. He was cuffed, paraded before cameras, and hauled off to jail, where he would spend nearly a year without bail—arrested three times total, each new arrest allowing prosecutors to extend his detention as they searched for something, anything, that might stick. During that time, he was interrogated daily without a lawyer present, pressured to confess to crimes he maintained he didn't commit, and held in conditions that would break most people. I knew a Japanese cop who had worked on the case. They can be fired and even prosecuted for doing it. It makes reporting on crime here difficult. “According to sources close to the investigation” is a phrase that appears time and time again in newspaper coverage. The charges against Karpelès were serious: embezzlement, breach of trust, and data manipulation. And they decided Karpeles must be guilty. So their strategy was to arrest him on any charge they could find, and keep arresting him until he confessed.” They hold the suspect for 23 days—he confesses or doesn't confess and then they arrest him or her  on charges of murder (sometimes manslaughter) and the process repeats. Once Karples was indicted–a guilty verdict seemed to be written in stone. Japan has a 99% conviction rate after an indictment. No one was sure what had really happened. The French press called it a miscarriage of justice. The mainstream media convicted Karpeles before his trial even began. But I wasn't convinced that the charges were valid or that he had hacked the exchange. And my first clue that maybe, just maybe, there was more to the story that met the eye. And he asked me to feed Mark's cat until he could find someone to look after them. He had more than one, it turned out. But originally I had only signed up for one cat. And that was when I spotted on his desk, the business card of Tigran Gambaryan. Created by Grove Atlantic and Electric Literature</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Each may have an intangible value ranging from tens of thousands to a few million dollars,” explained Jason Armstrong, CEO of Great Estate Blockchain. Prominent historic landmarks typically monetize their intangible value through tourism and the sale of franchised merchandise such as books, videos, and souvenirs. However, the majority of historic landmark properties lack the recognition needed to attract significant tourist traffic or generate meaningful merchandise sales, leaving most of their intangible value untapped. Great Estate Blockchain is developing solutions that combine a crypto token strategy with a short-term rental business model to monetize the intangible value of these historic landmarks. After new management took over in 2024, the company focused on renovating a $2.5 million historic landmark into a boutique Airbnb and researched into the potential of releasing Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) based on the property's cultural value. Since then, the company has continued to develop solutions focused on monetizing the social and cultural value of historic landmarks. “The key is to develop a solution that monetizes a property's cultural value without compromising its commercial value,” said Armstrong. “Our solution is to combine crypto strategy with renovating these historic properties into short-term rentals, such as Airbnb. Operating a property as an Airbnb and monetizing its cultural value through crypto technology are two complementary business lines. Because each Airbnb guest is a potential buyer of our crypto tokens, and each token holder is a potential client for our Airbnb service.” While the company is unable to provide a comprehensive solution in the near future due to limited capital resources, it has launched its new website, GreatEstateBlockchain.com, and may begin pre-orders for its pilot crypto tokens in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American dream is “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” but, in practice, it has always been about ownership. Sadly, the dream of ownership is slowly slipping away for many people. Harvard University's 2025 Youth Poll found that three-quarters say they want to own a home, but barely half think they ever will. Private data is a powerful asset, even if most Americans don't realize it. After the 2008 financial crisis, the government mandated that banks allow customers to access their data, but even today, almost two decades later, J.P. Morgan still fights to comply with “open banking.” When corporations hoard private data to create “moats” for user retention, they stifle competition and reduce innovation. Today, AI agents crawl the internet, vacuum up content without attribution, and return nothing to users. As we consume apps like ChatGPT and create prompts with deeply personal information, we have become even more prolific creators of valuable private data. To stop this cycle of big companies gobbling up our data for free will require a technological solution and, fortunately, one is on hand. Blockchain can turn users into economic stakeholders in the very digital services they power, and usher in a new era of wealth, participation, and dynamism. Until recently, blockchains sought to store all your data and execute all your applications —a cumbersome, expensive and slow process. Now, advances in cryptography and design allow builders to offer the privacy and ownership benefits of blockchain but in lighter, easy-to-use packages. These advances can be combined with a feature of blockchain that is sorely missing on the traditional internet: verifiability, or the ability to prove who you are and what you did. Verifiable data allows you to prove facts about yourself – like your repayment history, your health deductible, and even your digital reputation—without handing over everything (and, crucially, you don't need resource-intensive APIs or a company like J.P. Morgan's permission to access this information). Companies like Opacity Network are digital notaries already powering dozens of applications like Earnifi, which reached #1 for finance in Apple's App Store. Verifiable compute is a cryptographic guarantee that proves software executed exactly as it was supposed to, even if it doesn't run on a blockchain. Companies like EigenLayer, for example, allow you to economically punish software developers of unknown origin if they don't complete the assigned task correctly. Imagine sharing private health data with a highly specialized healthcare AI agent that wasn't built by Sam Altman or Elon Musk – now you can. Together, these technologies give the internet a trust layer that shifts power from large centralized organizations back to individuals and makes true ownership in the digital economy possible for the first time. In the past few months, Congress passed the GENIUS Act as a regulatory framework for non-bank actors to create stablecoins, and payments giant Stripe acquired Privy to embed 80 million digital wallets directly into user settings. Meanwhile, security firm Cloudflare blocked AI agents from crawling online publishers for free and, last month, Google partnered with 60 companies, including PayPal and Deloitte, on a protocol that will let AI agents pay for things using stablecoins. The initial benefactor of these initiatives will be professional online publishers, but soon it will be all of us—the very people creating the data. Projects like OpenLedger are already showing how users can get paid for sharing their data. The CLARITY Act, which is working its way through the Senate, could make it easier for agents to share ownership via tokens. A verifiable internet lowers barriers for startups, embeds trust into systems from the start, and gives people new ways to participate in value creation. Blockchain can ensure ownership shapes the next one century by giving people true control over their data – and, in turn, affirming that promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for the digital world.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market is a sea of red as linger trade tensions and tightening liquidity in the U.S. financial system drives demand for safe haven Treasury notes. Bitcoin BTC$106,608.93 has dropped below its 200-day SMA to trade near $104,500, representing a 6% decline in 24 hours. According to Timothy Misir, head of research at BRN, the sell-off represents a tactical liquidity event layered on macro uncertainty. "Positioning should be defensive, reduce leverage, keep cash dry, and use staggered spot buys into $104,000–$108,000 if liquidity allows,"Misir said in a note to CoinDesk. "Structural narratives (ETF adoption, treasuries, network fundamentals) remain intact, but today's environment rewards discipline: defend core BTC, tread carefully in ETH and alts, and wait for confirmation of sustained buy-side flows before rebuilding directional risk," he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Geldspielaufsicht, the Swiss Gambling Supervisory Authority or GESPA, has filed a criminal complaint with prosecutors over FIFA's World Cup-themed NFT platform, alleging potential violations of national gambling laws. Headquartered in Zurich, FIFA — the Fédération Internationale de Football Association — is the global governing body for football (also known as soccer). In a statement on Friday, GESPA said it became aware of the online platform collect.fifa.com (FIFA Collect) in early October, where various competitions such as drops and challenges involving so-called collectibles are offered in the form of non-fungible tokens. Following an investigation, the regulator claimed that FIFA Collect is providing gambling services not licensed in Switzerland and is therefore operating illegally. Participation in competitions on the platform requires a monetary stake, with cash prizes available to be won, it explained, and the outcome for participants depends on random draws or similar chance-based procedures. From a gambling law perspective, GESPA determined that the offerings constitute, in part, lotteries and, in part, sports betting under the Right to Final provision. FIFA did not immediately return a request for comment from The Block. FIFA unveiled the digital collectibles project marking notable soccer moments ahead of the World Cup in 2022, initially launching on Algorand before migrating to Polygon in 2023, with a new collection offering early adopters the chance to win 2026 World Cup tickets. "This makes FIFA collectibles available to any football fan, democratizing the ability to own a part of the FIFA World Cup," FIFA Chief Business Officer Romy Gai said at the time. "Just like sports memorabilia and stickers, this is an accessible opportunity for fans around the world to engage with their favorite players, moments and more on new platforms." Earlier this year, FIFA then announced plans to launch its own EVM-compatible blockchain leveraging the Avalanche tech stack, with its NFTs to migrate to the new network dubbed "FIFA Blockchain."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI, quantum computing, and cryptocurrency are not merely buzzwords; they represent the foundational pillars of a rapidly emerging digital frontier that demands a nimble, informed investment strategy. In a recent CNBC segment, Clark Allen, Head of ETFs at Horizon Investments, spoke with Frank Holland about the firm's new Horizon Digital Frontier ETF, ticker YNOT, which aims to capture the dynamism of this evolving landscape through an actively managed approach. The Horizon Digital Frontier ETF was launched in July 2025, and its early performance has been notable. A core insight from Allen's commentary is the necessity of an actively managed strategy for sectors characterized by extreme volatility and rapid technological shifts. Unlike passive index funds that track predetermined baskets of assets, an active ETF can dynamically adjust its holdings and weightings. This is technology, AI, quantum, as well as crypto.” This holistic view is critical because the boundaries between these technologies are increasingly blurring. AI advancements often rely on quantum computing research, and blockchain technology (the backbone of crypto) is increasingly being explored for secure AI and quantum data management. A static, passively managed fund risks being perpetually behind the curve, unable to react to emerging leaders or sudden market corrections within these fast-moving domains. For founders and VCs, this convergence is already a lived reality. Startups are increasingly leveraging AI for predictive analytics in blockchain, or exploring quantum-safe cryptography. An investment vehicle that recognizes and capitalizes on these interdependencies provides a more comprehensive and potentially more resilient exposure than fragmented, single-sector investments. The landscape of AI, for instance, is not monolithic; it encompasses everything from large language models to specialized robotics. Similarly, quantum computing is still in its early stages, with breakthroughs occurring regularly. Cryptocurrencies, too, are subject to regulatory shifts, market sentiment, and technological upgrades. An actively managed fund can pivot its focus from, say, foundational AI infrastructure to application-layer AI, or from one blockchain protocol to another, as market conditions and innovation cycles dictate. This agility is a direct response to the inherent unpredictability of frontier technologies, offering a sophisticated layer of risk management and opportunity capture that passive strategies cannot. For sophisticated investors such as VCs and tech insiders, who are intimately familiar with the boom-and-bust cycles of emerging tech, a fund that can adapt and potentially smooth out some of this volatility while maintaining exposure to high-growth areas is highly attractive. It allows for participation in the “digital gold rush” without requiring individual expertise across all three complex domains. Instead, it delegates the active management to specialists, which can be a significant advantage in areas where deep technical and market knowledge is essential to identify genuine innovation from speculative hype. This strategy speaks directly to the need for diversification within high-risk, high-reward sectors. Founders seeking to understand broader market sentiment or VCs looking to benchmark their own portfolio performance against a diversified basket of digital frontier assets can find value in observing the YNOT ETF's trajectory. Its very existence signals a maturing investment thesis around the digital ecosystem, moving beyond siloed categories into a more integrated view of technological progress.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is not a nostalgic journey, but a structurally new market shaped by new infrastructure, more refined allocation designs, and clearer regulatory frameworks. Most investors entered blindly, and many watched as the tokens they held plummeted shortly after listing. As regulators stepped in to clean up the mess, ICOs gradually faded out in the following years, replaced by venture capital rounds, SAFTs (Simple Agreements for Future Tokens), exchange IEOs (Initial Exchange Offerings), and later, retroactive airdrops. But the change is not that projects are issuing at lower valuations; in fact, fully diluted valuations (FDV) are higher than ever. Launchpads no longer rely on pure speed competition or Gas wars. Instead, they screen participants through KYC (Know Your Customer), credit scoring, or social influence, and then distribute quotas to thousands of participants in small allocations rather than large ones. For example, on the Buidlpad platform, I committed to invest $5,000 in Falcon Finance, but ultimately received only a $270 allocation, with the remaining funds refunded due to oversubscription. The situation was similar for Sahara AI, where I committed $5,000 but only received a $600 allocation. Oversubscription does not drive down prices; it only reduces individual allocations, maintaining a high FDV while achieving broader token distribution. Today, frameworks like the EU's MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) provide a clear path for compliant retail investors to participate, and issuance platforms have simplified KYC, geo-fencing, and qualification checks into straightforward configuration switches. On the liquidity front, some platforms have gone further by directly encoding post-sale policies into smart contracts, automatically injecting funds into liquidity pools or stabilizing early trading prices through mechanisms that buy below a certain price/sell above a certain price. By 2025, ICOs account for about one-fifth of all token sale trading volume, a stark contrast to just two years ago when this percentage was negligible. This revival of ICOs is not driven by a single platform but stems from a new generation of issuance systems, each addressing different pain points: These platforms work together to transform ICOs from chaotic fundraising tools into carefully designed market structures, with participation methods, pricing, and liquidity all planned rather than cobbled together. They have each tackled the pain points that plagued the first wave of ICOs, collectively building a more structured, transparent, and investment-worthy environment. Unlike centralized launchpads or exchange IEOs, Echo provides infrastructure rather than a trading market, allowing project teams to choose their sale format (fixed price, auction, or treasury/credit model), set KYC/qualified investor certification/geographic restriction rules through Echo Passport, distribute sale links independently, and launch on multiple chains such as Solana, Base, Hyperliquid, and Cardano. In July this year, the project used a time-weighted treasury model to sell 10% of its tokens at a price of $0.05, attracting over $50 million in committed funds. Following closely was LAB, which also achieved a return of 6.22 times upon listing. Here is an overview of Echo's recent sale projects: It is important to note that Echo does not enforce a post-sale liquidity framework; liquidity pool injections, market maker requirements, and unlocking schedules are determined by the issuers, not set uniformly by the platform. Investors should note: Echo's flexibility makes it the highest-returning launch infrastructure in this cycle, but it also requires investors to conduct due diligence. In September this year, Kraken Launch officially went live, with its underlying technology fully supported by Legion. This is the first time token sales can be conducted directly within Kraken accounts, adhering to MiCA compliance requirements and determining participant priority through credit scoring. At the core of Legion is the Legion scoring mechanism—a reputation metric ranging from 0 to 1000, calculated based on on-chain activities, technical contributions (such as GitHub submissions), social interactions, and endorsements from others. Project teams can reserve a certain percentage of token allocations (usually 20%-40%) for high-scoring users, with the remaining allocations opened up for first-come-first-served or lottery phases. This completely overturns the traditional ICO allocation model: it no longer rewards the fastest bots but instead rewards developers, contributors, and influential community members. Here is an overview of Legion's recent sale projects: Early cases like YieldBasis and Bitcoin Hyper saw significant oversubscription during the preferential phase (for high-scoring users), while low-scoring users were directed to limited allocation public sale rounds. Some early users have pointed out that the Legion scoring may overly emphasize social influence—the rankings of large X platform account holders may surpass those of actual developers, and the transparency of the scoring weight system needs improvement. Additionally, be sure to confirm the allocation distribution ratio between each project's preferential and public sale rounds, as different projects may adjust this rule. MetaDAO is doing something that no other launch infrastructure has ever attempted: directly encoding post-sale market policies into the protocol itself. This seemingly simple mechanism fundamentally changes the dynamics of early trading. In traditional ICOs, if liquidity is insufficient or insiders sell off, secondary market prices can plummet; with MetaDAO's price range mechanism, early prices often fluctuate within a limited range—downward movements are smaller, and surges are also capped. If there is no demand in the market, treasury funds will eventually run out, but it can guide market behavior on critical first days. Investors should note: When participating in a MetaDAO sale, be sure to note the ICO price and understand the price range rules. MetaDAO rewards investors who understand the mechanism rather than speculators chasing hype. Established in 2024, the core process is divided into two phases: first, users complete KYC registration and appointment; then, during the funding window, they submit their funding commitments. If the sale is oversubscribed, excess funds will be refunded. Buidlpad's milestone moment occurred in September this year with the sale of Falcon Finance. It does not implement complex scoring systems or predictive treasuries, focusing instead on providing structured participation channels for community members who pass compliance checks. However, it should be noted that liquidity still entirely depends on the issuer's planning, and cross-chain decentralized sales can sometimes lead to fragmented post-sale trading volumes. The KYC/appointment window is a hard threshold; missing it will result in losing allocation eligibility. Additionally, carefully read the tier structure—early stages often allow entry at lower FDV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BitMine Co-Founder Tom Lee said its Ethereum staking solution is coming soon. BitMine Co-Founder and CEO Tom Lee has revealed that the digital asset treasury (DAT) firm will be launching a staking solution “very soon.” Receive up to $100,000 worth of exclusive gifts for newcomers upon registration. Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit A staking solution will allow BitMine to lock up portions of its vast Ethereum holdings to earn yield, effectively turning idle crypto assets into a steady revenue stream. Lee noted BitMine's massive crypto treasury, which now includes 2.83 million ETH, representing 2.5% of all Ethereum. As markets fell over the past week, BitMine acquired another 104,336 ETH worth $417 million, according to on-chain tracking data. Ethereum's founders are currently preparing upgrades that will allow major financial institutions, including Wall Street firms, to build directly on the blockchain, Lee told the podcast. Lee said that after spending time with Ethereum developers and project leaders at Token 2049, he learned they were coordinated on implementing the necessary changes for institutional integration. “I have gotten the clear sense spending time at Token with a lot of the Ethereum founders that they are really listening to make sure they're going to do the upgrades that allow Wall Street to build on Ethereum,” Lee said. Lee's comments suggest that Ethereum's next development phase could focus heavily on institutional-grade infrastructure, requiring the network to emphasize security and scalability. While Lee explained how BitMine's upcoming staking solution could further strengthen its position in Ethereum, he dismissed concerns that the company's large holdings could lead to network centralization. However, he said discussions with researchers from Fundstrat and Standard Chartered indicate that “10% is actually still an acceptable level.” “…because if you think about even in any competitive world, if someone has 10% of a system, they aren't in control of it,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Conditional approval” from the OCC is like getting a backstage pass to the banking world, you're not fully in yet, but you've passed several marquee security checks. According to Banking Dive, Erebor Bank, named after a mountain in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, obtained a de novo bank charter after successfully navigating a lengthy review process with the federal regulator. The approval moves them one step closer to offering full banking services. Feds green light Palmer Luckey's crypto-friendly banking startup Erebor https://t.co/PrkC3K8UJa pic.twitter.com/Rb0Pif6r2y But make no mistake: it's not a full license yet. The “conditional” part means regulators will impose additional requirements before full greenlighting. Erebor doesn't hide its ambition to be a “tech-first” bank. The bank plans to serve companies focused on crypto, AI, defence, and manufacturing, along with payment service providers, investment funds, and trading firms. In other words, it's gunning for the Silicon Valley set, not small-town mortgage seekers. Tolkien must be rolling in his grave, learning the world's most evil and dystopian corporations named their global empires Palantir, Anduril, and Erebor— stolen out of his books. The OCC's approval letter adds that Erebor intends to “target its products and services to technology companies and ultra-high-net-worth individuals that utilize virtual currencies.” That's a polite regulatory way of saying: expect a clientele fluent in code and crypto. The business model leans sharply into digital assets, APIs, and startup-style financial services. If Erebor were merely a tech bank, it would already be interesting. But it has deep political undertones.Palmer Freeman Luckey is best known as the founder of Oculus VR (Wikipedia). Erebor was founded with backing from heavy hitters like Peter Thiel and Palmer Luckey, both of whom are major Republican donors. That places Erebor at a unique intersection of tech, money, and Republican politicking. That raises obvious questions: Will the bank lean right-wing on regulatory posture? Will regulators treat it more stringently because of its political roots? Expect pushback from regulators, opposition politicians, and press eager for a scandal. Regulators have a bigger squeeze when you're playing in crypto. The OCC is under pressure to avoid becoming a “crypto enabler” without controls. Erebor will face scrutiny over capital requirements, asset liquidity, risk to deposit insurance, and how it handles digital assets. Added to that, lots of banks say “tech first” but stumble on basics like security, compliance systems, fraud prevention, and customer service. The OCC granted preliminary conditional approval to Erebor Bank after thorough review of its application. Alongside these challenges, it's tangled in politics, every mistake will be amplified. Finally, conditional approval doesn't mean cash in the vault tomorrow. Erebor still needs to scale capital, staff, compliance, and core banking functions. It wants to marry crypto, politics, and banking in a way that could rewrite the rules around digital finance, or end in spectacular public flame.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple Labs is already a significant XRP holder, with its market report from earlier this year revealing it had 4.5 billion tokens in its stash, with another 37 billion locked in escrow. The fundraiser is being organized through a special purpose acquisition company or SPAC, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing anonymous people with knowledge of the matter. Ripple Labs didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. At the same time, Ripple Labs has another 37 billion tokens locked in an on-ledger escrow, which is released monthly; some of this amount is sold, while the remainder is returned to escrow. On Thursday, Ripple acquired corporate treasury management company GTreasury for $1 billion as part of its business acquisition strategy to expand operations. The deal provides the company with infrastructure to manage digital assets held in corporate treasuries, including stablecoins and tokenized deposits, which can also be used to generate yield for clients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spam has long been a nuisance in blockchain networks, clogging transaction queues and driving up fees. A new research paper from Delft University of Technology introduces a decentralized solution called STARVESPAM that could help nodes in permissionless blockchains block spam without relying on central control or costly fee mechanisms. This openness also makes it easy for attackers to flood the network with low-value or junk transactions. These floods slow down processing, inflate fees, and sometimes even halt block production. One well-known example occurred in 2022 when Solana went offline for seven hours after bots submitted millions of NFT minting transactions per second. The researchers set out to build a system that can distinguish spam from legitimate traffic using behavioral signals rather than transaction fees or centralized filters. STARVESPAM operates at the transaction relay layer, where nodes share transactions with each other before they are added to blocks. When a node sees signs of abuse, it lowers that peer's reputation score. The system does not ban nodes outright but reduces their ability to consume bandwidth or clog memory pools. “Adoption of STARVESPAM faces challenges, especially in environments where profit incentives dominate,” he said. He noted that adoption will likely depend on how operators view the trade-off between short-term gains and long-term reliability. “Widespread adoption may depend on whether enough infrastructure operators see value in curbing spam for the sake of system health, user fairness, or operational cost,” Chotkan said. “People will start caring about this once large-scale spam attacks become more frequent.” During that event, gas fees surged above $180 million and many legitimate transactions failed due to network congestion. The team compared STARVESPAM with several common approaches, including fee-based filters and rule-based systems like BanMan. Other methods either let too much spam through or excluded more legitimate traffic. The researchers also simulated a network of 100 nodes to see how reputation evolved over time. When some nodes switched from spammy to normal behavior, their reputation gradually recovered. This shows that the system can adapt without permanently excluding users who improve their behavior. This suggests that local reputation could sharply reduce the spread of unwanted traffic without hurting normal activity. The researchers see future versions of STARVESPAM adapting to multi-chain and Layer 2 systems. “Cross-chain and Layer 2 environments introduce a new class of challenges for spam mitigation,” he said. “Attackers can exploit bridges, airdrops, and incentive programs to spam across multiple chains using coordinated Sybil identities. This makes local reputation harder to track, especially when activity is fragmented across different layers or domains.” One potential solution involves extending reputation tracking across networks in a privacy-conscious way. “One promising direction is the use of shared identity primitives, such as decentralized identifiers or zero-knowledge credentials, to bind behavioral history across chains,” Chotkan said. “Integrating off-chain signals from indexers, RPC providers, or bridge monitors could also help nodes assess peer reputation even when traffic spans multiple domains.” Traditional blockchain defenses rely on economic deterrence, such as requiring higher fees or deposits. Those methods are easy to implement but often punish legitimate users along with attackers. A reputation system can adapt based on observed conduct instead of fee size.</p>
