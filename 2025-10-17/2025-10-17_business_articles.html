                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An investment envoy for Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday entreated Elon Musk and his tunneling business, the Boring Company, to commit to building an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait to be partly funded by Moscow. Kirill Dmitriev, who is head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, said in posts on Musk's social media platform X that he envisioned "the Putin-Trump Tunnel - a 70-mile link symbolizing unity." A tunnel like this would traditionally cost an estimated $65 billion to build, Dmitriev said, adding that The Boring Company and its technology could potentially reduce those costs to $8 billion and complete the project within eight years. Dmitriev's suggestion followed a call between Putin and President Donald Trump on Thursday, during which plans were made to discuss possible resolutions to the Ukraine War. Trump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other high-level advisors will meet next week with a Russian delegation before Trump and Putin meet in Budapest, Hungary, at a future date. Musk did not respond to a request for comment about the proposal. Construction of an undersea tunnel in the Bering Strait would require Musk's Boring Company to work through below-freezing temperatures in a region without existing infrastructure and with deep and frequent earthquakes. The Boring Company has no track record of working through such conditions. Its previous tunneling efforts were completed in hot, dry locations with plenty of infrastructure and services nearby. The Boring Company was recently fined and cited by environmental regulators in the state of Nevada for an "extraordinary number of violations," ProPublica reported, citing public records. Those violations included: digging without approval, releasing untreated water onto city streets and spilling waste from trucks. The Boring Company is now working on a 10-mile tunnel project from downtown Nashville, Tennessee, to its airport, dubbed the Music City Loop. Musk's automaker, Tesla, has supply chain ties to Russia, and the CEO has spoken with Putin about other matters in the past few years. The EV maker has purchased millions of euros worth of aluminum from Rusal, a company founded by sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, CNBC previously reported. In one instance, Putin had pressured Musk to direct SpaceX to withold Starlink, its satellite internet communications service, from Taiwan as a favor to Chinese President Xi Jinping, the Journal reported, citing two people briefed on the request. The conversations between Musk and Putin, who once ran the KGB, reportedly occurred as Musk was in the midst of a leveraged buyout and takeover of Twitter, now known as X. Working with NASA, Musk's aerospace and defense contractor, SpaceX, has also launched Russian cosmonauts to the International Space Station.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The traditional 60/40 portfolio has been under attack for years, and the recent hot trades in precious metals and cryptocurrencies are leading it to lose a little more of its prominence. Multiple strategists and investors are pivoting toward a 60/20/20 market portfolio: with the 60% in stocks unchanged, but fixed income losing half of its former hold over investor money, and 20% carved out for alternatives like gold and bitcoin. Stocks and bonds are moving in the same direction too often, they say, while inflation, geopolitical risk, and government spending and high debt loads mean bonds no longer offer the protection they once did. "We are seeing greater adoption of non-equity, non fixed-income products," Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, told CNBC. In this new approach to structuring market exposure, gold is not a hedge on the margins of a portfolio, but one of its core holdings. "What's really happening now is a shift into the acceptance of gold," Steve Schoffstall, director of ETF product management at precious metals and critical materials investing company Sprott, said on CNBC's "ETF Edge" earlier this week. Typically, he said, it's been viewed as a "fringe" allocation tool, "but what we're really staring to see now is more prominent economists suggest shifting from 60-40 to something closer to 60-20-20," he added. But Schoffstall also said that for "most people, we feel they are probably well positioned if they have a 5%-15% allocation to physical gold." Gold ETFs posted their largest monthly inflows ever in September, according to the World Gold Council, with close to $11 billion in the month. SPDR Gold Shares took in over $4 billion alone last month, and mid-October, has amassed another $1.3 billion from investors, according to ETFAction.com. Sprott says the total assets moved by investors into gold funds this year has surpassed $38 billion. Some investors are allocating to cryptocurrency, specifically bitcoin, with a similar 20% approach. Some financial advisors have gone beyond even that level, saying up to 40% in cryptocurrency is defensible as an investing approach. Bitcoin reached a record high of $126,000 on Oct. 6 and has seen a flood of new money this month, with iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) taking in close to $1 billion in a single day, and over $4 billion at the mid-month October mark. Rosenbluth said the alternatives bucket is no longer a single bet, but a mix of commodities, crypto, and private credit that are all packaged in ETFs, but investors do need to understand the bets have significant differences. Silver has also gained more attention among investors, and unlike gold, silver is a play on multiple global economic trends, including industrial demand, electrification, and automation. While this has been a period of time when these alternatives increased overall portfolio returns, there's no guarantee that will always be the case. The primary reason to restructure a portfolio with hedges, Rosenbluth said, is to add levers that operate differently during periods of ups and downs in the stock and bond markets, and that can help to smooth out returns over time. This week was a good example of how these assets, considered popular hedges, can have very different market dynamics. After hitting its record above $126,000 earlier this month, bitcoin has sold off sharply, with a weekly loss of over 8%, as of Friday morning, while gold and silver have continued to move up and remain on pace for weekly gains. Private credit, meanwhile, which has ballooned in recent years but also sparked fears it might be brewing a bubble, became a major concern of the market over the past week since the surprise bankruptcy of auto parts company First Brands.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security advisor, pleaded not guilty Friday to charges of mishandling classified information, multiple news outlets reported. Bolton, 76, made his initial appearance in federal court in Maryland one day after being indicted by a grand jury, becoming the latest Trump foe to face criminal charges. Former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James have also been indicted on criminal charges within the last month. Bolton is charged with 18 counts of possession and retention of materials related to national defense. He faces up to 10 years in prison on each count if convicted, though federal sentencing guidelines would likely recommend a much less severe punishment. The 26-page indictment alleges Bolton shared classified information with two relatives while he was Trump's national security advisor from April 2018 through September 2019. Bolton's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said that the former national security advisor did not share or store any information unlawfully. "The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago," Lowell said in a statement Thursday. Bolton in his own statement said he was being targeted because of his opposition to Trump. The charges, he said, are about Trump's "intensive effort to intimidate his opponents, to ensure that he alone determines what is said about his conduct."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of Europe's major private markets firms sold off on Friday as concerns over lending standards in U.S. markets swept across the Atlantic. London-listed ICG closed 5.5% lower, while CVC Capital Partners, which is headquartered in Jersey, lost about 6.6%. Swiss private markets firm Partners Group fell 3.4%, as Sweden's EQT was down 4.6%. The moves follow a widespread sell-off among U.S. regional banks this week, as fears grow over risky lending practices potentially spilling over from the private credit market into the broader banking space. ICG manages more than $30 billion in private debt assets, about 25% of its total asstes under management as of late June. Credit quality has come into sharper focus in recent weeks following U.S. car parts maker First Brands' implosion and the subprime auto lender Tricolor's bankruptcy. Investment bank Jefferies, which had exposure to First Brands, closed down 11% on Thursday before rebounding Friday. While First Brands' collapse stemmed mainly from its complex borrowing arrangements within the supply-chain financing and invoice receivables space, the debacle has spotlighted broader concerns over increased leverage and potentially lax credit standards. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said more potential stress could lay hidden within the credit system. "When you see one cockroach, there's probably more," said Dimon during J.P. Morgan's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Joachim Nagel, president of Germany's Bundesbank and ECB governing council member, warned this week of "spillovers" from the private credit market, calling it a "regulatory risk." "I'm concerned when it comes to private credit, private lending," Nagel told CNBC's Karen Tso at the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington on Wednesday. "This market is really big now — as far as I know it's more than $1 trillion, and we know there are some spillovers from the less-regulated market participants to the more regulated market participants. Meanwhile, Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said the group is now keeping closer tabs on non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly in the private credit space. "This leverage is probably resilient, but of course, we are watching underwriting standards very closely," Adrian told CNBC's Tso.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Together with blame for the shutdown aimed at the president and congressional Republicans, those views dragged down President Donald Trump's net approval rating on the economy to 42% approving and 55% disapproving. The results continued a second-term trend with his economic approval running below his overall approval rating. In his first term, the president's economic numbers were routinely positive and well above his overall polling. The survey of 1,000 people nationwide, with a margin of error of +/- 3.1%, found 53% of respondents blaming the potential economic fallout from the shutdown on Republicans in Congress and the president, compared with 37% for Democrats. But the survey also shows increasingly negative attitudes about the president's handling of critical economic issues. Those are the worst numbers of the three CNBC surveys during the president's second term, an important finding for a president who promised to reduce prices. And 56% disapprove of his tariff policies, with 41% approving, a net approval of -15 compared with -6 in the second-quarter survey. "It is clear that the cost of living in Americans' own personal lives is much more likely to be weighing them down about their economic confidence than the shutdown," said Micah Roberts, partner at Public Opinion Strategies, the Republican pollster for the survey. The survey, in which 40% of respondents were Republican and 38% Democrat, shows Trump maintains overwhelming support from his party and faces equal opposition by Democrats. "Most of the movement that's happening now is among independents, and that's important because we know … that independents are highly economically sensitive," said Jay Campbell, partner at Hart Research, the Democratic pollster for the survey. "They're less sensitive on partisan issues and they're much more sensitive on financial and economic measures." The only positive issue among those surveyed is Trump's handling of the southern border, which is +5. His handling of deportations moved from a 49-49 split to 46%-50% net disapproval. The president did have a slight improvement in views of his handling of foreign policy. Views on the economy grew more negative, with 27% saying the economy is good or excellent and 72% describing it as just fair or poor, reversing an improvement in the second quarter after the president dialed back his most extreme tariff threats. More than a quarter of Americans are concerned that they could lose their job in the next year, the highest level since CNBC first asked the question in 2022. But in a sign of confidence, 58% feel secure enough that they can find a new job with similar pay and benefits if they lose their current position. Younger Americans, people of color and women are among the groups least confident in their job prospects. But college grads and salaried employees are also expressing elevated uncertainty relative to the average. Less than a third of working Americans believe their salaries will rise in the next year, the lowest since the pandemic while three-quarters see prices rising. Half of the public say prices are continuing to go up "faster than usual." A 56% majority, including large numbers of Democrats and independents and 45% of Republicans, says it's inappropriate for the government to be taking stakes in private companies. A plurality of 43%, however, say Trump's policies when it comes to business are "about right," with 39% saying he's too biased in favor of business and 12% saying he's too biased against business.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI halted artificial intelligence-generated videos of Martin Luther King Jr. after users utilized its short-form video tool Sora to create "disrespectful depictions" of the civil rights leader. "While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used," OpenAI said in a post to social media platform X. The ChatGPT maker said it will work to toughen "guardrails" for historical figures and that public figures or representatives can ask to not appear in Sora videos. OpenAI did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Other public figures have also called out the use of AI deepfakes. Last week, Zelda Williams, the daughter of late comedian Robin Williams, asked that people stop sending her AI videos of her father. Last year, actress Scarlett Johansson said the company used a voice that sounded "eerily similar" to her performance in the movie "Her" on ChatGPT. OpenAI launched Sora at the end of September. The tool allows users to create AI-generated short videos using a text prompt. In less than five days, Sora head Bill Peebles said the tool had amassed over 1 million downloads, hitting the milestone faster than ChatGPT. Its ascent and the rise of AI-generated videos have also raised questions and concerns over the spread of misinformation, copyright infringement and the proliferation of AI slop, quickly produced videos that flood social feeds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there's little evidence of a systemic problem, according to a senior analyst at Moody's Ratings. Marc Pinto, the agency's head of global private credit, acknowledged in a interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that there are concerns over loose lending standards and some slack in the conditions that institutions attach to loans. However, he said when looking at the system as a whole, contagion the likes that could trigger a broader financial crisis is not evident. "When we dig deeper here and look to see if there's a turn in the credit cycle, which is effectively what the market seems to be focusing on, we can find no evidence," Pinto said. Bank stocks sold off aggressively across the board Thursday after Zions and Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holding bad loans related to the bankruptcies of two auto lenders. The worries have dragged down shares of investment bank Jefferies this month since it disclosed some exposure to bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands. Losses swept across the sector Thursday as worries grew that the danger could be more widespread. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon raised some eyebrows earlier this week when he said on the bank's earnings conference call that "when you see one cockroach, there are probably more." "One cockroach does not a trend make," Pinto said. In fact, Pinto said default rates on high-yield debt this year have been relatively low, holding under 5%, and are expected to drift down to below 3% in 2026. At the same time, the U.S. economy has proven stronger than thought, Pinto added, despite persistent worries about labor market weakness and the impact that President Donald Trump's tariffs might have on inflation and consumer demand. Pinto said he is at a conference this week with about 2,000 bankers "and one of the words that I keep hearing is resilience." "With respect to GDP growth, we're doing much better than many people thought just six months ago," he said. "So again, the credit conditions, looking at GDP growth as well as an expected decline in interest rates, we feel the credit quality is in a pretty good place today and potentially may improve." Market sentiment appeared to improve Friday after a sell-off Thursday. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking exchange-traded fund, which tracks the mid-market leaders, tumbled 6.2% Thursday but rose 2% in premarket trading Friday.

Stocks dropped yesterday amid mounting fears on Wall Street about the prevalence of bad loans, and what it means for a slew of regional banks. That's led to some "cockroach" hunting, as investors race to assess the health of financial institutions' lending businesses. John Bolton, a former national security advisor to President Donald Trump, was indicted yesterday by a federal grand jury on charges of mishandling classified information. Bolton is the third Trump adversary to face criminal charges in recent weeks, following the indictments of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNBC yesterday that bookings could start slowing if the government doesn't reopen soon. You're likely already feeling the economic impact of Trump's tariff policy, according to S&P Global. Even under conservative estimates, S&P said two-thirds of that cost is expected to be passed down to consumers. As CNBC's Jeff Cox notes, revenue from Trump's tariffs helped mitigate some government spending. Still, the federal government's shortfall sits at $1.78 trillion. Apple will soon announce a deal valued at $140 million annually for F1's U.S. media rights, sources told CNBC's Alex Sherman. The partnership will help the technology giant build out its sports streaming portfolio, which already includes Major League Soccer and MLB content. In an interview this week, Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, said Apple has "love" for F1. Cue also said the modern sports watching experience has "gone backwards" as so many different streaming services get in the game. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. The parent company of sunglasses maker Ray-Ban has a specific company to thank for its recent performance: Meta. EssilorLuxottica said a sizable amount of its revenue growth in the third quarter was tied to its partnership with the big tech company to develop and sell smart glasses. Speaking of Meta, Oracle's shares were able to buck yesterday's market downturn after the company confirmed a cloud deal with the Facebook parent.

This year, alone, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google are projected to spend about $320 billion in capex, mostly for AI infrastructure, according to an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider. Because AI learns by processing increasingly large amounts of data, improving it requires more computational power, which in turn necessitates more data centers. The largest data centers can require as much electricity as a small city and up to several million gallons of water a day. That's why they often appear in residential areas where these resources are readily available. While these data centers promise to bring new tax revenue to Virginia residents, BI's Dakin Campbell reports that some worry about how the centers will affect housing costs, the environment, and their quality of life. Carlos Yanes lives within 1,200 feet (370 meters) of several Amazon data centers and said he spent almost $20,000 to replace his windows in an attempt to muffle the sound and vibrations from the facilities. Amazon responded to local complaints by replacing its exhaust fans with taller versions, which did muffle the sound. However, Carlos and his neighbors can still feel the vibrations through their walls, BI's Robert Leslie reports. In 2021, construction on Google's data centers began near Donna Gallant's home. Another plot of land near Gallant's neighborhood, intended for housing, was rezoned in 2023 to accommodate more data centers. These data centers in Stanton Springs, Georgia, belong to Meta, the parent company of Facebook. This is due to a variety of factors, including power-hungry data centers, BI's Ellen Thomas reports. Arizona state lawmakers have extended tax incentives to companies through 2033, BI's Campbell reports, encouraging more construction. Microsoft consumed nearly 2.1 billion gallons of water in 2023, a 22% increase from 2022, according to its sustainability report. Meta, with more than a quarter of its built or permitted data centers in high water-stressed areas per BI's tally, said it will return more water to the environment than it consumes by 2030. Google pledges to replenish 120% of the water it consumes by 2030.</p>

During the first debate of the campaign on Thursday evening, candidates were asked how they would convince tech leaders who are concerned about increased corporate taxes to build their companies in NYC, instead of a city like Dallas. It's an especially relevant question for Mamdani, the democratic socialist candidate. His platform includes raising taxes on the city's most profitable corporations and wealthiest residents to fund public services like transportation and childcare. Mamdani didn't address his tax hike proposals in his answer, but instead leaned on his affordability agenda and said CEOs will come if prospective employees can afford to live in the city. "We are going to make this city more affordable, so the workers who want to work at those companies can actually be able to do so," the candidate said. "And we're going to ensure that this city continues to be one where we see businesses opening and also stay open." Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary held in June, was instead asked how he would persuade CEOs not to move their businesses out of New York due to the high cost of living. "I understand that the far left has been raising taxes and making businesses feel like the enemy. Cuomo was New York's governor from 2011 to 2021. "New York City is the global headquarters of the finance industry," Melissa Russo, a New York-based journalist and one of the moderators of Thursday's debate, said. Mamdani said he wants to generate wealth for all New York residents and that the current system has pushed the city toward its current poverty rate. The candidate said small business owners and the workers are being "pushed out by corporate greed, by private equity, and by the politics that refused to fight for them." Behind closed doors, Mamdani has engaged with some of the city's tech elites. Some attendees said they were struck by Mamdani's pragmatism. "He's engaging even though he knows that many people in the room don't agree with a number of his positions," venture capitalist Kevin Ryan, who moderated the fireside chat, told Business Insider. "I will give him credit for reaching out."</p>

"I would be the mayor of this entire city," Mamdani said. Mamdani said he would be fighting for his neighbors in Queens who own small businesses, like toy stores and dry cleaners, and those who work for them. Mamdani shocked New York City this summer when he led the Democratic primary over establishment candidate former Gov. Mamdani said the tax hikes — an idea that Gov. Despite his loss in the primary, Cuomo is still in the race as an independent, and with current Mayor Eric Adams dropping out, Cuomo is consolidating support from New York's elite, including business leaders. Not everyone on Wall Street is rooting against a Mamdani win in November's general election, and some rank-and-file members are donating to the upstart candidate. Mamdani has also engaged with some of the city's tech elites, positioning his progressive agenda through a pragmatic lens. Some business leaders' views of the assemblyman's proposals range from sharply critical to skeptical. Billionaire Mark Cuban, who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign, previously said Mamdani's campaign promise to freeze rent and develop city-owned grocery stores won't work. Doesn't matter," Cuban said in a talk with "Pod Save America." Thursday night was the first of two planned debates.</p>

Andrew Martin lit up his bedroom-turned-content creation studio with warm lights ahead of a Prime Day stream. He got up from his desk, settled down comfortably on a sofa behind him, surrounded by cat perches and cozy ambient lights. Martin said people tune into his streams to get good deals on electronics and to talk with him casually about life over the platform's live chat function. A typical stream involves a host touting products, offering their opinions, answering viewers' questions in real time, and also releasing special deals and discounts. Livestreaming in China is light-years ahead of the West. Ron Wardle, the former CEO of China-based e-commerce company ExportNow, said livestream commerce took off in China in 2018, after Alibaba's founder, Jack Ma, challenged beauty influencer Austin Li to sell more lipsticks than him on Alibaba's e-commerce platform, Taobao Live. Li earned the title of China's "Lipstick King" after he sold 15,000 lipsticks in five minutes, beating Ma's sales. His daily streams on Taobao feel like sensory overloads, with an endless array of banners and colorful pop-ups. In one of his most famous streams, he tested 380 lipsticks over a seven-hour stream. Live shows like Li's are "part shopping, part variety show," said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of Beijing-based e-commerce consulting firm WPIC Marketing + Technologies. "Live shows blend entertainment, discovery, and transaction in real time," Cooke told Business Insider. "The format creates a shared social moment — millions watching, commenting, asking questions — that static listings can't replicate." When Business Insider checked Taobao at 10:30 a.m. in China, there was a steady stream of live shows taking place on the app. Livestreams also help people decide what to buy, Cooke said, as the livestream hosts filter choices and translate complex specifications. This mode of selling is particularly effective for goods where "demonstration, trust, or impulse play a big role," he said, such as beauty products, cosmetics, skincare, trendy clothing, and small electronics. TikTok said in December that during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend in 2024, TikTok Shop — which relies heavily on livestreaming — saw a 165% increase in shoppers compared to the year before. Livestream shopping app Whatnot, which focuses on collectibles, announced in January that it had raised $265 million in its Series E funding round, bringing its valuation to $4.97 billion. And a September 2024 survey by digital commerce company VTEX found that 45% of 1,000 US adults surveyed had browsed or bought products from live shopping events on sites like Poshmark or Amazon in the year leading up to the study. Short-form video platforms have created a space for interactive and shoppable content, and brands are taking advantage of this. "American consumers — especially younger cohorts — want entertainment, discovery, and social proof in their shopping, which should allow livestreaming to grow," Cooke said. Collectibles of all sorts — board games, Pokémon trading cards, blind box toys like Labubu — are flying off the shelves, sought after by a consumer group called "kidults." And livestreaming is the collectible sellers' mechanism of choice. They often film product unboxings and prove the authenticity of the collectibles in real time in front of a camera. Business Insider tuned into a Utah-based livestream of Pokémon trading cards on eBay Live. The stream, which had about 50 viewers, showed a seller running through a deck of more than 50 cards, briefly describing each one over energetic, high-BPM music. Jamie Iannone, eBay's CEO, said in a September episode of "Opening Bid" that eBay is confident about the future of livestreaming because collectibles are a $10 billion business for the company annually. "eBay Live is still a nascent product, but one we think has a lot of potential," Iannone said on the podcast. For livestreamers, the career path offers flexible working hours, remote work, and a chance to make money from their interests. It was easy to get started — he already had ring lights and cameras. The platform allowed him to keep sharing makeup tips and swatch products for viewers. He said he loves interacting with people, some of whom ask him personal questions unrelated to products and deals. During one of his Amazon Live livestreams in October, Wessels answered questions from viewers about Amazon Prime Day deals, as well as some friendly regulars who asked him about his coming wedding. Martin, the electronics livestreamer from the UK, said his streams are "quite relaxed," and he usually gets asked about his filming equipment. For both Martin and Wessels, the commissions they receive from their livestreams are not enough to make ends meet. "So I went from sometimes hitting a hundred thousand viewers, to now, numbers that are much lower." Martin said that while he occasionally generates livestream sales, he focuses more on creating content for platforms like YouTube, where viewers can watch it at their own pace. "It hardly pays me anything at the moment, but as long as I can pay my bills and feed my cats, that's enough for me," Martin said of his livestreaming sales.</p>
