A blood test measuring levels of tau protein is almost 98% accurate in ruling out Alzheimer's disease in individuals with cognitive impairments.Credit: Thomas Deerinck, NCMIR/Science Photo Library A new blood test to aid with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The test, which is designed to rule out cognitive decline caused by Alzheimer's disease, is the first blood test cleared for use in primary-care settings but not a first for Alzheimer's. In a press release on 13 October, Roche reported that in a clinical trial of 312 participants, the Elecsys pTau181 test was correctly able to rule out Alzheimer's 97.9% of the time. The test uses a negative predictive value and helps to rule out Alzheimer's in individuals with cognitive decline, rather than giving a positive indication that someone has the disease. Faster, cheaper, better: the rise of blood tests for Alzheimer's Faster, cheaper, better: the rise of blood tests for Alzheimer's They agree really well with the gold standard biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, which we have been using in specialized settings for many years”, says Ashvini Keshavan, a neurologist and biomarker researcher at University College London. This test measures the ratio of two proteins: pTau217 and amyloid-β (1–42). But as accurate as they're said to be, the blood tests are prone to uncertain results when linking cognitive symptoms with Alzheimer's. More than 30% of all samples that were analysed with a pTau217 test developed by Quanterix, a life-sciences company in Billerica, Massachusetts, fell into this grey zone2. A similar number has not been reported for the Elecsys or Lumipulse tests.

After Earth in its original form emerged from clouds of gas and dust around 4.56 billion years ago, it didn't have much time to breathe—not even 100 million years later, an asteroid the size of Mars slammed into it and supposedly formed the Moon. Most of the original prototype was lost, but fragments of this “proto-Earth” that surfaced from ancient rocks are revealing what our planet was like before it took its final form. There has been no direct evidence of a proto-Earth until now. Anything left was either buried far beyond reach or covered by oceans, forests, grasses and other features of the landscape. After examining some of the most ancient rocks on Earth, a team of MIT researchers led by planetary scientist Nicole Nie have discovered an imbalance in potassium isotopes, which indicates those rocks are most likely remnants of that primordial surface. Potassium is one surface element, or lithophile, that is abundant right beneath our feet, and its isotopes (equal in protons but not neutrons) preserve the history of everything Earth accreted through ancient impacts. Most rocks on Earth contain far more potassium-39 and potassium-41 than potassium-40. Strangely, it was not an exact match for any of the primordial rock samples, which probably means that the evidence of the meteorites which transferred material to nascent Earth has either been completely destroyed or have not yet been found. “Earth's bulk composition has elemental and isotopic characteristics that cannot be fully reconciled with a mixture of known primitive meteorite compositions,” Nie said in a study recently published in Nature Geosciences. “One potential explanation for this is that the proto-Earth accreted materials with isotopic signatures distinct from those accreted after the Moon-forming giant impact.” Though potassium is volatile, meaning it evaporates easily, some apparently still remains trapped in rocks that are the remnants of our planet's earliest days. Nie and her team think the massive chemical overhaul Earth went through after that crushing impact somehow caused a slight increase in potassium-40 that could have been easy to miss. By simulating the effects of that impact, subsequent asteroid and meteorite impacts, and geological processes that may have also brought about chemical changes, they came up with a slightly higher potassium-40 content for Earth than is present in rocks from the prototype era.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that harnesses the body's own immune defenses to attack tumors. That gap is troubling because liver cancer cases have nearly tripled over the past four decades. Using both mouse models and human tumor samples, they discovered that certain bile acids -- molecules produced by the liver to aid digestion -- can interfere with cancer-fighting immune cells known as T cells. The team pinpointed several bile acids linked to weakened T cell function and faster tumor growth. By blocking the production of these acids, they were able to slow or stop tumor progression. When researchers increased UDCA levels through dietary supplements, liver tumors in mice shrank. The study, published in Science, sheds light on why immune cells behave differently depending on the tumor's location and identifies new molecular targets to strengthen liver cancer therapies. "Livers have a particularly unique environment, but we didn't really understand how it was affecting the immune and cancer cells. By investigating these liver-specific features, we have identified several potential ways to regulate bile acids, improve T cell performance, and enhance patient outcomes." To combat liver cancer, T cells must function effectively within this chemically rich environment. "Considering how T cell performance varies across different organs, tissues, and tumors puts us at a great vantage point for looking at ways to optimize cancer treatment," says Siva Karthik Varanasi, former postdoctoral researcher in Kaech's lab and current assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School. "By taking this unique approach, we're able to see that bile acids in the liver are hugely influencing T cells' ability to do their job and therefore may be a useful therapeutic target." They found elevated levels of conjugated bile acids and tested whether these compounds contributed to tumor growth. When they removed a protein called BAAT, which produces conjugated bile acids, the tumor load in mice dropped significantly. This suggests that adjusting BAAT activity in humans could improve their response to immunotherapy. The researchers then examined 20 distinct bile acids to determine how each affected T cells. Most primary bile acids showed little influence, except for one called TCDCA, which triggered oxidative stress -- a harmful molecular imbalance. One, called LCA, damaged T cell function by causing endoplasmic reticulum stress, while another, UDCA, boosted T cell performance and drew more immune cells to the liver. "We're already a huge step ahead when it comes to translating our findings to the clinic, because UDCA supplementation is already used to treat liver disease and could easily be tested in liver cancer next," says Kaech, who also holds the NOMIS Chair at Salk. "We are really excited to also explore the role of the gut microbiome in all of this, since bile acids are a huge part of that picture -- how can we manipulate 'good' and 'bad' bacteria in the microbiome to further regulate bile acid levels? In addition to exploring dietary and microbiome manipulations that could help with liver cancer, the team is curious to see if other conditions could be treated by targeting BAAT. Already, they believe chronic liver disease and obesity may benefit from the same reduction of conjugated bile acids.

Success rates for Europe's leading research grants are declining — some to single percentage points — as a surge in applications far outweighs the funds available. Data gathered by Nature show that researchers, especially those at the start of their academic journeys, are facing increasingly fierce competition to pursue research careers (see ‘Funding competition'). Applications for the 2025 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Postdoctoral Fellowships exceeded 17,000 — an increase of nearly 65% compared with 2024. For its Starting Grants — open to early-career researchers with two to seven years of experience after completing a PhD — the ERC has received 13% more proposals so far compared with 2024. Yet only an estimated 276 projects (8%) will be funded, down from 11% last year. “We're extremely pleased that there is such a high demand for ERC grants. “The flip side is we don't have more money. The result is that many researchers are fighting to stay in an increasingly competitive academic system. It's down to luck,” says Christina Carlisi, a cognitive neuroscientist at University College London, who has been applying for grants this year and feeling the strain. And I think that's sometimes difficult to grapple with in terms of keeping the motivation going.” National funding bodies across Europe are experiencing similar increases in applications. Another major funder in Germany, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, has received at least 20% more postdoctoral applications so far this year than in the same period last year. Grant applications received by the United Kingdom's central research funder, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), have almost doubled since 2017–18, according to a report published this year. Data shared with Nature by the UKRI's Medical Research Council show that two of its grant schemes recorded the highest number of applications since 2020 this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stretching from western Anatolia to southeastern Europe, this previously unknown land bridge provides a whole new migration route for Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens. The history-shaping power of land bridges cannot be overstated. Even land bridges that still exist today—the Panama Isthmus is only four million years old—have forever altered the course of history. Now, scientists from three universities based in Turkey have found a previously unknown land bridge that connected western Anatolia to southeastern Europe, serving as a crucial migration route for two hominins: Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens. The research team discovered this hidden land bridge by uncovering 138 stone tools across 10 sites off the coast of Ayvalık, Turkey, just east of Lesbos, Greece. “Our archaeological discovery has unveiled that this now-idyllic region once potentially offered a vital land bridge for human movement during the Pleistocene era—when sea levels dropped and the now-submerged landscape was briefly exposed,” Göknur Karahan, a co-author of the study from Hacettepe University, said in a press statement. “These findings mark Ayvalık as a potential new frontier in the story of human evolution, placing it firmly on the map of human prehistory.” The last Ice Age, which spanned the entire Pleistocene epoch (from 115,000 to 11,700 years ago) brought with it lower sea levels, as a vast amount of water was locked up within glaciers and ice sheets. “In all these periods, the present-day islands and peninsulas of Ayvalık would have formed interior zones within an expansive terrestrial environment,” Kadriye Özçelik, another co-author of the study from Ankara University, said in a press statement. Despite these challenges, the authors found what they call “Levallois technologies,” which are often seen in stone tools from various Pleistocene periods. These tools have previously been associated with both early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. “The presence of these objects in Ayvalık is particularly significant, as they provide direct evidence that the region was part of wider technological traditions shared across Africa, Asia, and Europe.” NASA Found a Secret U.S. Army Base Buried in Ice Scientists Found a Weird Way to Treat Hair Loss</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yet, sodium-based solid-state batteries have long struggled to match lithium's performance at typical temperatures. When we think about tomorrow's energy storage solutions, we should imagine the same gigafactory can produce products based on both lithium and sodium chemistries," said Y. Shirley Meng, Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering at the UChicago Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering (UChicago PME). "This new research gets us closer to that ultimate goal while advancing basic science along the way." The researchers developed a sodium-based solid-state battery that performs reliably from room temperature to below freezing, setting a new benchmark for the field. According to first author Sam Oh of the A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering in Singapore, who conducted the work while visiting Meng's Laboratory for Energy Storage and Conversion, the results bring sodium technology much closer to competing with lithium on electrochemical performance. The achievement also represents a fundamental advance in materials science. "This metastable structure of sodium hydridoborate has a very high ionic conductivity, at least one order of magnitude higher than the one reported in the literature, and three to four orders of magnitude higher than the precursor itself." The method is well known in other areas of materials science but had not previously been used for solid electrolytes, Oh said. "Since this technique is established, we are better able to scale up in future," Oh said. "If you are proposing something new or if there's a need to change or establish processes, then industry will be more reluctant to accept it." The current research advances sodium as a viable alternative for batteries, a vital step to combat the rarity and environmental damage of lithium. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
