This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. A federal district court in Montana Wednesday granted the Trump administration's request to toss out a youth-led lawsuit challenging the administration's efforts to increase the extraction and use of fossil fuels and other actions that suppress climate science and undermine renewable energy. While the court found it plausible that these actions would cause grave harm to the health and wellbeing of children, it determined that it is powerless to stop them, as that would tread into the realm of policymaking reserved for Congress. It was the first time in U.S. history that a federal court heard live testimony in a youth climate lawsuit. The case, filed on May 29 by 22 young Americans, aged 7 to 25, against President Donald Trump as well as some members of his cabinet and the agencies they lead, specifically challenged three executive orders that the president issued to boost fossil fuels. Under these orders, the Trump administration has taken a slew of actions such as opening up more federal lands to oil and gas drilling and coal mining, fast-tracking fossil fuel permitting decisions, investing hundreds of millions of dollars into coal-fired power plants, halting or cancelling solar and wind projects in development and moving to rescind the EPA's endangerment finding for greenhouse gases. Implementing the orders will result in an estimated 205 million metric tons of additional annual climate pollution by 2027 and 510 million metric tons of additional annual emissions by 2035, Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University who was one of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses, told the court. It also claimed that Trump was acting beyond his lawful authority in issuing executive orders that contravene other federal laws like the Clean Air Act. Although the court acknowledged the serious harms that the orders are expected to inflict — even recognizing fossil fuel exposure and climate change as a “children's health emergency” — it “reluctantly” decided that it cannot do anything about them. “While this Court is certainly troubled by the very real harms presented by climate change and the Challenged EOs' effect on carbon dioxide emissions, this concern does not automatically confer upon it the power to act,” U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen wrote in the 31-page ruling. Overturning the executive orders and supervising an “untold number of federal agency actions” to monitor compliance, according to Christensen, would be impractical and unprecedented. It effectively would amount to “hundreds of lawsuits being brought in a single case,” he wrote, adding that he is “unaware of any authority that supports such a sweeping ruling.” The U.S. Department of Justice applauded the ruling, saying in an emailed statement that it “throws out a sweeping and baseless attack on President Trump's energy agenda.” That case initially requested a declaration that the government's conduct, by contributing to dangerous climate change that threatened the plaintiff's life, liberty and property and violating the public trust doctrine, was unconstitutional. It also asked the court to order the federal government to develop and implement a science-based climate recovery plan. In January 2020, a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled in a split 2-1 decision that granting such relief exceeded the authority of courts because it dealt with complex policy matters that must be addressed by the executive and legislative branches of government. The Supreme Court declined plaintiffs' request to review that ruling in March, bringing Juliana v. United States to an end after nearly a decade of procedural wrangling but without the case ever getting to trial. Several of the Juliana plaintiffs are also plaintiffs in the Lighthiser case against Trump, which they say is distinctly different. Christensen's ruling, however, asserts that the two cases “nonetheless share several important characteristics,” including the request for courts to effectively oversee numerous government policies and actions in order to ensure constitutional compliance. Christensen also wrote that he was “troubled” by youth plaintiffs' request to revert back to the “regulatory status quo” as it stood before Trump took office in January. Julia Olson, chief legal counsel at Our Children's Trust and lead attorney for the youth plaintiffs, said the court got that wrong. “We're not trying to freeze the Biden policies and leave them as they were,” she told Inside Climate News. During the September hearing, Department of Justice lawyer Michael Sawyer told the court that the case was “undemocratic” because voters had elected Trump, who campaigned on a promise to “drill, baby, drill” and unleash fossil fuels. Olson, however, said the case was not about disputing or dictating national energy policy, but rather about protecting the fundamental constitutional rights of children. “It's not like [Trump would be] stuck with Biden's policies. Olson noted that some of the younger plaintiffs are not even allowed to vote, and thus have no other recourse than the courts. On a Wednesday Zoom call with the plaintiffs discussing the ruling, Olson said there were “lots of emotions” and tears. “I think the most prevalent sentiment was, how can a judge see us and see the harm we're experiencing and see that these executive orders are going to worsen our physical injuries, and then say that there's nothing he can do about it?” “It sends a message to the president and the executive to just go big, go big with your violations because if it's big enough, then we're going to throw up our hands,” she said. Our Children's Trust says it plans to pursue an expedited appeal of the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! The number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the occupied West Bank amid the Gaza genocide has surpassed 1,000, according to the UN, after soldiers killed a young Palestinian child while he was reportedly playing soccer on Thursday. One in every five victims is a child, the office said, with 213 children killed. This includes the killing of young Mohammad Bahjat Al-Hallaq, who the UN says was just 9 years old, on Thursday. Reports say that Mohammad was playing soccer in a field with friends in Al-Rihiya, south of Hebron, on Thursday evening when Israeli forces opened fire on the group. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Israeli forces shot Mohammad in the pelvis, and he was transferred to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. “It's normal, they were afraid and ran back towards the village,” one parent whose child was a witness told BBC. Israeli forces acknowledged the killing, and claimed the children threatened them with “confrontations and rock-hurling.” No Israeli forces were injured. “Documentation by the UN Human Rights Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory attributes this staggering number of killings of Palestinians to the [Israeli military's] systematic use of lethal force against Palestinians in the vast majority of cases, including live fire, airstrikes, and shoulder-fired missiles, in an unlawful, unnecessary, and disproportionate manner, with evident disregard for Palestinians' right to life, including children,” the group said in a statement. However, the UN office notes that 19 people were killed by Israeli settlers — whose violence is encouraged by Israeli government officials — and that there were an additional 14 killings that could have been committed by either settlers or the military. There were 1,449 attacks recorded in the entirety of 2024, putting 2025 on track for a record high. Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs.

Administration reportedly promises ‘supercheck' covering shutdown pay for law enforcement officers across DHS

The Trump administration has promised tens of thousands of federal agents carrying out his immigration crackdown that they will be paid during the government shutdown, according to emails seen by Reuters, even as other federal workers go without pay.

The pay plan was communicated to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) staff on Wednesday in separate internal emails seen by Reuters.

After the story was reported, Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement that more than 70,000 law enforcement officers across DHS including those at CBP, Ice, the Secret Service and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will be paid.

They are to receive by 22 October a “supercheck” covering pay for all hours worked during the shutdown period and the next pay period, she said.

The decision shields the personnel, who are implementing one of Donald Trump's top domestic priorities in the face of mounting public criticism, from the financial hardship many federal workers are experiencing during the shutdown.

The Trump administration has also said it will pay military troops and FBI agents during the shutdown.

The shutdown, which started on 1 October, has suspended salary payments for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, even as many of them are still required to work because their jobs are considered essential.

It was not clear what funds Ice and CBP would use to provide pay to the workers. The DHS did not answer a question about where the funding was coming from.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This item has been updated with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk's statement. A Polish court on Oct. 16 refused to extradite Ukrainian national Volodymyr Z. to Germany, where he is accused of involvement in sabotage of the Nord Stream gas pipelines, Polish broadcaster TVP reported. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the suspect was released from custody. The vessel was reportedly acquired through intermediaries using forged German documents. Poland's refusal follows a similar move by Italy's Supreme Court, which on Oct. 15 overturned the extradition of another Ukrainian national, Serhii Kuznetsov, wanted by Germany on related charges. Tusk earlier commented on the matter, saying those who built the Nord Stream 2 pipeline "should be ashamed and remain silent," not those accused of sabotaging it. Tusk said extraditing the suspect would be "against Poland's interests," and he shared Poland's stance with former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and President Volodymyr Zelensky "many months ago." Ukraine's Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said on Oct. 7 that Kyiv is not interfering in the extradition proceedings. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never became operational, had long been a flashpoint in European energy politics. Even before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, critics said it deepened Germany's dependence on Russian gas and undermined European energy security. In 2021, Nord Stream 1 supplied over one-third of Russia's gas exports to Europe. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. The Crimean Wind Telegram channel earlier reported explosions and a fire at the site, with visual confirmation of burning fuel infrastructure. Of those respondents, 58% said that criticism should be balanced and constructive, in order "to not destabilize the situation in the country." The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders, during which they also agreed to hold a high-level U.S.-Russia meeting next week. Poland's refusal follows a similar move by Italy's Supreme Court, which on Oct. 15 overturned the extradition of another Ukrainian national, Serhii Kuznetsov, wanted by Germany on related charges. The Kremlin appears to be deploying a trick already used several times this year. According to Vance, there is "fundamental misalignment of expectations, where the Russians tend to think that they're doing better on the battlefield than they actually are."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decision from governor, eyeing presidential bid, could echo across US as similar bans considered in states like New York A decision by Gavin Newsom, the California governor, to veto a bill that would have banned the sale of cookware and some other consumer products made with toxic Pfas “forever chemicals” may reverberate across the US by slowing or killing similar legislation in other states, public health advocates fear. California is often looked to for guidance by other states considering new environmental rules, and some legislatures, including large states like New York and Illinois, are weighing bans on Pfas in cookware. The veto from Newsom, who is considering running for president, hands the industry a new weapon to use in battles over Pfas in other states, advocates say. Advocates are regrouping and attempting to figure out the next step, but some say Newsom's reasoning for the veto is flawed and so it can be overcome in other states. The veto followed intense cookware lobby pressure, including from celebrity chefs who have a financial stake in selling Pfas pans, such as David Chang and Thomas Keller. The bill would have also banned the chemicals' use in cleaning products, kids' products, dental floss, food packaging and ski wax. In his explanation, Newsom focused on cookware and said the legislation is “well-intentioned” but added he is “deeply concerned about the impact this bill would have on the availability of affordable options in cooking products”. Cookware is viewed by public health advocates as low-hanging fruit in their efforts to protect consumers from Pfas because alternatives, such as stainless steel or cast-iron cookware, are widely available and often sell for about the same price. Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. The compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. Pfas are widely used in consumer goods, and the health risks have prompted hundreds of state laws banning or restricting their use, including six that prohibit Pfas in cookware. The decision offers some insight into how a potential President Newsom would approach environmental and toxic chemical issues – he has also vetoed previous bills that restricted Pfas use in household cleaners and artificial turf. When cookware made with PTFE – one kind of Pfas – is scratched or chipped, it can shed micro- or nanoplastics into food. Research has linked PTFE in combination with other microplastics to decreased sperm quality, among other health issues, and PTFE fumes emitted from a pan can cause flu-like symptoms. In May, the Illinois legislature approved a package of bans on Pfas in cosmetics, dental floss, juvenile products, menstrual products and some apparel. A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries. Moreover, stores including Target are already beginning to phase out cookware that contains Pfas, and the public is increasingly aware of and outraged over the risks, Salter said. “Whether or not California passes a ban, Pfas is on the way out because consumers are demanding it,” Salter added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia is the biggest AI chip designer, and TSMC manufactures these high-powered chips. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has hit it out of the park quarter after quarter when reporting earnings, but that hasn't made investors blasé about the artificial intelligence (AI) giant's next update. Instead, investors wait with just as much anticipation each time around -- and even wonder if, this time, they'll see a slowdown in what's been a whirlwind growth story. As investors count the days until the next report -- and in this case, it's set for Nov. 19 -- they look for clues about Nvidia's AI business, one that's generated record revenue in recent years. Nvidia, as the world's biggest AI chip designer, delivered $130 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year -- that's compared to $27 billion just two years earlier. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Now, one particular clue -- and one investors truly can count on -- comes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), a key Nvidia partner. TSMC, the world's largest chip manufacturer, just announced big news for Nvidia stockholders. Before we get to this fantastic news, though, we'll take a quick look at Nvidia's business and how the company works with TSMC. Nvidia for many years built its business around designing chips for the gaming market, but as AI surfaced as a growth opportunity, the company turned its attention there. Today, Nvidia dominates this market with its high-powered chips as well as related products and services from enterprise software to networking systems. This has helped earnings and the stock price soar -- Nvidia shares have climbed more than 1,100% over the past five years. Nvidia doesn't actually manufacture its AI chips, known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and instead turns to TSMC for that job. TSMC has more than 500 customers across segments of the market, including the world's chip leaders -- from Nvidia to Broadcom and Advanced Micro Devices. On top of this, since the actual production of advanced chips becomes more and more complex with each chip innovation, TSMC starts work with customers two to three years prior to a new project. Wei said during the company's earnings call this week. All of this means TSMC has a very clear picture of what's happening in today's AI market and what lies ahead. And this brings me to the news the company delivered this week -- news that's a big deal for Nvidia stockholders. Wei added that semiconductor demand "will continue to be very fundamental." All of this is incredible news for Nvidia's shareholders as it confirms the trends the chip designer has spoken of in recent quarters and its prediction for growth in demand. In Nvidia's most recent earnings report, back in August, CEO Jensen Huang predicted that AI infrastructure spending may jump to $4 trillion by 2030. TSMC's report this past week offers us reason to be optimistic about that possibility and suggests that Nvidia is already starting to reap the rewards. As customers seek GPUs, chip designers must turn to TSMC for production -- and it's likely that TSMC's revenue gains reflect demand for Nvidia's chips since Nvidia is the market leader. All of this means there's reason for investors to be optimistic about Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and the messages it will deliver regarding future demand for its GPUs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korean author Baek Se-hee, who wrote the bestselling memoir “I Want to Die but I Want to Eat Tteokbokki,” has died at age 35, the Korean Organ Donation Agency announced on Thursday. Her book blended memoir and self-help, detailing her conversations with her psychiatrist as she grappled with conflicting feelings of wanting to die but also enjoying small pleasures like tteokbokki, a popular South Korean street food that was her favorite dish. With its frank and thoughtful discussions about therapy and mental health, the book became immensely popular in South Korea when it was published in 2018. Once it was translated into English in 2022, it became popular overseas, too, reaching the Sunday Times Bestsellers List in the United Kingdom and receiving a recommendation in the New York Times. “I didn't always feel that way, but I would go in and out of a funk that was as inevitable as bad weather.” She wrote another memoir in 2019, titled “I Want to Die but I Still Want to Eat Tteokbokki,” about her continuing struggles of living with dysthymia, a constant low-level depression. Born in 1990, the second of three daughters, Baek studied creative writing at university. It was while she was working as a social media director at a publishing house that she underwent treatment for depression and wrote her memoir. Hungary's László Krasznahorkai wins Nobel Prize in literature for work confronting ‘apocalyptic terror' “I know her kind heart, one that loved so much and hated no one, so I hope she now rests in peace in heaven. I love you so much,” her sister added. Baek donated her heart, lungs, liver and both kidneys when she died, saving the lives of five people, the organ donation agency said. Anton Hur, Baek's English translator and fellow author, paid tribute to her in an Instagram post, saying that “her readers will know she touched yet millions of lives more with her writing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SAMARKAND, October 17. Moscow will regard the supplies of Tomahawk missiles to the Kiev regime as a hostile action which would significantly increase the risks to global security, Sergey Naryshkin, director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), said. "If it happens, Russia will consider this move as a hostile one. And such a step, if implemented, will certainly substantially elevate the risks in the security sphere - not only European, but global security as well," he told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting of the Council of the Heads of Security Agencies and Special Services of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. "This issue, at least partially, was discussed yesterday during a phone conversation between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States of America," the SVR chief added. On Thursday, US leader Donald Trump, following a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, said that they had agreed to meet in the Hungarian capital soon. Trump also noted that the US cannot deplete its own stock of Tomahawk cruise missiles by supplying them to Ukraine. He confirmed that the issue of the Tomahawk deliveries to the Kiev regime had been discussed with his Russian counterpart. On Friday, Trump plans to meet with Vladimir Zelensky in the White House. Earlier, the US president said that on October 17, Zelensky will ask him to supply the Tomahawks to Ukraine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India has seemingly pushed back against US President Donald Trump's claim it had agreed to stop importing Russian oil, signaling the issue that has strained ties is unlikely to be resolved soon. Trump on Wednesday said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had “assured me today that they (India) will not be buying oil from Russia,” which is subject to US sanctions, describing it as a “big step.” But on Thursday India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters he was “not aware of any conversation” between Trump and Modi, or any assurance from the Indian leader that he would stop purchasing Russian oil. This includes broad-basing our energy sourcing and diversifying as appropriate to meet market conditions,” the statement said. India has long maintained close ties with the Kremlin and is due to host Russian President Vladimir Putin later this year. The war sparked massive sanctions against Moscow's oil industry and sent prices cratering. For months, New Delhi has resisted Trump's calls to cease purchasing Russian oil, saying it would not bend over the energy needs of its booming economy and growing population, now at more than 1.4 billion people. In August, Trump announced an additional 25% tariff on India as a penalty for importing Russian oil and gas, building on a previously announced 25% tariff rate. It would be almost impossible for India to suddenly halt purchases of crude from Russia, its largest supplier, said Muyu Xu, a senior oil analyst at trade intelligence firm Kpler. Russia delivered roughly 1.7–1.8 million barrels per day, according to Xu, who cited figures covering the first nine months of this year. Trump says Modi told him that India would stop importing Russian oil “I don't think India can stop buying Russian oil overnight. “Replacing that volume from the spot market is no easy task. So far in October, Indian Oil Corporation Limited purchased 7.03 million barrels, the data showed. CNN has contacted Indian Oil Corporation Limited to ask if it plans to continue purchasing Russian oil and the factors guiding their strategy of sourcing from Russia. Earlier this month, Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar acknowledged that India “has issues with the United States,” attributing a significant portion of the friction to unresolved trade negotiations. He noted that the two countries “have not arrived at a landing ground for our trade discussions,” but said that India is actively working to find a solution.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. In August, just days after U.S. President Donald Trump had welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska, a remarkable image emerged from the White House. The European leaders' decision to accompany Zelensky reflected a combination of courage and pragmatism. It would have been easier to condemn Trump for welcoming Putin onto U.S. soil, or to hold a countersummit in Europe and avoid the potential domestic political embarrassment of paying homage in the Oval Office. But those options would have required the European leaders to believe that they can prevent a Russian victory in Ukraine (and guarantee their own countries' security) without U.S. military, economic, and diplomatic power. So instead, they leveraged their strengths—Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's ideological proximity to Trump, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's relatively frequent contact with him, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb's unique rapport with him (based in no small part on Stubb's golfing prowess)—to charm, cajole, and push the disruptive U.S. president more or less in the right strategic direction. The result was an agreement to ship advanced U.S. weapons systems to Ukraine via NATO purchases, with Trump even considering Kyiv's request for Tomahawk missiles. For European leaders, this collaborative effort to spur Trump to stick with U.S. allies—and with the alliance system the United States itself had built—represented a sharp departure from his first term. In it, German Chancellor Angela Merkel appears to impatiently confront a defiant or dismissive Trump while French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minster Theresa May seem to be backing Merkel. Meanwhile, a pained Abe stands by Trump's side, mimicking the U.S. president's body language and perhaps looking for an opportunity to diffuse the tension. The Trump team came to office in 2017 with no clear concept for their Asia strategy, so Abe helped convince them to adopt Japan's “free and open Indo-Pacific” framework. When Trump threatened to rain “fire and fury” on North Korea, Abe promised Japan's support—but quietly added conditions that defined whether force should actually be used. Where many world leaders sought to avoid confrontations with the mercurial U.S. president, Abe held 20 meetings, 32 phone calls, and five rounds of golf with Trump during his first term. “It wasn't really 20 summits,” one Japanese diplomat quipped to me, “but the same summit 20 times.” And during Trump's first term, Asian leaders followed his example. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi managed to get Trump to join him in Texas in 2019 for an appearance before 50,000 members of the Indian diaspora; the rally was titled “Howdy Modi.” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his ambassador in Washington, Joe Hockey, formed close relationships with Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's national security team to stay aligned on China strategy and engagement in the South Pacific. And even South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who came from the political left and was an unlikely partner for Trump, rallied to the U.S. president's side to encourage diplomacy with North Korea. For one, in some respects, Trump's approach to the region resembles an “Asia first” strategy far more than it did during his first term. Moreover, polls conducted in 2024 showed that in Australia, India, Japan, and South Korea, people were initially far less alarmed about Trump's return than were Europeans. Nor can Asian leaders' relative reticence be pegged to their political standing. As a result, U.S. strategy in Asia remains muddled, and Asian leaders are missing the full benefits of American partnership, including greater security against China. In private, one factor that Asian officials repeatedly point to in explaining their recent passivity is the policymaking process of the second Trump administration, which is more chaotic and unpredictable than it was during the first term. Back then, they could count on reliable and influential partners inside the administration, such as National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Matt Pottinger, who served as senior director for Asia on the National Security Council. Trump's tariff policies also rattled Asian leaders in ways that even his first-term musings about war and peace with North Korea did not. Australia can easily survive the ten percent tariffs levied by the administration, but Trump threatened additional 200 percent tariffs on pharmaceuticals—a third rail in Australian politics—if Australia does not start paying more for U.S.-manufactured drugs. The reasons why this dissatisfaction has not produced a more robust effort to manage Trump vary in each country. Despite frustration over tariffs and some polls showing that only 16 percent of the Japanese public trusts Trump, support for the U.S.-Japanese alliance remains at 90 percent or more, mostly owing to the sense of a shared threat from China. The Japanese public would take an approach like Abe's if they could get it, but nobody has emerged with Abe's domestic political strength or acumen for Trump. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's early gains in a February meeting with Trump were undone by U.S. tariffs and Ishiba's weak standing within his own party (he resigned in early September, triggering October elections). His successor, Takaichi, is more conservative, supports a “Japan first” approach, and has hawkish views on China that could resonate with the Trump administration. Trump, however, is beginning to soften his own stance on China ahead of a planned 2026 visit to Beijing and hopes for a positive trade agreement with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. If she becomes prime minister, Takaichi is likely to meet Trump for the first time in a matter of weeks at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, and although she would be right to caution Trump about China, as Abe did, such a warning is riskier in the face of Trump's shifting priorities. If Trump pushes aside Takaichi in favor of U.S.-Chinese relations, she will suffer politically at home. But Beijing's announcement on October 9 that it would expand export restrictions on rare-earth metals (which are critical for technology manufacturing) sparked a combative response from Trump, who threatened an additional 100 percent tariff on Chinese imports and suggested he would cancel his plan to meet with Xi at APEC. Trump is due to visit Japan at the end of October, and Takaichi may be able to use the new tension between Trump and Xi to her advantage—but only if she can get her house in order first. Australia has fought alongside the United States in all of the latter's major conflicts since World War I, and the two countries maintain strong defense and intelligence-sharing practices (of growing importance for both sides given competition with China). As part of the AUKUS agreement, signed in 2021, Australia agreed to purchase multiple U.S. Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines. Canberra is also ready to work with Washington on securing supply chains for critical minerals, given Australia's extensive mining resources. Albanese's Labor government has also used a more moderate tone in its response to the China threat than has the United States, emphasizing the stabilization of relations with Beijing—although that could be a positive for Albanese, if Trump's own approach to China continues to shift. Trump is deeply unpopular with the Labor Party's left flank—Pew surveys show that negative views of Trump are much stronger in Australia than other parts of Asia—and some of Albanese's advisers argue that he should keep a low profile around the American president. Albanese, however, is committed to his first meeting in Washington, where he has an opportunity to pull Trump into deeper engagement with the region—especially Southeast Asia and the Pacific, which are under pressure from China and critical to Australia's security. An ideological odd couple relationship seemed possible between Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, who was elected in June. Lee pulled off a masterful Oval Office performance on August 25, reassuring Trump of South Korean investment commitments to the U.S. economy and talking down tariff levels. South Korean support for the U.S. alliance was around 90 percent, but anti-American voices within Lee's progressive circle are now emboldened, and the relationship between Lee and Trump is in need of repair. Trump's attendance at APEC later this month offers a chance for reconciliation, if both sides can take advantage of it. On top of the 50 percent tariffs he levied against India, Trump infuriated New Delhi by taking full credit for ending the military clash that broke out in May between India and Pakistan and then inviting Pakistan's army chief to the White House. To many in India, this resembles a symbolic return to the kind of regional policy that Washington pursued 25 years ago, before it forged a strategic partnership with India. Modi could have gone the Abe route and brushed off these slights, instead working to push Trump in a better direction. But that would have been out of character for Modi, and now that his party's governing majority in parliament has been reduced and the Indian economy is slowing, he, too, faces a more challenging domestic political situation than he did during Trump's first term. But if Trump's expected absence at the Quad summit in India later this year is any indication, the relationship between Washington and New Delhi appears likely to remain broken for a while. But without a skillful manager like Abe, the trajectory of Trump's Asia approach remains uncertain. Others—including, it appears, Trump—see diplomacy with China as an opportunity for trade deals in the near term and are willing to set aside other concerns. The second Trump administration is certainly more difficult to manage given the president's love of tariffs and general unpredictability, and no current Asian leader can claim a mandate at home comparable to Abe's. But although no Abe-like Trump whisperer currently exists among Asia's leaders, that absence cannot be allowed to remain. Asian leaders have an even greater incentive to keep Washington in play than they did in 2017 because of China's ambitions, and only the United States has the composite power Asia needs to maintain regional defenses and deter Beijing's aggression. Despite Trump's unpredictability, key members of his administration are ready to step up engagement with Asia. Whatever combination of flattery, persuasion, and political alignment is required, Asian leaders should learn from their European counterparts and ensure that the United States stays in the game.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia shot down its own Su-30SM fighter jet over Crimea while its air defense was trying to intercept Ukrainian drones flying to the occupied peninsula and deep inside Russia overnight, Dmytro Pletenchuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian Navy, said on Oct. 17. "The enemy likely shot down its own multirole fighter while repelling a (Ukrainian) drone attack using air defense systems," Pletenchuk told the Kyiv Independent. In Russia, cities including Sochi, about 400 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, were under attack. An attack by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being repelled," Sochi Mayor Andrei Proshunin said. Russian media reported that over 10 airports had temporarily suspended operations. At around 7:30 a.m. local time, all drone and missile threats were cleared, Proshunin said afterwards. Ukraine's army regularly strikes military infrastructure within occupied territories and deep within Russia in an attempt to diminish Moscow's fighting power as it continues to wage its war against Ukraine. Sochi sits on Russia's Black Sea coast and is located about 310 kilometers (193 miles) from Ukraine and approximately 538 kilometers (334 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Orikhiv in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Overnight on Oct. 16, Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's Saratov Oblast, Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) confirmed. Meanwhile, an electrical substation in Russia's Volgograd Oblast was in flames following a reported Ukrainian drone strike the same night, regional Governor Andrey Bocharov said the morning of Oct. 16. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent. The Crimean Wind Telegram channel earlier reported explosions and a fire at the site, with visual confirmation of burning fuel infrastructure. A co-founder of the New York Group — a collective of Ukrainian emigre writers — Tarnawsky helped to expand and redefine contemporary Ukrainian literature through his embrace of narrative structure experimentation and linguistic innovation. Of those respondents, 58% said that criticism should be balanced and constructive, in order "to not destabilize the situation in the country." The announcement followed a phone call between the two leaders, during which they also agreed to hold a high-level U.S.-Russia meeting next week. Poland's refusal follows a similar move by Italy's Supreme Court, which on Oct. 15 overturned the extradition of another Ukrainian national, Serhii Kuznetsov, wanted by Germany on related charges. The Kremlin appears to be deploying a trick already used several times this year. According to Vance, there is "fundamental misalignment of expectations, where the Russians tend to think that they're doing better on the battlefield than they actually are."</p>

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Tommy Edman hit a tiebreaking single off hard-throwing rookie Jacob Misiorowski in a two-run sixth inning, and the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the Milwaukee Brewers 3-1 on Thursday to take a 3-0 lead in their NL Championship Series. No team has won consecutive titles since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees took three in a row. That was the only run allowed by Tyler Glasnow, who has combined with Ohtani, Blake Snell and Yoshinobu Yamamoto to give Dodgers starters a 1.54 postseason ERA during an 8-1 postseason spurt. The 23-year-old right-hander topped 100 mph with 17 pitches and struck out a Brewers postseason rookie record nine, but his fastball velocity dropped to 98-99 mph slightly in the sixth. Will Smith singled with one out on an slider in the middle of the strike zone and Freddie Freeman walked after falling behind 1-2 in the count. Edman, who had struck out twice against Misiorowski, lined a low slider into center, and Smith scored for a 2-1 lead as Sal Frelick made a week throw. Abner Uribe relieved and struck out Hernandez, then made a wild pickoff throw past first as Freeman scored, the second straight game with an error by the Brewers closer. Glasnow allowed three hits and three walks in 5 2/3 innings while striking out eight, leaving to a standing ovation from the crowd of 51,251. Alex Vesia followed Glasnow and got two outs for his second win of the playoffs. Roki Sasaki pitched a perfect ninth for his third save of the postseason, finishing a four-hitter. Dodgers relievers allowed one hit of 3 1/3 innings. Milwaukee, which swept the Dodgers 6-0 during the regular season, has lost its last 10 postseason road games dating to 2018. Ohtani, 1-0 with a 4.50 ERA in the postseason, makes his second postseason start after the right-hander struck out nine over six innings against Philadelphia in the NL Division Series. The two-way star was 1 for 4 with two strikeouts and is hitting .158 (6 for 38) with one homer and six RBIs in nine postseason game. Hitting even the three-year goal would take a level of agility that nuclear regulators have not been known for.
