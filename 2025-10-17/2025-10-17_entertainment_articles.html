By flouting all conventions in the face of rock and roll and making a mellifluous spectacle of the music that moved through his body like a thought from God, Jarrett has become a peerless symbol of artistic purity, his talent singular, his every note sui generis. By contrast, Ido Fluk's “Köln 75” — a passable “we're putting on a show!” movie about the mad scramble to stage “The Köln Concert” — is the kind of lightly amusing pop confection that starts with a “freeze frame, record scratch, ‘you're probably wondering how I got here'” moment before hitting a million different beats that are designed to feel pre-digested and familiar. A terse road trip where the tension between two people gives way to mutual respect! Related Stories ‘Primate' Trailer: Killer Ape Movies Never Go Out of Style, Now with Bonus Nefarious Tablet ‘It Was Just an Accident' Editor Amir Etminan on Cutting the Film in Secret, in a Safe House, and Off Hidden Hard Drives Which is to say it's no wonder that Jarrett, who loathes self-mythology and has always insisted that “music should go as quickly as it comes,” wanted nothing to do with the project. But the saving grace of “Köln 75” — and what makes the labored fun of this movie worth savoring on its own terms — is that Jarrett isn't really its subject. Instead, an irrepressible 18-year-old girl named Vera Brandes embodies both of those things, and the story here ultimately belongs to her. Brandes was the scaffolding that held up one of music's greatest nights, and by focusing on the defiant fearlessness that bound her to a jazz god like Jarrett, Fluk is able to bend the been there, heard that conventions of a standard music biopic into a genuinely enjoyable tribute to the legends behind the legends. If “Köln” 75 is ultimately forgettable despite its fun, well, perhaps that's the most fitting way of all to honor the ethos of Jarrett's music. While the safe functionality of Fluk's script might seem to undermine the radical nature of improvisational jazz, “Köln 75” nevertheless manages to articulate a core truth of Jarrett's performances: They were less motivated by Mozart-like confidence than they were by a profound fear of failure. It's a fear that young Vera (Mala Emde, convincingly both free-spirited and laser-focused all at once) feels in her bones. The daughter of a severely disapproving dentist (Ulrich Tukur) who witnessed World War II from the heart of Germany and still seems to think that women's lib is the worst thing that's ever happened to his country, Vera is a perfect vessel for rebellion. She loves marching in the street, seducing older men (though all men are older than she is), and stalking the local jazz clubs where they tend to hang out. “Shouldn't you be listening to rock and roll?” someone asks. Her vitality leaves quite the impression on saxophonist Ronnie Scott (Daniel Betts), who fends off the girl's advances even as he's dazzled by her willpower. It doesn't matter that Vera has less than zero experience, Ronnie just can't imagine that anyone else would be able to turn her down. It isn't long before Vera recognizes her own power, makes a name for herself, and — after crossing paths with Mick — becomes determined to book Jarrett (a squirrely and convincing John Magaro) at the most prestigious venue in all of Cologne. He plays against the piano, as Mick puts it, and that means he plays for people like Vera. She'll have to borrow 10,000 Deutsche Marks to host the show, and Jarrett will have to go onstage at 11:30 p.m. after the opera theater has already staged a full production of Alban Berg's demanding “Lulu,” but Vera sees this mad idea as her best chance to prove her dad wrong and publicly spit in his face. Of course, if Jarrett doesn't make it to Cologne in time, or if Vera can't find the right piano for him before the curtain goes up, the whole thing could easily turn into a life-defining fiasco. Cue the prefab suspense, some of which is the stuff of pure fiction (e.g., Mick's road trip with Jarrett, which allows us to understand the musician on a more personal level, and to better appreciate how he suffers for and surrenders to his art), and some of which is unbelievably true (e.g., Vera's last-minute scramble to replace the busted old Bösendorfer that Jarrett refuses to play). That may not sound like enough plot to sustain a narratively unadventurous 116-minute film, but that's only because it isn't. Fortunately, “Köln 75” is more rewarding for the interstitial moments that its plot makes possible than it is for the plot itself — fitting enough for a movie that isn't allowed to include a single note from the concert itself, and is thus forced to source its fun and catharsis from the music around the music. This is the story of a stooped man who created something completely new because the piano he was provided was too old to produce anything else, and the story of a young woman who made that happen because the life she was offered was too old for her to survive it. Dissonance isn't something to fear; it's the reason why consonance sounds so beautiful. His frequent use of direct-to-camera narration initially seems like a cloying misstep (mostly because so many other movies have sucked the fun out of that device). But Chernus talks at us with the condescending zeal of a true music-lover, and his cheeky tirades about the history of jazz — and why Jarrett's gift for improvisation is unique even in the context of such a freeform genre — are entertaining and educational in equal measure. At one point, there's even a delightful aside about how Can got their name, which itself speaks to the role that fate can play in the legacy of seemingly preordained artistic perfection. It simply offers a pleasant and zippy testament to the invisible — often forgotten — alchemy that goes into the making of a masterpiece.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Grey's Anatomy viewers left wondering after Thursday night's episode if beloved Dr. Amelia Shepherd has truly taken a leave of absence from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, the answer is both bad and good: Yes, veteran star Caterina Scorsone is indeed taking a hiatus from the ABC hit medical series, but she will return. 'The Wild Robot,' 'The Daily Show' Among Winners at Environmental Media Awards 'Grey's Anatomy' Star on Show Exit: "There Should be a Dead 'Grey's' Doctor Club" Amelia and Monica were on the verge of exploring a romantic relationship, and the loss sent her into a depression that played out with her onscreen family this week: sister-in-law Meredith Grey, played by star/executive producer Ellen Pompeo, and Maggie Pierce (exited castmember Kelly McCreary, who returned for Thursday's episode). “While Amelia was so centered in that storyline at the end of last season with Piper [Perabo]'s character and with the child [in the season 21 finale], I wanted for us to believe that everything was kind of OK for Amelia after we saved Link's [Chris Carmack] life. I also really wanted to deliver consequences of Amelia taking on all these impossible surgeries,” she said of Amelia also almost losing her ex, Link. “As Amelia mentions in the episode, she lost her father at a very young age and that really propelled the way her life went.” She was also a regular on Grey's spinoff Private Practice from 2010-13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A week after Netflix‘s LGBTQ military series Boots debuted, one review we weren't expecting to read is from the Pentagon. Since Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appears to be too busy with his crackdown on the press and whipping the troops into shape, Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson took time out of her day to decry the new show, which is based on retired Marine Corps. Greg Cope White's memoir The Pink Marine (and produced by late WWII veteran Norman Lear). “Under President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, the U.S. military is getting back to restoring the warrior ethos,” said Wilson in a statement shared with multiple outlets. Wilson added, “We will not compromise our standards to satisfy an ideological agenda, unlike Netflix whose leadership consistently produces and feeds woke garbage to their audience and children.” Created by Andy Parker and based on White's book, Boots stars Miles Heizer stars as 1990s closeted teen Cameron Cope, who impulsively follows his best friend Ray McAffey's (Liam Oh) lead in enlisting in the United States Marine Corps. White's book was set in 1979, when he joined the Reagan-era USMC with his friend Dale. Gay people could not openly serve in the military until Don't Ask, Don't Tell was repealed in 2011.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Ajike “AJ” Owens went to Susan Lorincz's door on June 2, 2023, the confrontation was one in a series of years-long disagreements between the two neighbors. Lorincz, 58 at the time, and Owens, 35, lived in a housing complex in Ocala, Florida, a small community of duplexes filled with young families. Several of the children referred to her as a racist and a “Karen,” telling their parents she called them the n-word. “This is just ridiculous,” Lorincz said on a 911 call around 8:54 that June night. Now that they're home from school, it's like, craziness.” After the several children told their parents that Lorincz had yelled at them and thrown a pair of roller blades at a 10-year-old, Owens, a Black mother of four, walked over to Lorincz's and knocked loudly on the door, demanding she come outside. Two minutes later, authorities received a second call from Lorincz, this time saying she had shot a woman through her locked front door. “I didn't know what to do,” Lorincz cried on the 911 call. Medical experts later pronounced her dead at the hospital. Lorincz was taken into police custody but quickly released after giving her testimony, citing that she only pulled the trigger because she was afraid for her life. Her defense — that she was “scared” Owens was going to kill her — took language directly from Florida's stand your ground law, which allows residents to use deadly force in their home if they fear for their lives. Stand your ground laws were touted as a way to keep people safe. How did it leave four kids without their mom? “And I felt really compelled to understand how this could happen. There is no overlying narration from witnesses or law experts. Instead, police conversations are a constant, accompanied by dozens of filmed interactions with Lorincz and her neighbors by the Marion County Sheriff's Office. There are interviews with Lorincz, statements from people in the neighborhood, filmed testimony from children as they ride their bikes and  play kickball, and conversations between deputies themselves calling Lorincz's responses' overblown. But even after multiple deputies and police officers encouraged Lorincz to leave the children alone — and asked the children to involve their parents instead of responding to Lorincz directly — the conflicts continued. ‘Ballad of a Small Player': Colin Farrell Gambles It All Away The Perfect Neighbor takes a frank — if not uncomfortable — approach to Owens' shooting, including clips of Owens' children begging for aid, neighbors attempting to do 911 before first responders take over, and the heartbreaking moment when Owen's mother, Pamela Dias, and Owens' children are informed she has succumbed to her injuries. “There's an expectation that children will outlive their parents, but as a parent, you never want to outlive your child.” But it also includes police footage of the protests and interviews that happened after Owens' death, including Lorincz's statement, all focused around Florida's controversial stand your ground law. Most stand your ground laws center around justifiable uses of force, according to Cynthia Godsoe, a professor of criminal law at Brooklyn Law School. Also referred to as a type of castle doctrine, these laws require that people fulfill certain criteria — like being physically on their inside their homes and being in fear of their life — before they can be legally justified in using a weapon to protect themselves. In the past two decades, dozens of states have expanded these laws to also include private property generally — meaning you could successfully use a stand your ground law just by being inside your property line and feeling threatened rather than in your home. However, research has shown that stand your ground laws not only increase rates of violence and homicides in states that implement them, but are disproportionately used against people of color. According to a 2022 study, stand your ground laws were associated with an eight percent increase in monthly homicide rates in states that have them. A Tampa Bay Times investigation into over 200 cases that cited stand your ground laws found that people were more likely to escape prosecution if their victim was Black. Owens was a Black mother shot by a white woman through a locked door, mirroring similar national cases where Black individuals were shot under stand your ground laws while doing things like jogging or ringing unfamiliar doorbells. Normally, the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone did something, in this case, manslaughter,” Godsoe explains. “But once you assert self defense like this, it almost smears the victim. The prosecution has to prove that this person was not actually scary. So now we've deputized people across the country who are gun owners to take things into their own hands.” Roughly two months after Owens' death, Gandbhir and her producers filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Marion County Sheriff's Office, asking for police body camera footage associated with the case. They were given over 30 hours of material on a thumbdrive, dash cam footage, body camera recordings, and clips from community Ring cameras, all of which were jumbled, out of date, and often missing the associated audio. Gandbhir describes it as a “huge process,” to make sense out of the material, but after she was able to put it in chronological order, she realized the body camera footage offered a perspective often missing from typical true-crime documentaries. Why This Nineties High School Punk Band Is Suddenly Bigger Than Ever Long Covid Is Real — And It's Changing an Entire Generation Gene Simmons, Rush, Tom Morello, More Honor Kiss' Ace Frehley: ‘My First Guitar Hero' “When there is a terrible crime in this country, when it comes to gun violence, unfortunately you only really ever see the aftermath. You see people talking to the news,” she says. “But in this [body cam] footage, we had two years leading up to the incident in which you saw this beautiful little community living together, loving each other that the police inadvertently went in and captured all. And you see what happened play out in real time.” In Owens' case, community members protested after the shooting until Lorincz was arrested. In Aug. 2024, Lorincz was found guilty of first-degree felony manslaughter with a firearm. In his ruling, Judge Robert Hodges said that shooting was based “more in anger than in fear.” Members of Owens' family were present when Lorincz received her sentence, footage of which plays during the final credits scene of The Perfect Neighbor. For Gandbhir, while the release of the film feels like a full circle moment in honoring Owens' life, she hopes people who watch the documentary will learn just how dangerous stand your ground laws have made life for many Americans. “Ajike should still be with us today,” Gandbhir says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Mann has revealed that Scott Cooper will direct his Western project Comanche, inspired by the story of Cynthia Ann Parker, a white woman who was kidnapped by Comanches as a child and later lived as a Comanche woman. He was replying to a question on two long-gestated Westerns he has been planning to make for some time. I have two screenplays, one of which I'm not going to do, I'm going to produce and Scott Cooper is going to do… it's called Comanche,” Mann told a masterclass at the Lumière Festival in Lyon on Friday. Michael Mann's 'Heat 2' Moves From Warner Bros To United Artists; Leonardo DiCaprio Circling Chris Shiherlis Role; Jerry Bruckheimer & Scott Stuber Producing Michael Mann To Be Honored With France's Lumière Award Actor and director Cooper is currently gearing up for release of his Bruce Springsteen biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as the rock star. Mann also gave an update on his plans for Heat 2, saying negotiations were ongoing and that he hoped to shoot the film in 2026. Earlier this month, Deadline revealed that the sequel to Mann's iconic crime drama  Heat, had moved to Amazon MGM Studios division United Artists, after years of development at Warner Bros. Sources also told Deadline that Leonardo DiCaprio is in early talks to star in the role of Chris Shiherlis, the character played by Val Kilmer in the 1995 original. Mann is in Lyon as its honorary guest of the heritage-focused Lumière Festival. The director will be feted with the Lumière Award in front of a 3,000-strong crowd at the festival on Friday evening, following in the footsteps of Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, Jane Fonda, Francis Ford Coppola, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton and Isabelle Huppert.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frehley died last night from complications after a fall, at 74. But his sound was primal rock power, blasting his Les Paul through a Marshall stack for the deranged solos of “Shock Me,” “Strange Ways,” and “She.” The most beloved native son of Jendell is coming home. Kiss were all about mystique — and nobody had more of it than Ace. In a band of sensible businessmen, Ace was truly the wild one, the one who really did rock & roll all night and party every day, causing chaos wherever he went. “I eat, sleep, and drink my character,” Ace told Rolling Stone in 1977. By the time I'm 40, interplanetary travel will be common. He definitely didn't envision a future where he'd still be famous nearly 50 years later: “I'm gonna be on Mars. This planet won't be here in 50 years.” Paul Daniel Frehley grew up in the Bronx, getting his mind blown at 15 when he witnessed the Who's first U.S. show. “Lead Guitarist Wanted with Flash and Ability,” the ad declared. They shook their heads at his fashion sense — but flash and ability were never a problem for this guy. Ace became a cult figure to Seventies kids with his rock-star pose on the cover of Kiss' Alive!, the album that made them famous. Kiss actually weren't selling many records at that point, barely keeping their heads above water, but the cover photo of Alive! Ace holds center stage, knees bent, slung low to the ground, brandishing his Gibson while Gene and Paul preen on either side of him. But that sums up Ace's star power — he didn't need his guitar to be right side up, or plugged in, for him to summon his Space Ace cool and preside as the otherworldly chaos agent at the heart of Kiss. Watch Ace Frehley Play ‘Deuce' and ‘New York Groove' During Final Live Show Gene Simmons, Rush, Tom Morello, More Honor Kiss' Ace Frehley: ‘My First Guitar Hero' Gene Simmons Remembers Kiss' Ace Frehley as the ‘Eternal Rock Soldier' This Ace Frehley T-Shirt Is Now Available at the Official Kiss Merch Store Online Ace wrote classics like “Shock Me,” inspired by a real-life near-electrocution moment, and “Cold Gin,” inspired by real-life cold gin. “Shock Me” was the first time he ever tried singing lead on a Kiss tune, a surprisingly belated and modest debut, but an unforgettable performance. In so many ways, it always felt like Ace was singing directly to the audience, to the Kiss Army that plugged him in and kept him high. Rock stardom worked that way for Ace — he was always a bare wire without any insulation, overloading and often blowing out, with the fans as his power source. The other guys could wash off their makeup and go back to real life, at least in theory, but Ace was all rock star, all the time. He was one of the great characters in the rock world, with his squeaky voice and famous choking-dragon “ack!” noise of a laugh. Like his bandmates, he was an unlikely but devoted buddy of the guys in Rush, one of the all-time most beloved rock-band odd couples. As Geddy Lee told Rolling Stone, “We would get high with Ace Frehley in his hotel room and make him laugh.” You could always tell it was Ace playing lead, with his unhinged noise blasts in “Strange Ways” or “100,000 Years” or “Calling Dr. Love.” As he told Rolling Stone in 2014, “Page, Clapton, Hendrix, Townshend, Beck — all I did was copy their solos and kind of twist them around, and you've got a guitar style.” Part of the Ace mystique was how cool it sounded when Paul Stanley said his name, especially on Alive 2! He always seemed so ethereal and otherworldly, even more disconnected from reality than his bandmates — he seemed to come at the world sideways, whether musically or visually, with his lurching posture and ambling gait. But he was a born comedian, as best seen in the band's classic 1979 full-makeup interview with Tom Snyder on The Tomorrow Show. Every detail of “New York Groove” sounds sleek and oversized — the stomp-stomp-stomp chorus chant, the rubber-band-man guitar quiver, the cha-cha beat, and his declamatory vocals, as he declares, “It's gonna be ecstasy! Long Covid Is Real — And It's Changing an Entire Generation Why This Nineties High School Punk Band Is Suddenly Bigger Than Ever Gene Simmons, Rush, Tom Morello, More Honor Kiss' Ace Frehley: ‘My First Guitar Hero' For a guy who claimed to be insecure about his vocal prowess, Ace is all swagger, peacocking his way through the city with a fistful of dollars and wicked ladies pursuing him. It's a Big Apple anthem on the level of Sinatra and Biggie. And there's something beautiful about the fact that Gene Simmons and Ace Frehley never stopped arguing about whose solo album sold better — although there's no denying that Ace's left the bigger bootprint on history. Ace left the band in 1982 — right before they took their leap of faith by washing off the makeup and beginning their massive comeback with hits like “Lick It Up” and “Heaven's on Fire.” He kept rolling with Frehley's Comet, rejoining the band for their massively successful 1996 reunion tour with the makeup back on. “My problem is that God gave me too many gifts,” he told Rolling Stone's Brian Hiatt in 2014. He titled his memoir No Regrets, but later remembered a few, so he planned a sequel, saying, “The working title is Some Regrets.” He was making music till the end, with his 2024 album, 10,000 Volts, and always remained his unimpeachable Space Ace self, with his unique mix of extraterrestrial glow and Bronx grit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prominent critics like Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert were singing Scorsese's praises before anyone really knew who he was. And there have been countless books that have touched on his career, such as Robert P. Kolker's revelatory essay collection A Cinema Of Loneliness, Peter Biskind's muckraking New Hollywood history Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, and Glenn Kenny's incisive and entertaining making-of-Goodfellas tome Made Men. You know his sensational NYU student films landed his name in the papers when he was still in his early twenties, that he worked on the landmark Woodstock documentary with his longtime editor/collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker, and that the exploitation film Boxcar Bertha that he made for producer Roger Corman garnered “don't do this again” rebukes from his peers and mentors. You know how the fluorescent genius of Scorsese's '70s masterpieces led to a cocaine crash that almost killed him, how he struggled to get the work he most cared about made in the '80s, and how his '90s hits practically turned him into a brand. With all of that said, what could director Rebecca Miller's five-part Apple TV+ docuseries Mr. Scorsese possibly have to offer to anyone who knows this story backward and forward? But it's more enlightening to have Schoonmaker sit in front of a screen and walk us through those choices, while also showing us rarely seen outtakes that reveal how the movie's individual shots were constructed. This series offers the Scorsese story illustrated, with Miller—an accomplished filmmaker herself—using split screens, clever edits, and footage from his personal archives to draw connections between the director's films, his favorite movies, and his own experiences. This is a world Scorsese watched through his bedroom window. In one of this documentary's most striking sequences, Miller pulls up image after image from Scorsese's films of characters looking down at the action unfolding below them, close enough to be affected by it but still at a slight remove. He was well-prepared by the time he arrived at film school, and while Scorsese's student work has long been available for fans to watch, it looks different in the context of all the anecdotes about his youth. The first episode ends with Scorsese feeling alienated and angry in California, where his friends Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Brian De Palma are all getting chances to make the movies they want to make while he's wondering if he'll have to follow up Boxcar Bertha with more low-budget, drive-in fodder. Then Miller throws in a cliffhanger of sorts, as Scorsese talks about wanting to do Mean Streets, needing a star, and being introduced to Robert De Niro. Episode two, “All This Filming Isn't Healthy,” covers the '70s highs and lows, ending with him collapsing and being hospitalized while coping with the failure of New York, New York. Episode four, “Total Cinema,” starts with the resounding resurrection of Goodfellas and finishes with a string of box-office disappointments, leaving Scorsese once again in need of a star to get his dream projects made. Enter Leonardo DiCaprio, who in episode five, “Method Director,” becomes Scorsese's muse and angel. Through each part, Miller and her interview subjects debunk a few myths about the man everyone calls Marty. Though its subject may have grown less temperamental over the past decade or so, Mr. Scorsese still draws a clear line between the man who battled with his personal demons and struggled with depression while making Raging Bull and The King Of Comedy and the one who fell into a similarly deep, dark hole while helming Shutter Island 30 years later. Mr. Scorsese doesn't shy away either from how an artist's obsessiveness and fits of fury can hurt the people who try to love him. Miller interviews all three of Scorsese's daughters (from three different wives), and each of them talks about what they've missed out on while he's pursued his dreams. Only one of Scorsese's ex-wives, Isabella Rossellini, sits for a new interview, and a strong memory she shares is of how, in the early '80s, he seemed to start each day angry before he even got out of bed. These contradictions seem to animate Scorsese: the compassionate Christian obsessed with violence; the champion of independent cinema who demands nine-figure budgets for his own movies; and the man who kept driving away wives until he met and married his fifth, Helen Morris, who has been coping with Parkinson's disease for decades. Mr. Scorsese peters out toward the close of its final chapter, perhaps because it's trying to put an end to a tale as yet unfinished. Nevertheless, this series is a valuable piece of cultural history and criticism, which serves to separate Martin Scorsese as an icon from who he really is as a human being and an artist. It's easy to talk about Scorsese's defining films in terms of their pervasive influence on cinema. And for all of its fine analysis, Mr. Scorsese also acknowledges that sometimes what the director has done remains ineffable. Early in “Saint/Sinner,” both Spielberg and De Palma talk with awe about the first time they saw Raging Bull, which is the work of an extraordinary filmmaker using all of his available tools in service of something that is equal parts brutal and personal, kinetic and suffocating. Spielberg says that the movie's radical empathy for a violent man left him in a fugue state for hours, shaken to his core.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Founding KISS guitarist Ace Frehley died Thursday (Oct. 16) at age 74 after sustaining injuries suffered during a fall last month. Frehley's family issued a statement announcing the guitarist's death, saying in part: “We are completely devastated and heartbroken. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth. Frehley's fellow rockers were also heartbroken when the news broke, coming out in droves on social media to share their love and condolences for the late musician and his family. “We are devastated by the passing of Ace Frehley,” reads a social post. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. The guitarist's onetime KISS bandmate and fellow co-founder Gene Simmons posted on X, writing, “Our hearts are broken. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec. Sadder still, Ace didn't live long enough to be honored at the Kennedy Ctr Honors event in Dec. KISS will be honored at the 2025 Kennedy Center Honors, taping Dec. 7 and airing Dec. 23 on CBS. A post shared by The Kennedy Center (@kennedycenter) Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan posted a throwback photo of Frehley on Instagram, writing “Godspeed, Ace.” Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello also posted a lengthy tribute, writing on Instagram that Frehley was, “My first guitar hero.” “The legendary Space Ace Frehley inspired generations to love rock n roll and love rock n roll guitar playing,” Morello wrote. Thank you, Ace for a lifetime of great music and memories. Grunge rockers Pearl Jam also shared a statement, noting that in their early days as a band they “spent untold hours talking about KISS and buying KISS stuff.” “I studied his solos endlessly over the years.” Poison's Brett Michaels also shared a photo he took with the late musician, adding, “Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time. @ace_frehley Ace, my brother, I surely cannot thank you enough for the years of great music, the many festivals we've done together and your lead guitar on Nothing But A Good Time. KISS founding frontman and guitarist Paul Stanley shared his “favorite photo” with his late ex-bandmate, and fondly recounted their first encounter. From one guitar legend to another, Steve Vai remembered Frehley as a character who was “gloriously unfiltered and full of life.” He writes, “Ace Frehley was the embodiment of rock 'n' roll attitude — unapologetic, loud, and irresistibly catchy. During my teenage years, his playing inspired me not because it was polished, but because it was gloriously unfiltered and full of life. Ace reminded us all that rock should never apologize for being fun and that a little chaos can sound downright heavenly. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, and fans. Gibson Guitars remember the Spaceman for his out-of-this-world guitar playing. “Thank you for the decades of music inspiring generations with your electrifying guitar work and unforgettable stage presence. Our thoughts are with Ace's family, friends, and fans around the world. Frehley played on KISS' first nine albums before he left the band in 1982. The guitarist also released nine solo studio albums throughout his career. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Beckham — or Posh, to members everywhere of the Girl Power brigade — spoke with Cohen and Hill to promote her new self-titled Netflix documentary series, when conversation inevitably turned to the Spice Girls. “Before I was in the Spice Girls,” she remarks in a snippet of the interview, “I was so self-conscious and they made me feel that I was good enough, but being on stage, I realized as fun as it is, you know, it's not ultimately what I want to do anymore.” Taylor Swift's 'The Life Of A Showgirl' Dazzles on ARIA Charts Somewhere flash, like the Sphere in Las Vegas? “It would be tempting, but could I take on a world tour? Beckham, whose husband David, the retired English soccer great with the brilliant right foot who is known to a generation of sports fans as “Golden Balls,” a nickname she coined, was inspired by another reunited British act from the 1990s, Oasis, whose comeback trek is heading to Australian stadiums later this month. Beckham last performed with the Spice Girls in April 2024 at her 50th birthday party at the swanky London private club Oswald's, where Posh, Scary, Sporty, Baby and Ginger sang an impromptu mini-set of “Stop” and “Mama”. Prior to that, the last time all five members performed together was at the London 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. The Brits' debut LP Spice cruised to five weeks at No. In the clip below, Beckham also talks about the disappearance of her “boobs,” the tabloid fodder that was English soccer's WAGs (wives and girlfriends) era, and her MO to “empower women and I want to share my tips and tricks with women.” Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

But, no: The Chair Company was apparently HBO's most-watched comedy premiere in years. That's a lot of people feeling unpleasantly relatable feelings about falling in front of your co-workers, or doubling down on things you shouldn't, or your fear that other people will find out about the secret wheelbarrow you sometimes surreptitiously take outside. (This is also your reminder to go re-watch Detroiters.) The series' premiere has grown to ten million viewers, several weeks after the fact, and its penultimate installment, which aired with the Chair Company premiere, pulled in 4 million viewers in its first three days of availability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Al Pacino is mourning the loss of Diane Keaton, his longtime friend, co-star, and former partner. The Oscar-winning actor released an emotional statement to Deadline following Keaton's death on October 11, calling her “a wonder” and “a once-in-a-lifetime gift.” A post shared by Jeanne Bazelaire de Lesseux (@jeannebaze) “I am deeply saddened by Diane Keaton's passing,” Pacino said. He reflected on their bond, adding, “Though over thirty years have passed since we were together, the memories remain vivid, and with her passing, they have returned with a force that is both painful and moving.” In his emotional message, Pacino remembered Keaton as a woman who brought light and creativity to everything she touched. “She opened doors for others, inspired generations, and embodied a once-in-a-lifetime gift that radiated through her work and her life.” A post shared by Best of Al Pacino (@bestofpacino) She was unstoppable, resilient, and above all, deeply human.” He concluded his tribute with a poignant line: “I will always remember her. Their on-screen chemistry soon evolved into a real-life romance that spanned over a decade, marked by mutual admiration and deep affection. According to a Daily Mail source, Keaton's passing deeply affected Pacino. “She was his equal in every way,” another friend said. “They lived only a few miles apart in Beverly Hills, but they didn't need to talk,” an insider told People. Now 85, Pacino continues to honor the woman who changed his life both personally and professionally. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The legendary KISS guitarist died Thursday in New Jersey after complications from a recent fall. His family shared that he passed away surrounded by “loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers, and intentions.” Frehley, a founding member of KISS, helped form the iconic rock band in 1973 alongside Simmons, Stanley, and drummer Peter Criss. In a joint statement shared with The Hollywood Reporter, Stanley and Simmons reflected on Frehley's lasting impact and their grief over his passing. “He was an essential and irreplaceable rock soldier during some of the most formative foundational chapters of the band and its history. He is and will always be a part of KISS's legacy. My thoughts are with Jeanette, Monique, and all those who loved him, including our fans around the world.” Frehley played on KISS's first nine studio albums before leaving the band in 1982. He later reunited with the group for their 1998 reunion album “Psycho Circus” before parting ways again in 2002. Throughout his career, Frehley became one of the most influential guitarists in rock history. The band's explosive live performances, complete with pyrotechnics and larger-than-life theatrics, cemented their status as pioneers of arena rock. Outside of KISS, Frehley released nine solo studio albums, showcasing his musical versatility and continuing to inspire generations of rock musicians. Bruce Kulick, who performed with KISS from 1984 to 1996, also shared a heartfelt tribute on Instagram. It has deeply affected me as well,” Kulick wrote. His undeniable role in the creation and success of KISS cannot be forgotten. As fans and musicians continue to honor his legacy, Ace Frehley's music, charisma, and fearless creativity will remain an enduring part of rock history. I grew up listening to kiss as a young man and all i can say is wow what a great group I remember when Peter Chris died and now ACE is gone he will be missed R.I.P ACE Frehley. Who was the genius that labeled the picture of Kiss with Vinnie Vincent as “Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley of the rock and roll band “Kiss” performing onstage in circa 1977.” Vinnie Vincent was a member of Kiss for 15 months (1982-1984).
