                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 17, Issue 9 of Aging-US on September 8, 2025, titled, "Runx1 overexpression induces early onset of intervertebral disc degeneration." In this study, led by first author Takanori Fukunaga from Emory University School of Medicine and corresponding author Hicham Drissi from Emory and the Atlanta VA Medical Center, researchers found that the Runx1 gene, when overactive in spinal disc cells, can accelerate age-related degeneration of the intervertebral discs. The findings offer new insight into the genetic factors that drive disc aging and suggest possible directions for treating chronic back pain. Their deterioration is a major cause of lower back pain, especially with aging. At the center of each disc is the nucleus pulposus (NP), a gel-like core that contains proteins such as collagen and aggrecan, which help retain water and maintain structure. As people age, NP cells often lose their function, contributing to disc breakdown. Using a genetically modified mouse model, the researchers activated Runx1 specifically in NP cells. The overexpression of Runx1 led to the loss of healthy NP cells, an increase in abnormal cell types, and damage to disc structure. Levels of essential proteins like aggrecan and type II collagen decreased, while type X collagen increased, signaling unhealthy tissue changes. A key finding was that Runx1 overactivity did not kill cells directly. Instead, it caused premature cellular aging, known as senescence. Senescent cells lose the ability to repair tissue, creating an environment that accelerates degeneration. Markers of senescence were significantly elevated in the affected discs. This suggests that targeting Runx1 may be a promising strategy to prevent or slow disc aging. Overall, this study highlights the genetic and cellular processes that contribute to intervertebral disc degeneration, a leading cause of disability. By identifying Runx1 as a potential driver of early disc aging, the research opens new opportunities for intervention and treatment of degenerative spine conditions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treatment with osimertinib plus a platinum–pemetrexed chemotherapy combination resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-mutated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared to osimertinib alone. The finding is based on an analysis of the complete data from the phase 3 global FLAURA2 study, co-led by researchers from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Gustave Roussy (Grand Paris, Villejuif, France). Median overall survival was 47.5 months in the osimertinib plus platinum–pemetrexed group versus 37.6 months in the osimertinib monotherapy group. This is the longest overall survival in this patient population that we've seen in any clinical trial to date. It shows that combination therapies can lead to improvements over a single agent. This data helps establish osimertinib plus chemotherapy as standard of care first-line therapy." Dr. Pasi A. Jänne, ESMO presenter and co-principal investigator, director of the Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology at Dana-Farber Jänne presented data showing that the combination could benefit subgroups of patients with poor prognoses. For example, the group of patients with central nervous system metastases who received osimertinib plus platinum–pemetrexed had median overall survival of 40.9 months compared to 29.7 months for those who received osimertinib alone. Osimertinib is a third generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). "This is a very exciting development," says Jänne. I think there's opportunity to use this as a platform to develop additional combination therapies that enhance efficacy from the start of treatment." Side effects include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and bone marrow toxicities and are most pronounced during the first few months of treatment that includes platinum chemotherapy but lessen during maintenance therapy with osimertinib and pemetrexed. "There are now multiple options for patients with newly diagnosed EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer, including combination therapies and monotherapies, which is a wonderful thing," says Jänne. "Patients have choices, and shared decision-making with patients will be essential to balance the greatest survival benefit against potential side effects." Jänne, P. A., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Large language models (LLMs) can store and recall vast quantities of medical information, but their ability to process this information in rational ways remains variable. A new study led by investigators from Mass General Brigham demonstrated a vulnerability in that LLMs are designed to be sycophantic, or excessively helpful and agreeable, which leads them to overwhelmingly fail to appropriately challenge illogical medical queries despite possessing the information necessary to do so. Findings, published in npj Digital Medicine, demonstrate that targeted training and fine-tuning can improve LLMs' abilities to respond to illogical prompts accurately. As a community, we need to work on training both patients and clinicians to be safe users of LLMs, and a key part of that is going to be bringing to the surface the types of errors that these models make. These models do not reason like humans do, and this study shows how LLMs designed for general uses tend to prioritize helpfulness over critical thinking in their responses. In healthcare, we need a much greater emphasis on harmlessness even if it comes at the expense of helpfulness." Danielle Bitterman, MD, corresponding author, faculty member in the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Program and Clinical Lead for Data Science/AI at Mass General Brigham Researchers used a series of simple queries about drug safety to assess the logical reasoning capabilities of five advanced LLMs: three GPT models by OpenAI and two Llama models by Meta. After confirming that the models could always match identical drugs, they fed 50 "illogical" queries to each LLM. For example, they used prompts such as, "Tylenol was found to have new side effects. The researchers chose this approach because it allowed for large-scale, controlled investigation of potentially harmful sycophantic behavior. The lowest rate (42%) was found in a Llama model designed to withhold from providing medical advice. Doing both yielded the greatest change to model behavior, with GPT models rejecting requests to generate misinformation and correctly supplying the reason for rejection in 94% of cases. Llama models similarly improved, though one model sometimes rejected prompts without proper explanations. This was not the case, with the models continuing to perform well on 10 general and biomedical knowledge benchmarks, such as medical board exams. The researchers emphasize that while fine-tuning LLMs shows promise in improving logical reasoning, it is challenging to account for every embedded characteristic - such as sycophancy - that might lead to illogical outputs. "It's very hard to align a model to every type of user," said first author Shan Chen, MS, of Mass General Brigham's AIM Program. These 'last-mile' alignments really matter, especially in high-stakes environments like medicine."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new review published in the Journal of Intensive Medicine on 25 July, 2025 and led by Dr. Alice Jacquens and Dr. Clara Perrault from Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France, sheds light on an under-recognized complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI): post-traumatic vasospasm (PTV). PTV is a sudden narrowing of brain arteries that can lead to stroke and long-term neurological damage. It may affect up to 60% of TBI patients but is often missed, especially in intensive care units where patients are sedated or in a coma. Unlike vasospasm after brain aneurysms, PTV occurs earlier, resolves faster, and may follow various patterns depending on the type of trauma. The review summarizes current knowledge on PTV's causes, detection, and treatments. Key tools like transcranial Doppler ultrasound and S100 protein blood tests can help with early diagnosis. The authors call for systematic monitoring of vasospasm after TBI and propose a classification of PTV based on trauma type. They also explore specific biological mechanisms involving inflammation, blood degradation products, and vasoconstrictors like endothelin-1. "Post-traumatic vasospasm is often silent but dangerous," says Dr. Jacquens. "Recognizing it early can help prevent secondary brain injury." With millions of TBIs occurring each year, this work highlights the urgent need for greater clinical awareness and focused research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom this week signed a suite of privacy protection bills for transgender patients amid continuing threats by the Trump administration. But there was one glaring omission that LGBTQ+ advocates and political strategists say is part of an increasingly complex dance the Democrat faces as he curates a more centrist profile for a potential presidential bid. The proposal was a top priority for trans rights leaders, who said it was crucial to preserve care as clinics close or limit gender-affirming services under White House pressure. Political experts say Newsom's veto highlights how charged trans care has become for Democrats nationally and, in particular, for Newsom, who as San Francisco mayor engaged in civil disobedience by allowing gay couples to marry at City Hall. "Even if there were no political motivations whatsoever under Newsom's decision, there are certainly political ramifications of which he is very aware," said Dan Schnur, a former GOP political strategist who is now a politics lecturer at the University of California-Berkeley. Earlier this year on Newsom's podcast, the governor told the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk that trans athletes competing in women's sports was "deeply unfair," triggering a backlash among his party's base and LGBTQ+ leaders. And he has described trans issues as a "major problem for the Democratic Party," saying Donald Trump's trans-focused campaign ads were "devastating" for his party in 2024. Caroline Menjivar, the state senator who introduced the measure, described her bill as "the most tangible and effective" measure this year to help trans people at a time when they are being singled out for what she described as "targeted discrimination." In a veto message on the California bill, Newsom cited its potential to drive up health care costs, impacts that an independent analysis found would be negligible. "At a time when individuals are facing double-digit rate increases in their health care premiums across the nation, we must take great care to not enact policies that further drive up the cost of health care, no matter how well-intended," Newsom wrote. Under the Trump administration, federal agencies have been directed to limit access to gender-affirming care for children, which Trump has referred to as "chemical and surgical mutilation," and demanded documents from or threatened investigations of institutions that provide it. In recent months, Stanford Medicine, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, and Kaiser Permanente have reduced or eliminated gender-affirming care for patients under 19, a sign of the chilling effect Trump's executive orders have had on health care, even in one of the nation's most progressive states. California already mandates wide coverage of gender-affirming health care, including hormone therapy, but pharmacists can currently dispense only a 90-day supply. Luke Healy, who told legislators at an April hearing that he was "a 24-year-old detransitioner" and no longer believed he was a woman, criticized the attempt to increase coverage of services he thought were "irreversibly harmful" to him. "I believe that bills like this are forcing doctors to turn healthy bodies into perpetual medical problems in the name of an ideology," Healy testified. The California Association of Health Plans opposed the bill over provisions that would limit the use of certain practices such as prior authorization and step therapy, which require insurer approval before care is provided and force patients and doctors to try other therapies first. "These safeguards are essential for applying evidence-based prescribing standards and responsibly managing costs — ensuring patients receive appropriate care while keeping premiums in check," said spokesperson Mary Ellen Grant. An analysis by the California Health Benefits Review Program, which independently reviews bills relating to health insurance, concluded that annual premium increases resulting from the bill's implementation would be negligible and that "no long-term impacts on utilization or cost" were expected. Following the podcast interview with Kirk, Cuellar said, advocacy groups backing SB 418 grew concerned about a potential veto and made a point to highlight voices of other patients who would benefit, including menopausal women and cancer patients. It was a starkly different strategy than what they might have done before Trump took office. "Had we run this bill in 2022-2023, the messaging would have been totally different," said another proponent who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Advocates for trans rights were so wary of the current political climate that some also felt the need to steer clear of promoting a separate bill that would have expanded coverage of hormone therapy and other treatments for menopause and perimenopause. That bill, authored by Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, who has spoken movingly about her struggles with health care for perimenopause, was also vetoed. In the meantime, said Jovan Wolf, a trans man and military veteran, patients like him will be left to suffer. Wolf, who had taken testosterone for more than 15 years, tried to restart hormone therapy in March, following a two-year hiatus in which he contemplated having children. Doctors at the Department of Veterans Affairs told him it was too late. Days earlier, the Trump administration had announced it would phase out hormone therapy and other treatments for gender dysphoria.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This expansion increases the project budget to €30 million and reinforces VICT3R's mission to transform the way safety is assessed in drug and chemical development, reducing reliance on laboratory animals. New beneficiaries include leading industrial partners such as Servier Group and Zoetis Belgium SA. Servier is an independent international pharmaceutical group governed by a foundation, committed to therapeutic innovation, while Zoetis is the world's leading animal health company. In addition, the project welcomes CAATevents gGmbH, an SME established in Germany as a non-profit organisation to support CAAT-US and CAAT-Europe, which focus on the development and validation of alternatives to animal testing. With this expansion, the total project budget has increased to €30 million. Other organizations have formally joined the VICT3R community by signing associated CRO agreements: Charles River Laboratories International Inc., a leading global provider of solutions for drug discovery, development and manufacturing; Scantox A/S, a contract preclinical research organisation supporting pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies in drug development; and Labcorp, a global leader in innovative and comprehensive laboratory services. Frank Bringezu (Merck Healthcare KGaA, Germany), VICT3R Co Lead: "With these new partners, the project substantially increases its impact and positions the VICT3R consortium at the forefront of transformative advancements in animal reduction, replacement and refinement." VICT3R (Developing and Implementing Virtual Control Groups to Reduce Animal Use in Toxicology Research) is a public-private partnership funded by the Innovative Health Initiative (IHI JU). The 3.5-year project, led by Pompeu Fabra University (Barcelona, Spain) and Bayer AG (Berlin, Germany), launched in September 2024, aims to reduce the use of animals in safety testing by replacing traditional control groups of live animals with Virtual Control Groups (VCGs) − statistically robust alternatives generated from historical study data, advanced statistics, and artificial intelligence. In non-clinical safety studies, animals are often used as untreated controls for comparison purposes, with experiments typically including three treatment groups and one control group. VICT3R's goal is to replace these control animals with virtual equivalents, thereby reducing the overall number of animals required − by up to 25% in some cases − while maintaining scientific rigor and regulatory acceptance. By building a shared database of high-quality historical control data and working in close collaboration with regulators, contract research organisations, and industry, VICT3R is laying the foundation for a more ethical, efficient, and sustainable approach to toxicology. Inari Soininen (SYNAPSE Research Management Partners S.L., Spain), VICT3R Project Manager: "The VCG concept is more than a technological advance – it represents a shift toward a more ethical and sustainable approach to safety testing, benefiting both the research community and society at large."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many years, the Indian Health Service (IHS) has been underfunded, leading to health and life expectancy disparities among Indigenous people, according to University of Oklahoma researchers. In a newly published article in Health Affairs, OU researchers propose a novel trust fund solution to increase and sustain the funding level, with the ultimate goal of improving health care access and outcomes. IHS underfunding has been a challenge for tribal nations and the United States, and it is highly relevant to Oklahoma, which was partly founded on Indian Territory. Junying (June) Zhao, Ph.D., Ph.D., MPH, lead author, assistant professor, OU Hudson College of Public Health "In fiscal year 2021, per capita federal spending for the IHS was $4,140. For the IHS, this has meant staff shortages, outdated facilities and care that is declined or deferred." To raise funding, Zhao and her research team propose the creation of an IHS Trust Fund, modeled after the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. In the late 1980s, Congress made a one-time appropriation to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund, which has since collected excise taxes on vaccine sales and invested its balances. As of January 2023, the fund held over $4 billion, which is used to pay for injury claims. An IHS Trust Fund would operate similarly to generate ongoing financial resources for unmet Indigenous health care needs. From fiscal years 2009 to 2020, the IHS was underfunded by about $60 million annually, Zhao said. To generate a $60 million annual return, about $600 million would be needed for the baseline principal, assuming a modest 10% return rate on investments. Accounting for inflation, that number would be close to $1 billion today, she said. Although government programs typically cannot accept gifts, Zhao believes that some entities and individuals have shown the ability and desire to contribute. "This approach is similar to endowments created by major universities for their capital projects," said Pallab Ghosh, Ph.D., an associate professor in OU's Department of Economics and co-author of the paper. Past efforts to address the underfunding problem have fallen short. Members of Congress have twice proposed transforming IHS funding from discretionary to mandatory. Other ideas, such as creating a unique Medicaid program for individual tribes, have also failed to gain support. "Since the late 18th century, the United States has had a trust responsibility to provide care in exchange for tribal lands," said study co-author Rashmi Jaggad, MPH, MDS, research project coordinator in the OU Hudson College of Public Health. "But when funding is low, health care access decreases. If people cannot afford services in private care, they often must go without. That is the problem we are seeking to solve." Zhao and her team have a long history of conducting research involving underserved populations. "At the OU Hudson College of Public Health, we are committed to research that addresses real-world inequities and improves the health of all communities," Bratzler said. "This work reflects that mission by offering a creative, evidence-based solution to a longstanding issue that has impacted Indigenous people for generations." Zhao, J., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A landmark international study led by the University of Zurich has shown that artificial intelligence can assess patient risk for the most common type of heart attack more accurately than existing methods. This could enable doctors to guide more personalized treatment decisions for patients. Doctors caring for patients with the most common form of heart attack – the so-called non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) – have so far relied on a standardized scoring system. This score is widely used and increasingly integrated into international clinical guidelines. However, it has long been recognized that existing tools cannot always capture the full complexity of these patients. A new study published in The Lancet Digital Health now suggests that many patients may need to be re-classified, with important implications for how heart attacks are treated worldwide. In the largest study on risk modeling in NSTE-ACS to date, an international research team led by the University of Zurich (UZH) analyzed health data from more than 600,000 patients across 10 countries. They used artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze clinical trial data from the landmark VERDICT trial and taught the model to recognize which patients benefit most from early invasive treatment, including angiography and stenting. While some patients gained substantial benefit from early intervention, others showed little or no benefit," says first author Florian A. Wenzl from UZH's Center for Molecular Cardiology, who also conducts research at the National Health Service in the UK. A major re-stratification of patient care – one that assesses the individual benefit of established treatment strategies – may therefore be necessary in hospitals worldwide. According to Wenzl, the study illustrates how AI could transform the treatment of heart attacks: "By re-analyzing clinical trial data, our model GRACE 3.0 learned who actually benefits from early invasive treatment – and who does not. This may imply a shift in how we should be managing these patients." "This could reshape future clinical guidelines and help to save lives," Lüscher adds. The researchers hope that the new GRACE 3.0 score provides doctors in routine clinical practice with a simple, validated and AI-powered tool to deliver more personalized and effective care for heart attack patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A long-term high-fat diet (HFD) exerts lipotoxic effects on multiple organs, particularly the liver, leading to metabolic diseases. This study aimed to delineate the dynamic effects of HFD on lipid metabolism, elucidate the mechanisms underlying hepatic lipotoxicity, and investigate the protective effects of Ganoderma lucidum against lipotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were fed either a 45% or 60% HFD, followed by measurements of body composition, serum lipid profile, and liver pathology at four, eight, twelve, and sixteen weeks. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n = 12 per group): normal diet, 45% HFD, and two HFD + Ganoderma lucidum water extract (GLE) groups (1 g/kg/d and 2 g/kg/d of crude drug, orally administered by gavage for eight weeks following a four-week HFD induction). Body weight, body fat, serum lipids, and hepatic steatosis increased progressively, accompanied by impaired glucose tolerance and liver injury, as indicated by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels. Similarly, ER-phagy selective receptors, particularly FAM134B, which is primarily expressed in hepatocytes as shown by single-cell sequencing, were upregulated after 16 weeks of HFD feeding. Furthermore, GLE mitigated palmitic acid-induced lipotoxicity in primary hepatocytes, as evidenced by improved cell viability, reduced ALT, AST, and lactate dehydrogenase levels in the culture supernatant, and decreased transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cell counts. In 45% HFD-fed mice, GLE reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and hepatic triglyceride levels. HFD-induced lipotoxicity causes hepatic tissue injury and inflammatory responses, which may be alleviated by coordinated regulation of compensatory UPR and ER-phagy. Ganoderma lucidum shows promise as a dietary supplement for managing metabolic disorders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The reasons for this have not yet been fully clarified. One potential factor is sex-specific differences in the blood-brain barrier. Together they are conducting research in the project "Leaky blood-brain barrier in major depressive disorder", funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF and the German Research Foundation. A particular focus here is on sex-specific differences. Kerstin Lenk and her team uses this experimental data to create digital twins of astrocytes, endothelial cells and the blood-brain barrier in order to investigate the diffusion of messenger substances between the cells involved in more detail in simulations. With our research, we want to contribute to a better understanding of both the development of depressive disorders and the different courses of the disease in women and men. This knowledge opens up new possibilities for more targeted therapies." Kerstin Lenk, Institute of Neural Engineering at TU Graz The research work in Graz and Regensburg is part of a larger movement in neuroscientific research that is systematically focusing on biological sex differences. Kerstin Lenk recently co-authored a review article with international colleagues in the journal Nature Reviews Bioengineering entitled "Modelling sex differences of neurological disorders in vitro", which highlights the many ways in which biological sex can be taken into account in research into neurological diseases. In vitro models such as artificially produced stem cells, 3D organoids or organ-on-a-chip systems offer new options to map these differences and thus improve the transferability of research results into clinical practice. These models are increasingly being supplemented by the use of computer simulations and artificial intelligence. Modelling sex differences of neurological disorders in vitro.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have discovered a previously unknown mechanism that explains how bacteria can drive treatment resistance in patients with oral and colorectal cancer. Tumor-infiltrating bacteria have been known to impact cancer progression and treatment, but very little is understood about how they do this. The new study shows how certain bacteria – particularly Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) – can induce a reversible state, known as quiescence, in cancer epithelial cells. This allows tumors to evade the immune system and resist chemotherapy. These bacteria-tumor interactions have been hiding in plain sight, and with new technologies we can now see how microbes directly affect cancer cells, shape tumor behavior and blunt the effects of treatment. The study describes how a bacterium can enter tumors and surround tumor epithelial cells, effectively cutting off their communication with surrounding cells and causing the cancer cells to enter a temporary resting state known as quiescence. This, in turn, allows them to evade the immune system, resist chemotherapy and promote metastasis. Researchers discovered this ability when they first noticed that Fusobacterium is enriched in areas of the tumor with reduced epithelial cell density and decreased transcription activity. Preclinical models showed that Fusobacterium accumulates in specific parts of the tumor, settling between cancer cells, interfering with them, and making them less vulnerable to certain chemotherapies. In an independent patient cohort, higher levels of this bacterium were associated with lower expression of genes that allow for immune detection and with reduced treatment response. At MD Anderson, the Bullman and Johnston labs are uncovering how microbes like Fn influence treatment resistance and tumor progression in gastrointestinal cancers. This lays the groundwork for new strategies to counteract microbial effects on cancer. In parallel, their teams also are exploring ways to engineer tumor-targeting bacteria as a future therapeutic tool. This approach, sometimes called using "bugs as drugs", offers a promising way to overcome the barriers posed by solid tumors, which often are resistant to traditional therapies. This highlights the need for further research to better understand these interactions in vivo. Tumor-infiltrating bacteria disrupt cancer epithelial cell interactions and induce cell-cycle arrest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Led by researchers from NYU Langone Health, the study featured a smartphone-based app that guides patients with migraine through progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), an evidence-based treatment for migraine in which patients tense and then relax one muscle group at a time. Published online October 16 in JAMA Network Open, the work shows that the percentage of patients who had at least a five-point improvement in a standard score of migraine-driven disability nearly doubled for those who used the app versus those who did not. The study used the Migraine Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS), a questionnaire that asks about the number of days over three months that migraine caused a person to miss work, school, or social events. Our findings highlight the potential of smartphone-based interventions to empower patients in managing their own migraine, and in reducing migraine-related disability without medication." Mia T. Minen, MD, MPH, lead study author, associate professor in the Departments of Neurology and Population Health, NYU Grossman School of Medicine It affects more than 14 percent of people globally and is a frequent cause of repeated emergency department (ED) visits, say the study authors. "The RELAXaHEAD app is meant to reduce migraine disability and hopefully reduce the rate at which patients return to the emergency department for migraine," added Dr. Minen, director of headache research at NYU Langone. This clinical trial involved 69 participants aged 18 to 65 who visited NYU Langone Health's EDs for migraine between 2019 and 2021. Participants were randomly assigned to use either the RELAXaHEAD app with progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) or to be in a control group that used only a headache diary. The number of study patients who had at least a five-point improvement in MIDAS score was 45.7 percent among those without the PMR and 82.4 percent with PMR. The research team also found that those who used PMR more frequently experienced better outcomes, suggesting a dose-response relationship. Moving forward, her team is conducting a large-scale clinical study funded by the National Institutes of Health to evaluate the study app for people with migraine, not in EDs but instead in primary care settings, where such patients most often present for care. This research was supported by National Institutes of Health grants NCCIH K23 AT009706 and NIH NCATS UL1 TR001445. These interests could benefit from the outcome of this study and are managed according to the policies of NYU Langone Health.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's largest-ever clinical trial of treatments to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's disease has launched, led by researchers at UCL and Newcastle University. By testing more drugs more efficiently than ever before, the trial could take up to three years off the time needed to test a drug candidate. The trial team is recruiting up to 1,600 participants in its first phase from more than 40 hospitals across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The trial is now underway, as participants are already being recruited at the London (UCLH) and Newcastle (Clinical Ageing Research Unit) sites, with the other trial sites to get underway between now and next April. People with Parkinson's can register their interest in participating using a simple online form. Parkinson's gets progressively worse and although there are treatments that can help with symptoms, these become less effective over time, so there is an urgent need to find treatments that can slow or stop the disease progression. The Edmond J Safra Accelerating Clinical Trials in Parkinson's Disease (EJS ACT-PD) trial is sponsored by UCL and funded by a Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) partnership, Cure Parkinson's, The Michael J. Co-chief investigator Professor Thomas Foltynie of the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, and consultant neurologist at UCLH's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN), said: "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide, and yet there are no treatments that can slow its relentless progression. We are prioritising drugs that already show promise as potential treatments, based on an extensive review of prior evidence, as we seek to identify a drug that does more than just provide symptom relief for Parkinson's. We hope this trial will serve as a blueprint for future trials in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative conditions. "Our trial's wide UK coverage ends the postcode lottery for clinical research, so that underserved populations with Parkinson's can participate in this highly inclusive trial." Our innovative trial design will enable us to accelerate the hunt for an effective treatment in a giant step forward for Parkinson's research, as we will be trialling multiple drugs simultaneously, adapting as we go along based on what we're learning. It's a real group effort, and we are particularly grateful to the people with Parkinson's and care partners who are making invaluable contributions to this research. With their input we have designed a trial that we hope will be available and accessible to people with Parkinson's across the UK." Initially, the trial will be testing two drugs known to be safe and effective at treating other conditions: a blood pressure medication and a drug used to treat an enlarged prostate. The first participant to be recruited into the trial at UCLH's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Graham Edwins, commented: "I wanted to be part of EJS ACT-PD because of the pioneering approach to test multiple medications in a single trial. Having Parkinson's, especially young onset, your choices are denial, acceptance or to fight back, which is what I feel I am doing by taking part. Even if I don't directly benefit, if I can help progress a potential treatment or cure for the next person diagnosed in their prime then it's a job well done." By analysing results on an ongoing basis, ineffective treatments can be identified and dropped from the trial, with more promising drugs progressing. The current standard clinical trials process is hugely time and resource consuming and stop-start in nature, taking up to 10 years for a single potential treatment to complete assessment. Dr Kevin McFarthing, chair of the trial's patient and public inclusion and engagement working group, commented: "By accelerating clinical research, this trial means that drugs that slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's are coming closer for people like me and for generations to come. Fox Foundation are assessing whether wearable technologies could be used to digitally monitor symptoms, and to search for specific and sensitive molecular signatures of Parkinson's in samples from participants. Professor Sonia Gandhi (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and The Francis Crick Institute), who is co-leading the EJS ACT-PD trial innovation programme, said: "This research will tell us which drugs might be effective, but critically why and how a drug may be working, and who may respond to it - it will change the way we monitor Parkinson's in future trials." The trial will begin by testing two repurposed drugs: telmisartan, a medication for high blood pressure, and terazosin, most commonly used to treat an enlarged prostate. The scientists aim to add a third drug, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), currently used for liver disease, in 2026. The trial will recruit people with Parkinson's who were diagnosed aged 30 or older, are taking dopaminergic treatment, and who have not had deep brain stimulation surgery nor infusion treatments. Eligible participants, once they start taking medication, will be invited to study visits, either in-person or remotely, every six months for up to three years. Trial medication will be delivered to participants' homes to reduce travel burden, particularly for those living in rural areas or with mobility issues. People with Parkinson's, their partners and carers, and community representatives have had a major impact on the resulting trial, including using a hybrid delivery approach in which participants can choose to attend study visits either in-person or from home, and assessing results based on a participant's own report of how Parkinson's affects them.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dengue has been a public health problem in the tropical world for decades and 2024 saw a global dengue surge, with more than 14 million cases and 10 thousand deaths reported worldwide – more than more double the figures for dengue epidemics previously recorded in 2023 and 2019. According to the authors, the study findings "suggest that Wolbachia prevented at least three-quarters of the dengue case burden that may have otherwise occurred in Niterói in 2024, corresponding to thousands of cases averted." The study, led by the World Mosquito Program and researchers at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and published in the journal Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases, involved the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the wMel-strain Wolbachia bacteria throughout Niterói, a city of half a million people in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. Associate Professor Katherine Anders from Monash University and Professor Luciano Moreira, from the World Mosquito Program and now CEO of Wolbito do Brasil, led the study evaluating the long-term public health impact of the Wolbachia deployments in Niterói. Of particular significance was the finding that dengue incidence Niterói in 2024 – which was a period of record high incidence of the disease in Brazil – was 374 per 100,000 population, substantially lower than overall in Rio de Janeiro state (1884 per 100,000) and nationwide in Brazil (3157 per 100,000). According to Associate Professor Anders, the study adds to the accumulating evidence that successful introduction of Wolbachia into mosquito populations is a sustainable intervention that provides ongoing protection to communities. This sets it apart from traditional ways of controlling the mosquitoes that transmit dengue – such as the use of insecticide, which has led to resistance and is challenging to deliver in complex urban environments. In July, Brazil has unveiled the world's largest biofactory, Wolbito do Brasil, located in Curibita, dedicated to breeding mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria, described by Professor Moreira as "an innovative method poised to safeguard an estimated 140 million people from dengue fever across the nation in the coming years."
