Wednesday: Which ATP Player on the bubble is most likely to qualify for Turin? Last up: Which tour finals will have the more exciting field? The WTA has had four different major singles winners this season in Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff, Iga Swiatek, and Madison Keys and all four have played impressively throughout the year as well. Resurgent two-time major finalist Amanda Anisimova has played inspired tennis to qualify for her first Final. Add to the mix Jessica Pegula who is playing clutch tennis and in good position to be part of the WTA Finals for a fourth consecutive year, and possibly Elena Rybakina or Jasmine Paolini, who are on the bubble along with teenager Mirra Andreeva. It's a fact that sets the WTA apart and I'm looking to seeing how it all unfolds.PAUL ANNACONEThey are both electric, but when you think of four Americans all qualifying for the WTA Finals, that is huge. They are both electric, but when you think of four Americans all qualifying for the WTA Finals, that is huge. Two American men likely to reach the ATP Finals for the first time since 2006 and four American women are likely to reach the WTA Finals for the first time since 2002, fans get a mix of old glory and new hope! There's lots to be excited about for both tours.BRETT HABERI'm excited about both, but I have to say I'm very jazzed about the WTA Finals field, and that's mainly because four of the eight singles players are likely to be American: Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Jessica Pegula, and Madison Keys. And that all goes without mentioning world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka duking it out against a reinvigorated Iga Swiatak. As long as both of them are in the draw and can continue their rivalry‚Äîon Sinner's home terra firma no less‚ÄîI'll cast my vote with the ATP Finals.

Leylah Fernandez overcame a late first-set deficit to defeat Rebecca Sramkova 7-6 (2), 6-3 in 1 hour and 34 minutes on Friday at the Kinoshita Group Japan Open in Osaka, advancing to the semifinals. 4 seed trailed by a break late in the first set but broke back to force a tiebreak, which she won decisively. She fell behind again early in the second set, down 2-0, but responded by winning four straight games to take control. Fernandez will face Sorana Cirstea, who ended Viktorija Golubic's seven-match winning streak 6-2, 2-6, 6-2, for a spot in the final. Serving showcase: Fernandez won just three more total points than Sramkova (52-49), with both players refusing to give up many points on serve, especially in the first set. Fernandez saved a break point in the opening game and didn't face another until 5-5. She'd go on to face only one more break point in the second set. Fast starts fuel success: Fernandez has now won the opening set in five of her past six matches, including all three in Osaka. She's 23-3 record this season when winning the first set, closing out 21 of those victories in straight sets. On Friday, Sramkova again threatened a comeback, saving three match points while trailing 5-3 in the second set, but Fernandez sealed the win with one final break.
