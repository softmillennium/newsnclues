                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. Ed Cox, Chairman of the New York Republican State Committee, speaks to reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday, Jan. 6, 2016, in Albany, N.Y. (AP Photo/Mike Groll, File) ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York's Republican State Committee on Friday suspended a Young Republican organization following the release of a group chat that included jokes about rape and flippant commentary on gas chambers. In a statement, New York's Republican committee said its leaders had voted unanimously to suspend the authorization of the New York State Young Republicans to operate at a statewide level. The statewide Republican committee said the Young Republican group could be reconstituted at a later date. “The Young Republicans was already grossly mismanaged, and vile language of the sort made in the group chat has no place in our party or its subsidiary organizations,” said NYGOP Chair Ed Cox. The decision came days after Politico released exchanges from a Telegram conversation between leaders and members of the Young Republican National Federation and some of its affiliates in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont. The messages have drawn heavy criticism from Republicans and Democrats. The Young Republican National Federation, which is the GOP's political organization for Republicans between 18 and 40, has said it was “appalled” by the messages. U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican who is eyeing a run for governor next year, has called for those involved to step down.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is set to host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks at the White House on Friday, with the U.S. leader signaling he's not ready to agree to sell Kyiv a long-range missile system that the Ukrainians say they desperately need. Zelenskyy gets his one-on-one with Trump a day after the U.S. president and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a lengthy phone call to discuss the conflict. In recent days, Trump had shown an openness to selling Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, even as Putin warned that such a move would further strain the U.S.-Russian relationship.But following Thursday's call with Putin, Trump appeared to downplay the prospects of Ukraine getting the missiles, which have a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers.) As of midday, 11 people have been arrested outside the Broadview facility. Law enforcement is urging demonstrators to stay in designated “protest zones.” Illinois State Police said some protesters blocked a street outside the facility Friday and ignored requests to move to the designated protest area. Kat Abughazaleh, a protester and congressional candidate, expressed outrage. Abughazaleh said she was hit in the face with a baton Friday and saw a woman pushed to the ground by officers. Trump said the new 100% tariff he's threatened on Chinese goods is “not sustainable,” in an interview with Fox News that aired Friday. The president said he was “forced” to consider the high tariff because of China's new export controls on rare earths, used in products from smartphones to jet planes. Trump said he hopes to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on an upcoming Asia trip, and played down further tensions with China. “I think we're going to do fine with China,” Trump said. Trump also blamed former President Richard Nixon for opening the floodgate to doing business with China. Trump, after his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, appeared to throw cold water on the possibility of sending Ukraine the long-range missile system. Although such a sale would be a splashy move, it could take years to provide the equipment and training necessary for Ukraine to use Tomahawks, said Mark Montgomery, an analyst at the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. Montgomery said Ukraine could be better served in the near term with a surge of Extended Range Attack Munition, or ERAM, missiles and Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS. The Tomahawk, with a range of about 995 miles (1,600 kilometers), would allow Ukraine to strike far deeper in Russian territory than either the ERAM (about 285 miles, or 460 km) or ATACMS (about 186 miles, or 300 kilometers). Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton, left, departs following his arraignment at the Greenbelt Federal Courthouse in Greenbelt, Md., Friday, Oct. 17, 2025. Bolton was ordered released from custody after making his appearance before a judge in the third Justice Department case brought in recent weeks against an adversary of the Republican president. Nine people were arrested Friday morning during protests at the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, where tense demonstrations have taken place for weeks outside an ICE facility. Federal agents have previously used tear gas and other chemical agents on protesters and journalists in the area, leading to a lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters. One person was arrested for obstructing or resisting officers while the others were still pending charges Friday morning, according to the Cook County Sheriff's office. One of the officials said the strike, conducted on what is believed to be a semi-submersible or submersible vessel, killed at least one person and left behind at least two survivors. The investigation appears to have followed a more conventional path toward indictment than other recent cases against perceived Trump enemies, who were charged by Trump's hand-picked U.S. attorney in Virginia over the concerns of career prosecutors. He was ordered released from custody after making his court appearance. The U.S. has blocked a global fee on shipping emissions as an international maritime meeting ended Friday without adopting new regulations. On Thursday, Trump urged countries to vote against the regulations. The International Maritime Organization adjourned its meeting Friday. The proposed regulations would have set a marine fuel standard and imposed fees for emissions above allowable limits. Shipping emissions have grown to about 3% of the global total, prompting calls for action. With a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas continuing to hold, Trump says he's optimistic that more Middle East and Muslim countries will move to normalize relations with Israel. The United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco forged diplomatic and commercial ties with Israel through Trump's first-term effort dubbed the Abraham Accords. Trump now wants to quickly build on that effort and believes that Saudi Arabia—the region's biggest economic power—could now be amenable. Trump in an interview with Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures added that Israel and U.S. strikes earlier this year that set back Iran's nuclear program could also inform Riyadh's calculations about joining the accords. “I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in,” Trump said. Bolton did not comment to reporters as he entered the courthouse in Greenbelt, Maryland, where he is expected to make an initial appearance before a judge on the 18-count indictment brought against him on Thursday. Former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton, arrives for his arraignment at the Greenbelt Federal Courthouse in Greenbelt, Md., Friday, Oct. 17, 2025. John Bolton has arrived at a federal courthouse to surrender to authorities on charges accusing him of sharing classified information. The former Trump administration national security adviser is accused of storing top secret records at home and sharing with relatives diary-like notes that contained classified information. A new AP-NORC poll finds that more U.S. adults support Trump's handling of the conflict in Israel after he brokered a ceasefire deal in Gaza, but his approval ratings on domestic issues remain weak. Even some of those who voted for him believe he needs to do more to address issues such as the economy, health care and immigration. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of the way Trump is handling his job overall, unchanged from September. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has celebrated his country's role as the host for upcoming talks between Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin. Trump said Thursday the meeting would take place in about two weeks. Orbán, a close ally of Trump and Putin, suggested Hungary's opposition to Western military aid to Ukraine influenced the decision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addresses a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025 (AP Photo/Omar Havana) WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States took survivors into custody after its military struck a suspected drug-carrying vessel in the Caribbean — the first attack that anyone escaped alive since President Donald Trump began launching deadly attacks in the region last month, a defense official and another person familiar with the matter said Friday. Trump later confirmed the attack. “We attacked a submarine, and that was a drug-carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs” Trump said while hosting the Ukrainian president at the White House. Secretary of State Rubio did not dispute that there were survivors, but he repeatedly said details would be forthcoming. It is believed to be at least the sixth strike in the waters off Venezuela since early September, and the first to result in survivors who were picked up by the U.S. military. It was not immediately clear what would be done with the survivors, who the people said were being held on a U.S. Navy vessel. Trump has justified the strikes by asserting that the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” with drug cartels, relying on the same legal authority used by the Bush administration when it declared a war on terror after the Sept. 11 attacks. The president's use of overwhelming military force to combat the cartels, along with his authorization of covert action inside Venezuela, possibly to oust President Nicolás Maduro, stretches the bounds of international law, legal scholars said this week. They now face an unclear future and legal landscape, including questions about whether they are now considered to be prisoners of war or defendants in a criminal case. Reuters was first to report news of the strike late Thursday. The strikes in the Caribbean have caused unease among both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, with some Republicans saying they have not received sufficient information on how the strikes are being conducted. A classified briefing for senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month did not include representatives from intelligence agencies or the military command structure for South and Central America. However, most Senate Republicans stood behind the administration last week when a vote on a War Powers Resolution was brought up, which would have required the administration to gain approval from Congress before conducting more strikes. Their willingness to back the administration will be tested again. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with Sens. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, and Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, is bringing another resolution that would prevent Trump from outright attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military is holding two survivors on a Navy ship after the US carried out a Thursday strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean, according to three US officials. The strike, which has not been publicly acknowledged by the Trump administration, was the sixth known strike on an boat allegedly involved in drug trafficking. But it appeared to mark the first time an attack had not killed everyone on board. US Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the region, referred CNN to the White House for comment. Asked about what happened to the survivors of the strike during an event at the White House Friday, President Donald Trump did not address the status of the detainees but said that US forces had “attacked a submarine, and that was a drug carrying submarine built specifically for the transportation of massive amounts of drugs.” “Just so you understand this was not an innocent group of people,” he said. “I don't know too many people that have submarines, and that was an attack on a drug carrying loaded up submarine.” It's unclear under what legal authority the US military can hold the men, said Brian Finucane, a former State Department lawyer who specializes in war powers issues. Congress, which maintains broad authority under Article I of the Constitution to declare war, has not authorized an armed conflict against drug traffickers. The Bush administration was ultimately able to rely on a 2001 congressional authorization that deemed the United States to be at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates to hold military detainees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dee Cahill of Margate, Fla., holds a “No Kings” sign as she participates in a pro-democracy, anti-Trump protest outside Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla., Thursday, July 17, 2025. Big crowds of protesters are expected Saturday in thousands of places around the U.S. in opposition to what some are characterizing as increasingly authoritarian practices by President Donald Trump. Some conservative politicians have condemned the protests as “Hate America” rallies, while others say that it represents a “patriotic” fight for First Amendment rights. Ezra Levin, a leading organizer of Saturday's protests, said the demonstrations are a response to what he called Trump's “crackdown on First Amendment rights.” Levin, the co-executive director of the nonprofit Indivisible, pointed to Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his unprecedented promises to use federal power to influence midterm elections, restrictions on press freedom and retribution against political opponents. He said those steps cumulatively represented a direct threat to constitutionally protected rights. Protests are planned for more than 2,500 locations nationwide — from the country's largest city, New York, to small unincorporated, rural communities like East Glacier Ridge, Montana, with roughly 300 residents. Organizers will consider the day a success, Levin said, if people are galvanized to become more politically involved on an ongoing basis. The last “No Kings” protest took place on June 14 in thousands of cities and towns across the country, in large part to protest a military parade in Washington that marked the Army's 250th anniversary and coincided with Trump's birthday. “No Kings” organizers at the time called the parade “coronation” that was symbolic of what they characterized as Trump's growing authoritarian overreach. Police in Los Angeles, where protests over federal immigration enforcement raids erupted the week prior and sparked demonstrations across the country, used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the formal event ended. Officers in Portland also fired tear gas and projectiles to disperse a crowd that protested in front of a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building well into the evening. One protester was killed during the Salt Lake City march in June. Experts have said state gun laws may shield both the shooter and the man who brandished a rifle but didn't fire shots. Jamie Carter, an organizer of Saturday's rally, said Utah activists considered not participating in this round of “No Kings” demonstrations, but “we also felt that we really had to get back out there.” Safety volunteers will be present but unarmed, and all have received de-escalation training, said Carter, of Salt Lake Indivisible. “We really want this to be a very uplifting, happy event of people coming together in a community to kind of try to erase and replace some of the bad memories,” she said. Concerns about large political demonstrations remain heightened in Utah, where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was also assassinated during a speaking event last month. Trump's crackdown against protests, especially in Democratic cities, has intensified since the June marches. Organizers in Chicago are expecting tens of thousands of demonstrators at a popular Lake Michigan park, followed by a downtown march. Federal immigration agents have arrested more than 1,000 people in Chicago, the nation's third largest city, with increasingly aggressive tactics since September. Protests have been frequent and well attended in recent weeks, and have boiled over in intense clashes outside a suburban federal immigration processing center. It feels so much more immediate,” said Denise Poloyac with Indivisible Chicago. “They're very concerned about what's happening in Chicago and around the country.” The trainings informed viewers about their rights during protests — such as whether you are required to carry ID or if wearing a mask is allowed (both vary according to each state) — and emphasized de-escalation techniques for encounters with law enforcement. Each official protest has a safety plan, which includes designated medics and emergency meeting spots. “Texas will deter criminal mischief and work with local law enforcement to arrest anyone engaging in acts of violence or damaging property,” Abbott said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The president earned positive coverage nonetheless for proposals that won't help most patients. One of President Donald Trump's boldest campaign pledges was to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) completely free. Yesterday, the Trump administration released its long-awaited proposals — which are nowhere making IVF free, or even significantly more affordable. That promise, a late gamble to win back women voters aggrieved by the GOP's hostile stances on reproductive rights, had been immediately controversial within his own party. Even though seven in 10 Americans support access to IVF, some religious conservatives believe the procedure — which involves fertilizing eggs outside the body and then transferring embryos to a womb — violates the sacred connection between sex and conception. They also object to embryos being destroyed in the process. Trump's new proposals fall far short both of his campaign pledge and a February executive order soliciting recommendations to “aggressively reduc[e] out-of-pocket and health plan costs” for the treatment. On offer is federal guidance (essentially a suggestion) for employers to provide fertility coverage as a stand-alone, optional benefit, similar to dental or vision insurance. The administration also secured an agreement with drugmaker EMD Serono to sell common IVF medications at steeply reduced prices through the forthcoming TrumpRx.gov portal, a new website where patients can buy prescriptions directly instead of using insurance. Neither move includes new subsidies, mandates, or funding — meaning most patients will see little to no relief. The voluntary employer guidance proposal is unlikely to work in practice. First, employers already can offer fertility benefits if they want to. And unlike vision or dental plans, where low costs are spread across most employees, a standalone IVF plan would only attract the small fraction of workers who need expensive treatment, meaning premiums would almost certainly go up for them. The TrumpRx discounts, meanwhile, would not help most patients. Most people purchase fertility drugs through their health insurance, meaning they can't use the TrumpRx site even if its prices are lower. The White House estimates their discounts will save patients up to $2,200, or less than one-fifth of the cost of one IVF cycle. Despite lobbying pressure, the Trump administration did not back down from vocally embracing IVF, either as a means to help patients experiencing infertility or as a tool to boost the country's birth rate. When asked at his Thursday press conference what message Trump had for religious conservatives opposed to IVF, the president shrugged it off. New York has already done something similar at the state level, mandating that large-group insurers cover up to three IVF cycles. Yet, Republicans have long fought to weaken or roll back the list of essential health benefits, arguing that the ACA's coverage requirements drive up premiums and limit consumer choice. The administration also could have expanded IVF coverage within the federal government's own health plan, which covers roughly 8 million federal workers, retirees, and their families. It declined to spend political capital on any of these solutions. Fertility groups lauded the White House for publicly championing IVF after months of uncertainty. In a statement, Sean Tipton of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine praised the administration for “using [its] platform to draw attention” to the fertility treatment gap in employer-provided health plans and for working with drug companies to tackle costs. RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association struck a similar tone, telling The 19th that Trump's announcement marked “an important step forward.” Back in May, both national organizations said they had not been consulted by White House officials exploring IVF ideas. Democrats and abortion rights groups, meanwhile, dismissed the proposals as hollow. Reproductive Freedom for All president Mini Timmaraju said the announcement was another attempt “to gaslight the American public into believing he'll deliver on empty campaign promises.” “IVF kills more babies than abortion,” Live Action's Lila Rose wrote on X, while Students for Life president Kristan Hawkins said she was “thankful there's no new healthcare mandate” but called the president's ideas a disappointment. “It's time to find real solutions that help families grow and flourish without killing Life in the process,” Hawkins stressed. Other anti-IVF groups like Us Before Them blasted the White House for delivering “a full federal endorsement of an industry that treats children as products to be ordered, screened, stored, and discarded.” Some social conservatives initially tried to spin Thursday as a victory, since the administration had avoided more aggressive mandates. “It should be counted as a win for the traditional social conservative movement, which tirelessly pointed out the huge financial, ethical, and moral risks associated with a federal guarantee or mandate of IVF coverage,” Patrick Brown, of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said on X. Still, the expectation that Trump would mandate taxpayer-funded IVF was always far-fetched. Fiscal conservatives had loudly opposed the idea, with senators like Rand Paul calling it “ridiculous” and Lindsey Graham warning of unlimited costs. Even former Trump administration economist Vance Ginn — who used IVF for two of his own children — argued against a government mandate, pointing to soaring deficits and constitutional concerns. For most Americans, “making IVF more affordable and accessible” sounds like meaningful progress, even if it falls far short of the campaign promise to make it free. It's the same performative moderation that has worked for him since the overturn of Roe v. Wade — promising to veto a national abortion ban even as his administration quietly reinstates funding restrictions, backs lawsuits targeting abortion medication, and fills agencies and courts with officials eager to narrow access. The CDC has lost one-third of its staff this year. The retro, cryptofascist aesthetic of all those ICE recruitment ads, explained.</p>

Adam Swart, CEO of Crowds on Demand, says the upcoming "No Kings" protest risks being exploited by agitators and interest groups "making money off chaos," while organizers defend their nonviolent record and security plans. More than 2,500 events are planned across all 50 states, according to the organizers, a coalition of more than 200 progressive groups led by Indivisible. Major demonstrations are expected in Washington, D.C., New York, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Protesters are being urged to wear yellow "to show collective strength in the face of oppression," according to organizers, who accuse the administration of "sending militarized agents into our communities, silencing voters, and handing billionaires giveaways while families struggle." The demonstrations come amid growing backlash to President Donald Trump's decision to federalize the National Guard and deploy troops to several major U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Memphis, Portland and, most recently, Chicago. A federal judge blocked the Guard's street deployment in Chicago but allowed the units to remain under federal command. "No Kings" protests against the Trump administration are expected to be held in cities nationwide on Oct. 18. At the same time, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has intensified nationwide raids targeting illegal immigrants, focusing on areas where day laborers often gather, such as Home Depot parking lots. Republicans are condemning the demonstrations, with some calling them unpatriotic. House Speaker Mike Johnson told Fox News the protests are being driven by "the pro-Hamas wing and the Antifa people," and accused Democrats of delaying government shutdown negotiations to appease their base. Protesters in Los Angeles wave American flags during a No Kings Protest on June 14, 2025. We'll have to get the National Guard out. I doubt it," Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., told Newsmax. Asked about the protests and whether National Guard units would deploy to manage crowds, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital, "Who cares?" Protesters march during a No Kings rally in Washington, D.C., Saturday, June 14, 2025. The "No Kings" movement first gained national attention in June, when similar demonstrations were held in response to the Army's 250th anniversary military parade. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., wrote on Bluesky that he looked forward to No Kings Day, calling Republicans "the same kind of weasels who would've called George Washington and America's revolutionaries ‘terrorists.'"

'America Reports' panelists weigh in on reports that dozens of Democrats won't commit to backing Hakeem Jeffries for another term as House Minority Leader and more. The top Democrat in the House of Representatives attacked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt with a slew of insults on Friday. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., accused Republican officials of unjustly going after Democrats amid a controversy over a swastika flag found in a House GOP lawmaker's office this week, though the lawmaker denied he or his staff played any role. And I'm not sure whether she's just demented, ignorant, a stone-cold liar, or all of the above," Jeffries said. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries attacked White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt as "sick" and "demented" on Friday. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for a response. Jeffries had been asked about the swastika, which was reportedly embedded into a small American flag that was hanging on a cork board in the office of Rep. Dave Taylor, R-Ohio. It was first reported by a local Ohio social media reporter who goes by the X handle "The Rooster." Taylor said in a statement to Fox News that several offices were targeted with the flag, which he said was the work of an "unidentified group" in a coordinated opposition campaign. "New details have emerged from a coordinated investigation into the vile symbol that appeared in my office. Numerous Republican offices have confirmed that they were targeted by an unidentified group or individual who distributed American flags bearing a similar symbol, which were initially indistinguishable from an ordinary American flag to the naked eye," Taylor said. "After a full-scale internal investigation, I am confident that no employee of this office would knowingly display such a despicable image, and the flag in question was taken down immediately upon the discovery of the obscured symbol it bore." It's not immediately clear why the events made Jeffries invoke Leavitt specifically, however. Tensions have run high on both sides as the shutdown drags on, and the standoff shows no signs of slowing down. Senate Democrats, led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tanked the GOP's funding bill ten times. In fact, it's expected to roll into its fourth week after Senate Democrats blocked the GOP's federal funding measure for a fourth time on Thursday before leaving Washington for the weekend. Republicans put forward last month a seven-week extension of fiscal year (FY) 2025 funding levels, called a continuing resolution (CR), aimed at giving congressional negotiators more time to strike a long-term deal for FY2026. The majority of Democrats are refusing to accept any deal that does not include serious healthcare concessions, at least extending COVID-19 pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.

Americans for Public Trust executive director Caitlin Sutherland sounds the alarm on the 'dark money' purportedly paying for Democrats' protests on 'The Ingraham Angle.' FIRST ON FOX: George Soros' foundations are funding the "No Kings" protests that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and tens of thousands of protesters will be participating in on Saturday. Soros, a billionaire investor and notorious Democratic Party donor, is founder of the Open Society Foundations. Indivisible is "managing data and communications with participants" for the "No Kings" protests that will be taking place in Washington and across the country. The money trail of George Soros' Open Society Foundations leads back to the "No Kings" protests. Per the Open Society Foundations' website, Soros "has given away more than $32 billion of his personal fortune" to the foundations. His son Alex serves as chairman of the board. Leah Greenberg, Levin's wife, serves as the other executive co-director. Greenberg formerly served as the policy director for the Tom Perriello for Governor of Virginia campaign. In 2017, Indivisible received a $350,000 grant from Tides Advocacy, a group affiliated with the Tides Network. The Tides Foundation, a foundation also affiliated with the Tides Network, has been accused of funding anti-Israel campus riots. Fox News Digital reached out to Perriello, the Indivisible group, the Open Society Foundations and the Tides Network but did not receive responses in time for publication. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was the first to sound the alarm on ties between Soros and the "No Kings" protest during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Thursday, saying "There's considerable evidence that George Soros and his network are behind funding these rallies, which may well be riots all across the country." Cruz introduced the Financial Underwriting of Nefarious Demonstrations and Extremist Riots (STOP FUNDERs) Act in July that would allow for the Department of Justice to impose Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) charges against individuals behind the funding of "violent" and "extreme" protests. Sen. Ted Cruz said the "No Kings" protests are "organized by Soros operatives and funded by Soros money." No one denies these basic facts," Cruz told Fox News Digital. "The Trump administration and the Republican Congress are committed to countering this network of left-wing violence." Per the Indivisible website, "On October 18, millions of us are rising again" to protest in an effort to paint President Donald Trump as a tyrant and an authoritarian king. Schumer announced on Thursday that he would be attending the protest, saying he "will join the marchers, to celebrate what makes this country so great" and encouraged peaceful demonstrations. In addition to funding from Soros, the Communist Workers of America Union is also partnered with the "No Kings" protest. "Protests can be strenuous and intense," the "How to Prepare for a Protest" section of the Indivisible website reads. "They are most effective when we peacefully use our constitutionally protected rights of assembly and speech and properly prepare ahead of time," the website continued.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A North Korean submunition has been found in a drone that was used to attack Ukraine last month, according to a new report, providing further insight into the extent that Pyongyang is helping Russia wage war on its Eastern European neighbor. The modified submunition – a small part of a larger weapon – was recovered by Ukrainian authorities following an attack on the port city of Kherson in September, the UK-based investigative organization Conflict Armament Research (CAR) said. It was marked with Korean characters, some of which referenced the Juche calendar, which counts the years after the birth of North Korea's founding leader, Kim Il Sung. While initially designed to be used in a rocket artillery system, it was modified to be attached to a first-person-view drone using a wooden stick, wire and duct tape, CAR said. CAR's investigation comes as Russia has ramped up its drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure while rapidly increasing its drone production. Russia has built a massive drone factory to pump out thousands of weapons, many of which aren't particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch hundreds in one night. This is done in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts have said. Meanwhile, North Korea has also ramped up its weapons program in the past few years, rapidly modernizing its armed forces, developing new weapons and testing intercontinental ballistic missiles. Pyongyang began sending large numbers of troops and equipment to Russia last year. Of that initial deployment, about 4,000 soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to Western officials.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States won its last-ditch effort to block an international carbon tax on the shipping industry, delaying a vote on the proposal by one full year. “Huge push by @SecRubio and the State Dept team,” Waltz said in a post to X. “Strong diplomacy that put American business and consumers first WON THE DAY over an ideological carbon tax from the UN and EU,” he continued. “I am outraged that the International Maritime Organization is voting in London this week to pass a global Carbon Tax,” Trump wrote in a post to Truth Social. “The United States will NOT stand for this Global Green New Scam Tax on Shipping, and will not adhere to it in any way, shape, or form.” The net-zero framework needed a two-thirds majority vote in favor to pass as an amendment to the maritime treaty. Members of the IMO initially voted to approve the framework and carbon tax in April,  agreeing to charge shipping companies for greenhouse gas emissions released by their vessels if they exceed a certain threshold. One of the main purposes of the tax is to accelerate a transition to the use of cleaner fuels for vessels, such as biofuels. Under the existing proposal, shipowners who exceed a certain threshold would face a minimum tax of $100 for every ton of carbon dioxide emitted over that baseline. Those that exceed higher thresholds would also be forced to pay a $380 fine. If the measure had been adopted, it would not have gone into effect until 2028. The International Chamber of Shipping lamented over the failed vote on Friday, with ICS Secretary General Thomas Kazakos saying the industry needs “clarity” on decarbonization strategies. “As an industry we will continue to work with the IMO, which is the best organisation to deliver the global regulations needed for a global industry,” he said. The IMO is still scheduled to meet next week to further discuss details of design and implementation of the framework.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump did not take the possibility of the US sending long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine off the table during his call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, sources familiar with their conversation told CNN. But Trump is also not expected to commit to providing the potentially game changing American-made weapons in his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Friday, two of the sources said, though they cautioned that things can always change once the president is alone in a room with the Ukrainians. The US president, in both public and private, has appeared more willing to allow Ukraine to obtain the long-range missiles in recent weeks, US officials said. Trump had been holding off, hoping to ascertain from Zelensky a better idea of how he planned to use them, the officials added. And they've said they viewed the possibility of receiving them as an attractive threat that Zelensky hoped would force Putin back to the table. And that's exactly what it appears to have done — though it remains unclear what, if anything, may have changed since Trump and Putin met in Alaska two months ago that would make the prospect of a peace agreement more likely. Roughly 24 hours before Zelensky was slated to meet with Trump in Washington, Putin made a last-ditch attempt to intervene with the American president and halt all talk of sending the lethal US weapons to Kyiv. His lengthy phone call resulted in a promise to have the two leaders meet in Budapest “within two weeks or so,” in Trump's telling — which appears to have bought Moscow more time as Trump's desire to reach a peace agreement has grown even further following his administration's success in Middle East negotiations. Trump, however, did not drop his new military threats while speaking with Putin on Thursday. “I did actually say, ‘Would you mind if I gave a couple thousand Tomahawks to your opposition?' He won't remove the threat until it's no longer necessary.” Another US official echoed that sentiment, telling CNN that Trump is looking to bring the war to an end and is focusing on a diplomatic approach first — suggesting the threat of sending Tomahawks to Ukraine is one tool he has at his disposal as part of that effort. Putin is said to have stressed during the call that Tomahawks – which have the range to target major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg – would have no significant impact on the battlefield, CNN previously reported. But they would damage the US-Russian relationship, he argued. Putin has previously argued that if Trump chooses to send the long-range missiles to Ukraine, it would completely alter the level of US involvement in the war thus far, noting that the weapons would likely require Americans to operate them. The risk of escalation is also a concern among some US officials, though others said previous steps that appeared escalatory — like allowing Ukraine to have more powerful missile systems or weapons — did not significantly escalate the conflict.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anyone destroying property or committing acts of violence will be swiftly arrested. Law and order will be enforced,” Abbott said in a post on X. “The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,” he said, adding that the governor's office was coordinating with both law enforcement and protest organizers. Virginia National Guard spokesman A.A. “Cotton” Puryear told the outlet that it hadn't received a formal request for assistance, but personnel “will be on state active duty conducting training.” An internal Virginia National Guard document obtained by the outlet showed detailed plans for the protests, establishing a task force consisting of a “Quick Reaction Force” and “Ready Reaction Force” staged outside of Richmond on Friday, including a “Non-Lethal Weapons Platoon.” There are 2,500 planned “No Kings” protests across 2,200 cities on Saturday, including cities outside the U.S., such as Madrid, Paris, and London. The last “No Kings” protests in June went by largely without incident, but Saturday's protests come amid a far more heated political climate. The assassination of Charlie Kirk last month and an attack on a Dallas ICE facility have triggered anxiety from conservatives about rising political violence. President Donald Trump declared antifa a terrorist group in response, buoyed by cells around the country's violent involvement and agitation in protests. Conservatives have grown increasingly worried about the threats posed by antifa after increasingly brazen terroristic actions, such as an armed assault on a Texas ICE facility in July.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although outlays for the fiscal year, 75% of which occurred since the start of Trump's second presidency, rose by 3%, federal revenue went up by $308 billion, or 6%. Roughly a third of the revenue boom resulted from Trump's unprecedented, near-universal tariffs on imports. Yet more than half of the revenue increase came from rising wages and realized capital gains, which, in turn, led to more income taxes paid to the Treasury. Instead, our $1 trillion interest bill was $160 billion greater than this year's price tag on the Pentagon, and every $4 of $5 collected by the federal government went solely to interest payments, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. And more importantly, it may be the first time this century that such a reduction has happened other than in response to a recessionary blow-out in the deficit first. Former President Joe Biden technically reduced the deficit, but only after beginning his presidency with a $3 trillion shortfall in 2021 to fund his disastrously inflationary American Rescue Plan. Even then, Biden followed one year of deficit reduction with two years of a half-trillion-dollar deficit expansion despite the economy facing no recession or new wartime spending. Before that, former President Barack Obama oversaw fairly sustained deficit reduction, but that was only after Tea Party Republicans forced his hand in response to his $1 trillion deficit expansion in 2009. Previously, former President George W. Bush turned the federal budget surplus he inherited from former President Bill Clinton into a post-9/11 deficit that peaked in 2004, and only after then did he make some progress bringing the deficit back down. All of this is to say that presidents usually start their first terms blowing out the deficit, and if they ever attempt to bring it down at all, it's only in the aftermath of some recessionary excuse to go on a taxpayer-funded spending spree. Through that lens, Trump beginning his second term with an unanticipated dose of fiscal discipline is extraordinary. Furthermore, despite the top-line nominal cost of Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there's some evidence that the legislation will result in more spending cuts than anticipated. A $1.7 trillion deficit is still more grotesque than any other in American history before COVID-19, and even with economic expansion slated to significantly reduce the deficit as a share of GDP to lower than it was during most of Biden's presidency. Uncle Sam's spending binge will remain compounding until Republicans muster the stones to take entitlements off autopilot. But a 4% deficit reduction is a remarkable start to any presidency, especially when it is attributable more to Trump's deregulation and tax cuts than the tax hike of his tariffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The demonstrations are meant to rebuke President Donald Trump‘s political platform and actions. “Here we are, Democrats have shut down your government now for 16 days,” McClain said. Well, let's see, they've posed for glossy photos outside the Capitol. They've jumped on TV to what looks like an audition to be the next radical in charge, after Chuck Schumer. And now, they're gearing up for their ‘I hate America' rally this weekend.” McClain then remarked on the performative nature of the left-wing political protests and slammed Democrats participating in them as “cheering for chaos.” “A rally where they'll cheer for chaos, instead of country,” McClain said. “So take note of what goes on at that rally.” “Take note of how they put Americans first,” she said. Saturday's “No Kings Protest” runs counter to much of what McClain mentioned. It is fundamentally opposed to Republican ideals and political philosophies. “We rose up once, and on October 18 we'll rise again — because one protest isn't enough to protect our democracy,” read a press release from Indivisible.</p>
