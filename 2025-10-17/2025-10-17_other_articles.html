                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Its unique environment hints at the possible nature of extraterrestrial life. It had been sealed up from the atmosphere for 5.5 million years, making the interior a science experiment that evolved into a virtually alien world. A few years later, a small number of researchers in hard hats and protective breathing apparatus began cautiously exploring the cave's dark, toxic, and humid depths. Navigating the Movile Cave's subterranean maze of passageways is treacherous without proper equipment and lights, and few researchers have been allowed inside, for good reason. The bizarre environment down there is unlike anywhere else on Earth, and it continues to surprise scientists with its bounty of life. Researchers have encountered previously undiscovered species of fungi, bacteria, and animals—many of which are endemic to the cave, and not found anywhere else. As the ancestors of today's primates, carnivores, and hoofed animals roamed the surface during the Miocene geological epoch, this world below ground developed into a home to organisms who would carve out a very different evolutionary path—one that may mirror other worlds in our solar system. Protected for so long from the surface world, the strange wonders underground are a scientific goldmine for researchers seeking to understand life's evolution—both on Earth and on planets with hostile environments. For example, scientists think life might exist on both Saturn's moon, Enceladus, and Jupiter's moon, Europa; Movile Cave may hold important clues about their evolution. And plenty of life forms call this cave home. Among the residents, researchers encountered gastropods, nematodes (threadlike worms), and tiny crustaceans, as well as centipedes, beetles, water scorpions, leeches, and spiders. And because color has no purpose here, evolution didn't bother with pigmentation either, leaving many of the creatures translucent or white—much like deep-sea creatures, who also live in an alien, sunless environment and tend to be see-through or white. The environment also contains methane and ammonium, compounds that would be dangerous to most life on Earth if they built up in enclosed spaces. Movile Cave's extreme environment also features 100 percent humidity and high carbon dioxide levels, while its oxygen content is one-third of what we're used to breathing on the surface. Researchers are seriously considering the idea that this kind of environment in our solar system could harbor life, because both the moons Europa and Enceladus are covered in salt water oceans hidden beneath icy crusts. Enceladus also ejects icy plumes of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen gases, which might originate from potential hydrothermal vents. With all of that in mind, scientists think these moons may be home to bacteria or other simple microorganisms. While they are the most basic forms of life on our planet, single-celled organisms tend to form the base of a food chain or can mold the environment around them in a way that encourages new life to form. That's a tremendously exciting prospect for scientists looking to discover extraterrestrial life. Earth itself may have conjured its first life forms—thought to be single-celled microbes—around deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which also have little to no oxygen and plume gases like carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds, and methane. Studying Earth's ecosystems has taught us that there's no single recipe for life. So it may be only a matter of time before we find life on other worlds.

When she is released by the greed-driven actions of Shilpa Shirodkar's character, Shiva (Sudheer Babu) steps forward to challenge her wrath.

The story's depth and the energy it carries are unlike anything I have experienced before.” Director Venkat Kalyan added, “Jatadhara is more than a supernatural thriller; it's a journey into our cultural underbelly where myths breathe and darkness listens. Sonakshi Sinha also spoke about her new avatar as an antagonist, and shared, “What makes Jatadhara powerful is how it weaves the supernatural into real human emotions. Directed by Venkat Kalyan and Abhishek Jaiswal, Jatadhara is set to hit theatres on November 7 in Hindi and Telugu.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chicago's own Levi Holloway has established himself as a leader in the horror-theater genre — yes, it's a thing. But what's great about “Paranormal Activity” — the U.S. premiere now at Chicago Shakespeare Theater and soon headed to Los Angeles, Washington D.C. and San Francisco — is that this genre specialist has been paired with Felix Barrett. Barrett is the immersive maestro of the British company Punchdrunk and an artist demonstrably skilled in making audiences feel like they have been trapped in a pitch black room with a demon and cannot get out. So it goes with “Paranormal Activity,” a show based on the Paramount Pictures movie franchise, which specializes in horror in intimate, domestic settings. The live stage version can't repeat old plots of course, so it comes with a fresh story about a young married couple (played by Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger) who have moved from Chicago to London to escape their demons from past sins, only to find that … Nobody wants to read some critic blathering on a horror show without answering the one thing most people will want to know: Will I be scared? There were more screams, shouts and screeches floating around The Yard Theatre than at a City Hall budget hearing. “Paranormal Activity,” which also features juicy performances from the Chicago actors Shannon Cochran and Kate Fry, is intentionally a slow, dramatic burn. Like the film franchise (or at least the ones I've seen), much care is taken here to establish characters making a desperate lunge for normalcy — in this case for a new life with maybe a kid on the way. This, by the way, is not parody horror. Better yet, this is an analog experience that well knows its biggest asset is the dislocation that an audience used to horror movies feels when it's being scared by actual humans (well, some actual, some not). There is no CGI nor digital trickery, at least not that one can perceive. Just doors that hide things, rooms with secrets, realistic props that take on lives of their own, all arrayed on an intentionally dull and realistic set by Fly Davis, evoking a house in the nation where this show was first seen. Aside from a more bankable title, “Paranormal Activity” struck me in the end as a more effective show than Holloway's prior Broadway horror play “Grey House,” which I liked, but that struggled with too much going on. Here, the demons have all the time they need, and if you ever wanted to watch how blackouts can effectively be used in the theater, well, director Barrett offers a blueprint. The two leads clearly have been directed to be as minimalist as possible, which, especially in the case of Álvarez, who under-vocalizes and is less emotionally demonstrative than ideal, sometimes lowers the blood pressure too much. But you can see the purpose when all hell lets loose. Note that this is an embrace-the-genre attraction, replete with a medium and most of the other familiar nomenclature. (“Oak,” another new and scary show you currently can see at Raven Theatre, offers more social commentary with its jumps.) This is not one of Holloway's complex allegories. Although maybe also a show to make you wonder what past action of your own will one day come back to haunt your dreams. Where: The Yard at Chicago Shakespeare Theater on Navy Pier, 800 E.

The founding guitarist of KISS, who died on Thursday, Oct. 16, at age 74, sat down for an interview with The Aquarian in March 2025, where he talked about his gratitude for returning to the stage after an injury to his right arm threatened to end his career. “I hurt my arm about two-and-a-half years ago – I fell down a flight of stairs,” he told the outlet. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Frehley was in his native New York at the time of the interview, preparing to perform with his band. "I think it's going to live on for hundreds of years. In discussing his legacy, the guitarist opened up about a recent comment about longevity from his psychic. I mean, we have longevity in the family on both sides," he said. After leaving KISS, Frehley formed his own group called Frehley's Comet, which put out two albums and launched a successful solo career that began in 1978 with a platinum-selling self-titled debut. With Space Invader in 2014, he became the only KISS member to crack the Top 10 of the Billboard 200 albums chart with a solo album, according to his biography. He was dad to a daughter, Monique, with wife Jeanette, and said in a 2018 interview that it was Monique who'd inspired him to get sober in 2006. Frehley's family announced his death in a statement shared with PEOPLE on Thursday. Oct. 16, saying the rocker died earlier that day in Morristown, N.J., following a recent fall at his home. TMZ previously reported that the rocker was on life support due to a brain bleed caused by a fall several weeks ago. In his last moments, we were fortunate enough to have been able to surround him with loving, caring, peaceful words, thoughts, prayers and intentions as he left this earth," the statement read. Reflecting on all of his incredible life achievements, Ace's memory will continue to live on forever!"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pair of “fortune tellers” failed to see jail in their future when they conned clients into believing they were cursed and needed cleansing rituals, according to investigators in Pennsylvania. Those rituals came at a cost of more than $600,000 in cash, jewelry, gift cards and more, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in an Oct. 8 news release. Gina Marie Marks and Steve Nicklas operated the scam out of “Jenkintown Psychic Visions” in Jenkintown and lured in their victims via psychic readings, Steele said. … In total, Marks and Nicklas stole $595,959 from the first victim.” The investigation led to another woman who also reported being financially victimized by “Jenkintown Psychic Visions,” starting in June 2023, prosecutors said. In that case, Marks made “unorthodox requests to satisfy rituals,” including at least $18,000 and a Chanel purse, prosecutors said. She then threatened “the victim with reputational damage and personal repercussions if her instructions were not followed,” Steele said. Financial records confirmed money from the victims was transferred into accounts belonging to Marks and Nicklas, Steele said. “These defendants, through their con scheme, preyed on people who were looking for help, guidance and hope, exploiting them for financial gain,” Steele said. Nicklas, 40, and Marks, 52, were arrested Oct. 7 and face charges including “corrupt organizations, dealing in the proceeds of unlawful activities, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception and receiving stolen property, as well as fortune telling,” prosecutors said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RIO RANCHO, N.M. — While Roswell may be the Alien Capital of the World, Rio Rancho is quickly becoming a national hub for UFO research – and some local students will soon be getting a crash course. Rio Rancho Public Schools is joining forces with the National UFO Historical Records Center for a first-of-its-kind partnership. The archivists are giving students and teachers an all-access pass for some rather unique lessons. If this all sounds a little out there, they're inviting you to come check it out for yourself this weekend. It's all meticulously organized inside portable classrooms next to Martin Luther King Jr. We really want to bring in elements of science, physics, critical thinking, the investigative process into that dialogue,” said David Marler, executive director of the National UFO Historical Records Center. That's what got RRPS leaders thinking outside the box. In the UFO realm, it's just a really good subject matter to springboard into that critical thinking piece,” said Michael Baker, COO of Rio Rancho Public Schools. I mean, there's definitely physics involved, so I think it gets a kid more engaged in the sciences and history at the same time,” said Barry Roth, chief archivist of National UFO Historical Records Center. Important knowledge is needed to answer the biggest question of them all. “Anyone that says UFOs are extraterrestrial, they're alien, prove it. You can try to prove it yourself this weekend. The National UFO Historical Records Center hosting a community open house Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is next to MLK Elementary in Rio Rancho. The Rio Rancho Astronomical Society will also be there with their telescopes for a peek into space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's right hand man has made bombshell claims on reports of UFOs above restricted US nuclear plants UFOs have been seen menacing US nuclear sites, according to Trump's right hand Marco Rubio. Your info will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy You'll now receive top stories, breaking news, and more, straight to your email. In the trailer, Rubio can be seen saying there had been reports of “something operating in the airspace over restricted nuclear facilities” that was not of US origin. He went on to say that “even presidents were [informed] on a need to know basis” regarding UFO sightings, and that people had claimed “it would cost them their lives” to speak out on the reports.

Captain Robert Salas said he believed the giant UFO was trying to “send a message to humanity” when it shut down multiple weapons at a top secret nukes base. Captain Salas and his commander had been ordered to sign a vow of silence after reporting the astonishing UFO encounter in 1967. He had been on duty at the Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, where he was the on-duty commander of a secret underground launch control facility. “I was in charge of ten nuclear missiles at the time when a UFO came over and hovered over our facility and while it was hovering there it was seen by all our guards,” he told The Sun Online. It was reported to me directly by those guards. “While the object was up there we lost all ten missiles due to guidance and control failure.” Captain Salas said the simultaneous shutdown was an “impossible” occurrence because the ten nuclear Minuteman missiles were all running on independent systems. Captain Salas remembers the incident as if it happened yesterday – and he is certain that UFOs are alien. Captain Salas said: “I can only speculate as to why it happened. This was a demonstration by an object of extra extraterrestrial origins and I don't say that lightly. “I think it was simply a message to all of us on Planet Earth that we need to rid ourselves of nuclear weapons.” “The department has determined that the authorized release of these unclassified videos does not reveal any sensitive capabilities or systems, and does not impinge on any subsequent investigations of military air space incursions by unidentified aerial phenomena,” the statement said. A statement from 2019 revealed there had been “a number of unauthorised and/or unidentified aircraft entering various military-controlled ranges and designated airspace in recent years”. “These kinds of incursions can be both a security risk and a safety hazard for both Navy and Air Force aviation,” the statement read. Luiz Elizondo, a former Pentagon official who had helped lead the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program initiative, resigned in protest after its closure and in opposition to what he called the excessive secrecy of the program.

Alex Jones, host of Infowars, at a November 2020 rally in Atlanta, Georgia

The US Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal by far right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones of the $1.4 billion in damages he has been ordered to pay for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

The top court turned down Jones's appeal of the defamation judgment without comment.

Jones, founder of the website InfoWars and host of a popular radio show, has been found liable in multiple lawsuits brought by relatives of the victims of the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six teachers dead.

Jones claimed for years on his show that the Sandy Hook shooting was "staged" by gun control activists and that the parents were "crisis actors," but has since acknowledged it was "100 percent real."

Sandy Hook families maintained that Jones's lies and denialism, coupled with his ability to influence the beliefs of thousands of followers, caused real emotional trauma.

Jones filed for personal bankruptcy in his home state of Texas after losing the defamation case.

Free Speech Systems, the Texas-based parent company of InfoWars, also declared bankruptcy.
