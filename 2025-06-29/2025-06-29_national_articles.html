Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says it is "too early to tell" whether Iran has given up on its ambitions to become a nuclear power on Sunday. Graham made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's "This Week," saying he agrees that the sites the U.S. struck were "obliterated," but he remains concerned about Iran's uranium supply. "Operation Midnight Hammer was a tremendous military success. It set the program back, I think, a couple years. Do they still desire to destroy Israel and come after us? "Until that changes, we're in trouble," he continued, adding that he believes Iran must meet certain requirements before President Donald Trump's administration agrees to talk with them. "They have to say, for the first time, the Iranian regime, we recognize Israel's right to exist," Graham said. "If they can't say that, then you're never gonna get a deal worth a damn. Trump said on Friday that he is open to conducting additional strikes against Iran, should Tehran pick up its nuclear program again to a level that is concerning to the U.S. Without question, absolutely," Trump told reporters Friday when asked about the possibility of subsequent strikes. Trump has previously issued similar warnings to Iran, and said Wednesday at the NATO Summit in the Netherlands that if Tehran were to seek to repair its nuclear program once more, the U.S. would not hesitate to move forward with additional strikes. Trump also slammed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared victory over Israel on Thursday. Trump countered Khamenei's claims and said he spared the ayatollah from death. "I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life," Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday. "I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, ‘THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!'"

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spaniards and tourists were desperately trying to keep cool Saturday, as the country sizzled in temperatures as high as 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) in Seville and other central and southern cities. Demonstrators use fans to help with the high temperature during a protest against the housing crisis affecting Portugal, in Lisbon, Saturday, June 28, 2025. A firefighting airplane sprays water on a hill in Thymari, south of Athens, Thursday, June 26, 2025, as authorities evacuate five locations during Greece's first summer heatwave with temperatures nearing 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). ROME (AP) — Major heat waves across Southern Europe have pushed temperatures above 40 C (104 F) in countries including Italy, Spain and Greece, as local authorities issued fresh warnings against the risk of wildfires. Experts link the rising frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to climate change, warning that such extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common across Europe's southern region. Severe heat waves were recorded in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal before the weekend, with locals and tourists alike taking shelter from the sweltering conditions. Two-thirds of Portugal were on high alert on Sunday for extreme heat and wildfires, with temperatures expected to top 42 C (107 F) in Lisbon. In Italy, a few regions — Lazio, Tuscany, Calabria, Puglia and Umbria — were planning to ban some outdoor work activities during the hottest hours of the day in response to the record-high temperatures. Italian trade unions pushed the government to expand such measures at a national level. On Sunday, the Italian Health Ministry placed 21 out of 27 monitored cities under its highest heat alert, including top holiday destinations like Rome, Milan and Naples. In Rome, tourists tried to seek shade near popular spots like the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain, using umbrellas and drinking from public water fountains to stay cool. Similar scenes were reported in Milan and Naples, where street vendors sold lemonade to tourists and residents to offer some refreshment from the heat. Greece was again on high wildfire alert because of extreme weather, with the first summer heat wave expected to continue throughout the weekend. A large wildfire broke out south of Athens on Thursday, forcing evacuations and road closures near the ancient Temple of Poseidon. Greek authorities deployed 130 firefighters, 12 planes and 12 helicopters to battle the blaze, while police evacuated 40 people, with five areas under evacuation orders. Southern regions of Spain recorded temperatures above seasonal averages, prompting health alerts and safety recommendations from authorities. The country's national meteorological service Aemet has said that June is set to break yet another record, becoming the hottest such month since records started. Experts warned that intense heat can affect daily life, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children. The study predicted that heat-related deaths could more than quadruple by mid-century under current climate policies. While more people die from cold than heat, the study stressed that rising temperatures will offset the benefits of milder winters, leading to a significant net increase in heat-related mortality.</p>

Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham made a passionate statement about the state of the team as it deals with Caitlin Clark's injuries and tries to keep the season from spiraling. Cunningham spoke to reporters about being the team that everyone in the league has circled on their calendars before their win over the Dallas Wings on Friday. Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham against the Wings at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, June 27, 2025. It was the second night of a back-to-back as they came off of a loss to the Los Angeles Sparks. "I think so far this season, we've had a lot of distractions. But I think that's really good for us," she said, via the Indy Star. "Let's go through the adversity early. Good news is we're not going to peak too early, so I mean, that's a positive. Everyone has this kind of rough schedule. For us, we get another opportunity tomorrow, and we've got to capitalize on it. So, everyone in our locker room? We've got to be better in that area. Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham runs up court during the Wings game in Dallas, June 27, 2025. Cunningham added that the tough schedule was "just an excuse" and that she had to do a better job for her teammates. She then had five points and four assists on Friday as the Fever defeated the Wings, 94-86. The WNBA schedule has become a tension point with some players. New York Liberty star Breanna Stewart spoke about the problems of a 44-game schedule earlier this month. "We want to play the games, especially if that's what is wanted for TV and having these sellout arenas," she said. "I think the hardest part is no matter what, when I was playing 36 games or 32 games, it was in the same amount of time as 44 games. Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham reacts during the third quarter against the Brazil National Team at Carver-Haweye Arena in Iowa City, Iowa, on May 4, 2025. "I know on both ends between April and October there's things happening. But I think that's one of the biggest talking points in the next CBA is like, alright, how can we make it so teams aren't playing four (games) in six (days) three times in a season and continuing to have the rest and recovery so we are at our best.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Relatives of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip mourn their deaths at Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Saturday, June 28, 2025. Relatives mourn over the body of Palestinian Bilal Abu Amsha, who was killed among others in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip, at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Saturday, June 28, 2025. People take part in a protest demanding the end of the war and immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government in Tel Aviv, Israel, Saturday, June 28, 2025. Palestinians dig through sand looking for belongings after an Israeli strike hit a displacement tent camp in Gaza City, Saturday, June 28, 2025. Relatives of Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip mourn their deaths at Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Saturday, June 28, 2025. Ron Dermer, a top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire, an Israeli official said, and plans were being made for Netanyahu to travel there in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a deal. Netanyahu was meeting with his security Cabinet on Sunday evening, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that hadn't been finalized. Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be an agreement within the next week. Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war. An eight-week ceasefire was reached just as he took office earlier this year, but Israel resumed the war in March after trying to get Hamas to accept new terms on next steps. Click here for an explanation of this decision. Trump also doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it “a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.” Last week, Trump called for the trial to be canceled. It unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity there. The trial has repeatedly been postponed at Netanyahu's request, citing security and diplomatic developments. On Sunday, the court agreed to call off two more days of testimony by him scheduled this week. Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over a major sticking point — whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement. Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying on social media that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. About 50 hostages remain, with less than half believed to be alive. Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said that “Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war,” without addressing Merdawi's claim. During a visit Sunday to to Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Netanyahu said that the Israel-Iran war and subsequent ceasefire have opened many opportunities: “First of all, to rescue the hostages. Of course, we will also have to solve the Gaza issue, to defeat Hamas, but I estimate that we will achieve both tasks.” Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war in Gaza. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something that the group refuses. The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage. Gaza's Health Ministry on Sunday said that another 88 people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the war's toll among Palestinians to 56,500. Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are even partly functional, and more than 4,000 children need medical evacuation abroad, a new U.N. humanitarian assessment says. We hope to God that the war will end,” said one Palestinian, Mahmoud Wadi. Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible displacement.</p>

Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley was reportedly under a federal investigation over gambling allegations tied to NBA games and prop bets. Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley reacts during the Minnesota Timberwolves game at Target Center in Minneapolis, March 30, 2025. Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, spoke out about the reported investigation. "An investigation is not a charge," Haney told ESPN. As of now, he has not been charged with anything." The allegations against Beasley were not immediately known. Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley against the Heat during the fourth quarter at Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida, March 19, 2025. "We are cooperating with the federal prosecutors' investigation," NBA spokesman Mike Bass told Fox News Digital. Beasley played all 82 games for the Pistons last season, starting 18 of them. He averaged 16.3 points and 2.6 rebounds per game. It was his first season with Detroit and ESPN reported the two sides halted contract extension negotiations as the investigation was revealed. He's played nine seasons in the NBA, spending time with the Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war. Russia fired a total of 537 aerial weapons at Ukraine, including 477 drones and decoys and 60 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. Another person was killed by an airstrike in Kostyantynivka, local officials said. In the far-western Lviv region, a large fire broke out at an industrial facility in the city of Drohobych following a drone attack that also cut electricity to parts of the city. Ukraine's air force said one of its F-16 warplanes supplied by its Western partners crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets. Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight. Two people were wounded in another Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Bryansk in western Russia, regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said Sunday morning, adding that seven more Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the region. Meanwhile, Russia claimed Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Novoukrainka in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region. Russian forces have been slowly grinding forward at some points on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, though their incremental gains have been costly in terms of troop casualties and damaged armor. In other developments, Russia's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said he had spoken on the phone with his U.S. counterpart, CIA Director John Ratcliffe. “I had a phone call with my American counterpart and we reserved for each other the possibility to call at any time and discuss issues of interest to us,” Naryshkin said in remarks to state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel on Sunday. Sunday's attacks follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments two days ago that Moscow is ready for a fresh round of direct peace talks in Istanbul. Two recent rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul were brief and yielded no progress on reaching a settlement. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree to withdraw Ukraine from the Ottawa Convention banning antipersonnel land mines, a Ukrainian lawmaker said Sunday. The 1997 treaty prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel land mines in an effort to protect civilians from explosives that can maim or kill long after fighting ends. “This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,” said Roman Kostenko, secretary of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense and intelligence.

MIAMI (AP) — Weather forecasters say a second tropical storm has formed along coastal Mexico.

Shortly after announcing Tropical Storm Barry off the country's Atlantic coast on Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tropical Storm Flossie formed along Mexico's west coast.

The storm's center was about 240 miles (about 390 kilometers) south of Acapulco and about 485 miles (780 kilometers) southeast of Manzanillo. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 40 mph (65 kph) and it was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump suggested tracking down and prosecuting the leakers of a preliminary intelligence assessment of the damage inflicted by the recent U.S. strike on Iran. In an interview with Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Bartiromo brought up a Truth Social post from Trump saying Democrats had leaked intelligence around the Iran strike, to which the president interjected that they should be prosecuted. When asked who specifically, Trump suggested the administration would find out the specific leaker, possibly by questioning the reporters who obtained the information. You go up and tell the reporter, ‘National security, who gave it?' You have to do that. And I suspect we'll be doing things like that,” he said. Trump has long taken issue with reporters' source confidentiality regarding national security matters. During the 2024 campaign, he repeatedly threatened punitive action against reporters who divulged sensitive state matters. Trump's ire for reporters covering national security matters was revived last week when CNN reported on a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that suggested the damage to Iran's nuclear sites may not have been as prevalent as previously thought. The Trump administration aggressively countered the assertion and was soon vindicated after further assessments indicated that the damage to Iran's nuclear program was decisive.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. NBA star Jonathan Isaac argues that transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports compromises fairness. Tennis legend Martina Navratilova came to the defense of "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling on Saturday as the writer received criticism from actor Pedro Pascal in a recent interview. Rowling and Pascal have clashed in the past on transgender issues, including after Rowling celebrated the United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman. Actor Pedro Pascal, who is starring in a movie titled "Eddington" that played at Cannes Film Festival, deflected concerns about the United States becoming closed off to migrants in a press conference on Friday. "Bullies make me f------ sick," Pascal told Vanity Fair. Rowling dismissed Pascal in a social media post on Friday and Navratilova added to it. "Another Johnny come lately telling women to STFU," Navratilova wrote. Navratilova is a lifelong Democrat but has never wavered on her push to keep biological males from competing against girls and women in sports. She has made clear in the past she is no supporter of President Donald Trump, and a quick scan of her social media posts would underscore that. However, she has lamented Democrats' inaction over the issue of transgender athletes participating in women's and girls' sports. When Trump signed an executive order to prohibit biological males from women's and girls' sports, she fired off a fierce message toward the Democratic Party. "I hate that the Democrats totally failed women and girls on this very clear issue of women's sports being for females only," she wrote in a post on X. She also expressed her frustration in January when the House of Representatives passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Only two Democrats voted with Republicans on the bill.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Israeli hostage rallies: Anti-war demonstrators and the families of Israeli hostages held protests in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand a ceasefire in Gaza following the truce between Israel and Iran. Trump helped broker the Israel-Iran truce and his administration has quietly aimed to revive nuclear talks with Tehran, though he has also exchanged sharp words with top Iranian officials, casting doubt on the diplomatic path forward. • Funerals in Iran: Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran earlier Saturday for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed by Israeli attacks during this month's 12-day conflict. You can read some of our latest reporting from the region here. Iranian state news on Saturday aired an apparent interview with Ali Shamkhani — a close aide to Iran's supreme leader who had previously been reported dead by both Israeli and Iranian media. Mystery mounted about Shamkhani's fate in the days after he was reported dead following Israel's June 13 strikes on Iran. Last Friday, multiple Iranian outlets — including IRNA, Tasnim and Fars — claimed Shamkhani had not died but instead had been “severely injured and hospitalized” in the strike. They did not, however, release new photos of him. Then Shamkhani appeared in pictures from Iranian state media coverage of Saturday's state funeral for those slain during the 12-day conflict with Israel. On the same day, Iranian state news agency IRIB ran what it billed as Shamkhani's first television interview with Iranian state media since the attack. “I did my morning prayer while under the rubble,” he said. IRIB also released footage of what it said was Shamkhani's home, reduced to broken concrete and rebar. But when I heard the sound of vehicles, I realized it was not,” he said in the interview, adding that he sustained internal injuries in the attack and that his rib cage was fractured. CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities for comment. Ayman Odeh, an Arab lawmaker in Israel facing impeachment proceedings, called for unity and a ceasefire at an anti-war protest in Kfar Saba, central Israel. In an appeal to the crowd, Odeh said, “I am your partner. Yes, there are differences, there are disagreements, but I want you to know: I am your partner, because my soul still yearns for freedom. “After so much death, suffering, and tears, better days will come. In a subsequent defense of the post, Odeh said many of the prisoners released were minors who had not been charged with any crime. “While it is clear that many of you tend to see primarily the Jewish suffering, I see and feel the suffering of both peoples,” Odeh said. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum estimated that 30,000 people came out. One sign said, “President Trump, end the crisis in Gaza! CNN's Nic Robertson reports from Tel Aviv where tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square to call for an end to the Gaza war and the return of the remaining hostages. He also demanded that the Israeli military stop what the government said would be a major attack on Iran, prompted by a ballistic missile launch at northern Israel after the ceasefire went into effect. In the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, demonstrators held up signs demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leave office. “How much more blood will be spilled before the guilty one goes?” read another. At Alonim Junction in northern Israel, demonstrators held up hands covered in red paint and chanted, “We have no soldiers for the wars for Netanyahu's welfare.” In the central Israeli city of Ness Ziona, protesters held a large banner that simply said: “End this f***ing war.” The hostages held in Gaza for more than 630 days of war should not be treated as “bargaining chips,” said Israeli lawmaker Yair Golan on Saturday, calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal at an anti-government protest in Haifa. They are our brothers and sisters,” said Golan, head of the left-wing Democrats party. “The soldiers fighting in Gaza are our sons and daughters. And anyone who does not place their return at the top of the national priority list — is neither a Zionist nor worthy of leadership.” Golan, who has been sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, added that Israel's ongoing war in Gaza “serves only the survival of the coalition.” The country's ceasefire with Iran, achieved after 12 days of conflict, has led to a renewed push from mediators to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Protesters across Israel — forbidden from organizing their demonstrations for the last two weeks because of emergency guidelines during the conflict with Iran — are now packing the streets of major cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Haifa. Viki Cohen, mother of 20-year-old Nimrod Cohen, told CNN she feels there is “momentum” now to end the war and to bring all of the hostages home. Trump is very demanding and we believe in him. And we know he has the power to stop the war,” Cohen said as she prepared to participate in a protest in Tel Aviv. Trump said Friday he believes a ceasefire will be agreed to in Gaza “within the next week.” We finished with Hezbollah, so now there is no threat, and it's time to finish the war in Gaza and to bring them all home.” One mother showed CNN's Fred Pleitgen a band on her baby's head, which she said is a “symbol saluting Imam Hossein … who's the leader of all the oppressed who stand against oppressors and don't submit.” “The Iranian nation should know that the reason for the conflict with America is that they want Iran to surrender,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in a post on his Farsi-language X account, echoing a portion of a previous statement. A top Iranian commander whose disappearance from public view after Israeli attacks sparked rumors he'd been killed attended Saturday's funeral procession in Iran's capital. Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, thought to be a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was seen among the crowds in Tehran at the state funerals being interviewed on camera. Asked by a reporter if he had a message for the people of Iran, Qaani said that “we have been successful so far, and from now on we will also move forward successfully.” Qaani was not seen for days after the unprecedented Israeli strikes but is one of the highest-profile military figures to survive. Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani — another high-profile Iranian military and political official previously thought to be dead — also appeared at Saturday's state funerals, according to pictures published by Iranian state media. Iran's president thanked citizens for turning out to mourn those killed in the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire. “I sincerely thank you, dear people,” Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X Saturday. He added that “serving such a free-spirited nation is the honor of my life.” A host of senior Iranian officials joined the mass mourning in Tehran on Saturday for those killed in Israel's attacks, but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was absent. Khamenei, who has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel, did not immediately issue a statement regarding the state funeral, which was held for 60 top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed in the 12-day conflict. The chief of staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, was also not seen at the ceremony, but issued a statement praising people for showing up to what he described as a “unique and multi-million-strong funeral.” Senior officials in attendance included Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei. This post has been updated to reflect Mousavi's statement. Sixty coffins made their way through Tehran, carrying military leaders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed in Israeli attacks this month, CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports. Attendees said they wanted to honor those who were killed, but also vowed revenge on both Israel and the US. The remains of Hassan Salehi, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Iran's Evin prison, have arrived at Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Tehran, Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim reported. Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest confidants, is set to visit Washington, DC on Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning. The visit comes ahead of a meeting between Netanyahu and President Donald Trump. On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is no set date for a Netanyahu visit, but Trump is “very open” to it. This past week, Trump denounced an ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt” in a social media post, which was hailed by allies of the long-time Israeli leader. Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Tehran on Saturday to commemorate the senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed during Iran's 12-day conflict with Israel. As mourners clad in all black chanted death to Israel and America, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged the loss of lives was “hard and painful” but pledged the nation would return to “new glory.” The company said that customers connecting through Dubai with final destinations in Iran “will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice.” “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. We continue to closely monitor developments,” the company said in a statement. The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people. Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said. “The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement. Some background: Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.” Speaking on the day of state funerals for those killed in Israeli strikes, Iran's foreign minister said that the loss of lives is “hard and painful” but their “memory will live on.” Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on Instagram Saturday, stressed that the “pride of a nation is paramount” as he pledged that Iran would return to “new glory and greater strength” following its 12-day conflict with Israel. He added that the 60 who were killed and whose bodies were laid to rest Saturday – in an event which saw hundreds of thousands line the streets of Tehran – gave their “blood” but did not surrender their honor. Top military commanders, scientists and civilians were killed in the brief and bloody conflict, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. US officials believe Isfahan's underground structures house nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon. US B2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites. But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lines of communication over the U.S.'s national security between the White House and Congress are strained as speculation grows that a preliminary report on the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was leaked out of Capitol Hill. Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) criticized the White House for not briefing the “Gang of Eight” on Capitol Hill, a group that consists of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), and Jeffries, along with the top members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. Another point of frustration within the Democratic caucus came when intelligence officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, were set to brief lawmakers on the operation Tuesday, before being delayed just hours before they were set to meet. We had a bipartisan, classified briefing on Iran scheduled today for Members of Congress—the Trump Administration canceled at the last minute. It's utter chaos and we need answers immediately. “It wasn't particularly enlightening and there remain a whole host of questions that need to be answered for the American people,” Jeffries told reporters leaving the briefing. Democrats are not the only party that feels this lack of trust surrounding recent international developments. Earlier this week, before the briefing, CNN and the New York Times reported that the strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back months as opposed to years, based on an early Pentagon intelligence assessment. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt snapped back at CNN in response to the leaked intelligence. “This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove,” Leavitt said Thursday. “This is a reporter who has been used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives.” The White House planned to limit classified information flow to Congress following the leak, which immediately prompted pushback from Democrats. Axios reported that a White House official confirmed the decision, saying the information was shared soon after it was posted to a system used to share information with Congress, CAPNET. “As the Chairman and Ranking Member of the relevant congressional committee tasked with overseeing the U.S. Intelligence Community, these allegations of improper disclosure of national security information strike at the heart of our solemn and apolitical mission to ensure classified data never falls into the hands of our adversaries,” Chairman Rick Crawford (R-AR) and ranking member Jim Himes (D-CT) wrote in a joint statement. We will continue to do so,” the New York Times said. CNN responded to Trump's attacks, specifically when he called on the CNN reporters to be fired, by defending their reporting. “To me, it still appears that we have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a handful of months,” Murphy said. “I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated,” Murphy added. Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had “some concern” that people are jumping to conclusions too early. “I simply wish that the administration would adhere to that same level of secrecy about classified information that shouldn't be shared on nonclassified channels, like Signal, and the fact that we still don't know whether the participants on some of those calls have ever even had their phone scrubbed for malware. Trump then announced Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire that remains fragile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. That kind of journalism isn't easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? You've probably noticed it by now: You're shopping online for some makeup or a new pair of running shoes or a water table for your toddler, and when you go to check out, you have a new option — why not break up the cost into four payments, made over time? US consumers, especially Gen Z and millennial ones, have been embracing “buy now, pay later” services like Klarna and Afterpay with gusto the last few years. It's not hard to see the attraction: Unlike a credit card, most BNPL plans don't carry interest, and they generally don't impact your credit score (though that is now changing). On social media people tout BNPL as a way to buy stuff you want but don't have the cash for right then — or maybe ever. And that's starting to show up in the data: Leading BNPL company Klarna — which recently partnered with the food delivery service DoorDash, spawning a thousand memes — saw its net losses from consumers not paying their loans more than double in the first quarter of this year. Scanlon is an author and economic commentator, best known for breaking down economic issues through blog posts and videos on social media. In a video she published shortly after Klarna announced its partnership with DoorDash, Scanlon called the rise of BNPL a symptom of our “poor-impulse-control economy.” “What I worry about is that the convenience and the impulsivity that it allows for allows for the expansion of the grift economy, of a world where people are spending money on things that they don't need to and they're just totally lost in that cycle,” Scanlon told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. Scanlon talked to King about buy now, pay later, Gen Z's relationship to debt, and what financial responsibility looks like in today's economy. Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify. A lot of Gen Zers have had very common interactions with debt. Medical bills, anything involving a credit score. Debt has been so normalized for the younger generation that when they see something like BNPL, it's like, “Oh, this is just casual debt.” It's just what they do with their money. This is interesting, that debt has always been available to Gen Z. If you're an older millennial like I am, that's not really the case. You couldn't just pay for stuff on your phone. They have this ease with paying for stuff and taking on debt for stuff that never occurred to me when I was young. In 2021, the Fed had rates really close to zero. We're always talking about how much money the United States as a country owes. And so I think for everybody, they're looking at that and they're like, If the government owes all this money, surely I can have a little bit of debt, too. And then credit scores have become such a core part of the American identity. It really informs a lot — how you can buy a house or if you can even get certain loans. And I think it really has a lot to do with the environment that Gen Z has grown up in and the fact that these tools are so readily available and they're so easy to use. Talk to me a bit about debt. When you look at debt systemically, it's not inherently a bad thing. BNPL in itself isn't evil, especially if you can pay it all off without having to face those high interest rates. But it's really about the system that encourages these sorts of products to be created. Real wages were stagnant for a really long time. It's very tough to get a job right now. If you're graduating from college and the college wage premium has eroded quite a bit, rent is high because we don't build enough housing. I don't see a solution before me. And so I think that's been the big thing with debt — we've used it as a tool in order to navigate some of the hairier parts about being in the United States right now. And it sounds like what you were saying is that's a bit of a privileged or maybe old-fashioned idea of how paying for things works. I think, “Why don't you just wait?” ignores some of the ladder issues that we're facing as Gen Z, younger people — even millennials, in some capacity, are facing this broken-ladder problem where they could wait to buy that moisturizer, but that would require the entry-level labor market to free up again, that would require wages to really speed up, that would require the housing market to normalize. And you should be careful — I don't think you should be living above your means in an extravagant way. But it really is a psychological buffer of sorts, where people are just like, Well, I don't know what else to do, so I'm going to go buy this thing. It is an element of instant gratification, the same thing that we see in social media, but for Gen Z-ers and younger people. And so I think these little small luxuries matter — buying that moisturizer matters because it is indulgent in a certain way, but it's also an act of agency in an economy that doesn't feel like it's allowing you into it. It does feel like there is some American ethos here that says, To live is to be in debt, and we've all accepted that. I mean, that's the only way you can get by sometimes. It's far lower, but I think a lot of people just feel like, one wrong move and the whole thing could come tumbling down. And so we have these issues that are outside of the realm of consumer packaged goods being delivered where we have to really start thinking through actual solutions to these problems, because they're not going to fix themselves.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The court blocked Judge Brian Murphy's order creating new burdensome administrative hurdles and making it harder to deport illegal immigrants to countries they are not originally from. One of the biggest barriers to swift and just immigration enforcement is that many countries either limit how many of their citizens they will take back from the United States each year or forbid the U.S. from sending back any of their citizens. Countries with such limits or bans include China, Cuba, India, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Trump has sought to alleviate this bottleneck by entering into diplomatic agreements with third countries that will take deportees who are not citizens of those countries. These agreements are complex and sensitive foreign policy matters that the federal judges have no business interfering with. More importantly, however, there is nothing in the Constitution, federal statute, or federal regulation that empowers an illegal immigrant to choose which country they are deported to. Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by Senate Democrats just this past December, disagrees. He believes that illegal immigrants destined for deportation to countries other than their home country are due extra rights. Mind you, this is on top of the process the migrants are already due to determine if they have credible fear of torture if they are returned to their home country. Murphy entered a nationwide injunction of all such third-country deportations this March. One Guatemalan illegal immigrant argued in Murphy's court that he should not be deported to Mexico because he was raped in the country. Solicitor General John Sauer telling the Supreme Court in May that Murphy “invented” an “onerous set of procedures” that made perfectly legal third-country deportations all but impossible. Writing in dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Trump administration, “Has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard.” The Trump administration honored onerous court orders from open borders Biden judges, including the order to stop deporting illegal immigrants to El Salvador. There is no evidence that the Trump administration has wrongly deported any U.S. citizens or legal residents. In Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, Justice Antonin Scalia said, “While aliens who have established connections in this country have due process rights in deportation proceedings, the Court long ago held that Congress is entitled to set the conditions for an alien's lawful entry into this country and that, as a result, an alien cannot claim any greater rights under the Due Process Clause.” But just because an illegal immigrant thinks the U.S. is safe, and all other countries are less safe, doesn't entitle them to legal status here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran has banned the head of the United Nations‘ nuclear watchdog organization from its nuclear sites and is removing surveillance cameras from them, according to multiple reports. Iran claimed the moves, which are the regime's latest following a ceasefire in its “12 Day War” with Israel, were made after Israel acquired “sensitive facility data.” The new measures from Iran were announced during a mass funeral held in Tehran over the weekend for high-level Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists killed in targeted Israeli strikes earlier this month when it began its military campaign dubbed “Operation Rising Lion.” Footage posted by Araghchi show Iranians packed onto a main street, chanting and waving Iranian flags. “The Wave after Wave of Patriots who took to the streets in Iran to honor military commanders, scientists, researchers and civilians including women and children murdered in cold blood by the Cowardly Israeli regime, all have one message: Unlike the Feeble Israeli regime, we do NOT hide our losses; we are PROUD of our MARTYRS, who are our role models. For every fallen officer or scientist, Rest Assured 100 More Are Lining Up To Take Their Places. Until the Last Drop of Blood, the Powerful and Resilient Iranian Nation will Resist whoever attempts to decide OUR destiny,” Araghchi posted on X. The United States responded to separate threats against Grossi from Iranian officials on Saturday, specifically alleged calls for the IAEA head's arrest and execution. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called those threats “unacceptable” in a statement posted on X. We call on Iran to provide for the safety and security of IAEA personnel,” Rubio said.</p>
