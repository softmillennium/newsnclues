If you're looking for a reliable computer without spending $1,000 or $2,000, HP is always a solid choice thanks to its wide range of dependable products. Right now, though, Amazon is offering a deal that's hard to ignore: there's an HP 14-inch laptop which is at an all-time low price, likely the lowest ever for an HP laptop of this kind. For just $179, a discount from the regular price of $230, you get a compact, lightweight laptop with Windows 11 Home preinstalled and one year of Microsoft 365. The snowflake white finish gives it a clean, modern look, and the 14-inch micro-edge HD display provides a large screen without taking up too much bezel. With the 79% screen-to-body ratio and 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel, you get more screen real estate in a smaller footprint which is ideal for watching videos and browsing the web. The HD screen (1366 x 768) is sufficiently sharp for day-to-day activities and the onboard Intel UHD Graphics 600 even makes it possible to play 4K content smoothly. It's not a gaming monster so don't expect to run resource-intensive games and graphics-hungry creative software but for office tasks and general web surfing, it gets along fine without complaint. The 4 GB of RAM is enough to keep things humming along. Storage is handled by a 64 GB embedded multimedia card which is flash-based to support quick boot time and quick access to your content. While 64 GB isn't massive, it's sufficient for the essentials apps and files. What really provides more value, though, is a year's subscription to Microsoft 365 included with your purchase.

The Ninja DZ401 Foodi 6-in-1 XL air fryer is the highest-rated air fryer available for purchase on Amazon, with over 37,000 reviews and an impressive 4.7 out of 5 stars. If you need an XL air fryer that can actually do it all, this is the one to buy. Ninja has become the brand of choice when it comes to air fryers, and this inaugural (early) Prime Day discount is open to everyone, not only Prime members. This double-basket feature dispenses with the need to cook in batches or wait for the first dish to finish before cooking another. Smart Finish enables you to prepare two dishes of different settings and ensures that they are ready at the same time and consequently everything is ready simultaneously to be served. It is not the same with Match Cook which allows you to duplicate settings on both baskets for full capacity meals. The IQ Boost feature smartly shares power among the baskets and allows one to cook something as big as a 6-pound whole chicken and a side dish at the same time, without compromising on speed or quality. With its six cooking functions—air fry, air broil, roast, bake, reheat, and dehydrate—the Ninja DZ401 Foodi has you set for quick meals. What's more (and one of the main reasons why it is so popular) is that you can prepare your favorite fried food with up to 75% less fat compared to normal deep frying. The spacious 10-quart capacity enables you to cook up to 8 pounds of chicken wings at a time, perfect for family gatherings, parties, or cooking for the week.

Bitcoin Depot Chief Legal Officer, Chris Ryan, said that police departments using brute force to open Bitcoin ATMs and seize the cash inside is bordering on law enforcement overreach. Sawing them open might even be breaking banking and criminal laws, added Ryan. “You've got these rogue law enforcement officers thinking that they're doing the right things by these consumers,” Ryan said. “What they're actually doing is creating another victim, which is us, with the damage of our property and seizing of our funds.” Just last week, the Jasper County Sheriff broke into a Bitcoin Depot ATM after one of its constituents reported getting scammed out of $25,000. Because the Sheriff used a power tool to break open the ATM to get its contents, Bitcoin Depot said that its machine — which cost $14,000 each — was completely totaled. Requests like this happen up to 20 times a year, Ryan said to Decrypt, and that doesn't even include cases where the police just straight up break their machines open. Crypto ATMs are similar to regular deposit machines, wherein they accept cash and credit the same amount to your bank account. Depositors that use the machine are required to confirm that they're depositing the money into their own wallets, and it even warns users using third-party addresses that they might be getting scammed. Unfortunately, many people, including law enforcement and the courts themselves, do not understand how crypto works. Because of that, we get incidents like these where police forcibly open crypto ATMs, causing damage to a third party's property. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. While Bitcoin Depot and other similar operations are legitimate, they're often used by scammers because of how fast and easy it is for them to get the stolen funds. Even though you can easily track crypto transactions due to the public nature of the ledger, getting them back is often difficult because of anonymity. Because of these attributes, scammers are increasingly switching from gift cards to Bitcoin ATMs. Jowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. YouTube's Christian ‘Peri Fratic' Simpson claims to be “the acting CEO of Commodore Corporation.” The surprise Commodore buyout deal hinted at three weeks prior, seems to have been put into motion. Last and definitely not least, the video ends in a signature tease – this time it's a tease for new hardware. That should mean the deal is worth somewhere between $1m and $5m. Apparently many backers of this project, including Peri Fratic, have already put in lots of cash to make this buyout happen, taking out second mortgages, selling the family silver, etc. Lots of details and discussion about funding are provided, but left us wondering what would happen if not enough suitable investors come forward, and what kind of timescale needs to be adhered to, to finalize the contract? It will go forward with its ‘Retro Futurism' plans, “honoring our past, innovating the future.” Furthermore, Perifrantic has been busy appointing (acting) CEO, CFO, COO, and many more key positions – many of whom honor the past. Some big names that will play a part in the new future Commodore include, in order of mention: Bill Herd (Commodore Pioneer), Albert Charpentier (Father of the C64), Michael Tomczyk (Vic Tzar of the Vic 20), James Harrison (Tech support manager), David Pleasance (ex VP becomes Heritage and legacy advisor), Hans Olsen (demo and convention facilitator), Tim Morgan (PR officer), and more. Perifrantic makes an interesting point in anticipation of critics that will chime in to assert “this will never be the original Commodore.” In his defense, the retro tech enthusiast says “what if we got 47 trademarks from 1982, or original Commodore engineers back, original executives, assistants, ROMs, Amiga? I mean, at some point, it does start to become the real Commodore, right?” It will exist to “streamline the usage of the brand and logo, along with releasing some of our own products,” it is stated.

Specifically, merchandise designers, social media manager, and anyone who owns a license from a classic 1980s or 90s game should get in touch with the new (acting) Commodore CEO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More VRAM and CUDA cores with increased power requirements. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia is expected to follow up its current lineup of RTX 50 series desktop GPUs with a Super refresh. According to a new set of specifications posted by reliable Nvidia hardware leaker @kopite7kimi on X/Twitter, expect Team Green to launch at least three new models including the RTX 5070 Super, RTX 5070 Ti Super, and the RTX 5080 Super. These look like pretty safe bets for inclusion in our frequently updated Best Graphics Cards for Gaming in 2025 feature. It will have 6,400 CUDA cores, which represents an uplift of just over 4% compared to the 6,144 CUDA cores on the regular RTX 5070. As for the VRAM, it is expected that the RTX 5070 Super will be upgraded to 18GB of GDDR7 memory with a 28 Gbps bandwidth on a 192-bit bus interface. As we suggested in a previous report back in April around a similar set of leaked specifications, Nvidia might be planning to replace the 2GB GDDR7 memory modules on the existing RTX 50 series lineup, with 3GB modules to gain an additional boost in performance. Lastly, there is the RTX 5080 Super which is, more or less, similar to the RTX 5070 Ti Super except with a higher CUDA core count and memory bandwidth. The memory bandwidth (as corrected) will be increased to 32 Gbps while the power draw will jump from 360W to 415W. With leaks like this, please add a sprinkling of salt to the asserted specs. While the refreshed models appear promising, these specifications remain unconfirmed rumors until Nvidia makes an official announcement. That said, if accurate, the RTX 50 Super refresh, with its increased VRAM, could appeal to consumers craving more memory for high-resolution gaming, demanding workloads, or future-proofing their systems. However, given Nvidia's track record with GPU launches, it wouldn't be surprising to see high demand once again paired with inflated pricing, if and when the new RTX 50 Super series hits the market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. It's a straightforward operation: One of the first mathematical truths we learn is that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But mathematicians still have many unanswered questions about the kinds of patterns that addition can give rise to. “This is one of the most basic things you can do,” said Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford. “Somehow, it's still very mysterious in a lot of ways.” In probing this mystery, mathematicians also hope to understand the limits of addition's power. For instance, add any two odd numbers and you'll get an even number. But for decades, progress on the problem was negligible. “It's a very basic-sounding thing that we had shockingly little understanding of,” said Julian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge. Sixty years after Erdős posed his problem, Bedert solved it. He showed that in any set composed of integers—the positive and negative counting numbers—there's a large subset of numbers that must be sum-free. His proof reaches into the depths of mathematics, honing techniques from disparate fields to uncover hidden structure not just in sum-free sets, but in all sorts of other settings. Erdős knew that any set of integers must contain a smaller, sum-free subset. It contains five different sum-free subsets, such as {1} and {2, 3}. Erdős wanted to know just how far this phenomenon extends. If you choose a million integers at random, around half of them will be odd, giving you a sum-free subset with about 500,000 elements. His proof dealt with averages: He found a collection of sum-free subsets and calculated that their average size was N/3. Erdős wanted to measure the size of those extra-large sum-free subsets. Mathematicians soon hypothesized that as your set gets bigger, the biggest sum-free subsets will get much larger than N/3. “It is surprising that this simple question seems to present considerable difficulties,” Erdős wrote in his original paper, “but perhaps we overlook the obvious.” “The longer it went without people being able to improve on that simple bound, the more cachet this problem acquired,” said Ben Green, Bedert's doctoral adviser at Oxford. And, he added, this was precisely the kind of problem where “it's very, very hard to do any better at all.” After 25 years without improving on Erdős' original result, mathematicians finally began inching forward. In 1990, two researchers proved that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + 1/3 elements, more commonly written as (N + 1)/3. For example, if you know that a sum-free subset has to have at least 5/3 elements, that means its size is guaranteed to be 2 or more. The result might have seemed hardly worth mentioning, but buried in Bourgain's paper was a startling breakthrough. He just couldn't pin down the details to turn it into a full proof. Jean Bourgain devised a creative strategy for proving the sum-free sets conjecture. This quantity, which comes from a field of mathematics called Fourier analysis, tends to be large if a set is more random, and small if the set exhibits more structure. “It's a very striking marker of how difficult this problem is.” There was reason to be optimistic: Mathematicians already knew of sets with a small Littlewood norm that have massive sum-free subsets. These sets, called arithmetic progressions, consist of evenly spaced numbers, such as {5, 10, 15, 20}. “I certainly tried to prove the sum-free conjecture using [Bourgain's] ideas,” Green said, but “we still don't understand much about the structure of sets with small Littlewood norm. And so, though mathematicians continued to have faith in Bourgain's Littlewood-based strategy, nothing happened. Then, in the fall of 2021, Benjamin Bedert started graduate school. With Green as his doctoral adviser, it was inevitable that Bedert would come across the sum-free sets conjecture. Green's website lists 100 open problems; this one appears first. Bedert perused the list shortly after he began his graduate studies. At first, he shied away from the sum-free sets problem. In summer 2024, Bedert decided he was ready for a riskier project. “I'd proved some reasonably good results in my PhD so far, and kind of put a thesis together already,” he said. Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford, has resolved a decades-old problem that tests the role of addition in sets. So far, it had been too difficult to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always resemble collections of arithmetic progressions. But Bedert thought it might be useful to prove something more attainable: that even if these sets aren't literally built from arithmetic progressions, they share certain key, progression-like properties. In arithmetic progressions, there are many groups of numbers that have the same sum. For instance, in the set of even numbers (which is an arithmetic progression), 4 + 8 has the same sum as both 2 + 10 and 2 + 4 + 6. Bedert thought it might be enough to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always obey this property. Within a couple of weeks, he'd succeeded in proving that the property was true. “Then I realized there was still so much more work to do.” First, Bedert showed that any set with a small Littlewood norm could be “mapped” to a second set that bore an even closer resemblance to arithmetic progressions. “Over the Christmas break, I was obsessively thinking about this problem,” Bedert said. “I'm not sure where it came from,” he said. “Maybe these ideas stir in your mind for a while, and then [you] finally get something out that works.” He represented the structure of his sets using a tool called the Fourier transform, and then modified a 1981 proof to show that some of the individual components of that representation must have a large Littlewood norm. Since Bourgain had already shown how to handle sets with large Littlewood norms, that completed the proof. In the end, Bedert showed that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + log(log N) elements. “It's a really amazing result,” said Yifan Jing of Ohio State University. Jing, who was also mentored by Green, credits the achievement to Bedert's intense focus. “Benjamin really went in depth to modify Bourgain's proof and make it work,” he said. “He spends much more time than other people on the same problem.” But mathematicians don't know precisely how fast that deviation can grow. Thanks to a 2014 paper by Green and two colleagues, they know that the deviation is slower-growing than N. But, Green said, “there remains a massive gap” between that upper bound of N and Bedert's lower bound of log(log N). The work also provides new insight into sets that have a small Littlewood norm. “Old and difficult problem solved by brilliant kid,” he said. “The stuff he's building on, it's subtle and hard to work with.
