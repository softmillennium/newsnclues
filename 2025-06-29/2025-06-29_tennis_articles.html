                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Fritz, this year's fifth seed at Wimbledon, will have to confront that challenge head on Monday in one of the popcorn opening matches at the All England Club. “My game is very fast — big serve, short rallies,” Mpetshi Perricard told ATPTour.com ahead of his Wimbledon campaign. “I'm not sure what other players think, but obviously when I'm playing someone who serves big and plays fast, like [Reilly] Opelka, it's not very pleasant to know you don't have control over the points. After a breakout season in 2024, during which he won his first two tour-level titles in Lyon and Basel, Mpetshi Perricard earned Most Improved Player honours at the ATP Awards. At the heart of his success is a bold tactical approach that continues to serve him well — particularly on grass. By launching second serves at speeds comparable to his first, the World No. 36 Mpetshi Perricard often blitzes through service games and ramps up the pressure on his opponents. “It's a real strategy,” said Mpetshi Perricard, who won 88.8 per cent of his service games last year. “I've got a lot of control, and that allows me to put pressure on my opponents.

Last year, despite falling in the final round of qualifying, Mpetshi Perricard received a lucky loser spot in the main draw after Alejandro Davidovich Fokina's withdrawal. How to make some noise on your Wimbledon main-draw debut? Hit 51 aces… The Frenchman wore down 20th seed Sebastian Korda in his five-set opener and rode that momentum to the fourth round, in which he lost to Lorenzo Musetti. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fritz, will have little time to settle into his campaign at SW19. Yet ahead of his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Mpetshi Perricard, the American remained level headed and quietly assured. “It's a scary match, because some things are more out of your control than in other matches,” said Fritz, who reached the quarter-finals last year. “It's not easy when you play someone like him. “But historically, I have done well against big servers. While Mpetshi Perricard poses a threat, Fritz can draw on his own grass-court pedigree.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Draper has made eye-catching rise up rankings this year Jack Draper has vowed to embrace being the new leader and figurehead of British tennis as he begins his Wimbledon campaign as a top contender for the championship. Draper will face Sebastian Baez of Argentina in his first-round match on Tuesday, a long-awaited homecoming for the 23-year-old after enjoying a remarkable rise during the past year. The fourth seed is now the point of reference for all other British players and many have already asked him for his thoughts on their own journeys. “It's very nice when people reach out,” Draper said. An example of Draper's newfound authority came last year when Hannah Klugman, one of Britain's most talented youngsters, arranged a lunch meeting with him through her coach, Ben Haran. Klugman, who reached the French Open girls' final this month, will make her grand slam debut on Monday against the 29th seed Leylah Fernandez after receiving a wildcard. “My message to her was that everyone's on their own journeys,” Draper said. “But regardless, if you look at a top player, or if you look at someone who's doing incredibly well, it doesn't necessarily mean they've got it all figured out and they're not in the state of struggle themselves. They just know how to deal with it better. You go out there, win, you feel great, but the challenge is there every day to perform and to be better. So my message to her was that everyone's the same. Draper has been handed a difficult draw as he tries to manage the elevated pressure and expectations that come with his new status but is determined to show the country his potential. “It's a great opportunity here at Wimbledon and a great chance to hopefully show the British public what I'm able to do on a tennis court, and the type of personality I am,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jannik Sinner will kick start his Wimbledon campaign against compatriot Luca Nardi, whom he has never faced in his career. Ahead of the tournament, Sinner talked about his US Open mixed doubles partner Emma Navarro. The US Open mixed doubles event this week has been moved to the qualifying rounds and this move attracted many top players, including Sinner. It was very unexpected, to be honest (laughs). I just met her yesterday for the first time, and we never talked, we never texted each other. Sinner's arch-rival Carlos Alcaraz will be playing the mixed doubles alongside Emma Raducanu, while Novak Djokovic will be competing with compatriot Olga Danilovic. Women's World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will enter the tournament with Grigor Dimitrov, while Iga Swiatek has joined forces with Casper Ruud. Navarro will start her Wimbledon campaign against Petra Kvitova. While Sinner will be bidding to win his fourth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, Navarro will be hoping to reach a Major final for the first time. Her best performance in a tournament of this category came in 2024 when she made it to the final of the US Open and lost the match to eventual winner Sabalenka. Novak Djokovic was all praise for Jannik Sinner in the pre-tournament press conference at Wimbledon. He was asked about Aryna Sabalenka's controversial comments she made after her defeat to Coco Gauff. Djokovic defended the Belarusian, saying players sometimes fail to control their emotions, especially after a defeat in a Grand Slam final. If you look at Sinner and Alcaraz after five and a half hours of fighting, Jannik could have been bitter after losing that match. Djokovic will be locking horns with France's Alexandre Muller to start his bid for his eighth Wimbledon title. He will meet Italy's Fabio Fognini in the first round and is projected to square off against Sinner in the final. Sinner has never reached the championship match here. Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last six Grand Slam titles between them and the last player other than them to win a Major was Djokovic at the 2023 US Open. Since that victory, Djokovic only reached one Grand Slam final (2024 Wimbledon). This article first appeared on FirstSportz and was syndicated with permission.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — It didn't take long for Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka to patch up their relationship after this month's French Open final.Now as Wimbledon is about to start, Gauff is hoping everyone else can also forget what the top-ranked Sabalenka said in the wake of her loss to the American at Roland Garros.A day after dancing together on Wimbledon's Centre Court in a TikTok video, the two tennis players faced more questions on Saturday about the aftermath of Sabalenka's comments right after the final, when she said her loss had more to do with her own mistakes than Gauff's performance.The Belarusian later wrote to apologize to Gauff and said her comments were "unprofessional," but not before she faced some major backlash from fans and pundits—especially in the United States.

Here are the essentials to get you ready for Wimbledon 2025: The 2025 Wimbledon tournament will begin on Monday, June 30, 2025 and be played over 14 days before concluding on Sunday, July 13, in London. Fans wanting to stream the action can watch matches on ESPN+ or Fubo. Since the Open era began in 1968, only Roger Federer (2003-07), Pete Sampras (1993-95; 1997-2000) and Bjorn Borg (1976-80) have managed to win Wimbledon three years in a row. Markéta Vondroušová shocked the tennis world by becoming the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon when she prevailed in 2023. Italian Jannik Sinner, the reigning Australian Open and U.S. Open champion is this year's top seed on the men's side at Wimbledon. That's despite losing to Alcaraz in an epic French Open final. Alcaraz is seeded second, followed by No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, and No. 4 seed – and hometown favorite – Jack Draper of the United Kingdom. 1 women's seed ahead American Coco Gauff, who is the No. 2 seed despite beating Sabalenka in the 2025 French Open final.</p>

Osaka has been drawn to face Talia Gibson in round one of Wimbledon, with WTA number two Gauff taking on Dayana Yastremska. She defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the Roland Garros final earlier this month, although followed that up with an opening match defeat in Berlin. Osaka lost in the French Open first round, and also lost her opener in Berlin before a round of 16 exit at the Bad Homburg Open.

Gauff has indeed achieved huge success in her relatively brief career so far, with the 21-year-old now a two-time Grand Slam champion. Furthermore, the 27-year-old is a seven-time WTA champion, with four of those titles involving Grand Slam success. Currently ranked 53rd in the world, Osaka has played in four Grand Slam finals throughout her career so far, and has won all four.</p>

However, after making it to the fourth round of Wimbledon a year ago, she will look to find more success on the grass. On Tuesday, Raducanu will face fellow American Ann Li in the women's singles match at the Eastbourne International in a Wimbledon tuneup.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There was no hiding Naomi Osaka's frustration after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa at the French Open last month. She had won the first set in a thrilling tiebreaker and battled for two hours and 21 minutes in front of an enthralled crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier. But ultimately she couldn't close out the match. The 27-year-old struggled to speak in her news conference soon after. "I feel like I should be doing better," she said with emotion in her voice. So, like, even with [coach] Patrick [Mouratoglou], I was thinking this just now, he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever [Serena Williams] to, like, 'What the f--- this is? She quickly apologized for cursing before sitting back in her chair, and looked on the verge of tears. The moderator asked if she needed a minute to regain her composure. It would have been understandable if she didn't come back, maybe even expected during an earlier stage of her career, but Osaka returned soon after. According to Mouratoglou, who has been working with Osaka since September, she's done just that, and he is more encouraged than ever by what he's seeing as Wimbledon gets underway. Osaka has moved on fully from what happened in Paris. And despite having never advanced past the third round at the All England Club, Mouratoglou said Osaka is optimistic, and is ready for her first-round match against qualifier Talia Gibson on Monday. But Osaka, Mouratoglou and the rest of the team aren't thinking about winning titles, although they do believe they will come again. "For the last two years she hasn't won as much as she has in the past, and it can be difficult to deal with," Mouratoglou told ESPN on Thursday. "So I think at this point it's much better to not expect anything and focus again on what she can control and what she wants to achieve rather than on the outcome ... I'm not focused too much on the results, but more on the game and what she produces in terms of game. After the match against the tenth-seeded Badosa, Mouratoglou said they sat down and discussed what happened -- what went wrong, why her level dipped in the second set, and why she made some of the decisions on court that she made. He also understood that she desperately needed a few days away from tennis. It had been a long clay-court season, during which she played four tournaments and won her first title (at the 125K Saint-Malo event) since returning from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season. Osaka went home to Los Angeles and spent time with her almost-2-year-old daughter, Shai. "I think that probably having [her daughter] will help her to get over her losses, being a mother," Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said last week. That perspective is something Osaka has spoken openly about since returning to the tour. While she had struggled with her mental health prior to her pregnancy and had taken multiple breaks from competition previously, Shai has provided her with something else to focus her energy on, no matter how she has performed on the tennis court. "Giving birth to my daughter changed my mindset a lot," Osaka told ESPN ahead of her comeback. "And it's also made me realize that my world doesn't have to revolve around me -- which might also be a little selfish too. According to Mouratoglou, that attitude was on full display when a refreshed and reenergized Osaka came back to Europe to prepare for the ever-so-short grass-court season. "This part of the season is so important and you really have to be fully focused," Mouratoglou, also the author of the just-released "Champion Mindset" self-help book, said. But I think she's really moved on. She's not thinking about Roland Garros at all." Three weeks after her disappointment in Paris, Osaka was back on the court and playing at the Berlin Open. She lost to eventual semifinalist Liudmila Samsonova in another three-set thriller, but the team was encouraged by what it saw. Wanting to get more match experience on the surface before heading to London, Osaka then accepted a wild card for the Bad Homburg Open. In a tightly contested battle headlined by strong serving by both players, Osaka defeated Olga Danilovic 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) for her first grass-court victory of the season. "I hope so," Osaka said after the match when asked if she was becoming a good grass-court player. So she's not someone who would fake it. Mouratoglou admitted that it's been difficult at times for Osaka. Having been at tennis' peak earlier in her career, she has struggled over the years with her results and knows the expectations others have placed on her. She hasn't advanced past the third round at a major since she won the Australian Open in 2021, nor has she claimed a tour-level title in that span. But there have been bright spots -- she reached her first WTA final in almost three years in Auckland this season before having to retire with injury, and she made the fourth round at the 1000-level events in Miami and Rome this year. 1 in the world, so to be No. 50 and having to be patient doing everything right, that's what she feels is difficult," Mouratoglou said. "But to be at the top of the game is very difficult, so this is just a [new] difficulty that she needs to accept, but I feel she does. I feel maybe she was not in the past month, but now she says to me, 'It's going to click, I just have to be patient.' And she is sure about it now." After their match in Paris, Badosa praised Osaka's level and said, "Very, very soon she's going to be where she wants to be, for sure." Evert believes she remains one of the best ball strikers on tour and lauded her hard work and fitness, but she thinks it's simply confidence that Osaka needs most to return to her previous glory. 1 thing is, and I've watched her play a lot of matches where it's been very close, and she's not won those matches, and I think what she has lost a little bit during the time off was the belief, the belief on the big points, the belief in the big games when it's 5-all," Evert said. "Those shots, those golden shots were there for her taking when she was winning Slams for those couple of years, but that is missing. She'll need to really break through and win these tight, tight matches that she seems to be losing now." He sees just how good and consistent Osaka can be in practice. and their priority is getting what he sees every single day on the practice court to translate in a match. While Osaka has gotten tough first-round opponents in several of her recent Slam appearances due to her lack of seeding, she has a relatively favorable matchup against Gibson, a 21-year-old from Australia playing in her first major main draw outside of her home country. If Osaka wins Monday, she would likely play No. Zheng has won two of their three previous meetings, with both wins coming since Osaka's return, but grass is also Zheng's weakest surface. Last year, in her first time playing the tournament in five years, she reached the second round. But prior to the draw announcement, former world No. 1 and 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick said there was "no reason why she can't play well on grass" and sounded optimistic about her chances during a spot on the Tennis Channel. Those around Osaka believe that as well. In fact, they believe the low expectations and her under-the-radar status entering the tournament can only benefit her. And because of that, perhaps Wimbledon -- however unlikely that might sound -- might actually be the perfect place for everything to finally come together again for Osaka. "We know there's less pressure for her to play well on grass," Mouratoglou said. "It's an opportunity to go there and play with less pressure and be able again to show what she's capable of and what she does in practice. We'll use that as motivation closer to [her first match] to make her feel lighter and be able to just focus on her game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At the US Open in August, they will play doubles together. On Friday, they spoke for the very first time in their lives. "It was very unexpected to be honest," Italian world number one Sinner told reporters at the All England Club, when asked about the partnership. "I just met her on Friday for the first time. This year's US Open mixed doubles is being held as a standalone event on 19-20 August before the hard-court Grand Slam begins on 24 August, a move by the United States Tennis Association which said it hoped would attract more high-profile singles players. Sinner and Navarro are one of several eye-catching pairings who have been put together for the tournament where British number one Emma Raducanu and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz are also due to join forces. But Sinner and Navarro can take confidence from the examples of unexpected pairings going on to win slams. "The tournament kind of wanted us to play together because certain teams were already set up," Sinner explained at Wimbledon, where he faces fellow Italian Luca Nardi in the first round on Tuesday. "The choice was not big but I'm very happy to play with Emma. I told her already to not get frustrated with me for my not-very-good volleys." World number 10 Emma Navarro reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year Australian Open and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Navarro, who also reached the US Open semi-finals last year, specialises in singles but has made several Grand Slam doubles appearances. But she has never won a doubles match at the US Open. A host of big names - including Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, Nick Kyrgios and Naomi Osaka - are also on the US Open mixed doubles entry list. Britain's Jack Draper is set to feature alongside Chinese world number six Zheng Qinwen. Jannik Sinner (centre) has parted company with physiotherapist Ulises Badio (left) and trainer Marco Panichi (right) Sinner is confident his decision to part with two core team members on the eve of Wimbledon will not affect his tournament chances. He opted to move on from trainer Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio who had been employed by the 23-year-old since September 2024, helping him retain his Australian Open title in January and reach the French Open final in June. Sinner reached the quarter-finals of last year's Wimbledon where he was beaten in five sets by Russian Daniil Medvedev.

The Italian has not played competitively since he was forced to retire in the fourth set of his semi-final with Carlos Alcaraz at Roland-Garros with a leg issue, but says he is ready to begin his campaign. “I didn't play much, honestly,” he told reporters at Wimbledon on Sunday. “It's been tough, of course, after French Open to don't play any tournament before Wimbledon, to prepare the grass season. “Basically I stayed without touching any racquet two full weeks, but the important thing was doing therapies and rehabilitation every day. Let's say I didn't take as a vacation the two weeks. I arrived here on Monday, so let's say one week of training, which was a little bit not really one week because I was sick a little bit two days…but at least we are here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz's first match on a grass court came just six years ago. The contest against Fabio Fognini will open Alcaraz's a bid for a third consecutive championship at the place. That's something only four men have achieved in the Open era, which began in 1968: Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Alcaraz already is 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, which includes going 2-0 at the French Open — which he won three weeks ago via a comeback from two sets down against No. 2-ranked Alcaraz became the youngest man to win a major trophy on each surface: grass, clay and hard courts. But he's got a fondness for the green stuff. “The most beautiful tennis that we can watch is on grass. “The movement is really tough, but when you get it, it's kind of (as though) you're flying.” He loves that it allows him to show off the variety in his game and all of the skills he possesses. He is as creative as it gets with a racket in hand, sometimes to his own detriment, and admits enjoying seeing replays on arena video screens after some of his best deliveries (that technology isn't used at the All England Club, but perhaps it should be). “I really want to hit slices, drop shots, going to the net all the time, playing aggressively,” said Alcaraz, who said he lost to two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray during a round of golf early in the week. “I think on grass it's the style that you have to play, so that's what I like the most.” It's instructive to hear what Djokovic had to say about Alcaraz after a straight-set loss in last year's final at the All England Club. “He just was better than me in every aspect of the game,” Djokovic said. Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies at Wimbledon but was the runner-up to Alcaraz in 2023 and 2024. When it comes to the idea of joining an elite group by completing a three-peat in two weeks' time, Alcaraz insisted that isn't the sort of thing he really cares about or spends time considering. But where it would place him in history? “I really want to lift the trophy,” Alcaraz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Wimbledon set to begin Monday, John McEnroe believes the American men are closing in on winning a major title. No American man has won a Grand Slam trophy since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. Pete Sampras was the last American man to win Wimbledon – in 2000. Fritz is coming off winning his fourth Eastbourne title, one of the warm-ups to Wimbledon played on grass. Fritz defeated fellow American Jenson Brooksby 7-5, 6-1 to extend his record for the most men's singles titles won in Eastbourne. “I definitely think that we're closer than we've been in quite a while,” McEnroe said this week on an ESPN conference call with reporters. In recent years, several American men have gone deep into majors. Last year, Fritz beat Tiafoe in the U.S. Open semifinals to become the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009, and the first at the Open since Roddick in 2006. In the final, Fritz lost to Italian Jannik Sinner in straights sets in a jam-packed Arthur Ashe Stadium where the crowd included Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, Jon Bon Jovi, Matthew McConaughey and Noah Lyles. Fritz, who opens Monday against huge-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, has never been past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. Shelton had his best finish at Wimbledon last year when he reached the fourth round. Tiafoe has twice reached the U.S. Open semis, but also has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon (2022). Paul advanced to the Australian Open semis in 2023 and the quarters at Wimbledon a year ago, where he lost in straight sets to Carlos Alcaraz. They have combined to win the last six major titles and show no signs of letting up. They have apparently picked up where the "Big 3" left off. Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer combined to win 66 major titles, depriving many other players, including all the Americans during that era, of winning majors. “I think that some of it was we just assumed that [American men winning majors] would keep happening in the early 2000s [after Sampras and Andre Agassi], and then when we realized that it wasn't, that all of a sudden legends came in... Federer, and Nadal [and] Djokovic,” McEnroe said. He added: "In terms of who we have, Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, Francis Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka. They're all sort of the same age. I think it's good when you have people pushing each other…. He's more like the type that I have been pushing. Don't focus all in it at 10 years old. Maybe play some other sports for a while. I think that's starting to make an impact in terms of our consistency.” On the women's side, two Americans have won both majors this year, with Madison Keys capturing her first Slam crown at the Australian Open and Coco Gauff winning an epic battle over world No. “On the women's side you have the two Grand Slam winners already this year are American, Madison and Coco,” 18-time major champion Chrissie Evert said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>No fan of the sport will ever forget the exhilarating 2008 Wimbledon final where, after rain breaks stopped play, and it got so dark visibility was poor, Spaniard Rafael Nadal beat world number one Roger Federer. However, not all is lost: now a young array of Gen Z tennis aces are bringing some sizzle back to the courts again, with their thrilling games and glamorous off-court lifestyles (including a rumoured romance between two players). The French Open last month saw a nail biting five and a half hour match as Carlos Alcaraz come back from three match points down to beat World No. And that's not the only news swirling around Alcaraz: he is rumoured to be in a relationship with fellow player Emma Raducanu - best known for winning the US Open in 2021, at the tender age of just 18. So it seems tennis is back with a bang, and here are some the players making it sexy again, ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on June 30 and will run through to July 13. As a Black woman and tennis player, Coco has said she is especially proud of her success. The prestigious list was curated by Time editors, who said they looked to 'extraordinary leaders working toward a more equal world' and 'trailblazers fighting for a more equitable future.' 'The 12 women on our 2024 list are pivotal figures from across the globe who have dedicated themselves to lifting up others as they rise,' the article read. Emma Raducanu shot to global prominence in 2021 when she won the US Open at just 18-years-old - a victory she has since spoken about as playing a role in causing stress and performance anxiety. However, she has been playing at a top level, and will no doubt be a big draw for many when it comes to Wimbledon (though she has her work cut out for her, facing some very tough opponents in the early rounds of the prestigious tournament). As is inevitable when it comes to very famous sports stars, 22-year-old Emma has been at the centre of romance rumours with another player - Carlos Alcaraz. Emma finally addressed the rumours surrounding her off-court connection with Alcaraz very recently. Raducanu was seen supporting Alcaraz last Thursday and Saturday, sparking talk around Queen's that there might be ‘something going on between them', as the pair were spotted laughing and joking together and arriving at the venue just minutes apart. Their most recent link-up came this week, with Alcaraz being confirmed as the latest global ambassador of Evian ahead of Wimbledon - the tournament's official water supplier since 2008. Raducanu also works with Evian, her collaborative work starting after she became the hottest property in British sport by winning the US Open in 2021, which led to her signing lucrative deals with the likes of Nike and Christian Dior. During a press conference, Raducanu was inevitably asked about the romance rumours, to which she smiled and said: 'We're just good friends.' Having lifted the famous Wimbledon trophy twice, he insists he's not getting distracted by the prospect of becoming only the fifth man to win three Wimbledon titles in a row. The Spaniard could join icons Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to complete a hat-trick if he can triumph on Centre Court once again. ‘I really want to win the title, I really want to lift the trophy,' Alcaraz has said. Meanwhile, off court, the player have been besieged with rumours that he is dating his sometimes doubles partner Emma Raducanu - who has said the two are 'just friends'. 'From a brand positioning profile and marketing perspective, it would be an absolute dream. With a current ATP ranking of number four, Draper has everything to play for as he prepares to take part in Wimbledon. He has a tough draw - should he get through to the quarter final, he will potentially face Novak Djokovic, who has amassed a record-breaking number of slam titles during his career. Draper was suffering with a hip injury earlier this year, but by March, he revealed he was feeling much better. I feel really strong in every area of my game.' ‘When Andy retired they said I was next in line,' said Draper, who was 27th in the world when Murray called it quits. ‘I didn't really think about it then but I have improved so much and put myself in this position. They are obviously big shoes to fill, I'm aware of that. Taylor Fritz will start his Wimbledon having won the Stuttgart Open title on June 15 (with a 6-3, 7-6 win against German player Alexander Zverev). The American athlete will no doubt be hoping to go further in the tournament this year, after admitting he felt 'hurt' after crashing out in the quarter final in 2024. He lost that match 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to Italian Lorenzo Musetti. 'Tough match yesterday, always hurts to come up just short but that's part of the game. Now all I can do is rest up, get back to work, and have a good flight home,' he added. After winning Eastbourne yesterday, with a 7-5 6-1 victory over fellow American Jenson Brooksby, Taylor has now won seven of his eight matches on grass this year. The world Number 5, who was last year's US Open runner-up, will no doubt now be eying that Wimbledon trophy. Commenting on the upcoming slam after his Eastbourne victory, Taylor said: 'I'm going to be ready to go. I'd much rather go into the tournament with confidence and a title.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis star Danielle Collins has teased Emma Raducanu after she dismissed speculation about a possible romantic relationship with Carlos Alcaraz. Raducanu and Alcaraz are accustomed to the limelight, but have sparked even more gossip since deciding to team up for mixed doubles at the forthcoming U.S. Open. While Raducanu's immediate attention is on her opening Wimbledon match against British compatriot Mimi Xu this Monday, she was asked about her rapport with Alcaraz during a media briefing. The 22-year-old quickly quashed suggestions of a budding romance. However, American tennis player Collins couldn't help but share Raducanu's succinct reply on social media and make a joke at the former U.S. Open champion's expense. In the lead-up to Wimbledon, Raducanu faced the press and was quizzed about the authenticity of rumors connecting her with Alcaraz in a romantic sense. The question came after the two stars were seen together in an Evian ad shoot. Following her comment, a journalist humorously suggested that it might be the perfect note to end the press conference. Collins, who is gearing up to take on Colombia's Camila Osorio at Wimbledon this Tuesday, couldn't resist joining in on the fun. She replied to a snippet of Raducanu's press conference on Instagram with mock outrage. Raducanu and Alcaraz are set to light up the U.S. Open as a formidable pair in a star-studded mixed doubles lineup this August. The young Spanish sensation, fresh off clinching his fifth Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros, is all geared up to join forces with Raducanu on the iconic courts of Flushing Meadows. "She's gonna be the boss," Alcaraz joked. "Yeah, I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have really good relationship with her. "So it's just gonna be interesting. I will try, you know, to put my doubles skill on it. Alcaraz revealed he had made a "special request" to team up with Raducanu and admitted that she initially left him hanging before giving an answer. However, Raducanu has since explained the reason behind her delay. "Gotta keep them on their toes!" "I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision." Through their collaboration, Raducanu will aim to capture another major victory at Flushing Meadows, building on her stunning teenage success story from the 2021 U.S. Open singles championship. As a result, Raducanu is on high alert for the challenge posed by 17-year-old wildcard Xu at Wimbledon. The British star and former U.S. Open champ is no stranger to Xu's playing style, having shared the court with her in practice sessions before their upcoming first-round showdown at the All England Club. It's going to be a really different match. For her, it's one where there's nothing to lose.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Madison Keys has voiced her concerns about the current political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, suggesting it has had a negative impact on global kindness.The American tennis star, who won the Australian Open this year, is set to face Romanian player Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round of Wimbledon on June 30. However, before she attempts to break through the quarter-final barrier, she expressed her struggle to remain optimistic during Trump's second term in the White House. These comments were made during a discussion about her non-profit organisation, Kindness Wins. "But also not being oblivious to what's going on and the realities of everything. Trump has come under fire for a series of controversial policies, from his stern stance on Iran to stringent immigration controls that have sparked nationwide protests. Over 17,200 individuals were deported in April alone, as per the latest statistics from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The US President is also facing intense scrutiny over his dealings with Canada, in addition to his proposed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' – a move potentially slashing various social programmes whilst carving out new tax reliefs. Her foundation has been busy refurbishing facilities like the JV Morris Tennis Center, reflecting its ever-growing influence in both digital realms and grassroots communities. In a bid to foster youth development, her #KindnessWinsDay campaign in 2024 granted a £3,600 to the Denton Johnson Tennis Program in Central Florida – just one of many ventures her foundation arms are extending to uplift the nation's children. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. "Tennis has always given me a safe space to grow and find who I am," declared Keys. On the tennis court, Keys' talent continues to shine brightly. She is ranked sixth in the world heading into Wimbledon. Toppling giants like Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, Keys clinched her much-deserved maiden Grand Slam title. That victory occurred just weeks after Trump resumed office in January. Regardless of how far she progresses in Wimbledon, Keys remains dedicated to her mission both on and off the court.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prior to arriving in London for Wimbledon, the last time Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka shared a court was in the 2025 Roland Garros final. That ended with Gauff winning a three-set thriller to claim her second major singles title. Following the match, Sabalenka‘s press conference comments picked up a lot of traction, as fans believe she was downplaying Gauff's victory over her. 1, Sabalenka, repeatedly expressed her disappointment for playing so poorly in a final, and not handling the windy conditions well. She even went on to argue that if Iga Swiatek had beaten her in the semifinals, Swiatek would've certainly defeated Gauff in the championship match. Sabalenka apologized, but her comments were immediately characterized as distasteful and dismissive of Gauff, the world No. 2 player, who has three straight wins over Swiatek. She gave her frequent opponent the benefit of the doubt, understanding how emotional one can be after a devastating loss. On Friday, Gauff showed how she didn't take the comments personally at all, collaborating with Sabalenka for a couple of TikToks as they shared the court with each other while preparing for Wimbledon. Making two separate videos, Sabalenka shared one of the two doing a choreographed dance, with the caption, “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together.” The video Gauff shared was of the two lip syncing a Kim Kardashian audio saying, “Ok guys, we're back. We're good, so you guys should be too,” making it clear there's no beef between the two tennis stars. That's evident when they are on the court together, having a head-to-head record of 6-5 in Gauff's favor. Both of Gauff's majors came with wins against Sabalenka in the final, and they could be on pace to meet in another final with Wimbledon starting on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian legend Novak Djokovic agreed that Wimbledon could offer his best chance to claim a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title. While attending the pre-Championships press conference on Saturday, the 38-year-old was asked if he believed this year's Wimbledon could be his best chance to win the 25th Grand Slam title and could it be his last dance at the grass-court Grand Slam this year. "Whether it could be my last dance, I'm not sure, as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next," said Djokovic prior to his 20th appearance at Wimbledon. "My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. That's the goal, but you never know at this stage." "And yes, I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play in Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level," the seven-time Wimbledon champion continued. He won four titles consecutively before being beaten by Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years. I'm trying to play the best tennis in Grand Slams and trying to win Grand Slams. "I think I still played a decent level of tennis that showed me that I can still play on a very high level at the later stages." "That's what is also giving me an extra motivation to keep going. 1 Jannik Sinner who defeated him in the French Open semifinals earlier this year.</p>
