Democratic mayoral candidate denies Trump's accusation that he is communist while reaffirming push to tax wealthy

Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to cut New York City off from federal funds if favored mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, “doesn't behave himself” should he be elected.

Mamdani, meanwhile, denied that he was – as the president said – a communist. But he reaffirmed his commitment to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers while saying: “I don't think that we should have billionaires.”

In an interview with Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, Trump argued that a Mamdani victory was “inconceivable” because he perceived the candidate to be “a pure communist”.

He added: “Let's say this – if he does get in, I'm going to be president, and he's going to have to do the right thing, or they're not getting any money. He's got to do the right thing or they're not getting any money.”

More than $100bn flows to the city from the federal government through different entities and programs, according to the city's comptroller last year.

Speaking Sunday with NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, Mamdani said, “no, I am not” a communist.

He also said that he had “already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am – ultimately because he wants to distract from what I'm fighting for”.

Mamdani said he was inspired by the US civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr, who once remarked: “Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism. There has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country.”

He then reiterated his intent to raise taxes on New York's wealthiest as part of a campaign pledge “to shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods”.

“I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality – and ultimately what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” Mamdani said. “And I look forward to work with everyone, including billionaires, to make a city that is fairer for all of them.”

Mamdani said the proposal reflected “a description of what we see right now”.

“It's not driven by race,” he said. “It's more of an assessment of what neighborhoods are being undertaxed versus overtaxed.

“It is not to work backwards from a racial assessment of neighborhoods or our city. Rather, it's to ensure that we actually have an equal playing field.”

Many New Yorkers and moderate Democratic politicians have expressed concern over Mamdani's win over former governor Andrew Cuomo in the 24 June primary for the Democratic nomination.

Among those to endorse him was progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But he has not been endorsed by many other prominent Democratic party figures, including the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, who said coolly after his win: “Obviously, there's areas of difference in our positions, but I also think we need to have those conversations.”

Mamdani said on Sunday that he was looking forward to discussions with Hochul, saying: “Ultimately, my policies, my vision, it's driven by an assessment of what's actually happening.”

Asked if he thought moderate Democrats were afraid of him, Mamdani said: “I think that people are catching up to this election.

“Ultimately what we're showing is that by putting working people first, by returning to the roots of the Democratic party, we actually have a path out of this moment where we're facing authoritarianism in Washington DC” under the Trump administration.

In his comments on Mamdani's having secured the Democrats' nomination in the heavily Democratic city, Trump said: “It's shocking.”

“I used to say we will never have a socialist in this country,” the president said, in part.

Asked about Mamdani's proposals to oppose his administration's immigration crackdown and to arrest Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he sets foot in New York, Trump said the mayoral candidate would “be very unsuccessful” on both counts.

“He's a radical left lunatic,” Trump said.

Mamdani, for his part, said Democrats “need to be a party that's not just against Donald Trump – but also for something”.

“And our campaign was for working people, bringing dignity back into those lives,” Mamdani said.

Statement condemns comments made by London punk duo while police confirm investigation is under way

Glastonbury 2025 – live

The organisers of Glastonbury have said they are “appalled” by comments made by Bob Vylan after the punk duo appeared to incite violence, something the festival said went against its ethos of “hope, unity, peace and love”.

At the West Holts stage on Saturday afternoon, the London group led a chant of “death, death to the IDF”, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.

Describing himself as a “violent punk”, the frontman of the duo, Bobby Vylan, said: “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that's the only language some people speak, unfortunately.”

Their set, which was before that of the Irish rap trio Kneecap, was broadcast live on the BBC but has since been removed from its streaming services. A BBC spokesperson previously said some of Bob Vylan's comments were “deeply offensive”.

A decision had been made before the Kneecap performance not to screen it live, due to fears it would breach “editorial guidelines” on impartiality.

Meanwhile, Avon and Somerset police said the force was investigating both performances to see if any offences had been committed.

Emily Eavis, the organiser of Glastonbury, issued a joint statement condemning Bob Vylan's words, writing: “As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism. We will always believe in – and actively campaign for – hope, unity, peace and love.

“With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer's presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs.

“However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan yesterday. Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”

Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, told the Telegraph: “There is no excuse for this kind of appalling hate speech. I said that Kneecap should not be given a platform and that goes for any other performers making threats or inciting violence. The BBC needs to explain how these scenes came to be broadcast.”

Wes Streeting earlier described the chanting as “appalling” and said the BBC and Glastonbury had questions to answer, but he also had strong words for Israel.

Responding to a statement from the Israeli embassy condemning the performance, the health secretary said: “Firstly, I do think that if I take the equivalent of the war in Ukraine, I'm unequivocal about which side of that war I'm on. I want Ukraine to win. Would I be celebrating or chanting for the death of Russian soldiers? No, I want to see an end to the war, and I want to see an end to the conflict.

“I'd also say to the Israeli embassy, get your own house in order in terms of the conduct of your own citizens and the settlers in the West Bank. So, you know, I think there's a serious point there by the Israeli embassy I take seriously. I wish they'd take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously.”

During the festival, artists from the full cross-section of the music scene showed their support for the Palestinian cause.

CMAT and the Libertines shouted “Free Palestine” during their sets – as did Gary Lineker at the end of his talk – while Joy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith all had Palestinian flags or keffiyeh scarves on stage.

During her set early Sunday afternoon, the musician Nadine Shah performed in front of a backdrop showing the destruction in Gaza. She told the crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags: “I just don't like seeing people being killed.”

Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of the activist group Palestine Action, whom the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has planned to proscribe as a terror organisation, if a Commons vote goes her way next week.

It read: “Palestine Action is intervening to stop a genocide. It is acting to save life. We deplore the government's decision to proscribe it. Labelling non-violent direct action as terrorism is an abuse of language and an attack on democracy.

“The real threat to the life of the nation comes not from Palestine Action, but from the home secretary's efforts to ban it. We call on the government to withdraw its proscription of Palestine action and to stop arming Israel.”

Shah added: “And if I read this out after 4 July, I can potentially be prosecuted for that.”

The Israeli embassy said of the Bob Vylan performance that it was “deeply disturbed by the inflammatory and hateful rhetoric expressed on stage at the Glastonbury festival”.

A statement on X said: “Freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out – especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.

“Chants such as ‘Death to the IDF' and ‘From the river to the sea' are slogans that advocate for the dismantling of the state of Israel and implicitly call for the elimination of Jewish self-determination. When such messages are delivered before tens of thousands of festivalgoers and met with applause, it raises serious concerns about the normalisation of extremist language and the glorification of violence.”

Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending tariff discussions because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting Digital Services Tax.ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to broaden his list of demands on Canada to re-open trade talks, listing his past grievances about Canada's supply management policies that control production and imports of eggs, dairy and poultry.

Mr. Trump made the comments in a pre-recorded interview with Fox News Channel host Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday morning.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mr. Trump agreed earlier this month at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta. to negotiate an economic and security deal within 30 days.

The 30-day plan raised expectations that Canada might be able to eliminate or reduce the series of tariffs the Trump administration has imposed on Canada this year.

However, Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending those talks because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting a Digital Services Tax (DST) from large multinationals such as Netflix and Amazon as of Monday, retroactive to 2022.

Mr. Trump's statement on Friday had mentioned supply management, but said he was “terminating” all trade discussions with Canada because of the “egregious” DST.

In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked about his plan to stop all trade discussions with Canada.

“Until such time as they drop certain taxes, yeah,” he answered. “People don't realize, Canada is very nasty to deal with.”

He then repeated his past objections with Canada's agricultural policies, which set high tariffs on imports above certain exempted levels.

“Our farmers want to send it. They have to pay 200, 300, 400 per cent. People don't know that.”

He also said, “I love Canada” and “hopefully we'll be fine with Canada” before repeating his desire for Canada to be part of the U.S.

“Frankly, Canada should be the 51st state. It really should, because Canada relies entirely on the United States. We don't rely on Canada,” he said.

Opinion: Sixty years ago, a philosopher said Canada would be absorbed by America. He could still be right

Prior to breaking for summer, Parliament approved the Bloc Québécois's Bill C-202, related to supply management.

The short bill aims to hamstring the government's ability to make concessions related to the existing tariffs or quotas in any trade negotiations.

Audrey Champoux, the Prime Minister's press secretary, declined to comment further Sunday on the President's position on trade talks, pointing instead to the statement the Prime Minister's Office issued Friday.

That brief statement said the Canadian government “will continue to engage in these complex negotiations with the United States in the best interests of Canadian workers and businesses.”

As of Monday June 30, affected companies will be required to file a return and submit taxes owed, retroactive to 2022.

The Parliamentary Budget Officer has previously estimated that the DST would bring in about $1.2-billion per year if implemented. Last year's federal budget provided a lower estimate, saying it would bring in $2.3 billion in 2024-25, covering the 2022, 2023, and 2024 taxation years and then $900 million in each of the following four years.

Many of the large multinationals who would be required to pay the DST have long lobbied against the move. 

Joel Kaplan, the chief global affairs officer for Meta, praised Mr. Trump on X Friday for calling off trade talks with Canada because of the DST.

“Thank you, President Trump, for standing up for American tech companies in the face of unprecedented attacks from other governments,” he wrote.

Unifor National President Lana Payne, who is a member of the Prime Minister's Council on Canada-U.S. Relations, responded online by saying the President keeps changing what his issue is with Canada.

“First he said it was about fentanyl and the border. Then supply management. Then autos. Then lumber. Then banks. Then steel and aluminum. Now it's our tax system - which other countries and sovereign nations do,” she wrote on X Friday. “There is no rational consistent objective other than to break us. And as for the tech bros needing protecting from a little tax. Come on.” 

A 2024 report by the U.S.-based Tax Foundation said at the time that 18 countries in addition to Canada have implemented some form of DST, including Austria, France, India and the United Kingdom.

The report said that about half of all European countries have either announced, proposed or implemented a DST. 

Canadian business groups, including the Business Council of Canada, have long warned that the unilateral implementation of a DST could risk undermining Canada's economic relationship with the U.S.

Shifting from debating difference to seeking shared meaning isn't just theoretical. I've seen it work

I was born in Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when religion became the architecture of public life. But it was precisely this fusion of faith and power that forced my family to flee. We were persecuted not for breaking laws but for belonging to a minority religious community, the Bahá'ís – a persecution that continues today. This experience taught me how religion can be used to exclude, to dehumanise, to dominate. But it also taught me that ignoring religion is not the answer.

More than 80% of the world's population identifies with a religion. Yet in many parts of the world – especially in the west – religion is treated as a private matter, something best kept out of polite conversation, or at worst, a source of division and danger. We live in a paradox: a deeply religious world that increasingly doesn't know how to talk about religion.

This silence isn't neutral. It creates a kind of cultural illiteracy – especially at a time when religion continues to shape geopolitics, social movements and personal lives, from the rise of religious nationalism to faith-based responses to humanitarian crises. And in places like the United States, it's becoming even more central to public discourse, often with high political stakes.

So how do we talk about religion in a world that needs moral clarity but fears moral language?

One idea that has helped me reframe how we talk about religion comes from my own faith – the Bahá'í concept of progressive revelation. It teaches that the world's major religions are expressions of the same spiritual reality, revealed at different times to meet the evolving needs of humanity. They are not rival ideologies but chapters in a single story. Not different truths but different reflections of one truth.

Imagine if we approached religion not as a set of camps to defend or oppose but as a shared inheritance. What if we stopped asking which one is right and started asking what they're trying to show us – about justice, humility, forgiveness, the soul and the sacredness of life?

This shift – from debating difference to seeking shared meaning – isn't just theoretical. I've seen it work.

In refugee communities in the Middle East, I witnessed how grassroots interfaith efforts helped displaced people from opposing religious backgrounds begin to heal. In one camp in Jordan, Christian and Muslim women began cooking together during Ramadan and Easter, eventually hosting communal feasts for the wider community. These weren't institutional programs but quiet acts of dignity and repair – rooted in faith and in the will to see the human behind the label.

In my doctoral research on Syrian religious-minority refugees in Berlin, I found that secular integration policies often failed to account for the central role religion played in people's sense of identity, belonging and healing. Integration thrived not when religion was ignored but when it was engaged – through interfaith dialogue, shared spiritual spaces or recognition of religious holidays. These approaches didn't erase difference. They helped people move forward together. Religion became less of a dividing line and more of a connective thread.

Even here, in my suburban neighbourhood in Aotearoa New Zealand, I see glimpses of this every week. On our street families come from Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Hindu, Bahá'í and other diverse backgrounds. Every Friday afternoon I host a simple class for the children of the neighbourhood. We sing, tell stories and explore themes like kindness, truthfulness and the nobility of the human spirit. It's a space for the children to discover their spiritual identity and their capacity to contribute to the world around them. Over time this has quietly knit our community together. Parents, too, have found connection – not through sameness but through a shared desire for their children to grow into just and compassionate human beings.

This idea – that spiritual truth unfolds over time – has changed how I live. It's shaped how I raise my children, how I relate to neighbours of different beliefs and how I engage in public life. It helps me stay curious instead of defensive and to approach others not through fixed categories but with an openness to what we might learn from one another.

And that's the heart of it, really: moral imagination – the ability to see not just what is but what could be. It invites us to ask new kinds of questions:

What does it mean to live a meaningful life?

How do we hold both reverence and reason in the same hand?

What truths do our traditions carry that the world still needs?

What happens when we stop talking about religion and start listening with it?

These are not easy questions. But they matter. While secular frameworks offer many tools, they often fall short of naming the deepest yearnings of the human spirit. And while religion has been misused, it can also be reclaimed – as a source of clarity, compassion and shared purpose.

Recognising the wisdom in religion doesn't mean denying the harm it's caused. It means telling the full story – separating faith from fanaticism and choosing not silence but better language: language rooted in humility, inquiry and hope.

We don't need less religion in public life. We need better ways of talking about it – ways that allow both believers and non-believers to engage meaningfully, with honesty and depth.

Maybe it starts with a simple shift. What if the world's religions are not competing claims but reflections of one unfolding truth? What if, beneath all our differences, there's just one story being told in many tongues?

If we believed that, we might stop asking who is right –and start asking what's possible. And maybe then, we'd finally begin to build the world we all long to live in.

Democrats are hoping to draw out the bill's passage while highlighting provisions expected to harm US families.

After an hourslong delay from the initial goal of noon, U.S. Senate Republicans on Saturday night kicked off the process of passing their 940-page budget reconciliation package — which the chamber's Democrats are making the clerks read in full, not only to draw out the process but also to highlight the various provisions expected to harm American families.

“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don't realize what's in it,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the chamber's floor. “If Senate Republicans won't tell the American people what's in this bill, then Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish.”

The updated bill text was released late Friday. Republicans then spent Saturday scrambling for enough support for the procedural vote. Ultimately, only Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) voted with Democrats against considering the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which U.S. President Donald Trump wants to sign by July 4, or Independence Day.

Tillis explained his position in a lengthy statement, saying in part: “I cannot support this bill in its current form. It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”

Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) pointed out Saturday that “while Republican senators are securing baubles and trinkets for their political donors, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the Senate bill will cut $930 billion from Medicaid.” That preliminary analysis doesn't account for other attacks on healthcare, including the Affordable Care Act.

“Just as before, these cruel cuts to Americans' healthcare will strike a mortal blow to rural healthcare, and threaten the health and safety of kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities, and working families across the country,” Wyden warned. “Life and death decisions of this magnitude should not be subjected to this rushed and reckless process. I urge Republican senators not to travel down this dangerous path: there is no band-aid that can heal these dangerous, deadly cuts.”

It's 2AM on a Sunday and I'm heading to the Capitol to FORCE a full reading of the Republicans' 940-page bill.This bill will rip health care coverage away from 16 million people and cut food assistance.It's sick. And we will not stand for it.

Paul suggested on social media Saturday evening that the GOP bill would add too much to the national debt. In his post on X, the senator also took a swipe at the platform's owner: the richest man on Earth, Elon Musk, who was the de facto leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency until his ugly exit from government last month.

Musk, meanwhile, also took to X to blast the package, criticizing the proposed taxes on wind and solar projects: “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

While celebrating the 51-49 procedural vote — and specifically praising Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for their crucial support — Trump lashed out at both Paul and Tillis on his Truth Social platform Saturday, threatening the latter with a primary challenge.

Politico reported that “Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol shortly after 8:00 pm to break a possible tie,” with Johnson, Paul, and Tillis having already voted “no.” Johnson changed his vote after negotiations that involved Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and the other holdouts listed by Trump.

One win for critics of the megabill is the removal of Lee's provision to force the sale of public lands, which had generated widespread opposition, including from some Republican lawmakers. Lee had tried to slip a rewritten version of the measure back into the package after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled against it earlier this week.

Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez on Saturday held a rally outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in New York City to promote her recently introduced No Masks for ICE Act.

“We would never accept it if the NYPD operated in masks without names or badges — and we shouldn't accept it from ICE either,” Velázquez (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.

“When agents hide their faces and identities they create chaos, fear, and open the door to abuse,” she continued. “Immigrant communities are left wondering if they're being arrested or kidnapped. That's not how law enforcement should operate in a democracy. This bill is about restoring basic standards and bringing basic transparency and accountability to immigration enforcement.”

As the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works to deliver on Republican President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations, federal agents, including those with ICE, have taken immigrants into custody while wearing masks and plain clothes — sparking alarm over abuse by anonymous agents and also copycat criminals.

Velázquez's bill would bar ICE agents from wearing facial coverings during immigration enforcement, unless medically necessary or required for safety. It would also require written justification for any mask use, agents to wear clothing displaying their name and affiliation with ICE, and DHS to report annually to Congress on any related complaints and disciplinary actions.

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CBS News on Saturday that masks are optional but that “ICE law enforcement and their families are being targeted and are facing a 500% increase in assaults… due to the demonization of ICE by hostile groups and irresponsible elected officials.”

“Politicians and activists must turn the temperature down and tone down their rhetoric,” the spokesperson added.

Immigrant rights advocates, legal experts, and Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) also joined the rally. He noted in a statement that “the past few months we've seen a disturbing pattern: masked, plain-clothes agents ambushing immigrants outside courtrooms and on city streets.”

“If their operations are legitimate and above-board, why is there a need for anonymity, and why don't they need warrants to come onto private property?” Nadler asked. “This bill will put an end to those intimidation tactics, restore transparency, and ensure the public knows exactly who is wielding federal power in our communities.”

Today, outside 26 Federal Plaza, we joined Congress members @velazquez.house.gov + @nadler.house.gov, @thenyic.bsky.social, @legalaidnyc.bsky.social, and allies to spotlight the No Masks for ICE Act to call for immediate federal action to end secretive, unaccountable immigration enforcement.

The rally was held at 26 Federal Plaza, a 41-floor building in Lower Manhattan that houses an ICE field office and one of New York City's immigration courts. Earlier this month, NYC Comptroller Brad Lander — then a Democratic mayoral candidate — was arrested by federal agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court at the building.

On the 10th floor, “there is a holding area where immigration authorities have typically held a few dozen immigrants at a time for a few hours before transferring them to detention centers,” The New York Times reported a few days after Lander's arrest. “But as the Trump administration expands its immigration crackdown, the space has become overcrowded and people sleep sprawled on the floor, sometimes for days, according to those who have spent time there.”

The Times also noted a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem signed by nine of the state's Democratic members of Congress — Nadler and Velázquez plus Reps. Yvette Clarke, Adriano Espaillat, Dan Goldman, Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ritchie Torres—who want to conduct oversight of the field office, which they argue is a detention facility.

“Congressional oversight is essential to bring transparency to the conduct of the Department of Homeland Security,” they wrote. “Given the overaggressive and excessive force used to handcuff and detain elected officials in public, DHS's refusal to allow members of Congress to observe the conditions for immigrants behind closed doors begs the obvious question: What are you hiding?”

Following the introduction of Velázquez's bill, two Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and their official badges when detaining or arresting people.

That legislation is led by Goldman and Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and backed by dozens of their Democratic colleagues. Espaillat said that “if you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous. DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes.”

Storytelling is pushing back against the dominant idea that queerness and rural life are incompatible.

In the years since our now-Vice President J.D. Vance published his disingenuous memoir Hillbilly Elegy — which many Appalachians criticized as “poverty porn” designed to launch his political career — Appalachians have continued our tradition of “talking back.” We published books like What You're Getting Wrong About Appalachia (2018) and Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy (2019) to challenge the stereotypes and misrepresentations of the region used by both Vance and the liberal pundits who jumped at the opportunity to blame the 2016 election on us.

While these responses included some depictions of queerness in Appalachia — and while the now-defunct Instagram account Queer Appalachia and its zine Electric Dirt gained significant popularity around this time — there remained a noticeable lack of books specifically focused on LGBTQ life in the region.

Many queer Appalachians felt it was crucial to speak for ourselves, and, in recent years, publishers like Haymarket Books, WVU Press, and the University Press of Kentucky have helped meet that need, releasing a wave of books that highlight the diversity of Appalachian stories.

“[W]hat I have seen is that regional presses (both indie presses and university presses) have really committed to publishing books that represent the South and Appalachia in all their complexity,” Neema Avashia, author of Another Appalachia: Coming Up Queer and Indian in a Mountain Place, told Truthout. “And so, because of that, I do think we are seeing more queer books on the shelves reflecting our stories than we did previously.”

“[T]here's definitely an upsurge of queer voices breaking into the mainstream traditional publishing platforms,” Davis Shoulders, series editor of University Press of Kentucky's Appalachian Futures: Black, Native, & Queer Voices and owner of the bookstore Atlas Books in Johnson City, Tennessee, told Truthout. His edited collection, Queer Communion: Religion in Appalachia, is set to be released in October.

“There's a hell of a boom, and I'm absolutely here for it. I want to lift every voice — Black, Brown, queer, disabled, fat, weird, excluded — across Appalachia,” Willie Edward Taylor Carver Jr., author of Gay Poems for Red States, told Truthout.

“[I]t's about damn time! There have always been queer and trans people, and writers, in Appalachia and the South. I'm so grateful folks across the region and beyond are getting to hear our stories now, after so many decades of erasure and silencing, internally and externally,” Rae Garringer, founder and director of Country Queers, told Truthout.

These authors told Truthout that it is crucial for queer Appalachians to tell our own stories, preserve the voices of our community, and make sense of our identities in a region where we face political violence and erasure — from both within and outside Appalachia.

“[N]arrative creates meaning. It changes the DNA of the world we live in. We know this instinctively,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. said. “And for a while, we were on a path — slow for some, faster for others — toward something better. Then fascism shifted the tracks. Now it's instinct again: speak or die. Tell the story. Change the DNA. We have to wrest the pen back — from the fascists and from the ‘allies' who use progressive language to climb the ladder, only to snatch the pen away from those they leave behind.”

This pride, Truthout invited these authors to discuss their work, the boom in queer Appalachia stories, and the importance of queer Appalachian storytelling.

In 2017, Garringer wrote a thesis on queerness in Appalachia titled The Republic of Fabulachia: Queer Visions for a Post-Coal Appalachian Future. At the time, I had just completed my master's degree, started a queer Appalachian zine called Marx in the Mountains, and was captivated by the idea that my identities as Appalachian and queer could coexist with each other. This is what inspired me in 2022 to publish Y'all Means All: The Emerging Voices Queering Appalachia — which gave queer Appalachians the space to describe ourselves — and co-edit Deviant Hollers: Queering Appalachian Ecologies for a Sustainable Future, a collection released in 2024 that explores what exactly is queer about Appalachia.

In the past few years, Garringer has published two books expanding on their work around queerness in the region. Their first book, Country Queers: A Love Letter, published last year, builds on their Country Queers oral history project.

“Country Queers: A Love Letter is a book of photos, oral history excerpts, and my own reflections on a decade of travelling around what is currently known as the United States interviewing rural and small town LGBTQIA2S+ [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, and Two Spirit] folks. The Country Queers oral history project, which I founded in 2013, was born out of my frustration at how hard it was to find easily accessible rural queer stories about anything other than violence and death, and how absent rural queerness was from both local small town narratives and national queer narratives at the time,” Garringer told Truthout. “The book is a culmination of that 12-year strong project, and includes interview excerpts with folks from Massachusetts to Texas, North Carolina to Arkansas, West Virginia to California.”

Just this year, they also released an edited collection titled To Belong Here: A New Generation of Queer, Trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachian Writers, which features the voices of dozens of queer, trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachians sharing how they make sense of life in the region through poetry and essays.

“To Belong Here: A New Generation of Queer, Trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachian Writers is a collection of essays and poems by a gender expansive, multiracial group of writers raised and/or based in Appalachia. The book wrestles with how we navigate a complicated sense of belonging to a region that doesn't always love us back,” Garringer said. “I wanted to help create a queer Appalachian anthology that featured more Black, Brown, and Indigenous writers, and more trans writers than previous anthologies from the region had. And I wanted to encourage organizers who I know are brilliant writers, but who aren't often encouraged to prioritize their creative work over their movement work, to write something for this collection.”

Such queer creative nonfiction — which include essay collections, queer memoirs, poetry collections, and hybrid works that mix all three — has also grown increasingly popular. Notable works include Another Appalachia by Avashia, Tar Hollow Trans by Stacy Jane Grover, and Gay Poems for Red States by Edward Taylor Carver Jr., all of which offer powerful, nuanced perspectives on queer life in the Appalachian region.

Another Appalachia reflects on growing up queer in southern West Virginia as the daughter of Indian immigrants. “My book is about what it was like to grow up in southern West Virginia as the daughter of Indian immigrants in a community where there were very few people of color, and what it was like to make sense of my own queerness in the context of profound silence about queerness. It's also about how the experiences of my childhood continue to shape how I understand the world today,” Avashia told Truthout. “In some ways, it is an effort to complicate readers' understanding of Appalachia, and the folks who live there.”

In Tar Hollow Trans, Grover reflects on her transgender identity through the lens of Appalachian culture and tradition. Returning to the landscape of her upbringing, she sought to understand how her personal experiences intersect with the region's values and the people who shaped her early life. In doing so, she uncovered meaningful links between Appalachian and transgender identities — connections that go beyond a shared sense of marginalization.

Gay Poems for Red States responds to the ongoing harm of anti-LGBTQ+ movements by celebrating the possibility of living a life rooted in pride, beauty, and belonging.

“I wrote Gay Poems for Red States during a moment in my life when so much I had fought for — my 20-year career, the safety of my students, the feeling that I belonged — was under attack by anti-queer extremists,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. told Truthout. “In that moment, the queer kid I used to be — this kid I once saw as weak and vulnerable — spoke up. He reminded me how strong he was. How much he had always known about survival. And through a series of poems that felt like he was writing them through me, I learned how I would survive, too. Because he taught me.”

His next book, Tore All to Pieces, is a novel that is a “reminder that if we are a painting, then queer folks — gay men and women, trans kids — we can't be unpainted. We are each other's context. In all the ways, good and bad.”

This work continues a rich tradition of queer fiction writing in Appalachia. Collections like Walk Till the Dogs Get Mean: Meditations on the Forbidden from Contemporary Appalachia, published in 2015, and LGBTQ Fiction and Poetry from Appalachia, published in 2019, alongside the fiction writing of celebrated authors such as Carter Sickels and Silas House, have long brought vibrant, complex queer stories from the region to life.

For example, Sickels's The Prettiest Star is set in 1986 and follows a young queer man living with HIV who returns to his hometown in the Appalachian region of southern Ohio.

“I remember what it was like growing up then, and I wanted to document the fear and hatred and cruelty, the intense homophobia, and show how the government, families, media, and churches turned their back on people with AIDS,” Sickels told Truthout. “I also wanted to look at the crisis through the lens of rural America and explore what happens when a queer person, dying of AIDS, returns to the family and the small town that rejected him. It's a story about a family and place.”

Similarly, House's Southernmost, Lark Ascending, and The Tulip Poplars (forthcoming in 2026) explore queerness, faith, love, and resistance across vastly different genres — ranging from contemporary drama to dystopian adventure to sweeping historical romance — while centering queer characters in ways that challenge dominant narratives about both the South and Appalachia.

“My main goal in writing about queer characters is to show them in authentic ways. I think too often we're shown one of two ways: as either fun and partying with limitless resources or miserable and abused. Of course we contain multitudes,” House told Truthout. “In my books I want my queer characters to be multidimensional and I want their orientation to only be one part of them and their story.”

Together, these authors — and the communities they write with and for — are not only queering the canon of Appalachian literature but also asserting that queer and trans people have always belonged in these mountains, shaping the region's past, present, and future.

These authors emphasize that queer Appalachian stories are more vital than ever in today's political climate, pushing back against the dominant narrative that queerness and rural life are incompatible.

Rebecca Scott, co-editor of Deviant Hollers, told Truthout, “Queer stories right now are important across the board. These stories counteract the dehumanization processes going on against trans and queer people, Black and Brown people, Indigenous people, disabled people, and women in Appalachia and across the world.”

“I think queer Appalachian stories are always important, but especially now. I think they offer needed mirrors to queer folks in states whose legislative agendas seek to [enact] profound and lasting harm to queer people,” Avashia told Truthout. “At the same time, I also think they force folks outside Appalachia to reckon with demographic complexity, and not write off entire regions of the country as undeserving of solidarity. Queer people are everywhere in this country, and queer Appalachian stories only underscore that fact.”

Echoing this sentiment, House pointed out the long-standing misconception that queer people do not exist in rural areas. “For one thing, there's long been this notion that there are no queer people in Appalachia or rural places and that's obviously not true. So, we need to tell these stories to make sure people know we have existed here for as long as there have been people here,” House explained. “We are going backwards as a nation and it seems like we have been, on LGBTQ issues, ever since marriage equality passed 10 years ago. This whole faction was so outraged by that that they've been turning back the clock as hard as they can and the main focus of their bigotry and hatred is aimed at our trans siblings. So, telling these stories is important because being visible is important.”

Sickels expressed the cultural appetite driving this storytelling movement: “I think people are hungry for nuanced, complex, diverse stories that dismantle the stereotypes of Appalachia as this monolith of straightness and whiteness. Queer and trans people, Black people, people of color, immigrants, all live in Appalachia, and it feels important, even urgent, to shine a light on these stories and voices,” Sickels told Truthout. “Queer stories are stories of resistance, community, and survival, and we need those more than ever right now.”

“Appalachia is incredibly powerful,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. said. “She is Black, Brown, queer, trans, liberal, smart, open-minded, and fierce. She is also all of the other things we say she is. And in every form, she is Appalachian.”

As threats to LGBTQ communities mount across the United States, queer Appalachian authors are not just telling their stories — they are reclaiming the narrative of an entire region and writing a future rooted in visibility, resistance, and care.

“I truly believe that Appalachian country queers are some of the kindest, most creative, most brilliant, and best organized people in the world,” Garringer told Truthout. “I think rural queer and trans folks, especially those of us living in ‘deep red' states and far from major cities, have a lot of expertise around how to survive these times, and how to take care of each other along the way.”

In the words of Shoulders: “Queer Appalachians are the future.”

            If you're someone who clicks on an article about political engagement, you're probably a person who likes keeping up with the news. Maybe you find yourself constantly scrolling social media. You care deeply about politics, and with so much happening, you want to make sure you're on top of it all.
    


            You're not alone — but most of the country doesn't share your approach to the news.
    


The latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows that the attention divide splits Americans roughly into thirds. There's a high-attention group, consisting of the 32% saying they frequently seek out the latest news. A middle group of 31% has people who say they follow major developments but don't seek them out. And then there's the lower-attention group: 25% who say they pay attention only when necessary and another 12% who tune out altogether.
    


            Those fault lines are key to understanding American politics. Highly engaged Americans were more averse to sending in troops to the demonstrations in Los Angeles, according to other polls this year. President Donald Trump scored better on immigration among voters who hadn't heard as much about specific, high-profile detentions or deportations. And highly engaged Americans, much more than the other groups, believe that the nation's democracy is under attack.
    


            Those at either end of the ideological spectrum are the mostly closely plugged in: Fifty-one percent of those who call themselves very liberal and 47% of those who say they're very conservative fall into this group, compared with 35% of those who call themselves only somewhat liberal, and fewer than 3 in 10 who say they're moderate (29%) or somewhat conservative (22%).
    


            Robert Timm, a 75-year-old Democrat from Ukiah, California, has a daily routine: He starts his day reading the latest headlines on Yahoo, frequently talks politics with his wife, and ends the evening watching the news on television, particularly MSNBC.
    


            “I'm typically watching it fairly closely because I'm concerned about a lot of things that are happening in the country,” said Timm, one of the 2,539 people included in the survey. Many of those concerns center on Trump, who Timm says is “obviously trying to do what he wants, regardless of how it affects the people in the country.”
    


            Older Americans are notably likelier to fall into this category: Fifty-two percent of those older than 65 say they frequently seek out political news, compared with one-third or fewer among any younger age group. Those with college degrees and in wealthier households are also somewhat more likely than average to seek out the news, as are White Americans and men.
    


            Among the highly engaged, roughly 9 in 10 say they see important differences between the parties. Asked about a series of different issues, many have no trouble picking which party better aligns with their views. And a broad majority, 60%, feel that democracy is under attack.
    


            Among those paying less attention, nearly 40% say their views don't align with either party's across a majority of the issues they were asked about in the survey. Nearly 3 in 10 see little difference between Democrats and Republicans.
    


            “Honestly, I think they're the same,” said Tyler Ruth, a mother from Hilton Head, South Carolina, who participated in the poll. “Different color, but they're the same. Go about different things differently, but they're the same because they all have money and they hold power. They don't have to worry about, ‘How am I going to make ends meet for a couple of days until I get paid?'”
    


            Nearly half of Americans who spend less time on politics say they don't see either party as capable of getting things done, 10 points higher than among the mostly highly engaged group, and just 37% see democracy as under attack.
    


            Americans younger than 45, people of color and those with lower household incomes are all relatively likely to say they follow politics only when necessary or not at all, as are people without college degrees. And although they're not making an effort to seek out political news, most aren't completely cut off from it, either.
    


            In the past, Ruth said, politics wasn't a top priority for her — she's juggling raising children with special needs while also attending college for social work. But after hearing about cuts to her children's care this year, she started following the news more closely, including efforts by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services to build a database for tracking autism.
    


            In CNN's survey, a majority even of those in the lower attention group said they still get some information about current events, and nearly half said they voted in last year's election. Overall, those who did broke in favor of Trump, a finding that dovetails with recently released data highlighting the key role infrequent voters played in securing Trump's victory. And it may reflect Trump's strength last year in winning over voters who typically don't express much trust in the political system.
    


            “I'm not a party system fan at all,” said Peter Montes, a poll respondent from Conroe, Texas, who works in the oil and gas industry. “I think that the parties need to be abolished, and we need to reset.” While he doesn't consider himself an outright Trump fan, he sees the president as bringing a business-minded ethos to the political sphere in a way he hasn't seen since Ross Perot, and said he's been paying closer attention to the news since Trump returned to office this year.
    


            But looking ahead to future elections, he doesn't see many other politicians with similar appeal. Nor, this far out, is he especially excited for next year's midterms. “I'll see the news, but I'm not going to go and stalk the news out to figure out what's going on. I'll just check in every once in a while,” he said.
    


The CNN poll was conducted among 2,539 adults nationwide by SSRS from May 5-26, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources — an address-based sample and a random-digit dial sample of prepaid cell phone numbers — and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail or by phone. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines, a step that follows the Baltic nations and Poland's move to boost their defense as the war rages on in Ukraine. 

The 1997 treaty, joined by over 160 countries, bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in efforts to protect civilians from the scattered explosives that could still injure them long after the conflict is over. 

"Russia has never been a party to this convention and uses anti-personnel mines extremely cynically," Zelensky said in justifying the decision. "And not only now, in the war against Ukraine. This is the signature style of Russian killers — to destroy life by all methods at their disposal.

Earlier in March, the Baltic states and Poland announced their intention to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, a significant shift in defense policy that shows how countries near Ukraine are preparing for a potential war in Europe.

Anti-personnel mines are scattered across the battlefield in Ukraine, with soldiers and civilians often losing their feet or limbs due to detonations. Territories liberated by Ukraine since 2022 have been heavily covered with mines, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to clear them. Russia has used more than a dozen variants of anti-personnel mines since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to Human Rights Watch's June report. 

In a surprise move that angered Moscow, the Biden administration in 2024 approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine. Then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was to help Ukraine stall the Russian advances in the east as the front-line situation deteriorated.

"This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded," lawmaker Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliament's defense committee, said in the Facebook post announcing a significant move forward in withdrawing from the major mine treaty. 

Now that Zelensky signed the decree enacting the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, it will land on the parliament's table, Kostenko said. The dates when the decision will take effect are still unclear.

RFK Jr has direct control, but Senate testimony in May that someone else is running the agency has created confusion

Who is in charge at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? The answer is more complicated than it may seem.

With no confirmed or acting CDC director, Robert F Kennedy Jr has direct control over the agency, allowing him to sign off – or not – on vaccine recommendations, according to legal experts.

Yet Kennedy, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), testified before a Senate committee in May that someone else is running the agency – creating confusion that could lead to legal challenges.

“There's not a CDC director or acting director. Essentially, RFK Jr is the director of the CDC,” said Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

Kennedy now has “a lot more opportunity to actually influence the outcome of these decisions and to take actions in the absence of a Senate-confirmed director”, said Renée Landers, professor and director of the health law program at Suffolk University Law School in Boston.

The dismissal of 17 independent vaccine advisers and their replacement with less experienced advisers, some of whom have histories of anti-vaccine activism, is “very concerning”, especially given Kennedy's rejection of germ theory and his own anti-vaccine activism, Landers said.

On Thursday, the independent vaccine advisers appointed by Kennedy voted to ban thimerosal, a preservative (also known as thiomersal) with a demonstrated safety record, from 4% of flu vaccines in the US.

The remaining 96% of flu vaccines, as well as all other childhood vaccines, were already free of thimerosal out of an abundance of caution, despite decades of research indicating the preservative's safety. The move will make it harder for some people to access the flu vaccine.

The recommendation would normally be taken up by the CDC director, either to reject, or to implement as official, guidance from the agency. But for now, those decisions go directly to Kennedy, who has already exercised these capabilities before.

On 13 May, “with pending confirmation of a new CDC Director”, the health secretary adopted the recommendations for Chikungunya vaccines to be officially recommended by the CDC, according to the agency's website.

Kennedy did not sign off on the committee's votes for two other vaccines against RSV and meningitis.

Those vaccines, recommended in April by the independent advisers whom Kennedy dismissed this month, still have not gotten official CDC recommendations; it's not clear whether or when they will.

Kennedy also recently directed the CDC to change its Covid vaccine recommendations, softening the recommendation for children and ending it for pregnant people entirely, despite strong evidence that pregnancy is a major risk factor for severe illness and death.

“It is concerning that the power vacuum leaves open his ability to make these decisions that are inconsistent with scientific consensus,” Landers said.

Congress introduced a new law in 2023 that directors of the CDC must now undergo Senate confirmation. This appointment is the first time the CDC director has gone through the process.

“It is a little bit of uncharted waters,” Landers said.

David Weldon was first nominated and then withdrawn hours before his Senate confirmation hearing in March.

Susan Monarez served as acting director from 23 January until she was nominated on 24 March, at which point she stepped down. Once someone has been nominated for director, they cannot serve as acting director.

Monarez testified in her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, but it's not clear when lawmakers will vote on the nomination,

In the absence of an acting director, the head of HHS has control of the agency, according to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.

Signing off – or not – on CDC recommendations cannot be “delegated down” to other officials under the vacancies act, said Anne Joseph O'Connell, a professor at Stanford Law School; “it can only go up” to the HHS secretary.

“What's unusual about this situation is that we generally think having exclusive duties go ‘up' to the agency head when there is a lower-level vacancy is a good thing. But here many don't trust the secretary on these matters,” O'Connell said.

Kennedy put forth a different name for who is in charge of the CDC in May testimony before the Senate's health, education, labor and pensions committee.

“Who is the acting CDC director?” Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Democratic senator from Delaware, asked.

“The acting director was Susan Monarez, but she is now up for permanent director, so she's been replaced by Matt Buzzelli,” Kennedy said, describing Buzzelli as “a public health expert”.

But there's no indication that Buzzelli, a lawyer who is listed as chief of staff in the office of the CDC director, is acting director, nor is he qualified for the position.

“Buzzelli cannot be the acting CDC head,” O'Connell said. He's not the first assistant to the CDC director, he's not Senate-confirmed, and he did not serve 90 days in the year before the last director of the CDC left, O'Connell said: “There is no wiggle room.”

The lack of clarity is compounded by the Trump administration's non-compliance with information requirements, experts said. The CDC, along with other agencies, is required to update each year an office of personnel management site about who holds which jobs, a deadline the agencies missed in March.

Buzzelli “has been carrying out some of the duties of the CDC Director as the Senior Official, as necessary, and is surrounded by highly qualified medical professionals and advisors to help fulfill these duties as appropriate”, Andrew Nixon, HHS director of communications, told Stat News in May. (HHS did not respond to the Guardian's media inquiry.)

Such actions could open the officials up to legal challenges. Without official documentation naming Buzzelli and other decision-makers to official positions, they would not have the designated authority to make certain decisions, which means their actions could be challenged.

For instance, they may not be authorized to enter into new contracts or end prior agreements early with state, local, tribal and territorial governments – potentially opening up any such actions to lawsuits.

“The person who takes the action has to be someone lawfully appointed to the position. To the extent that agencies try to skirt that kind of requirement, it does leave the decisions vulnerable to legal challenge,” Landers said.

MPs describe receiving veiled deselection threats as No 10 sought to quash revolt before finally backing down 

The Conservative shadow cabinet minister looked more cheerful than at any point in the 12 months since the general election. “How did they get into such a mess?” they asked. “What are they going to do?”

The answer was revealed a couple of days later when Keir Starmer and his ministers made a series of emergency concessions on their flagship welfare programme, to prevent the otherwise far-greater ignominy of the programme being voted down in the House of Commons.

U-turns of various sorts are an inevitability in government; the skill lies in how elegantly you can perform them. And this week's eventual cave-in to backbench Labour pressure – formally announced by a Downing Street statement after midnight on Thursday – was very, very messy indeed.

To return to the shadow minister's gleeful query, how did it end up like this? The narrative will depend on who you ask. But a common thread, even among some in No 10, is the idea of a government worryingly disconnected from its own MPs.

From the moment in March that Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, first set out consultative proposals to overhaul welfare payments, it was evident that a large number of backbenchers had worries about elements of the plan.

Notably, the green paper set out a significant tightening of the eligibility for personal independence payments (Pips), which help those with long-term illness or disability, causing concern not only among MPs but also numerous charities.

But armed with a 150-plus Commons majority – and what felt to some MPs like an almost messianic insistence on turning around an increasingly unaffordable social security system – Downing Street ploughed on.

“This has happened because of an arrogance from the top,” one veteran Labour MP said. “On the day of the green paper, the whips were saying they thought a maximum of 10 people would actually rebel. They were laughing at us.

“They didn't think anyone would have the guts from the new intake. But they [new Labour MPs] have been doing their own organising.”

As it turned out, there was a lot of organising, from all sides of the parliamentary party. With Starmer largely preoccupied with other subjects – including the G7 summit in Canada and a change of course over a national inquiry into grooming gangs – MPs were taking action.

The crunch point arrived on Monday with the publication of an amendment intended to kill off the welfare bill at its second reading in the Commons on 1 July. Initially signed by 108 Labour MPs, it soon had the backing of more than 120.

These were not the perennial malcontents primarily from the Labour left – the “maximum of 10” so dismissively summed up by the party whip. Signatories included a string of senior backbenchers who chair select committees, and numerous 2024-intake MPs.

How did dozens of hand-picked, newly arrived backbenchers, once thought so loyal they were dubbed “Starmtroopers”, find themselves within a year on the brink of a rebellion that could have defeated the government?

For many, the problem dates back to the very early days of the parliament and a kind of vicious discipline that resulted in seven MPs being suspended from the Labour party over a vote on the two-child benefit cap. Three of those MPs remain exiled today.

Even loyal MPs were under orders never to submit amendments – or to make their views known publicly on any subject. “It was like student politics,” said one. “Keep your mouth shut and maybe we'll let you on the entertainment committee.”

“Arrogant” is the word MPs are using most of all. It was the blithe assumption by whips and No 10 that any rebellion would fold that sent many over the edge.

“They tried to treat the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] like naughty children,” one MP said. “They all did what they were meant to do and raised the issue privately, and then got totally ignored.”

Another repeated charge within the party is that even when its hierarchy did recognise the disquiet, the response tended to be either complacency or high-handed, bungling menaces.

MPs described outreach to them as having been limited to presentations and charts showing the growing size of the welfare budget and increases in numbers going on Pip.

“We asked to see the prime minister or the chancellor and we got a presentation from officials,” one said. “They were very, very dismissive.”

MPs say they received a litany of threats, including the possibility of a general election. Those on the right of the party were warned their actions could bring about a leadership challenge that would be won by Angela Rayner. The same threat was made to those on the left, but with Wes Streeting as the looming spectre.

Others say they have received veiled threats of deselection, or that their funding for the next general election would be decided on the basis of whether or not they toed the line. One party official allegedly rang a rebellious MP's husband in order to get her to back down.

“I don't even think some of this is sanctioned by No 10,” one MP said. “Until Wednesday they had their fingers in their ears. But those who are responsible for party management have been absolutely losing it.”

After the implications of Monday's amendment became clear, outreach efforts finally began. Even Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, made a rare appearance on the Commons terrace on Wednesday evening to try to persuade MPs over a glass of rosé. “She doesn't want to be £5bn out of pocket,” one MP said.

Yet the number of rebels continued to grow, and No 10 finally bowed to the inevitable. On Thursday morning, the prime minister used a Commons statement ostensibly about international affairs to promise a welfare rethink.

Until that point, Starmer had seemed oddly detached from the issue, surfacing intermittently at summits to bat away questions about the revolt – or “noises off” as he termed it – as a distraction from the vital task of transforming welfare.

Some MPs view this as indicative of a prime minister more than usually disconnected from the everyday grid of parliamentary business, as illustrated by the statistic that since winning the election he has voted in the Commons just seven times.

A few have begun to openly speculate about what the situation means for Starmer's leadership. “It is very bad for Keir. It is one in four of his MPs [that intended to rebel]. He is toast,” one MP said.

A lot of the ire, however, has been directed at Morgan McSweeney, Starmer's chief of staff, and what one rebel called the “overexcitable boys” in the PM's team.

Inside No 10, there had been a determination to force through the plan in part because of internal polling and focus groups that suggest the public backs the changes when the context is explained – even wanting them to go further.

One adviser, a close ally of the prime minister, said they had been so determined the vote had to go ahead – concessions or not – because the symbolism of being able to get the government's agenda through the Commons was so important.

“This is a fairly moderate reform,” the adviser said. “If the government cannot make this modest saving – in a change that will not affect nine out of 10 people already on the benefit – then how can we pursue the political programme we need, to make the tough decisions the country needs us to take? It's impossible.”

Other advisers are furious about the situation they have found themselves in. “It's absolutely outrageous these people are prepared to throw away a historic majority because people were a bit mean to them on Twitter,” said one.

Another said: “Just wait and see what happens if they depose Morgan. It is over, then. Finito. Then we might as well hand the keys to Farage.”

But other advisers in government say they can see how No 10 has played it wrong. One called it “a staggering failure of political management from the people who supposedly had an iron grip on the PLP”.

For many Labour MPs, however, it is about nothing more complicated than a government machine that forgot how to listen.

“Everything the government is now realising is something MPs have been saying for months,” one MP said. “The fact that you cannot defend these cuts on the basis they will get people into work. The fact that you cannot guarantee the most disabled people won't be worse off.

“MPs are not idiots. We deserve to be listened to. We anticipated this failure. They are in this mess now because they were too arrogant to listen.”

CHOLPON-ATA, June 29. /TASS/. The collective West seeks after strategically defeating Russia, using the Kiev regime as a ram, but it will not succeed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during talks with Kyrgyzstan's Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubayev.

"We see an unprecedented standoff our country against the collective West that decided again to wage a war against us and inflict a strategic defeat to Russia, essentially using the Nazi regime in Kiev as a ram," Lavrov said. "The West has never succeeded in that - they will not work it out this time also," the top Russian diplomat said.

The West "probably, starts figuring that out," Lavrov noted. Considering the current international situation, Russian Foreign Minister pointed to particular importance of close ties with Kyrgyzstan in all the areas.

BELGRADE, June 29. /TASS/. Six police officers and two civilians were injured as a result of Saturday's violent protests in Belgrade, Serbia's police director Dragan Vailjevic said in an official statement, published by the Interior Ministry's press service.

According to the official, violence broke out when one group of protestors tried marched towards another group, holding a separate rally.

"Commanders of police units forming a cordon warned participants that they will not be allowed any further. This produced no effect, and an attack on police officers followed," he said. "After the attack, which lasted around five or six minutes, the police was forced to intervene. The police acted with a high degree of professionalism. Minimal force was used only to stop those attacking the police and the state."

"A few dozens of offenders and troublemakers were detained and will be brought to justice in accordance with the law. Regrettably, six officers were injured, and reports about their condition are now being verified. Also, two civilians were wounded. They were admitted to a healthcare facility, and details about their wounds are yet unknown," the police director said.

Nenad Stefanovic, the head of the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade,said earlier that all those responsible for attacks on police officers and governmental institutions will be identified and brought to justice.

The rally in central Belgrade gathered around 36,000 participants, according to Serbia's interior ministry. Protestors clashed with the police, and riot control weapons were used to drive them away from several streets in the city center.

The Serbian president will make a televised address to the nation at 11:00 a.m. local time on Sunday (9:00 a.m. GMT), the Vecernje novosti newspaper reported.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the start its full-scale war overnight on June 29, launching 477 drones and 60 missiles towards Ukrainian cities, Ukraine's Air Force said. 

Russian missile and drone attack terrorized Ukraine overnight as air raid alarms sounded across the country, including western regions far from the front lines.

Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, confirmed to the Associated Press that the attack had become "the most massive airstrike" since the beginning of Russia's full-scale in February 2022.

Russia's bombardments — a fact of life after three years of full-scale war — have intensified dramatically in May and June, with mass attacks becoming more frequent and more deadly.

Ukraine's Air Force warned late in the evening on June 28 that Russia had launched three Tu-95 bombers from the Olenya military airfield in Murmansk Oblast. The Air Force also warned that multiple groups of Russian drones were heading towards various regions.

Several hours later, the Air Force reported that a Russian MiG-31K — a jet capable of carrying Kinzhal ballistic missiles — took off from Savasleyka airfield in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The Air Force followed this up with warnings that cruise missiles were bound for several regions, including Ternopil, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts in western Ukraine. 

The Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces said it scrambled fighter jets and activated ground-based air defense units in response to the Russian aerial attacks in western Ukraine.

Explosions and strikes were reported in Mykolaiv, Kremenchuk, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy Oblast, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv as waves of attacks came throughout the night. Some regional officials shared preliminary reports of damage and casualties even as air defense continued to operate in the area. 

Civilian infrastructure was damaged and at least three people were injured in attacks on Cherkasy Oblast, Governor Ihor Taburets reported.

In Kremenchuk, Poltava Oblast, an undisclosed enterprise was hit, causing a fire, according to Governor Volodymyr Kohut. 

A production facility at an unnamed enterprise in Zaporizhzhia was hit during an overnight missile attack, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. No casualties were reported. 

After the alarms died down, officials in Lviv Oblast said that Russia attempted to strike critical infrastructure in the region. According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi, these efforts were largely unsuccessful. 

"Despite the complexity of this overnight combined attack, no one was injured and no civilian buildings were damaged in Lviv," he wrote on Telegram. 

Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitalii Kim reported that Russia targeted the city overnight with ballistic missiles and Shahed drones, hitting an infrastructure facility. The strike caused a fire but no casualties. 

The mass missile and drone attack comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters that Moscow is ready to hold another round of peace talks.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations have now held two direct talks in Istanbul, but the discussions have yielded few results outside of coordinated prisoner swaps.

Moscow refuses to budge on its maximalist ambitions in Ukraine and is unwilling to enter a ceasefire unless Kyiv preemptively agrees to surrender all foreign military aid. Putin on June 20 declared that "all Ukraine is ours" in a bombastic speech at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.

Russian ballistics and kamikaze drones have targeted Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with renewed ferocity, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more. Just this week, a Russian missile struck a passenger train in Dnipro, leaving 21 dead and over 300 wounded.

 President Donald Trump reveals new details on Operation Midnight Hammer and U.S. foreign policy on Iran on ‘Sunday Morning Futures.'

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says it is "too early to tell" whether Iran has given up on its ambitions to become a nuclear power on Sunday.

Graham made the statement during a Sunday morning appearance on ABC's "This Week," saying he agrees that the sites the U.S. struck were "obliterated," but he remains concerned about Iran's uranium supply.

"Operation Midnight Hammer was a tremendous military success. It set the program back, I think, a couple years. But the question for the world is: Does the regime still desire to make a nuclear weapon? The answer is yes. Do they still desire to destroy Israel and come after us? The answer is yes."

"Until that changes, we're in trouble," he continued, adding that he believes Iran must meet certain requirements before President Donald Trump's administration agrees to talk with them.

"They have to say, for the first time, the Iranian regime, we recognize Israel's right to exist," Graham said. "If they can't say that, then you're never gonna get a deal worth a damn.

TRUMP SLAMS RUSSIA'S CASUAL THREAT TO ARM IRAN WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS: ‘THAT'S WHY PUTIN'S THE BOSS'

Trump said on Friday that he is open to conducting additional strikes against Iran, should Tehran pick up its nuclear program again to a level that is concerning to the U.S.

"Sure. Without question, absolutely," Trump told reporters Friday when asked about the possibility of subsequent strikes. 

RUSSIAN LEADER CLAIMS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES PREPPED TO PROVIDE IRAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOLLOWING US STRIKES

Trump has previously issued similar warnings to Iran, and said Wednesday at the NATO Summit in the Netherlands that if Tehran were to seek to repair its nuclear program once more, the U.S. would not hesitate to move forward with additional strikes.

Trump also slammed Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who declared victory over Israel on Thursday. Trump countered Khamenei's claims and said he spared the ayatollah from death.

"I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the U.S. Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life," Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Friday. "I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, ‘THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!'"

Spaniards and tourists were desperately trying to keep cool Saturday, as the country sizzled in temperatures as high as 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) in Seville and other central and southern cities.

ROME (AP) — Major heat waves across Southern Europe have pushed temperatures above 40 C (104 F) in countries including Italy, Spain and Greece, as local authorities issued fresh warnings against the risk of wildfires.

Experts link the rising frequency and intensity of these heatwaves to climate change, warning that such extreme weather events are becoming increasingly common across Europe's southern region.

Severe heat waves were recorded in Italy, Greece, Spain and Portugal before the weekend, with locals and tourists alike taking shelter from the sweltering conditions.

Two-thirds of Portugal were on high alert on Sunday for extreme heat and wildfires, with temperatures expected to top 42 C (107 F) in Lisbon.

In Italy, a few regions — Lazio, Tuscany, Calabria, Puglia and Umbria — were planning to ban some outdoor work activities during the hottest hours of the day in response to the record-high temperatures. Italian trade unions pushed the government to expand such measures at a national level. 

On Sunday, the Italian Health Ministry placed 21 out of 27 monitored cities under its highest heat alert, including top holiday destinations like Rome, Milan and Naples.

In Rome, tourists tried to seek shade near popular spots like the Colosseum and the Trevi Fountain, using umbrellas and drinking from public water fountains to stay cool.

Similar scenes were reported in Milan and Naples, where street vendors sold lemonade to tourists and residents to offer some refreshment from the heat.




Greece was again on high wildfire alert because of extreme weather, with the first summer heat wave expected to continue throughout the weekend.

A large wildfire broke out south of Athens on Thursday, forcing evacuations and road closures near the ancient Temple of Poseidon. Strong winds spread the flames, damaging homes and sending smoke across the sky.

Greek authorities deployed 130 firefighters, 12 planes and 12 helicopters to battle the blaze, while police evacuated 40 people, with five areas under evacuation orders.

In Spain, locals and tourists were desperately trying to keep cool this weekend, as the country sizzled in temperatures as high as 42 C (107 F) in the southern city of Seville along with other locations in southern and central parts of the country.

Southern regions of Spain recorded temperatures above seasonal averages, prompting health alerts and safety recommendations from authorities. The country's national meteorological service Aemet has said that June is set to break yet another record, becoming the hottest such month since records started.

Experts warned that intense heat can affect daily life, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly and children.

Local authorities advised against physical activity during the hottest hours of the day, and recommended drinking plenty of fluids.

A Lancet Public Health study published last year highlighted the increasing risk of heat-related deaths because of climate change. The study predicted that heat-related deaths could more than quadruple by mid-century under current climate policies. 

While more people die from cold than heat, the study stressed that rising temperatures will offset the benefits of milder winters, leading to a significant net increase in heat-related mortality.

Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham made a passionate statement about the state of the team as it deals with Caitlin Clark's injuries and tries to keep the season from spiraling.

Cunningham spoke to reporters about being the team that everyone in the league has circled on their calendars before their win over the Dallas Wings on Friday.

It was the second night of a back-to-back as they came off of a loss to the Los Angeles Sparks.

"I think so far this season, we've had a lot of distractions. Some injuries. Don't know who's playing. Just a lot of distractions. But I think that's really good for us," she said, via the Indy Star. "Let's go through the adversity early. Let's learn from it. Good news is we're not going to peak too early, so I mean, that's a positive. It's not an excuse. Everyone's playing a back-to-back. Everyone has this kind of rough schedule. For us, we get another opportunity tomorrow, and we've got to capitalize on it. Dallas is a team that's hungry for a win.

"We've talked about this, we're circled on everybody's schedule. No one likes us, right? So, everyone in our locker room? That's the only type of people that we have that we can lean on. We've got to be better in that area. We have got to stay disciplined, we have to stay focused, we need to get consistent and we've got to lean on each other. I think that we've kind of wavered a little bit on that. We have our own islands."

Cunningham added that the tough schedule was "just an excuse" and that she had to do a better job for her teammates.

She then had five points and four assists on Friday as the Fever defeated the Wings, 94-86.

The WNBA schedule has become a tension point with some players.

New York Liberty star Breanna Stewart spoke about the problems of a 44-game schedule earlier this month.

"We want to play the games, especially if that's what is wanted for TV and having these sellout arenas," she said. "I think the hardest part is no matter what, when I was playing 36 games or 32 games, it was in the same amount of time as 44 games.

"I know on both ends between April and October there's things happening. But I think that's one of the biggest talking points in the next CBA is like, alright, how can we make it so teams aren't playing four (games) in six (days) three times in a season and continuing to have the rest and recovery so we are at our best. It's tough, it's a tough thing."

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday urged progress in ceasefire talks in the 20-month war in Gaza, as Israel and Hamas appeared to move closer to an agreement.

Ron Dermer, a top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire, an Israeli official said, and plans were being made for Netanyahu to travel there in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a deal.

Netanyahu was meeting with his security Cabinet on Sunday evening, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that hadn't been finalized.

“MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!” Trump wrote on social media early Sunday. Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be an agreement within the next week.

Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war. An eight-week ceasefire was reached just as he took office earlier this year, but Israel resumed the war in March after trying to get Hamas to accept new terms on next steps.

Some Palestinians greeted the possibility of a new truce with skepticism after watching the last ceasefire shattered.

“Since the beginning of the war, they have been promising us something like this: Release the hostages and we will stop the war,” said Abdel Hadi Al-Hour. “They did not stop the war.”

From AP's Standards and Stylebook teams:

The AP is calling the conflict between Israel and Iran a war, given the scope, intensity and duration of military activities on both sides. Click here for an explanation of this decision. 

Trump also doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it “a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.”

In the post Saturday evening, Trump said the trial interfered with ceasefire talks, saying Netanyahu “is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back.”

Last week, Trump called for the trial to be canceled. It was a dramatic interference by an ally in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. It unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity there.

The trial has repeatedly been postponed at Netanyahu's request, citing security and diplomatic developments. On Sunday, the court agreed to call off two more days of testimony by him scheduled this week.

Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over a major sticking point — whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.

Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying on social media that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. About 50 hostages remain, with less than half believed to be alive.

Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said that “Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war,” without addressing Merdawi's claim.

During a visit Sunday to to Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Netanyahu said that the Israel-Iran war and subsequent ceasefire have opened many opportunities: “First of all, to rescue the hostages. Of course, we will also have to solve the Gaza issue, to defeat Hamas, but I estimate that we will achieve both tasks.”

Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war in Gaza. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something that the group refuses.

The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage.

Gaza's Health Ministry on Sunday said that another 88 people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the war's toll among Palestinians to 56,500. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas government, doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, but says more than half of the dead are women and children.

The war has displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape and left people overwhelmingly reliant on outside aid, which Israel has limited since the end of the latest ceasefire.

Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are even partly functional, and more than 4,000 children need medical evacuation abroad, a new U.N. humanitarian assessment says.

“We are exhausted, we are tired. We hope to God that the war will end,” said one Palestinian, Mahmoud Wadi.

The Israeli military ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza, home to hundreds of thousands of people who had returned during the ceasefire earlier this year.

Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.

The military will expand its escalating attacks westward to the city's center, calling for people to move toward the Muwasi area in southern Gaza, Adraee said.

An Israeli military offensive aims to move Palestinians to southern Gaza, so forces can more freely operate to combat militants. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible displacement.

Detroit Pistons guard Malik Beasley was reportedly under a federal investigation over gambling allegations tied to NBA games and prop bets.

The U.S. Attorney's Office is conducting the investigation into the NBA veteran, ESPN reported on Sunday. Fox News Digital reached out to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.

Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, spoke out about the reported investigation.

"An investigation is not a charge," Haney told ESPN. "Malik is afforded the same right of the presumption of innocence as anyone else under the U.S. Constitution. As of now, he has not been charged with anything."

The allegations against Beasley were not immediately known.

"We are cooperating with the federal prosecutors' investigation," NBA spokesman Mike Bass told Fox News Digital.

The Pistons acknowledged there was an investigation ongoing but deferred further comment to the NBA.

Beasley played all 82 games for the Pistons last season, starting 18 of them. He averaged 16.3 points and 2.6 rebounds per game. It was his first season with Detroit and ESPN reported the two sides halted contract extension negotiations as the investigation was revealed.

He's played nine seasons in the NBA, spending time with the Denver Nuggets, Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Los Angeles Lakers and Milwaukee Bucks.

Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war.

Russia fired a total of 537 aerial weapons at Ukraine, including 477 drones and decoys and 60 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. Of these, 249 were shot down and 226 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed.

The onslaught was “the most massive airstrike” on the country since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, taking into account both drones and various types of missiles, Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for Ukraine's air force, told The Associated Press. The attack targeted several regions, including western Ukraine, far from the front line.

Poland and allied countries scrambled aircraft to ensure the safety of Polish airspace, the country's air force said.

Three people were killed in each of the drone strikes in the Kherson, Kharkiv and the Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to the three governors. 

Another person was killed by an airstrike in Kostyantynivka, local officials said. In addition to aerial attacks, a man died when Russian troops shelled the city of Kherson, and the body of a 70-year-old woman was found under the rubble of a nine-story building hit by Russian shelling in the Zaporizhzhia region.

In the far-western Lviv region, a large fire broke out at an industrial facility in the city of Drohobych following a drone attack that also cut electricity to parts of the city. 

Ukraine's air force said one of its F-16 warplanes supplied by its Western partners crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets. The pilot died. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight.

Two people were wounded in another Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Bryansk in western Russia, regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said Sunday morning, adding that seven more Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the region.




Meanwhile, Russia claimed Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Novoukrainka in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region.

Russian forces have been slowly grinding forward at some points on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, though their incremental gains have been costly in terms of troop casualties and damaged armor. 

In other developments, Russia's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said he had spoken on the phone with his U.S. counterpart, CIA Director John Ratcliffe.

“I had a phone call with my American counterpart and we reserved for each other the possibility to call at any time and discuss issues of interest to us,” Naryshkin said in remarks to state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel on Sunday.

Sunday's attacks follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments two days ago that Moscow is ready for a fresh round of direct peace talks in Istanbul. Two recent rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul were brief and yielded no progress on reaching a settlement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree to withdraw Ukraine from the Ottawa Convention banning antipersonnel land mines, a Ukrainian lawmaker said Sunday. The move follows similar recent steps by the Baltic states and Poland.

The 1997 treaty prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel land mines in an effort to protect civilians from explosives that can maim or kill long after fighting ends.

“This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,” said Roman Kostenko, secretary of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense and intelligence. He noted that Russia is not a party to the convention “and is massively using mines against our military and civilians.”

MIAMI (AP) — Weather forecasters say a second tropical storm has formed along coastal Mexico.

Shortly after announcing Tropical Storm Barry off the country's Atlantic coast on Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tropical Storm Flossie formed along Mexico's west coast.

The storm's center was about 240 miles (about 390 kilometers) south of Acapulco and about 485 miles (780 kilometers) southeast of Manzanillo. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 40 mph (65 kph) and it was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph).

President Donald Trump suggested tracking down and prosecuting the leakers of a preliminary intelligence assessment of the damage inflicted by the recent U.S. strike on Iran.

In an interview with Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo, Bartiromo brought up a Truth Social post from Trump saying Democrats had leaked intelligence around the Iran strike, to which the president interjected that they should be prosecuted. When asked who specifically, Trump suggested the administration would find out the specific leaker, possibly by questioning the reporters who obtained the information.

“We can find out. You go up and tell the reporter, ‘National security, who gave it?' You have to do that. And I suspect we'll be doing things like that,” he said.

Trump has long taken issue with reporters' source confidentiality regarding national security matters. During the 2024 campaign, he repeatedly threatened punitive action against reporters who divulged sensitive state matters.

EARLY IRAN BOMB DAMAGE SPIN FALLS APART

Trump's ire for reporters covering national security matters was revived last week when CNN reported on a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that suggested the damage to Iran's nuclear sites may not have been as prevalent as previously thought.

The Trump administration aggressively countered the assertion and was soon vindicated after further assessments indicated that the damage to Iran's nuclear program was decisive.

NBA star Jonathan Isaac argues that transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports compromises fairness.

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova came to the defense of "Harry Potter" author J.K. Rowling on Saturday as the writer received criticism from actor Pedro Pascal in a recent interview.

Rowling and Pascal have clashed in the past on transgender issues, including after Rowling celebrated the United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman.

"Bullies make me f------ sick," Pascal told Vanity Fair. "It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen."

Rowling dismissed Pascal in a social media post on Friday and Navratilova added to it.

"Another Johnny come lately telling women to STFU," Navratilova wrote.

Navratilova is a lifelong Democrat but has never wavered on her push to keep biological males from competing against girls and women in sports.

She has made clear in the past she is no supporter of President Donald Trump, and a quick scan of her social media posts would underscore that. However, she has lamented Democrats' inaction over the issue of transgender athletes participating in women's and girls' sports.

When Trump signed an executive order to prohibit biological males from women's and girls' sports, she fired off a fierce message toward the Democratic Party.

"I hate that the Democrats totally failed women and girls on this very clear issue of women's sports being for females only," she wrote in a post on X.

She also expressed her frustration in January when the House of Representatives passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Only two Democrats voted with Republicans on the bill.

Former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice outlines the impact of Operation Midnight Hammer on the Middle East region on 'Special Report.'

A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report is casting doubt on President Donald Trump's claim that recent U.S. airstrikes "completely and totally obliterated" three Iranian nuclear facilities, instead concluding the mission only set back Iran's program by several months.

The report, published by CNN and The New York Times, comes just days after Trump approved the strikes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. In a national address immediately following the operation, Trump declared the sites "completely and totally obliterated." 

While members of the Trump administration have waged a new war to discredit the initial report from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, multiple experts told Fox News Digital that there is too little information available right now to accurately determine how much damage the strikes did. 

Piecing together a thorough intelligence assessment is complex and time-consuming, they said. 

FBI INVESTIGATING IRAN STRIKE LEAKER, LEAVITT SAYS: ‘THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

Trump said Saturday that the U.S. completed a "very successful" strike against Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, saying that Iran's nuclear enrichment installations have been "obliterated."  (Fox News)

Dan Shapiro, who previously served as the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for the Middle East and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, said he didn't put a lot of stock in both overly pessimistic or overly optimistic assessments that emerged quickly, and said that the initial assessment from DIA was likely only based on satellite imagery. 

"That's one piece of the puzzle of how you would really make this assessment," Shapiro, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital. "You'd really want to have to test all the other streams of intelligence, from signals intelligence, human intelligence, other forms of monitoring the site, potentially visits by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, potentially visits by other people. So that's going to take days to weeks to get a real assessment." 

"But I think it's likely that if the munitions performed as expected, that significant damage was done, and would set back the program significantly," Shapiro said. 

Gen. Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that initial battle damage assessments suggested "all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction," but he acknowledged that a final assessment would "take some time." 

Still, media reports based on the DIA report painted a different picture, and CNN's reporting on the initial report said that Iran's stash of enriched uranium was not destroyed in the strikes, citing seven people who had been briefed on the report. The findings were based on a battle damage assessment from U.S. Central Command, according to CNN. 

Other members of the Trump administration, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, have subsequently pushed back on the DIA report's conclusions, claiming that the report was labeled "low confidence."

The term is commonly used when labeling initial assessments, and means that conclusions are based on limited data, according to experts. 

Retired Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, who previously served as the director for transnational threats at the National Security Council for former President Bill Clinton, said the low confidence description is commonly used in early assessments. 

"Low confidence means the analyst is not sure of the accuracy of their assessment," said Montgomery, now a senior fellow at the Washington think tank the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "This is frequent when with a Quick Look 24-hour assessment like this one."

Montgomery's colleague, Craig Singleton, also a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that the low confidence label is used in cases with thin evidence and serves as a warning to policy-makers to seek additional information. 

"Most importantly, low confidence assessments are usually issued when key facts have yet to be verified, which certainly applies in this case," Singleton said.

Rob Greenway, former deputy assistant to the president on Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that it will take one or two months to get a more thorough assessment with higher confidence.

Greenway also said that the strikes were designed to create damage underground, which will complicate the assessment of damage, because it is not immediately available and will require multiple sources of intelligence, such as signals or human intelligence, to draw conclusions. 

Israel had also previously conducted strikes targeting the sites, adding to the web of analysis that must be evaluated, Greenway said. 

"Each of these are one piece of a much larger puzzle, and you're trying to gauge the ultimate effect of the entirety of the puzzle, not just one particular strike," said Greenway, now the director of the Allison Center for National Security at The Heritage Foundation. "All of that means it's going to take time in order to do it." 

Even so, Greenway said that the amount of ordnance dropped on the sites – including more than 14 30,000-lb. bombs – means that the targeted facilities have been so heavily compromised they are no longer serviceable. 

"We were putting twice the amount of ordnance required to achieve the desired effect, just to make sure that we didn't have to go back," Greenway said. 

EX-CLINTON OFFICIAL APPLAUDS TRUMP'S 'COURAGEOUS' IRAN CALL, DOUBTS HARRIS WOULD'VE HAD THE NERVE

"There's virtually no mathematical probability in which either facility can be used again by Iran for the intended purpose, if at all, which again means that everything now is within Israel's capability to strike if that's required," Greenway said. 

And Michael Allen, a former National Security Council senior director in the George W. Bush administration, said that even though a final judgment from the intelligence community won't be ready soon, the intelligence portrait will become "richer" in the coming days. 

"Stuff is pouring in, and we're out there collecting it, and they're trying to hustle it to the White House as soon as possible," Allen, now the managing director of advisory firm Beacon Global Strategies, told Fox News Digital. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that very few people had access to this report, and those who leaked it to the media will be held accountable as the FBI investigates who shared the document with the press. 

"That person was irresponsible with it," Leavitt told reporters Thursday. "And we need to get to the bottom of it. And we need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public."

            • Israeli hostage rallies: Anti-war demonstrators and the families of Israeli hostages held protests in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand a ceasefire in Gaza following the truce between Israel and Iran. Rallygoers urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize a “historic window of opportunity” to bring remaining hostages home.
    


            • Trump's Middle East diplomacy: Many protesters made direct appeals to US President Donald Trump to intervene in the conflict. Trump helped broker the Israel-Iran truce and his administration has quietly aimed to revive nuclear talks with Tehran, though he has also exchanged sharp words with top Iranian officials, casting doubt on the diplomatic path forward.
    


            • Funerals in Iran: Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran earlier Saturday for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed by Israeli attacks during this month's 12-day conflict.

            Iranian state news on Saturday aired an apparent interview with Ali Shamkhani — a close aide to Iran's supreme leader who had previously been reported dead by both Israeli and Iranian media.
    


            Mystery mounted about Shamkhani's fate in the days after he was reported dead following Israel's June 13 strikes on Iran.
    


            Last Friday, multiple Iranian outlets — including IRNA, Tasnim and Fars — claimed Shamkhani had not died but instead had been “severely injured and hospitalized” in the strike. They did not, however, release new photos of him.
    


            Then Shamkhani appeared in pictures from Iranian state media coverage of Saturday's state funeral for those slain during the 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            On the same day, Iranian state news agency IRIB ran what it billed as Shamkhani's first television interview with Iranian state media since the attack.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify his identity or the date the interview was recorded.
    


More on the interview: Shamkhani is shown holding a walking stick and using a breathing aid. He references an Israeli strike on his home, saying he was trapped by rubble for three hours following the attack.
    


            “I did my morning prayer while under the rubble,” he said.
    


            IRIB also released footage of what it said was Shamkhani's home, reduced to broken concrete and rebar.
    


            “At first, I thought it was an earthquake. But when I heard the sound of vehicles, I realized it was not,” he said in the interview, adding that he sustained internal injuries in the attack and that his rib cage was fractured.
    


            “I know why they targeted me, but I cannot say,” he added.
    


            CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities for comment.
    


            Ayman Odeh, an Arab lawmaker in Israel facing impeachment proceedings, called for unity and a ceasefire at an anti-war protest in Kfar Saba, central Israel.
    


            “We must reach a comprehensive deal. We must bring back all the hostages. We must end the war on Gaza,” said Odeh, who leads the Hadash-Ta'al party in Israel's parliament. “Enough! Enough with the wars!”
    


                    In an appeal to the crowd, Odeh said, “I am your partner. And you are my partners. Yes, there are differences, there are disagreements, but I want you to know: I am your partner, because my soul still yearns for freedom. I am your partner, because I still believe in humanity.”
                





            Odeh, who was invited to speak by the organizers of the protest, concluded his remarks by calling to continue the demonstrations. “After so much death, suffering, and tears, better days will come. We will bring them,” he told the crowd.
    


Some background: Odeh faces impeachment proceedings following a post on social media at the beginning of the last Israel-Gaza ceasefire in January, which hailed the release of “(Israeli) hostages and (Palestinian) prisoners.” The post outraged right-wing members of Israel's parliament, called the Knesset, who initiated the proceedings.
    


            In a subsequent defense of the post, Odeh said many of the prisoners released were minors who had not been charged with any crime.
    


            “While it is clear that many of you tend to see primarily the Jewish suffering, I see and feel the suffering of both peoples,” Odeh said.
    


            Tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday to call for an end to the Gaza war and a return of the remaining hostages.
    


            “It's big, it's vibrant, it's noisy,” CNN's Nic Robertson, who is at the scene, said of the atmosphere.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum estimated that 30,000 people came out.
    


            Many held signs showing pictures of the hostages that said, “Bring them home now,” a frequent refrain during the weekly protests. Others held signs that appealed to US President Donald Trump to step in and demand an end to the war.
    


            One sign said, “President Trump, end the crisis in Gaza! Nobel is waiting!”
    

CNN's Nic Robertson reports from Tel Aviv where tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square to call for an end to the Gaza war and the return of the remaining hostages.


            Trump was part of the effort to secure a ceasefire after 12 days of conflict between Israel and Iran. He also demanded that the Israeli military stop what the government said would be a major attack on Iran, prompted by a ballistic missile launch at northern Israel after the ceasefire went into effect. Israel instead targeted a radar north of Tehran.
    


            Trump's perceived ability to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hand has led many protesters to renew their calls for him to step in and force an end to the war in Gaza.
    


            Ruby Chen — the mother of Itay Chen, who was killed in the October 7, 2023, attacks and whose body is still being held in Gaza — said the right thing to do was to “return all the hostages, even at the price of ending the war.”
    


                    “Bibi, the return of the hostages is not surrender, it is being Jewish,” Chen said, addressing Netanyahu by his nickname. “Mr. Prime Minister, now is the time to go for it and not to have political considerations. Bring the 50 hostages home already.”
                





            The large rally happening now in Tel Aviv comes at the end of a day of protest in Israel, with several smaller demonstrations held across the country demanding an end to the war in Gaza and return of Israeli hostages.
    


            In the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, demonstrators held up signs demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leave office.
    


            “The war must end, the hostages must return, the government must fall!” one read. “How much more blood will be spilled before the guilty one goes?” read another.
    


            At Alonim Junction in northern Israel, demonstrators held up hands covered in red paint and chanted, “We have no soldiers for the wars for Netanyahu's welfare.”
    


            In the central Israeli city of Ness Ziona, protesters held a large banner that simply said: “End this f***ing war.”
    


            The hostages held in Gaza for more than 630 days of war should not be treated as “bargaining chips,” said Israeli lawmaker Yair Golan on Saturday, calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal at an anti-government protest in Haifa.
    


            “The hostages are not bargaining chips. They are our brothers and sisters,” said Golan, head of the left-wing Democrats party. “The soldiers fighting in Gaza are our sons and daughters. And anyone who does not place their return at the top of the national priority list — is neither a Zionist nor worthy of leadership.”
    


            Golan, who has been sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, added that Israel's ongoing war in Gaza “serves only the survival of the coalition.”
    


            The country's ceasefire with Iran, achieved after 12 days of conflict, has led to a renewed push from mediators to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
    


            Protesters across Israel — forbidden from organizing their demonstrations for the last two weeks because of emergency guidelines during the conflict with Iran — are now packing the streets of major cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Haifa.
    


            As renewed protests against the war in Gaza begin tonight in Israel, the mother of a hostage is calling on US President Donald Trump to demand an end to the conflict.
    


            Viki Cohen, mother of 20-year-old Nimrod Cohen, told CNN she feels there is “momentum” now to end the war and to bring all of the hostages home.
    


                    “Even (though) we were disappointed before so many times, now we feel that it's a little different. Trump is very demanding and we believe in him. We trust him. And we know he has the power to stop the war,” Cohen said as she prepared to participate in a protest in Tel Aviv.
                





            “He can pressure our prime minister to do it, to finish the war in Gaza. And in this way all the hostages can come home, and my son among them.”
    


            There are 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of which at least 20 are believed to be alive.
    


            The weekly anti-war and anti-government protests that have packed the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities were forbidden during the 12-day conflict with Iran because of emergency guidelines prohibiting large gatherings. With the restrictions lifted, organizers are renewing the protests, particularly in light of the ceasefire with Iran.
    


            Trump said Friday he believes a ceasefire will be agreed to in Gaza “within the next week.”
    


                    “We hope that now it's the momentum to bring all the hostages back home after the fight with Iran,” Cohen said. “Iran gives a lot of support to Hamas, and now they don't have Iran anymore. We finished with Hezbollah, so now there is no threat, and it's time to finish the war in Gaza and to bring them all home.”
                





            CNN witnessed the Hosseini infants ceremony in Tehran, which took place Friday in the background of Iran's tensions with Israel and the US.
    


            One mother showed CNN's Fred Pleitgen a band on her baby's head, which she said is a “symbol saluting Imam Hossein … who's the leader of all the oppressed who stand against oppressors and don't submit.”
    


            Crowds chanted against the US and Israel during the ceremony while videos were shown of Iran's missile program.

            As tens of thousands gathered in Iran's capital, Tehran, for the state funeral of those killed in Israeli strikes, a post on the Iranian supreme leader's X account reiterated his vow that the Islamic nation will never surrender to the United States.
    


                    “The Iranian nation should know that the reason for the conflict with America is that they want Iran to surrender,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in a post on his Farsi-language X account, echoing a portion of a previous statement. “The Americans are the ones who have committed this great insult to the Iranian nation, and that such an event will never happen,” the statement added.
                





            It was Khamenei's first post since the start of the state funeral. The message did not address the event directly.
    


            The supreme leader has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel.
    


            A top Iranian commander whose disappearance from public view after Israeli attacks sparked rumors he'd been killed attended Saturday's funeral procession in Iran's capital.
    


            Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, thought to be a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was seen among the crowds in Tehran at the state funerals being interviewed on camera.
    


            Asked by a reporter if he had a message for the people of Iran, Qaani said that “we have been successful so far, and from now on we will also move forward successfully.”
    


            Qaani was not seen for days after the unprecedented Israeli strikes but is one of the highest-profile military figures to survive.
    


Qasem Soleimani, his predecessor in the Quds Force — the overseas branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps — was killed in a US drone strike during the first term of Donald Trump's presidency.
    


            Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani — another high-profile Iranian military and political official previously thought to be dead — also appeared at Saturday's state funerals, according to pictures published by Iranian state media.
    


            Iran's president thanked citizens for turning out to mourn those killed in the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire.
    


            “I sincerely thank you, dear people,” Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X Saturday.
    


                    “With love, you bid farewell to the martyrs of the homeland, and the voice of our unity reached the world,” he continued.
                





            He added that “serving such a free-spirited nation is the honor of my life.”
    


            Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran today for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and civilians killed by Israeli attacks earlier this month.
    


            A host of senior Iranian officials joined the mass mourning in Tehran on Saturday for those killed in Israel's attacks, but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was absent.
    


            Khamenei, who has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel, did not immediately issue a statement regarding the state funeral, which was held for 60 top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed in the 12-day conflict.
    


            The chief of staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, was also not seen at the ceremony, but issued a statement praising people for showing up to what he described as a “unique and multi-million-strong funeral.”
    


            Senior officials in attendance included Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei.
    


More on Khamenei: The 86-year-old supreme leader made his first public statement since the Israel-Iran truce on Thursday, issuing the remarks in a recorded message from an undisclosed location. Khamenei declared victory in the conflict despite Israel's killing of senior Iranian leaders and the strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites.
    


This post has been updated to reflect Mousavi's statement.



            Sixty coffins made their way through Tehran, carrying military leaders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed in Israeli attacks this month, CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports.
    


            Attendees said they wanted to honor those who were killed, but also vowed revenge on both Israel and the US.
    


Watch here:



            The bodies of those killed in Israeli airstrikes have begun to arrive at a cemetery in Iran's capital for burial.
    


            The remains of Hassan Salehi, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Iran's Evin prison, have arrived at Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Tehran, Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim reported.
    


            Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest confidants, is set to visit Washington, DC on Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            The visit comes ahead of a meeting between Netanyahu and President Donald Trump.
    


            On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is no set date for a Netanyahu visit, but Trump is “very open” to it.
    


            This past week, Trump denounced an ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt” in a social media post, which was hailed by allies of the long-time Israeli leader.
    


            Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Tehran on Saturday to commemorate the senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed during Iran's 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            As mourners clad in all black chanted death to Israel and America, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged the loss of lives was “hard and painful” but pledged the nation would return to “new glory.”
    


            The  brief and bloody conflict between Iran and Israel, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon, saw casualties on both sides and ended with a US-brokered ceasefire.
    


Here's what you need to know: 



            Emirates, one of the United Arab Emirates' flagship carriers, has canceled all fights to and from Iran's capital Tehran until July 5 due to the “regional situation,” the company announced Saturday.
    


            The company said that customers connecting through Dubai with final destinations in Iran “will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice.”
    


            “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. We continue to closely monitor developments,” the company said in a statement.
    


            The Israeli military detained six settlers in the occupied West Bank overnight after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say the suspects attacked security forces.
    


            The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people.
    


            When Israeli forces approached the group, the IDF says the soldiers were physically and verbally assaulted. In addition, the suspects vandalized and damaged the security forces' vehicles and attempted to ram the forces.
    


            Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said.
    


                    “The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement.
                





Some background: Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory.
    


            Earlier this week, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.”
    


            Speaking on the day of state funerals for those killed in Israeli strikes, Iran's foreign minister said that the loss of lives is “hard and painful” but their “memory will live on.”
    


            Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on Instagram Saturday, stressed that the “pride of a nation is paramount” as he pledged that Iran would return to “new glory and greater strength” following its 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            He added that the 60 who were killed and whose bodies were laid to rest Saturday – in an event which saw hundreds of thousands line the streets of Tehran – gave their “blood” but did not surrender their honor.
    


            Top military commanders, scientists and civilians were killed in the brief and bloody conflict, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
    


            The US military did not use bunker-buster bombs on one of Iran's largest nuclear sites last weekend because the site is so deep that the bombs likely would not have been effective, the US' top general told senators during a briefing on Thursday.
    


            The comment by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, which was described by three people who heard his remarks and a fourth who was briefed on them, is the first known explanation given for why the US military did not use the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb against the Isfahan site in central Iran.
    


            Questions have swirled over the past week about the extent of the damage to Isfahan and other sites following US strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.
    


            US officials believe Isfahan's underground structures house nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon.
    


            US B2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites.
    


            But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine.

Lines of communication over the U.S.'s national security between the White House and Congress are strained as speculation grows that a preliminary report on the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was leaked out of Capitol Hill.

The White House has been put under pressure to provide more information on the bombings in Iran last weekend, as bits and pieces begin to leak to the media and House leaders threaten to limit classified briefings for rank-and-file lawmakers.

Johnson told lawmakers he thinks the leak was a “substantial setback” and guessed the leak to the two major outlets came “probably from this body.”

“It probably affects what we are able to be told because there are real risks to that,” Johnson said, following remarks from President Donald Trump that he wants to limit the flow of intelligence due to the leaks. “So, it's unfortunate. It affects how the institution works, and that's a problem, so we got to address it.”

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) criticized the White House for not briefing the “Gang of Eight” on Capitol Hill, a group that consists of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), and Jeffries, along with the top members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. 

Another point of frustration within the Democratic caucus came when intelligence officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, were set to brief lawmakers on the operation Tuesday, before being delayed just hours before they were set to meet.

The briefing instead took place Friday morning — almost a full week after the strikes took place — where Democrats left unsatisfied with the information they received, saying they still have more questions. 

“It wasn't particularly enlightening and there remain a whole host of questions that need to be answered for the American people,” Jeffries told reporters leaving the briefing. 

“I still have questions and frankly, they had a hard stop and had to leave to attend to other matters, and there are a lot more members who had some questions to ask,” Rep. Gabe Amo (D-RI) told the Washington Examiner.  

Democrats are not the only party that feels this lack of trust surrounding recent international developments.

Earlier this week, before the briefing, CNN and the New York Times reported that the strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back months as opposed to years, based on an early Pentagon intelligence assessment. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt snapped back at CNN in response to the leaked intelligence. 

“This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove,” Leavitt said Thursday. “This is a reporter who has been used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives.”

The White House planned to limit classified information flow to Congress following the leak, which immediately prompted pushback from Democrats. Axios reported that a White House official confirmed the decision, saying the information was shared soon after it was posted to a system used to share information with Congress, CAPNET. 

The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's top members sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel requesting that they conduct an investigation into the leak, and if the perpetrator is found, they are to be prosecuted to the “fullest extent of the law.”

“As the Chairman and Ranking Member of the relevant congressional committee tasked with overseeing the U.S. Intelligence Community, these allegations of improper disclosure of national security information strike at the heart of our solemn and apolitical mission to ensure classified data never falls into the hands of our adversaries,” Chairman Rick Crawford (R-AR) and ranking member Jim Himes (D-CT) wrote in a joint statement. “We are unified in our understanding that improper disclosure of classified information has no place in our body politic, nor are such disclosures in our nation's interests.”

The White House sent legal letters to both publications following the leak, prompting a response from both outlets. 

“No retraction is needed. No apology will be forthcoming. We told the truth to the best of our ability. We will continue to do so,” the New York Times said.

CNN responded to Trump's attacks, specifically when he called on the CNN reporters to be fired, by defending their reporting.

“We stand 100% behind Natasha Bertrand's journalism and specifically her and her colleagues' reporting,” the outlet said.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) responded to the leaks, seemingly confirming the information found in the reports.

“To me, it still appears that we have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a handful of months,” Murphy said. “There's no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don't seem to stand up to reason.”

“I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated,” Murphy added.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had “some concern” that people are jumping to conclusions too early. He said he thinks “leaks of any crimes should be prosecuted.” 

HOUSE LAWMAKERS LEAVE IRAN BRIEFING TIGHT-LIPPED AND DIVIDED ON SATISFACTION 

“I simply wish that the administration would adhere to that same level of secrecy about classified information that shouldn't be shared on nonclassified channels, like Signal, and the fact that we still don't know whether the participants on some of those calls have ever even had their phone scrubbed for malware. That is not right,” Warner said.

In response to the attacks last Saturday, Iran launched a missile attack on Monday against a U.S. military base in Qatar that resulted in no damage or casualties. Trump then announced Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire that remains fragile.

Federal officials arrested two people on Friday at a Los Angeles house tied to a suspected Iranian human smuggling network said to have been "repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism."

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced the arrests in an X post on Friday, saying that the operation was part of a broader national security effort involving multiple federal agencies. 

"CBP executed a federal search warrant today at a human smuggling hub in Los Angeles tied to national security threats," the agency said. "Two individuals were arrested during the operation, which was led by CBP's Special Response Team with support from Border Patrol tactical units and Air and Marine Operations."

The detentions follow the arrests of seven Iranian nationals at the same location earlier last week, CBP said, adding that the suspects were on the FBI Terror Watchlist and connected to an Iranian human trafficking hub.

"The location has been repeatedly used to harbor illegal entrants linked to terrorism," CBP said.

"Intelligence indicates the smuggling network has trafficked individuals from adversarial regimes, including Iran—posing direct risks to U.S. national security," CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Sunday.

Officials did not identify the two suspects taken into custody at the home on Friday.

Beckham added that the agency was able to thwart potential threats thanks to President Donald Trump's priorities.

"President Trump is clear: the safety of the American people comes first," Beckham said.

Burritos on a payment plan, explained.

You've probably noticed it by now: You're shopping online for some makeup or a new pair of running shoes or a water table for your toddler, and when you go to check out, you have a new option — why not break up the cost into four payments, made over time? 

US consumers, especially Gen Z and millennial ones, have been embracing “buy now, pay later” services like Klarna and Afterpay with gusto the last few years. It's not hard to see the attraction: Unlike a credit card, most BNPL plans don't carry interest, and they generally don't impact your credit score (though that is now changing).

On social media people tout BNPL as a way to buy stuff you want but don't have the cash for right then — or maybe ever. And that's starting to show up in the data: Leading BNPL company Klarna — which recently partnered with the food delivery service DoorDash, spawning a thousand memes — saw its net losses from consumers not paying their loans more than double in the first quarter of this year. 

All this has Kyla Scanlon worried. Scanlon is an author and economic commentator, best known for breaking down economic issues through blog posts and videos on social media. In a video she published shortly after Klarna announced its partnership with DoorDash, Scanlon called the rise of BNPL a symptom of our “poor-impulse-control economy.”

“What I worry about is that the convenience and the impulsivity that it allows for allows for the expansion of the grift economy, of a world where people are spending money on things that they don't need to and they're just totally lost in that cycle,” Scanlon told Today, Explained co-host Noel King.

Scanlon talked to King about buy now, pay later, Gen Z's relationship to debt, and what financial responsibility looks like in today's economy. Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You're a commentator, you're a public intellectual, you're also a member of Gen Z, and you speak directly to Gen Zers who are operating in the economy. How are young people using BNPL?

A lot of Gen Zers have had very common interactions with debt. Student loan debt is a big part of the life of a Gen Zer. Medical bills, anything involving a credit score. Debt has been so normalized for the younger generation that when they see something like BNPL, it's like, “Oh, this is just casual debt.”

For young people, they've been raised in the shadow of the 2008 crisis and student loan debt. It's just what they do with their money.

This is interesting, that debt has always been available to Gen Z. If you're an older millennial like I am, that's not really the case. You might remember getting your first credit card when you were 22, but there was no Apple Pay. You couldn't just pay for stuff on your phone. 

And it strikes me that my nieces and nephews who are teenagers, they can do that. They have this ease with paying for stuff and taking on debt for stuff that never occurred to me when I was young.

A lot of that is structural. In 2020, the government sent out unemployment checks. In 2021, the Fed had rates really close to zero. We're always talking about the deficit. We're always talking about how much money the United States as a country owes. And so I think for everybody, they're looking at that and they're like, If the government owes all this money, surely I can have a little bit of debt, too. 

And then credit scores have become such a core part of the American identity. It really informs a lot — how you can buy a house or if you can even get certain loans. I think people view debt as structural to themselves as a person, and that's increased. And I think it really has a lot to do with the environment that Gen Z has grown up in and the fact that these tools are so readily available and they're so easy to use.

Talk to me a bit about debt. Is it dangerous?

When you look at debt systemically, it's not inherently a bad thing. Like most things, it's a tool. Like social media, you could say it's bad, but it's just a tool. It's all about how you use it. Same with debt. 

BNPL in itself isn't evil, especially if you can pay it all off without having to face those high interest rates. Credit cards themselves aren't evil. But it's really about the system that encourages these sorts of products to be created. 

Real wages were stagnant for a really long time. The entry-level labor force has really deteriorated. It's very tough to get a job right now. If you're graduating from college and the college wage premium has eroded quite a bit, rent is high because we don't build enough housing. Groceries are up. People are looking at the very high prices, the impossibility of ever buying a house, the struggles that they might be facing in the labor force. 

It's like, Well, sure, it might be irresponsible to use BNPL to get a moisturizer from Sephora, but what else am I going to do? I don't see a solution before me. And so I think that's been the big thing with debt — we've used it as a tool in order to navigate some of the hairier parts about being in the United States right now. 

I think historically you might say, Look, you can't afford the Sephora lotion right now, why don't you just wait? And it sounds like what you were saying is that's a bit of a privileged or maybe old-fashioned idea of how paying for things works.

Right! I think, “Why don't you just wait?” ignores some of the ladder issues that we're facing as Gen Z, younger people — even millennials, in some capacity, are facing this broken-ladder problem where they could wait to buy that moisturizer, but that would require the entry-level labor market to free up again, that would require wages to really speed up, that would require the housing market to normalize. 

So I think a lot of people blame younger people for using debt and using BNPL. And you should be careful — I don't think you should be living above your means in an extravagant way. But it really is a psychological buffer of sorts, where people are just like, Well, I don't know what else to do, so I'm going to go buy this thing. 

It is an element of instant gratification, the same thing that we see in social media, but for Gen Z-ers and younger people. There isn't that stability, that expectation of stability in the traditional sense. And so I think these little small luxuries matter — buying that moisturizer matters because it is indulgent in a certain way, but it's also an act of agency in an economy that doesn't feel like it's allowing you into it.

It does feel like there is some American ethos here that says, To live is to be in debt, and we've all accepted that.

I mean, that's the only way you can get by sometimes. There's that misquoted statistic about living paycheck to paycheck. It's not 60 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. It's far lower, but I think a lot of people just feel like, one wrong move and the whole thing could come tumbling down.

And so we have these issues that are outside of the realm of consumer packaged goods being delivered where we have to really start thinking through actual solutions to these problems, because they're not going to fix themselves. The incentives are too misaligned.

Watch live as the Senate is taking a prolonged procedural vote during a rare Saturday evening session as Republicans struggled to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans voting in a dramatic late Saturday session narrowly cleared a key procedural step as they race to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

Senate Republicans voting in a dramatic late Saturday session narrowly cleared a key procedural step as they race to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline. The tally, 51-49, came after a tumultuous session with Vice President JD Vance on hand if needed to break the tie.

The tally, 51-49, came after a tumultuous night with Vice President JD Vance at the Capitol to break a potential tie. Tense scenes played out in the chamber as voting came to a standstill, dragging for more than three hours as holdout senators huddled for negotiations, and took private meetings off the floor. In the end, two Republicans opposed the motion to proceed, joining all Democrats.

There's still a long weekend of work to come. 

Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.

“It's time to get this legislation across the finish line,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

Ahead of roll call, the White House released a statement of administrative policy saying it “strongly supports passage” of the bill. Trump himself was at his golf course in Virginia on Saturday with GOP senators posting about the visit on social media.




But by nightfall, Trump was lashing out against holdouts, threatening to campaign against one Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who had announced he could not support the bill because of grave Medicaid cuts that he worried would leave many without health care in his state. Tillis and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against. The president was working the phones from the Oval Office late Saturday night, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Pressure was mounting from all sides — billionaire Elon Musk criticized the package as “utterly insane and destructive.”

The 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act was released shortly before midnight Friday, and senators are expected to grind through all-night debate and amendments in the days ahead. If the Senate is able to pass it, the bill would go back to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.

With the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Senate bill would increase by 11.8 million the number of people without health insurance in 2034.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans unveiled the bill “in the dead of night” and are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what's in it. He immediately forced a full reading of the text late Saturday in the Senate, which would take hours.

The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up and has admonished the “grandstanders” among GOP holdouts to fall in line.

The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.

But the cutbacks to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments, which a top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said would be a “death sentence” for America's wind and solar industries, are also causing dissent within GOP ranks. 

The Republicans are relying on the reductions to offset the lost tax revenues but some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.

Tillis said he spoke with Trump late Friday explaining his concerns. Paul of Kentucky had been opposed to the bill's provision to raise the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion. 

And GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who initially voted no, switched hours later after private talks to agree to advance the bill.

As the roll call teetered, attention turned to Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was surrounded by GOP leaders in intense conversation. She voted to proceed.

A short time later, Thune drew conservative holdouts Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to his office, with Vance and Johnson also joining. Talks dragged on.

Then swiftly, Vance led them all back in to vote. 

Later, Scott said he had met with the president, adding, “We all want to get to yes.” 

Lee said the group “had an internal discussion about the strategy to achieve more savings and more deficit reduction, and I feel good about the direction where this is going, and more to come.”

The release of the bill's draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the measure to ensure it complied with the chamber's strict “Byrd Rule,” named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump's bill.

Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals, including shifting food stamp costs from the federal government to the states or gutting the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were deemed out of compliance with the rules.

But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.

The final text includes a proposal for cuts to the Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary hurdles and objections from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers. 

The CBO had said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The budget office has started releasing initial assessments of the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.

Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the package would cost the poorest Americans $1,600, the CBO said.

The Senate included a compromise over the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, but the issue remains unsettled.

The current SALT cap is $10,000 a year, and a handful of Republicans wanted to boost it to $40,000 a year. The final draft includes a $40,000 cap, but limits it for five years. Many Republican senators say that is still too generous, but House Republicans are not fully satisfied either.

House Speaker Mike Johnson sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington.

The Supreme Court finally slapped down this week one of the many Biden-appointed judges who have hampered President Donald Trump's deportation efforts. The court blocked Judge Brian Murphy's order creating new burdensome administrative hurdles and making it harder to deport illegal immigrants to countries they are not originally from.

One of the biggest barriers to swift and just immigration enforcement is that many countries either limit how many of their citizens they will take back from the United States each year or forbid the U.S. from sending back any of their citizens. Countries with such limits or bans include China, Cuba, India, Venezuela, and Vietnam. When these countries refuse to take back their citizens, the Department of Homeland Security is forced to house them, sometimes indefinitely, making it harder to hold and process other illegal immigrants.

Trump has sought to alleviate this bottleneck by entering into diplomatic agreements with third countries that will take deportees who are not citizens of those countries. These agreements are complex and sensitive foreign policy matters that the federal judges have no business interfering with.

More importantly, however, there is nothing in the Constitution, federal statute, or federal regulation that empowers an illegal immigrant to choose which country they are deported to. If an illegal immigrant is captured and determined to have no right to be in the U.S., then the federal government has every right to send them to whatever country is willing to take them.

Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by Senate Democrats just this past December, disagrees. He believes that illegal immigrants destined for deportation to countries other than their home country are due extra rights. Specifically, he believes they are due notice of which country the U.S. plans to deport them to, and 15 days to challenge their deportation to that country. Mind you, this is on top of the process the migrants are already due to determine if they have credible fear of torture if they are returned to their home country.

Murphy entered a nationwide injunction of all such third-country deportations this March. One Guatemalan illegal immigrant argued in Murphy's court that he should not be deported to Mexico because he was raped in the country. He wanted a hearing so that he could argue that Mexico was too unsafe for him. Murphy agreed.

The Trump administration then appealed Murphy's order, with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer telling the Supreme Court in May that Murphy “invented” an “onerous set of procedures” that made perfectly legal third-country deportations all but impossible.

The Supreme Court did not issue a decision explaining why it agreed to hold Murphy's order, but the fact that it suspended its enforcement indicates that Murphy will most likely lose when the full case reaches the court.

Writing in dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Trump administration, “Has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard.”

This is just false. The Trump administration honored onerous court orders from open borders Biden judges, including the order to stop deporting illegal immigrants to El Salvador. There is no evidence that the Trump administration has wrongly deported any U.S. citizens or legal residents.

BORDER SECURE, NO NEW LEGISLATION REQUIRED

Illegal immigrants are due process before they are deported, but not the same process as people are due in criminal trials. In Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, Justice Antonin Scalia said, “While aliens who have established connections in this country have due process rights in deportation proceedings, the Court long ago held that Congress is entitled to set the conditions for an alien's lawful entry into this country and that, as a result, an alien cannot claim any greater rights under the Due Process Clause.”

If an illegal immigrant would be tortured by their government upon return to their home country, then they deserve protection. But just because an illegal immigrant thinks the U.S. is safe, and all other countries are less safe, doesn't entitle them to legal status here. If illegal immigrants want to choose which country they live in next, they should self-deport. Otherwise, the U.S. government has every right to send them to any country that will take them.

Iran has banned the head of the United Nations‘ nuclear watchdog organization from its nuclear sites and is removing surveillance cameras from them, according to multiple reports.

On Saturday, Iranian Parliament vice speaker Hamid Reza Haji Babaei announced the barring of Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, from the regime's nuclear sites as well as the removal of the surveillance measures, moves that threaten to keep Iran‘s nuclear footprint even more in the dark following U.S. and Israeli attacks designed to dismantle their nuclear program.

Iran claimed the moves, which are the regime's latest following a ceasefire in its “12 Day War” with Israel, were made after Israel acquired “sensitive facility data.”

The new measures from Iran were announced during a mass funeral held in Tehran over the weekend for high-level Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists killed in targeted Israeli strikes earlier this month when it began its military campaign dubbed “Operation Rising Lion.”

Thousands of the regime's supporters gathered in the capital for the funeral on Saturday, where Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and two top officials thought to be dead after earlier Israeli strikes — specifically, Quds Force Cmdr. Esmail Qaani and Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei — were also present.

Footage posted by Araghchi show Iranians packed onto a main street, chanting and waving Iranian flags.

Pezeshkian and Araghchi issued statements shortly after the event, with both suggesting Iran will not back down following the strikes from Israel that decimated the top brass of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as later U.S. bombings that the Trump administration has insisted “obliterated” three nuclear sites.

“The Wave after Wave of Patriots who took to the streets in Iran to honor military commanders, scientists, researchers and civilians including women and children murdered in cold blood by the Cowardly Israeli regime, all have one message: Unlike the Feeble Israeli regime, we do NOT hide our losses; we are PROUD of our MARTYRS, who are our role models. For every fallen officer or scientist, Rest Assured 100 More Are Lining Up To Take Their Places. Until the Last Drop of Blood, the Powerful and Resilient Iranian Nation will Resist whoever attempts to decide OUR destiny,” Araghchi posted on X.

CENTRIFUGES AT IRAN'S FORDOW ‘NO LONGER OPERATIONAL,' GROSSI SAYS

The United States responded to separate threats against Grossi from Iranian officials on Saturday, specifically alleged calls for the IAEA head's arrest and execution. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called those threats “unacceptable” in a statement posted on X.

“Calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of IAEA Director General Grossi are unacceptable and should be condemned. We support the lAEA's critical verification and monitoring efforts in Iran and commend the Director General and the lAEA for their dedication and professionalism. We call on Iran to provide for the safety and security of IAEA personnel,” Rubio said.

Watch live as the Senate is taking a prolonged procedural vote during a rare Saturday evening session as Republicans struggled to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

WASHINGTON (AP) — At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July. 

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount. 

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. 




There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year. 

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. 

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. 

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings. 

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.

Former top White House adviser Elon Musk renewed his criticism of President Donald Trump‘s “big, beautiful bill,” this time trashing the Senate‘s version of the massive tax bill as “utterly insane and destructive.”

Musk, who engaged in a fiery online public feud with Trump over the House's version of the bill earlier this month, signaled that he thinks no different of the Senate bill text, an updated version of which was released late on Friday.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Musk posted on X.

The updated version of the tax bill released by the Senate Budget Committee includes bigger cuts to clean energy as well as an earlier termination of electric vehicle tax credits, which are pertinent to Musk as CEO of Tesla.

Under the House version, EV tax credits weren't slated to expire until as late as 180 days after the bill's signing into law. The Senate accelerated the credits' termination to as soon as the end of September.

The Senate is currently engaged in an initial procedural vote on the tax bill, with a final vote on the bill likely getting pushed further into the weekend.

Musk continued his rebuke of the bill in later X posts on Saturday, calling it “utter madness” and saying the projected $5 trillion debt ceiling increase in it will put “America in the fast lane to debt slavery!”

He also shared a screenshot of a poll conducted by the Tarrance Group showing widespread agreement from Republican voters that the “big, beautiful bill” would increase the federal deficit.

SENATE GOP INCLUDES STEEPER CUTS TO CLEAN ENERGY CREDITS IN UPDATED TAX BILL

“Polls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,” Musk said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), one of the few GOP holdouts on the bill, retweeted Musk's post, saying “it is very clear people don't want this extreme amount of debt and reckless spending.”

GOP Tax Bill:

North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis said he won't seek reelection following a primary threat from President Donald Trump.

“As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven't exactly been excited about running for another term,” the Republican said in a statement Sunday. “It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking reelection.”

Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., will not run for re-election when his term is up, he announced Sunday, hours after he voted against advancing President Donald Trump's tax bill and drew the president's ire.

"As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven't exactly been excited about running for another term," Tillis said in a statement.

"That is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home," he said.

"It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking re-election," he continued.

Tillis' announcement is likely to spur a competitive — and costly — election in the key battleground, where Trump had already said he would explore supporting a primary challenger to the two-term senator.

Tillis has been an outspoken critic of Trump's megabill, and he voted against advancing the package in a key late Saturday vote, making him one of two Republicans to do so. 

After Tillis' "no" vote,Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the North Carolina Republican.

"Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against "Senator Thom" Tillis," Trump wrote.

"I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America," he continued.

Tillis' seat, which he has held since 2014, has also been a target for Democrats in next year's midterms eager for a pick-up opportunity.

Insiders at artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia have dumped more than $1 billion in stock over the last year, according to a report from the Financial Times.

About $500 million worth of sales occurred over the last month as the market notched new highs and shook off geopolitical tensions that had rattled investors, according to the report. The stock is up more than 17% this year despite concerns over curbs limiting AI chip sales overseas and 44% over the last three months.

Securities filings revealed that the tech titan recently unloaded about $15 million worth of shares as part of his more than $900 million plan announced in March to sell up to 6 million shares through the end of the year. Huang's net worth totals about $138 billion, placing him as 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Last week, the chipmaking giant hit a fresh record and rallied for five straight days following the stock sales and an annual shareholder meeting, where the CEO called robotics the biggest opportunity for the company after AI. That helped the chipmaker regain its seat as the most valuable company ahead Microsoft and Apple.

The FT article cited a report from VerityData, which noted that the jump in shares above $150 prompted the stock dump.

Last year, Huang unloaded more than $700 million in Nvidia shares as part of a prearranged plan.

A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment on the report.

President Donald Trump said that Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has "to do the right thing" if he is elected mayor of New York City, or he could see federal funding dry up.

"Let's say this, if he does get in, I'm going to be president and he's going to have to do the right thing, or they're not getting any money," Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo during an interview that aired Sunday.

"He's got to do the right thing," Trump said.

It's not the first time that Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding for local politicians, particularly those in blue states, whose positions he opposes.

He's previously threatened to strip federal funding from California over Gov. Gavin Newsom's policies towards transgender athletes participating in women's sports.

While Trump took particular aim at Mamdani, the 33-year-old who defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the first round of the city's Democratic mayoral primary last week, he also made a wider funding threat to all New York City mayoral candidates.

"I can tell you this, whoever's mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves, or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially," Trump told Bartiromo.

Trump has repeatedly called Mamdani — who is a Democratic socialist — a communist, as he did during the interview on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures.

Mamdani has rejected that label.

"I am not and I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am," Mamdani told NBC News' Kristen Welker on "Meet the Press."

On Monday, Chinese technology giant Baidu plans to make its Ernie generative AI large language model open source, a move by China's tech sector that could be its biggest in the AI race since the emergence of DeepSeek. A Baidu spokesman confirmed the plan and said the open sourcing will be a gradual roll-out. 

Will it be a shock to the market on the order of DeepSeek? That's a question which divides AI experts.

One big change is that Baidu wasn't always on the open source bandwagon.

"Baidu has always been very supportive of its proprietary business model and was vocal against open-source, but disruptors like DeepSeek have proven that open-source models can be as competitive and reliable as proprietary ones," Lian Jye Su, chief analyst with technology research and advisory group Omdia, previously told CNBC.

Now that Baidu has made the decision to open source, even if it isn't a DeepSeek moment, it is an important one for the global AI race.

"This isn't just a China story. Every time a major lab open-sources a powerful model, it raises the bar for the entire industry," said Sean Ren, associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California and Samsung's AI Researcher of the Year.

Ren says Baidu's move puts pressure on closed providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to justify gated APIs and premium pricing.

"While most consumers don't care whether a model's code is open-sourced, they do care about lower costs, better performance, and support for their language or region. Those benefits often come from open models, which give developers and researchers more freedom to iterate, customize, and deploy faster," Ren said.

Other industry experts view an open source Ernie as potentially being even more disruptive to both U.S. and Chinese competitors when it comes to the price equation.

"Baidu just threw a Molotov into the AI world," said Alec Strasmore, founder of AI advisory Epic Loot. "OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, all these guys who thought they were selling top-notch champagne are about to realize that Baidu will be giving away something just as powerful," Strasmore said, comparing Baidu's move to Costco creating Kirkland.

He said the message to all of the world's startups is "stop paying top dollar."

"This isn't a competition; it's a declaration of war on pricing," Strasmore said. 

Baidu said in March that its recent ERNIE X1 model delivers performance on par with DeepSeek's R1 "at only half the price."

Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, hinted earlier this year that the roll-out would help developers worldwide in AI development. "Our releases aim to empower developers to build the best applications — without having to worry about model capability, costs, or development tools," Li said in a speech to developers in China in April.

In the least, it's one more moment in time when investors have to analyze how cost dynamics in AI model access are changing quickly, and what it means that more applications can be built on top of "these dirt cheap models," Strasmore said. "Baidu is going to be seeding the world with Chinese AI models," he added.

Making these AI tools more widely available is a notable development from Baidu, but "the news of Baidu going open source probably lands with a big thud," said Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy at Phenom, an applied AI company for the human resources sector. "Most people in the United States don't even know it's a Chinese tech company," he said.

Jurkiewicz compared the broader move to open architecture in AI as the difference between Android and Apple.

"When Android first emerged, its standout feature was that it was configurable and customizable. But it was almost too much work in the sense that people just wanted the thing to function correctly,"  Jurkiewicz said. "Android, out of the box, is plain and vanilla, so it has to be customized, and that's a real challenge," he added. 

There is no doubt that the open source movement in AI is a threat to the business models of major players in the space. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, wrote in a January Reddit thread about the issue, and in more recent Senate testimony has said an open source rollout may happen this summer. 

"While OpenAI has open-sourced models in the past, the company has generally favored a proprietary, closed source development approach," Altman said, acknowledging that may need to change. "[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy," Altman said. "Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it's also not our current highest priority … We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years."

In the May Senate appearance, Altman said, "We realize that we open AI can do more to help here. So we're going to release an open source model that we believe will be the leading model this summer because we want people to build on the U.S. stack in terms of closed source models. A lot of the world uses our technology and the technology of our colleagues. We think we're in good shape there."

More recently, Altman posted that the release would be delayed, but still scheduled for summer.

One advantage U.S. players maintain, according to Jurkiewicz, is that the Baidu release will encounter skepticism at the enterprise level, with many questions about security. "On the other hand, the big players — OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Co-Pilot — are integrated with everything," Jurkiewicz said.

Ren said while open source often conveys a sense of transparency, that doesn't necessarily translate into market trust. "Just because a model's weights are public doesn't mean we know what data it was trained on, whether consent was given, or if those data contributors were credited or compensated," Ren said. 

As AI becomes more embedded into our daily lives, that lack of accountability becomes a serious issue. "If we don't address it now, we risk scaling systems that quietly extract value from millions of people without consent, credit, or compensation," Ren said.

With DeepSeek, some countries banned the AI and there were widespread concerns about consumers downloading the technology. 

Strasmore said the Chinese links can get dangerous if more products are tied to the Baidu API. "This would be virtually giving China access to every app on every phone. That's one scary component," he said.

Elon Musk slammed the US Senate's latest version of President Donald Trump's multi-trillion dollar tax bill Saturday, warning that the cuts to electric vehicle and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country.

Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, posted on his social media platform X about the bill, which the Senate advanced in a contentious vote late Saturday. Musk recently left Trump's side after working for several months as the head of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America's and the rest of the world's dangerous vulnerability. China's latest actions show their readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence.

This is not a new challenge. The United States has known for over 15 years that its critical mineral supply chains were too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Chinese leverage and control. And yet, across Democratic and Republican administrations, we have failed to respond with urgency or coherence. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors.

Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough — but have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?

Skepticism is high. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back.

Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described China's export license process as highly invasive — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users.

Executives say the process amounts to "official information extraction."

While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes.

This isn't just licensing — it's competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk.

This vulnerability did not happen overnight. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China's export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.

The first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments.

The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China's six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing's grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available.

The recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of "weaponizing" its control over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan. Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in recycling, substitution, and refining technologies.

Predictably, Beijing reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the plan as "a pretext" for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating confrontation out of fear of losing market share.

Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington's orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid.

The raw numbers are staggering. China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare earth mining but over 90% of refining capacity. It produces 92% of the world's neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. This dominance is no accident. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine.

U.S. sites like MP Materials' Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. The DoD and DOE have offered grants, and the FY2026 Trump budget looks to expand U.S. mining capacity and secure access to critical minerals. But all this remains dwarfed by China's head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector.

China moved early and decisively into Africa and Latin America, partnering with governments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and refining infrastructure. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries.

The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China's licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction.

This is a decisive moment. China is betting that America's internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. They may be right. The U.S. needs to proves them wrong.

The United States must now treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. From mining and refining to magnet production and recycling, every link must be strengthened through targeted investment, permitting reform, and strategic coordination.

A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance.

The six-month export reprieve from China is not a solution — it is a stress test. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. Washington must respond with urgency, unity, and a strategy equal to the scale of the challenge. There is still time, but not much.

Many of us already know the components of a healthy relationship — things like strong communication, total honesty, and unwavering commitment. But most people don't actually know what these qualities look like in practice.

As a result, couples may find themselves in a miserable situation. Even worse, they don't recognize it due to unhealthy habits like emotional numbing, suppression, or normalizing issues. When you're stuck in familiarity and routine, it's hard to stop and assess your feelings.

As a psychologist who studies couples, I often recommend a quick survey to couples. If you find yourself answering "no" to all the questions, there's a chance you may be unhappy in your relationship, but not realize it.

In relationships, conflict is both inevitable and necessary. But the way you fight matters more than what you're fighting about. If it always feels like it's you versus your partner, instead of the two of you versus the problem, it's worth assessing why.

Research on conflict resolution shows that when both partners believe a disagreement is solvable, they're more likely to find a way forward. But you can't rely solely on optimism; you need a shared and clear-cut strategy. Otherwise, arguments can turn into emotional duels and over time lead to distance and resentment.

If your answer to this question is "no," ask yourself: "What are we fighting for?" If the answer isn't the relationship itself, sit down together to discuss and reestablish what it really means to be a team.

The healthiest relationships give you room to breathe. To laugh loudly, ugly cry, make a mess, and be weird. Research notes that people who feel secure in expressing themselves in authentic, unrefined ways are more likely to engage in healthier relationship behaviors.

If you have to constantly remind yourself to suppress parts of your personality, you'll slowly start to lose invaluable parts of your identity.

If you answered "no" here, you need to pause and reflect. You deserve to be with someone who doesn't flinch when they're met with your most real, honest self. Great partners see this as a special privilege. It shouldn't feel like something that has to be "tolerated."

In the early wooing stages, curiosity comes naturally. You want to know everything about each other — what they're thinking, how they see the world, what makes them tick. But later on, that curiosity can dwindle.

Research asserts that curiosity is a fundamental tool for emotional intimacy. If your partner stops asking questions about your thoughts, feelings, or experiences, they'll never get to know the new versions of you that are born each and every day.

A "no" to this question could suggest that your relationship is running on autopilot. A partner who's truly invested in you will keep asking, keep listening, and keep learning about who you are.

Mistakes don't matter nearly as much as how they're handled in the aftermath. Does your partner own up to their faults and try to make things right? Or do they dodge responsibility, get defensive, and turn the blame onto you?

Research on conflict repair teaches us that even the smallest gestures — acknowledging a mistake, offering a sincere apology, or even using humor — can stop an argument from spiraling. But when accountability is absent, you'll eventually start questioning whether you can trust each other at all.

If your partner never takes ownership, or if they consistently make you feel like the "difficult" one for bringing up a concern, it might be time to regroup and reconsider what's keeping you invested. Honesty, humility, and a genuine desire to do better should be a bilateral norm in a relationship.

When Priyanka Jain, co-founder and CEO of vaginal microbiome test and care company Evvy, is hiring, she knows what she wants to see in a candidate.

She's looking for someone "who goes above and beyond just what your job title tells you to do," she says. That could mean including an "Interests" section on your resume that lists volunteering or outside projects, or just illustrating your passion for your field with accomplishments on the job.

She also knows what she doesn't want to see in a candidate: Someone who's only interested in doing strategy. When execution is "outside of their zone of genius," she says, "that's always a little concerning."

Every company needs people who strategize about how to improve operations, as well as people who execute. But at a startup, where personnel and resources are limited, "you don't have the luxury of having strategy people and execution people," says Jain.

Every person needs to be able to "figure out what the problem is," she says, plus, "you also need to be able to get into the weeds, figure out the solution, write it yourself, get it into the world."

At the end of the day, when it comes to strategy and execution at a startup, "everybody has to be able to do both."

To suss out if candidates can both ideate and roll up their sleeves, Jain asks about a problem they had in a past company and how they solved it.

"The level of detail that anybody's able to get into as it relates to the process and not just the deliverable tells you a lot about how involved they actually were," she says. If they can explain exactly the steps it took to solve the problem, they probably took those steps themselves — and could do it again to solve problems at their next company.

The other element Jain is looking for in a candidate's answer is their attitude. "If they get excited about both sides," she says, "that's always a really good sign." They'll carry that level of enthusiasm for getting things done going forward.

The S&P 500 rose to a fresh record on Friday, but macro uncertainties persist. Investors may want to consider dividend-paying stocks as a way to enhance returns in the event of choppy markets.

Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend stocks, given that these experts assign their ratings after an in-depth analysis of a company's fundamentals and its ability to generate solid cash flows to consistently pay dividends.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Fast-food chain McDonald's (MCD) is this week's first dividend pick. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.77 per share. With an annualized dividend of $7.08 per share, MCD stock offers a dividend yield of 2.4%. It is worth noting that McDonald's has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years and is on track to becoming a dividend king.

Recently, Jefferies analyst Andy Barish reiterated a buy rating on McDonald's stock with a price target of $360. The analyst believes that MCD stock is a buy on a pullback. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on McDonald's stock and a price target of $342.

Barish sees near-term acceleration in McDonald's U.S. same-store sales (SSS) and medium-term acceleration in unit growth as the major drivers for the stock, which would help narrow the current valuation gap compared to rivals Yum Brands and Domino's. The analyst also noted improved international SSS, as the company remains a trade-down beneficiary due to its value proposition and low-price point combos.

Among other positives, Barish mentioned brand power and competitive advantages in size, scale, advertising, supply chain and most up-to-date chain of restaurants. He is also optimistic about MCD due to its defensive qualities and brand positioning during uncertain times, higher visibility in delivering low-single to mid-single digit SSS compared to rivals, acceleration of global unit growth to 4% to 5%, category-high operating margins and massive free cash flow generation to support dividends and repurchases.

"Despite a soft 1Q and well-known pressures on the low-end consumer, MCD is executing well by balancing value, innovation, and marketing," said Barish.

Barish ranks No. 591 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 9.9%. See McDonald's Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

We move on to EPR Properties (EPR), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on experiential properties such as movie theaters, amusement parks, eat-and-play centers and ski resorts. EPR recently announced a 3.5% increase in its monthly dividend to $0.295 per share. At an annualized dividend of $3.54 per share, EPR stock offers a dividend yield of 6.2%.

Following an extensive visit to EPR's corporate headquarters and meetings with some teams in the company, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak upgraded EPR stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $65 from $52. TipRanks' AI analyst also has an "outperform" rating on EPR with a price target of $61.

Yarmak turned bullish on EPR, noting the recent rise in the stock and improvements in the cost of capital. He said that the company can "once again return to reasonable external growth."

Specifically, the analyst estimates that year to date, EPR's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has improved to about 7.85% from nearly 9.3%. At these improved levels, Yarmak said that he thinks the company can start aggressively making more acquisitions and boost external growth.

Moreover, Yarmak highlighted the continued improvement in the fundamentals of the theatre industry and expects percentage rent to enhance EPR Properties' earnings over the next several years. Meanwhile, the improved cost of capital is enabling management to look at other external growth opportunities, mainly golf assets and health and wellness assets.

Yarmak ranks No. 670 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.2%. See EPR Properties Stock Charts on TipRanks.

The third stock on this week's dividend list is Halliburton (HAL), an oilfield services company that provides products and services to the energy industry. HAL offers a quarterly dividend of 17 cents per share. At an annualized dividend of 68 cents per share, Halliburton stock's dividend yield stands at 3.3%.

Following a virtual investor meeting with management, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on Halliburton stock with a price target of $24. Also, TipRanks' AI analyst has an "outperform" rating on HAL stock with a price target of $23.

While management acknowledged near-term risks to the North American business, Mehta noted that about 60% of HAL's revenue comes from international markets and presents a relative degree of resilience, which is not priced into the stock. Halliburton expects continued softness in certain geographic locations such as Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. However, most of HAL's international rigs are exposed to unconventional drilling, and management does not expect these rigs to experience large suspensions.

Interestingly, management expects "idiosyncratic growth" from four key areas: unconventional completion opportunities in Argentina and Saudi Arabia, market share growth in directional drilling, intervention opportunities as operators are more likely to spend greater time optimizing existing assets than developing greenfield assets, and artificial lift opportunities. Mehta expects these opportunities to enhance margins and support strong free cash flow conversion, making HAL stock attractive at these levels.

Despite the expected softness in pricing in North America, Halliburton expects to maintain a premium to the market due to its differentiated Zeus technology and the long-term nature of its electric contracts, noted the analyst.

Mehta ranks No. 541 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 9.2%. See Halliburton Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday pleaded for progress in ceasefire talks in the war in Gaza, calling for a deal that would halt the fighting in the 20-month-long conflict as Israel and Hamas appeared to be inching closer to an agreement.

An Israeli official said plans were being made for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to travel to Washington in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a new deal. The official declined to discuss the focus of the visit and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not yet been finalized.

"MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social early Sunday between posts about a Senate vote on his tax and spending cuts bill.

Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters, he said, "We're working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of."

Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Trump was taking office earlier this year, attempts since then to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed.

A top adviser to Netanyahu, Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire.

The Gaza message wasn't the only Middle East-related post by Trump. On Saturday evening, he doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it "a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure."

In the post on Truth Social, he said the trial interfered with talks on a Gaza ceasefire.

"(Netanyahu) is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING," Trump wrote.

The post echoed similar remarks Trump made last week when he called for the trial to be canceled. It was a dramatic interference by an international ally in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. And it unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity in the country.

The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza, an early target of the war that has been severely damaged by multiple rounds of fighting.

Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.

The military will expand its escalating attacks to the city's northern section, calling for people to move southward to the Muwasi area in southern Gaza, Adraee said.

After being all but emptied earlier in the war, hundreds of thousands of people are in northern Gaza following their return during a ceasefire earlier this year.

An Israeli military offensive currently underway aims to move Palestinians to southern Gaza so forces can more freely operate to combat militants. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible transfer.

The war in Gaza began with Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage, about 50 of whom remain captive with less than half believed to be alive.

Israel's retaliatory response has killed more than 56,000 people, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but say more than half of the dead are women and children.

The war has set off a humanitarian catastrophe, displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape.

Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over one major sticking point, whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.

Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying in remarks on the Telegram messaging app that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. A Netanyahu spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses.

In this article

For years, France's Eutelsat has been trying to build a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink satellite broadband service.

The company merged with British satellite venture OneWeb in 2023, consolidating the region's satellite communications industry in an effort to catch up to Starlink, which is owned by SpaceX.

Last week, the French state led a 1.35-billion-euro ($1.58 billion) investment in Eutelsat, making it the company's biggest shareholder with a roughly 30% stake.

Europe largely lags behind the U.S. in the global space race. Starlink's constellation of over 7,000 satellites dwarfs Eutelsat's. Meanwhile, Europe's launch capabilities are more limited than the U.S. The region still relies heavily on America for certain launch services, which is a market dominated by SpaceX.

Eutelsat currently has a market capitalization of 1.6 billion euros, much lower than estimates for Starlink owner SpaceX's value, which was pegged at $350 billion in a secondary share sale last year. In 2020, analysts at Morgan Stanley said that they see Starlink growing to $80.9 billion in their "base case valuation" for the firm.

Luke Kehoe, industry analyst at network monitoring firm Ookla, said France's investment in Eutelsat shows the country "is now treating Eutelsat less like a commercial telco and more like a dual-use critical-infrastructure provider" and a "strategic asset" in the European Union's push for technological sovereignty.

However, building a European competitor to Starlink will be no mean feat.

Communications industry experts tell CNBC that, while Eutelsat could boost Europe's efforts to create a sovereign satellite internet provider, challenging its U.S. rival Starlink would require a significant increase in investments in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.

Eutelsat's OneWeb arm operates a total of 650 LEO satellites, which is less than a tenth of Starlink's 7,600-strong global satellite constellation.

"To offer greater capacity and coverage, [Eutelsat] needs to increase the number of satellites in space, a task made more difficult due to the fact that many of OneWeb's satellites are nearing the end of their lifespan and will need to be first replaced before growing the constellation's size," Joe Gardiner, research analyst at market research firm CCS Insight, told CNBC via email.

Ookla's Kehoe echoed this view. "Eutelsat's chances of achieving parity with Starlink in the mass-market satellite broadband segment within the next five years remain limited, given SpaceX's unmatched global scale in LEO infrastructure," he said.

"Even with the latest injection of capital from the French state, Eutelsat continues to lag behind Starlink in several key areas, including capital, manufacturing throughput, launch access, spectrum and user terminals."

Nevertheless, he thinks the company is "well positioned to succeed in European-sovereign, security-sensitive and enterprise segments that prioritise jurisdictional control and sovereignty over raw constellation capacity." The enterprise segment refers to the market for corporate space clients.

That's certainly the hope. France's Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to ramp up its investment in space, saying last week that "space has in some way become a gauge of international power."

When Eutelsat announced its investment from France last week, the firm stressed its role as "the only European operator with a fully operational LEO network" as well as the "strategic role of the LEO constellation in France's model for sovereign defense and space communications."

Earlier this year, Eutelsat was rumoured to be in the running to replace Starlink in Ukraine. For years, Starlink has offered Ukraine's military its satellite internet services to assist with the war effort amid Russia's ongoing invasion.



Relations between the U.S. and Ukraine soured following the election of President Donald Trump and reports surfaced that U.S. negotiators had raised the possibility of cutting Ukraine's access to Starlink.

Germany set up 1,000 Eutelsat terminals in Ukraine in April with the aim of providing an alternative — rather than a replacement — for Starlink's 50,000 terminals in the war-torn country.

Since then, U.S.-Ukraine tensions have somewhat cooled, and Starlink remains the primary satellite broadband provider to the Ukrainian military.

Eutelsat's former CEO Eva Berneke has herself admitted that the company cannot yet match Starlink's scale.

"If we were to take over the entire connectivity capacity for Ukraine and all the citizens — we wouldn't be able to do that. Let's just be very honest," she said in an April interview with Politico.

Berneke was replaced as CEO in May by Jean-Francois-Fallacher, a former executive of French telecoms giant Orange.

Meanwhile, even though Eutelsat has been ramping up investments in LEO satellite with its OneWeb unit, experts say its technical architectures and orbital designs are ultimately different from Starlink's.

"The OneWeb constellation currently uses a bent-pipe architecture, which is not as capable as Starlink satellites; therefore, OneWeb will also need to invest in second-generation satellites," he added.

The French firm's use cases also differ to Starlink's. Eutelsat operates a constellation of geostationary orbit (GEO) as well as LEO satellites. GEO satellites orbit the earth at a much higher altitude than their LEO equivalents and can typically cover more land with fewer satellites.

"Eutelsat's higher altitude satellites are leveraged for specialized use cases, such as polar coverage for companies and research facilities in remote regions like Greenland and Alaska," said Joe Vaccaro, vice president and general manager at Cisco's ThousandEyes network intelligence unit.

Looking ahead, Eutelsat said it plans to "build upon its operation improvements" with a "differentiated go-to-market model" and "strong European anchoring." It also noted that the U.K. government could also increase its investment in Eutelsat "in due course."

President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate late Saturday night, pushing the massive spending package one step closer to the president's desk.

The vote on a motion to proceed to final debate on the bill passed with 51 yeas and 49 nays. Every Democrat and two Republicans, Sens. Thom Tillis, N.C., and Rand Paul, Ky., voted against it.

The actual voting took hours and the measure only passed after three Republican holdouts — Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Cynthia Lummus of Wyoming — folded and voted yes.

Sen. Ron Johnson, Wis., an outspoken critic of the bill, ultimately changed his vote to a "yes" from a "no." That additional Republican vote gave the bill 51 yeas, so Vice President JD Vance did not need to cast a vote to break a tie.

The ultimate vote was a victory for Republican Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., who has pledged to get the bill to Trump for his signature by July 4.

Trump hailed the late-night vote passage and she he was "VERY PROUD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TONIGHT" in an all-caps, late-night Truth Social post.

But the hours of uncertainty and last-minute wrangling underscore the tricky path ahead for the controversial package.

Saturday's procedural vote tees up a final Senate vote on the megabill that will likely happen sometime Sunday or Monday.

Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are forcing the 940-page bill to be read out loud once it heads to full debate on the Senate floor Sunday.

"We will be here all night if that's what it takes to read it," Schumer wrote Saturday on X.

While the package cannot officially pass the upper chamber until the final vote, the procedural vote was considered a big test for Thune.

The vote comes after weeks of turmoil and tension over the massive package that exposed bitter policy disputes and emboldened some firm Republican holdouts.

Some Republican senators repeatedly balked at the bill's impact on the national debt.

The Senate bill could add over $3.9 trillion to the national debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis.

The sweeping domestic policy package will also have to be passed again in the House, which just narrowly passed its own version of the bill last month.

Some House Republicans have already expressed opposition to key elements of the Senate version of the bill — most notably deep cuts to Medicaid — likely foreshadowing a close vote in the lower chamber.

Both Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson hold narrow majorities in their respective chambers, meaning they can only afford to lose the support of a small number of Republican lawmakers to pass the package in a party-line vote.

Meanwhile, Trump continues to urge lawmakers to get the package passed before Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline.

"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal," the White House said in a statement of administration policy on Saturday.

I'm your AI market decoder—cutting through the chaos to show you what trends really matter (and which ones to ignore).

SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is making a bold return to crypto—and it could be the move that finally unlocks its full potential as a financial powerhouse. After exiting the crypto space in late 2023 due to regulatory hurdles, SoFi's relaunch of crypto trading and its push into blockchain-based remittances in 2025 position the company to capitalize on two of fintech's fastest-growing trends. With a $49 billion global blockchain fintech market projected by 2030, SoFi's strategic pivot could transform it from a niche player in digital banking to a leader in the next era of financial services.  

The Crypto Relaunch: Reclaiming a Niche MarketSoFi's decision to reintroduce spot trading for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by year-end 2025 isn't just a return to past popularity—it's a calculated play to attract a younger, tech-savvy demographic. The relaunch comes with plans to expand into stablecoins, staking, and crypto-collateralized lending over the next 24 months. These features align with a growing demand for crypto integration into everyday financial tools.  

 

For context, SoFi's stock jumped over 2% on June 25, 2025, after announcing these plans, signaling investor optimism. But the real opportunity lies in user growth. Younger investors, who prioritize app-based simplicity and exposure to digital assets, could flock to SoFi's platform. This demographic is also more likely to engage with multiple financial services—lending, savings, and insurance—thereby boosting cross-selling opportunities.  

Blockchain Remittances: Tapping into a $93 Billion U.S. MarketSoFi's blockchain-powered remittance service isn't just a side project—it's a direct attack on traditional banking inefficiencies. By leveraging blockchain for near-instant transfers with transparent fees, SoFi aims to undercut legacy players like Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram (MGI). The U.S. alone sends $93 billion annually in remittances, primarily to Latin America and Asia, with global remittances exceeding $800 billion (per 2023 World Bank data).  

The service's 24/7 accessibility and support for stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to fiat—eliminate the need for currency conversion fees. For example, a Mexican immigrant in California could send USD or a USD-pegged stablecoin to a relative in Mexico City, with funds arriving in minutes rather than days. This service isn't just cost-effective; it's a gateway to deeper customer relationships. Users who send remittances via SoFi may also adopt its savings accounts, loans, or investment products, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem.  

 

Regulatory Tailwinds and Strategic InfrastructureSoFi's comeback is enabled by shifting regulatory sands. The OCC's March and May 2025 interpretive letters (1183 and 1184) explicitly permit national banks to engage in crypto custody and stablecoin activities—a green light for SoFi to operate without fear of regulatory overreach. This aligns with a broader trend under the Trump administration to foster innovation in financial services.  

Furthermore, SoFi's Galileo platform—its API-driven banking-as-a-service infrastructure—is now being opened to third-party developers. This could turn SoFi into a behind-the-scenes provider of blockchain infrastructure, akin to how Twilio (TWLO) dominates communications APIs. By monetizing its technology stack, SoFi could diversify revenue beyond its core customer base.  

The Ecosystem Play: From Banking to Blockchain HubSoFi's vision isn't limited to crypto trading or remittances. CEO Anthony Noto aims to integrate blockchain into every facet of its offerings, from crypto-collateralized loans to blockchain-backed insurance products. Imagine using Bitcoin as collateral for a mortgage or a savings account that earns yield via staking. This holistic approach could make SoFi the “Swiss Army knife” of digital finance, reducing customer churn and boosting lifetime value.  

Financially, SoFi's first-quarter 2025 results—$71 million net income and $772 million revenue—suggest it's already on solid footing. Adding crypto and remittance fees to its revenue streams could accelerate growth.  

Risks and ConsiderationsNo crypto play is without risks. Volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices could deter risk-averse users. Regulatory uncertainty, though diminished, remains a wildcard. Competitors like Block (SQ) and Coinbase (COIN) are also vying for crypto dominance. However, SoFi's existing user base of 2.5 million+ and its vertically integrated banking model give it a leg up.  

Investment Thesis: A Stock Poised for Multiples ExpansionSoFi's moves address two critical pain points: stagnant user growth and reliance on fee-based banking. Crypto and remittances could add millions of new users and billions in revenue. If successful, SoFi's valuation multiple—currently trading at roughly 2.5x revenue—could expand to match fintech peers like PayPal (PYPL), which trades at ~5x revenue.  

For investors, SOFI's stock represents a bet on two trends: the mainstreaming of crypto and the dominance of all-in-one fintech platforms. The near-term catalysts—crypto trading relaunch and remittance rollout—make 2025 a pivotal year. While risks exist, the upside for a company primed to lead the next wave of financial innovation is compelling.  

Final Take: SoFi's crypto pivot isn't just a comeback—it's a blueprint for fintech leadership. Investors who believe in a future where crypto and blockchain are mainstream should consider SoFi as a core holding in their tech portfolios.

XRP may have the potential to reach three-digit prices if it becomes the go-to bridge currency for CBDCs globally.

Notably, XRP trades at $2.19 today, up over 3% this past week. However, despite the current position, many investors still see it as undervalued. This is due to its growing utility in real-world payments, especially the possibility that it could serve as a bridge currency for central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs.

Amid the growing momentum behind CBDC development, there is a rise in demand for a fast, neutral asset that can connect different currencies across borders. 

For context, more than 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are actively researching or testing CBDCs. As a result, several industry commentators have pointed to XRP, with its speed and low transaction cost, as a possible candidate to bridge these CBDCs when they launch.

However, the impact on price remains uncertain. To explore what XRP could be worth if it took on the role of a global CBDC bridge, we asked ChatGPT for an estimate based on market data and reasonable assumptions.

In its evaluation, ChatGPT presented three factors: transaction volume, liquidity needs, and XRP's supply. Today, the foreign exchange market sees more than $7.5 trillion move every day. If XRP powered just 1% to 3% of CBDC-related flows within that market, it could settle between $75 billion and $225 billion daily.

Notably, supporting that level of volume would require strong liquidity. Analysts often calculate liquidity demand using a simple formula: divide the daily transaction volume by how many times each XRP moves in a day. 

If each XRP moves five times daily, and the volume reaches $100 billion, the system would need $20 billion worth of XRP available at any given time. Spread across the current circulating supply of 55 billion XRP, this creates a base price of around $0.36 per token just to meet liquidity needs.

However, that is only part of the assessment. According to ChatGPT, that figure does not reflect market dynamics like speculation, holding, or growing scarcity. Taking those into account, ChatGPT projected a range of potential prices. 

Specifically, with basic adoption as a bridge currency, XRP could rise to somewhere between $10 and $20. If global usage expands and demand for liquidity rises, the price might reach $50 to $100. And if XRP sees wide adoption, lower velocity, and reduced supply, the price could jump to $120 or even cross $500 in the most bullish scenario.

Nonetheless, ChatGPT stressed that all of this depends on factors such as regulatory approval, large-scale adoption, and real-world use working together. While that remains uncertain, the XRPL's momentum in the CBDC space continues to grow.

Several national banks and global financial bodies already use the XRP Ledger in pilot programs. Ripple has teamed up with countries like Palau, Bhutan, Georgia, and Montenegro. While these projects do not rely on XRP itself, their use of a private ledger similar to the XRPL indicates the network's appeal for CBDCs.

We're living in a digital world that's constantly changing, and it looks like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are becoming a big part of how companies recognize their employees. Imagine if every time you did something great at work, you got a unique digital token that actually had value and could be verified. This article takes a deep dive into how NFTs are shaking up the way we think about employee recognition, boosting morale, and even transforming payroll in the crypto age. Spoiler alert: It's not all sunshine and rainbows, but it's definitely interesting.

What are NFTs? They're unique digital assets that show you own something on-chain. Usually, we think of them as art or collectibles, but now they're spilling into the workplace. Using NFTs as a way to recognize employees means companies can give out personalized rewards that are real and can't be faked. This kind of recognition does wonders for morale and can make employees feel more connected to the company.

With more companies looking for new ways to pay their employees, crypto payroll systems are becoming more common. These systems let employees get paid in Bitcoin or stablecoins, which is pretty much what a lot of tech-savvy folks want. It's not just about being trendy, though; these systems can help keep employees around and give companies a good reputation. Startups are starting to see crypto payment platforms and B2B crypto payment solutions as essential tools for their HR departments.

Imagine getting a digital token every time you hit a milestone at work. Companies are starting to do just that, using NFTs as small bonuses or rewards for achievements. It's a fun way to recognize hard work, and it gives employees a tangible way to show off what they've accomplished. Plus, these NFTs can go in personal wallets, which means employees can take their recognition with them after they leave the company.

While Bitcoin has been a go-to for crypto payments, stablecoins are taking center stage for payroll. They don't fluctuate like Bitcoin does, so they make it easier for companies and employees to manage expectations when it comes to salary. This is especially true when you're dealing with employees from different countries, where currency value can swing wildly. Companies that adopt stablecoins can make sure their employees get paid on time and in a way that makes sense.

Of course, nothing comes without its challenges. Legal and compliance issues are major hurdles for any fintech startups looking to dive into this world. Plus, trying to mesh NFT payroll with old-school systems can feel like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. There's also the tech side of things—companies need to know how to mint, manage, and transfer these NFTs, and cybersecurity is a must to keep employee data safe.

NFTs and crypto are changing the game for employee recognition and payroll. They offer a way to give out personalized rewards that are real and transparent, making employees feel valued. But there are definitely some challenges to tackle, especially when it comes to regulations and tech. As the digital economy keeps shifting, companies that adapt will likely have a leg up in attracting and keeping good talent.

While blockchain technology promises transparency and decentralization, practical issues such as slow transaction speeds and high fees have made it challenging to meet the needs of everyday users.

Whether you're trading tokens, minting NFTs or engaging with decentralized apps, the experience often falls short of the seamless and efficient interactions people expect from modern digital platforms. On public blockchains such as Ethereum, periods of heavy demand still push transaction fees into the dollars and delay settlement for minutes—an experience that certainly falls short of mainstream expectations.

To close that gap, developers have turned to Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions: purpose-built networks that execute transactions off the main Ethereum chain, compress the results into cryptographic proofs, and post those proofs back to Layer 1 for immutable finality. The approach combines the security of a battle-tested base layer with the speed and cost efficiency required for mass-market applications—an architecture that now safeguards roughly $36 billion across thousands of decentralized apps.

A Layer 2 solution is any protocol that executes transactions off the base blockchain (Layer 1) while ultimately relying on that Layer 1 for security and final settlement. Think of it as a mall parking garage: shoppers still enter the main building (Ethereum), but the actual traffic is redirected to multi-storey ramps built next door, preventing gridlock at the front door.

Most L2s fall into two camps: rollups (Optimistic or Zero-Knowledge) and state channels/validium hybrids. Other recognized Layer 2 solutions include nested blockchains and sidechains.

While all L2s aim to enhance scalability, their methods for inheriting Layer 1 security and managing data availability vary, and some, like Validiums, introduce additional trust assumptions regarding data availability. All share the same north star: compress data, cut fees and leave heavy-duty security to Ethereum's battle-tested consensus.

An L2 batches hundreds, or even thousands of user transactions, creates a cryptographic proof of the new state, and submits that lightweight proof to Layer 1.

Optimistic rollups (e.g., Optimism and Arbitrum) assume the batch is valid unless challenged within a dispute window. Fraud proofs keep operators honest.

ZK-rollups (e.g., zkSync Era or Polygon zkEVM) generate succinct validity proofs up-front, so withdrawals finalize in minutes rather than days.

Either way, the result is a 10-100× throughput boost because only the proof, not every transaction detail, touches the L1.

Layer 2 solutions differ significantly from Layer 1 in several key aspects. In terms of throughput, Layer 1 processes around 15 to 20 transactions per second (TPS), while Layer 2 dramatically boosts this capacity, with rollups achieving over 1,000 TPS and solutions like Polygon potentially reaching up to 65,000 TPS.

Transaction fees also show a stark contrast; Layer 1 fees typically range from $0.25 to $0.50 on average but can spike to $20-$60 in times of high network congestion. On the other hand, Layer 2 fees are often below $0.05, with some solutions reducing costs to as little as $0.0196, post-Dencun upgrade.

Regarding security, Layer 1 relies on its native Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, whereas Layer 2 inherits security directly from Layer 1 through cryptographic proofs. Data availability also diverges in approach, with Layer 1 storing data entirely on-chain, while Layer 2 integrates on-chain proofs with minimal data requirements.

Finally, their use cases reflect their technical capabilities. Layer 1 is typically reserved for high-value decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and settlement processes, while Layer 2 excels in high-volume scenarios like payments and gaming due to its enhanced scalability and lower costs.

Lower fees are the headline benefit of L2s, but several second-order benefits matter just as much:

Ethereum's March 2024 Dencun upgrade introduced blob space (EIP-4844), a cheap data lane expressly for rollups. Blobs lowered average L2 transaction fees by roughly 90%, catalyzing the migration of everyday payments and micro-trades off-chain.

By shifting order-routing, AMM swaps, and NFT orders to L2 while anchoring security to L1, Ethereum keeps its decentralization ethos intact yet gains Visa-scale throughput—a feat that pure L1 scaling alone couldn't handle.

Although L2 networks provide a number of benefits over L1 in terms of cost and speed, there's no such thing as a free lunch in crypto security:

Users should generally be looking for L2s with open-sourced node software, decentralized proposers and permissionless fraud-proof systems scheduled on the roadmap.

The L2 user experience still remains a bit unintuitive: bridging ETH, switching RPCs, and wrapping gas tokens still confuse newcomers. Wallet standards like EIP-4337 (account abstraction) and gas-sponsored transactions help, but widespread education is needed. Regulators also eye cross-chain bridges as potential money-laundering chokepoints, which may impose compliance overhead on sequencer operators in 2026 and beyond.

The industry increasingly treats Ethereum as a settlement layer, a Supreme Court for finality, while thousands of L2 “city-states” handle day-to-day commerce. Optimism's Superchain will soon enable atomic cross-rollup calls, and ZK-proof hardware acceleration promises sub-cent fees. Whether one mega-rollup dominates or a mesh of specialized L2s persists, the direction is clear: scale out, not up.

Bottom Line

Layer 2 scaling solutions have moved from academic whitepapers to production rails powering millions of daily transactions. By batching computation off-chain and posting cryptographic receipts on-chain, they deliver faster, cheaper and greener crypto experiences without abandoning Ethereum's security guarantees. Expect L2s—not yet another monolithic Layer 1—to carry Web3 toward mass adoption.

What Is Layer 2?

Layer 2 is a secondary network that processes transactions off the main blockchain while anchoring final settlement back to it for security.

What's The Difference Between Layer 1 And Layer 2?

Layer 1 handles base consensus and data availability; Layer 2 executes bulk transactions and periodically submits proofs to Layer 1, achieving higher throughput and lower fees.

Can I Use My Ethereum Wallet On Layer 2 Networks?

Yes. Most L2s are EVM-compatible, so Metamask and hardware wallets work once you add the network RPC or connect via WalletConnect.

What Is The Best Layer 2 Solution Right Now?

“Best” depends on priorities: Base leads in TVL, Optimism's Superchain dominates transaction share, and ZK-rollups like zkSync offer near-instant finality with strong cryptographic guarantees.

A closely followed crypto analyst is predicting a historic rally for altcoin markets based on an unprecedented technical setup.

The pseudonymous analyst known as TechDev shares a chart with his 532,000 followers on the social media platform X showing the price action of TOTAL2 – which tracks the total market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins – with a Bollinger Band indicator.

Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to assess price volatility and identify potential breakout or mean-reversion opportunities. When the bands are close together, it suggests that volatility is historically low and the asset is potentially due for a big move.

According to TechDev, the Bollinger Bands are tightly contracted for TOTAL2, suggesting that a huge burst to the upside for altcoins is imminent.

“Altcoin compression is at a record high.

Expansion will be unlike anything the market has seen.”

The analyst also believes that, based on the overall business cycle, Bitcoin is nowhere near its top.

“Re-evaluate your top calls.”

TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge.

The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for investor risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, according to TechDev.

“The steep part lies ahead.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,165, up 4% in the last seven days.

NFT projects lost roughly $1 million in crypto over the past week when hackers posed as IT staff and struck at the heart of minting systems. The breach hit fan-token marketplace Favrr and Web3 initiatives Replicandy and ChainSaw, among others.

According to onchain investigator and cybersecurity analyst ZackXBT, the attackers pushed out mass batches of NFTs, drove floor prices to zero, then cashed in their haul before teams could react.

Based on reports, the group quietly joined development squads under false identities. They gained insider access to minting contracts. Then they minted thousands of tokens and NFTs in moments.

The sudden flood crushed floor prices and let the thieves grab hot cash in minutes. It all unfolded in under a week, and about $1 million vanished from these projects' treasuries.

Favrr suffered one of the biggest hits. The thieves dumped tokens so fast the market couldn't catch up. Replicandy and ChainSaw saw similar moves. At Replicandy, floor values hit zero almost instantly.

ChainSaw's stolen crypto still sits inactive in wallets, waiting for launderers to stir it back into exchanges. ZackXBT pointed out that nested services then further obscured the money trail.

Onchain transfers moved funds through multiple exchanges and wallets. Analysts say tracing mixed outputs can take weeks. Exchanges must review huge logs.

That slows or even blocks law enforcement from locking down accounts. In the Coinbase data leak back in May 2025, about 69,461 customers had personal info exposed.

Contractors were bribed to hand over user data, leading to an extortion bid against the exchange.

The NFT/Web3 insider episode echoes Ruby Sleet's tactics. In November 2024, that group targeted aerospace and defense firms, then shifted to IT companies via fake hiring drives.

They used social engineering to plant malware and harvest credentials. Today's blockchain and NFT hacks show that open and irreversible ledgers magnify mistakes. When insiders gain privileges, there's often no undo button.

Security experts warn teams to rethink trust models. Zero‑trust approaches limit each engineer's reach. Multi‑party approval gates could block sudden minting spikes.

Real‑time activity monitors can flag odd behavior right away. And code reviews paired with identity checks for every new hire help close gaps before they're abused.

 Kenya's crypto startups fear a Binance-linked lobby group could tilt new regulations in the exchange's favor under the proposed VASP bill. 

Some crypto startups are raising concerns over Kenya's proposed virtual asset service providers (VASP) Bill, warning it could hand outsized influence to a Binance-linked lobby group, potentially undermining fair competition in the country's digital asset industry.

According to disclosures seen by The Kenyan Wall Street, a private think tank called the Virtual Asset Chamber of Commerce (VAC) will be included on the regulatory board established under the draft law.

Some crypto stakeholders in Kenya claim that VAC has run Binance-sponsored regulatory talks, lacks independence and acts as a proxy for the exchange.

“All regulation convos by VAC that happened recently have been sponsored by Binance. Then VAC, a private consulting entity, with a non-compete with Binance ‘magically' gets a regulatory seat? How is this fair? How is this constitutional?” one stakeholder told The Kenyan Wall Street.

The report claimed that Binance pays VAC $6,000 per country each month for policy advocacy, citing a confidential agreement. This raises fears that the lobby group could skew Kenya's crypto rules to benefit Binance and sideline local players.

Critics also reportedly noted similarities with VAC's reported attempts to insert itself into Rwanda's regulatory process.

“If an entity of poor international reputation or one with clear conflict of interest becomes our crypto regulator, Kenya shall never leave FATF and EU greylists,” warned another stakeholder.

In a comment to The Kenyan Wall Street, VAC's director Basil Ogolla defended VAC's role, pointing out its two-year campaign of consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and Parliament.

“The National Assembly's decision to include VAC as a nominator in the regulatory board reflects the trust and confidence built through this track record of meaningful engagement,” Ogolla reportedly said.

Notably, the new regulatory body in Kenya will also include representatives from the National Treasury, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), along with a lawyer and an accountant.

Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment but had not received a response by publication.

In May, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan's National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

In an interview on April 17, CEO Richard Teng revealed that Binance is actively advising several governments on building strategic Bitcoin reserves and crafting crypto policies.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng said.

Earlier, on April 7, former CEO Changpeng Zhao was named an adviser to Pakistan's newly launched Crypto Council, which will oversee the country's blockchain and digital asset initiatives.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that the recent price movements in the altcoin market indicate a potential bottoming out, which could pave the way for a broader recovery. He attributes this to the weakening of gold prices and the possibility of changes in macroeconomic policies, such as future rate cuts, which could inject liquidity into risk assets like altcoins. Additionally, van de Poppe points to a bullish divergence forming on the OTHERS/BTC chart, a signal that often precedes major altcoin rallies. He emphasizes that the current technical patterns align with those observed at previous cycle lows, further supporting his view that the market is bottoming out.

However, not all analysts share this optimistic outlook. Tony Severino notes that Bitcoin's dominance has recently risen to 65.66%, with RSI indicators remaining strong, indicating that Bitcoin continues to outpace the rest of the market. The altcoin season index is currently low at 22, suggesting that altcoins have yet to regain momentum. This discrepancy highlights the challenge that altcoins face in reclaiming market share from Bitcoin. Traders are closely monitoring the situation to see if the tide will turn in favor of altcoins.

Altcoins have been experiencing a significant downturn, with exchange flows dropping by 40% year-over-year. This prolonged period of decline often precedes corrective movements, suggesting that the market may be poised for a strong rebound. Analysts have highlighted the potential for a 50% gain in altcoins, citing historical trends and increased institutional interest as key factors. Several top altcoins have shown bullish signals, with key support levels holding firm, indicating a potential turnaround.

Technical indicators further support the possibility of an altcoin rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for many altcoins is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting that a positive shift in market sentiment could trigger a comeback. For instance, Dogecoin's RSI is at nearly 46, positioning it for a potential recovery if market conditions improve. Additionally, several altcoins have flashed bullish signals, hinting at a potential rebound in the near future.

Despite the challenges, the altcoin market shows signs of resilience. Historical data indicates that altcoins often experience a surge following a Bitcoin rally, although the classic altseason pattern may no longer be as pronounced. Analysts suggest that the current market conditions could signal the beginning of an altcoin season, where cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana could see significant gains. A drop of less than 50% in these altcoins would mark the official start of this season, potentially leading to phenomenal increases.

Several altcoins have shown promising developments that could drive their rebound. Bittensor (TAO) has gained institutional attention following a $10 million investment from Synaptogenix, signaling growing interest in decentralized AI networks. Stellar (XLM) has outperformed major coins over the past year, with a 159% annual gain, and is showing signs of a technical rebound. SUBBD, currently in its presale phase, is pioneering AI-driven content creation with staking incentives and growing adoption. NEAR Protocol has proposed cutting its inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%, which could tighten supply and potentially increase the value of the NEAR token. Story (IP) has unveiled a $10 million fund aimed at early-stage teams building at the intersection of intellectual property, AI, and finance, positioning IP as a major real-world asset class.

In summary, while the altcoin market has faced significant challenges, technical indicators and institutional interest suggest a potential rebound. Several altcoins have shown bullish signals and promising developments, positioning them for a strong recovery if market sentiment improves. The current low readings and historical trends indicate that the altcoin market may be poised for a turnaround, with several cryptocurrencies showing the potential for significant gains.

The shutdown underscores the volatility of Web3 ventures in Africa and the broader challenge of building sustainable platforms in a still-nascent ecosystem. While Momint helped prove that there is real creator demand for digital ownership, it also shows that scaling such products into profitable businesses remains tough.

South African crypto startup, Momint, once hailed as a pioneering social media and NFT marketplace, is shutting down.

According to coverage on BitKE, Momint initially drew attention for helping African creators monetize digital content through NFTs.

— BitKE (@BitcoinKE) May 3, 2021


The platform facilitated over 400,000 transactions, onboarded thousands of creators, and championed real-world utility for tokenized assets.

 

Here's a clear summary of Momint's key activities as documented by BitKE over the years:

1.) Launch & Growth Milestones

May 2021 – Momint officially launched as South Africa's first NFT marketplace supporting ZAR payments. Early successes included sales of high-profile NFTs like Bryan Habana's rugby turntable for over $20,000. It raised roughly $2.1 million in seed funding within two weeks.



By March 2022 – The platform enabled a historic NFT sale of Nelson Mandela's arrest warrant for over $130,000—one of Africa's most significant NFT transactions.

2.) Real‑World Asset & Energy Focus

Feb 2023 – Partnered with Sun Exchange to launch SunCash, a solar crowdfunding initiative. Users could buy solar cells starting at R150 ($8.33) to fund installations across Limpopo, Western Cape, and Mpumalanga. Investors received ~12% annual returns paid quarterly in USDC, with Delmas High School serving as the flagship site.

July 2024 – Received a $50,000 grant from DFINITY's ICP hub (Mzansi Web3), after reaching ~$1.95 million in marketplace volume and 53,000+ users. The grant supports Momint's integration with ICP blockchain to improve real-world asset tracking, reduce transaction costs, and enable smart-meter data linking.

3.) Crypto Payments & Merchant Integration

July 2023 – Integrated with 1Voucher to allow crypto-to-fiat conversion via vouchers. Users convert ETH or USDC into 1Voucher codes and spend them at over 10,000 South African merchants (e.g., Pick n Pay, Woolworths) as well as international retailers, restaurants, ride‑hailing, and travel services. The Momint wallet supports cheap cross-border transfers too.

Platform Stats (as of mid‑2024)

53,000+ user wallets

Approximately $1.95 million in total marketplace volume

 

Despite these successes, Momint struggled with unsustainable operating costs and limited user growth beyond its early adopters. In its closure announcement, the team cited challenges with fundraising in the current market environment and shifting regulatory headwinds as key reasons for shutting down.

The shutdown underscores the volatility of Web3 ventures in Africa and the broader challenge of building sustainable platforms in a still-nascent ecosystem. While Momint helped prove that there is real creator demand for digital ownership, it also shows that scaling such products into profitable businesses remains tough.

More than a quarter of South Koreans in their 20s to 50s now own digital assets, with their crypto investments making up 14% of their total financial portfolios, according to a new report from the Hana Institute of Finance released Sunday.

The study, titled 2050 Generation's Virtual Asset Investment Trends, shows that interest in crypto cuts across age groups. Those in their 40s led participation at 31%, followed by people in their 30s at 28% and 50s at 25%.

78% of respondents in their 50s said they use crypto as a way to amass funds, while 53% said they were preparing for retirement through crypto investments. More respondents now cite growth potential, diversification, and structured savings plans as key motivations for investing.

Meanwhile, 70% of respondents expressed interest in expanding crypto investments in the future. 42% said they would invest more if traditional financial institutions took a larger role in crypto markets, while 35% cited stronger legal protections as a key factor in boosting confidence.

Korean investors make regular crypto purchases

Investment patterns are also maturing. The proportion of investors making regular purchases rose from 10% to 34%, and mid-term trading increased from 26% to 47%, while short-term trading fell slightly.

The way investors get information is also changing. Per the report, reliance on word-of-mouth has declined, while the use of official exchanges and analytical platforms has risen.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the primary choice, with six in ten investors including BTC in their holdings. As experience grows, however, many diversify into altcoins or stablecoins. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and security tokens (STOs) remain niche, with nine in ten investors sticking exclusively to coins.

“Virtual assets play a major role within investors' portfolios,” said Yoon Sun-young, a researcher at Hana Financial Research Institute. “Investors expect legal institutionalization and expansion of the role of the existing financial sector.” 

A major pain point highlighted was the restriction preventing linking multiple bank accounts with crypto exchanges. Seven in ten investors said they would favor their primary bank if this rule were relaxed.

Concerns about market volatility remain widespread (56%), while worries over exchange or fraud risks were more pronounced among those hesitant to invest further.

Korea's crypto boom fueled by desperation

Last week, Eli Ilha Yune, chief product officer at Anzaetek, said the surge in crypto South Korea's crypto adoption isn't driven by optimism about blockchain technology.

Speaking at German Blockchain Week, Yune argued that many young Koreans are turning to crypto out of financial desperation, seeking quick profits rather than supporting Web3 ideals.

Youth unemployment in South Korea is a key factor, standing at 6.6%, more than double the national average. Yune explained that South Korea's once high-growth economy has stalled, leaving many young people jobless and unable to afford real estate or see meaningful returns from traditional investments like stocks.

Amid this economic pressure, crypto has become the only viable investment option for Korea's younger generation, according to Yune. He noted that while some young investors understand crypto's technology, many are unaware of its infrastructure.

Technology Reporter

On the evening of ﻿22 May, the biggest investors in the $Trump memecoin – the US president's personal crypto token – descended on the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia for an exclusive black-tie event.

Invited guests were the top 220 $Trump holders. Blockchain analysis suggests that more than half were probably foreign investors who had collectively poured millions into the token. “What's happening tonight at Trump's golf course … is in effect putting a ‘for sale' sign on the White House,” said Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal﻿ to reporters before the event, who called it “corruption”. The White House rejected the claim.

So did Justin Sun, the coin's largest investor. “All the haters need to really pay attention,” said Sun ﻿on the ﻿CoinDesk website the following day, denying that he was buying access to the president. “There are positive things happening in the [crypto] industry.” Later, he posted a picture of himself on social media, fist in the air, standing in front of the American flag. On his wrist was a $100,000 watch made of 18-carat gold. The caption read: “I was awarded a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch by Trump!”

Sun, a 34-year-old billionaire worth about $8.5﻿bn from crypto ventures, including the blockchain platform Tron, reportedly invested $20m﻿ in the memecoin to secure his place at the dinner. He had already poured a separate $75m into the Trump family's crypto ﻿company World Liberty Financial (WLF). In February, five weeks after ﻿Trump became president, the US securities regulator shelved a 2023 civil fraud case against Sun that could have cost him millions in fines and repayments.

Since February, Sun's business ties with the Trumps have deepened, even as questions surrounding his crypto empire remain unanswered. The entrepreneur is alleged to have made billions by finding ways around rules, selling hype and pushing the boundaries of the law. But instead of facing greater scrutiny, it appears Sun now finds himself closer than ever to the seat of American power.

In June, WLF moved its stablecoin – a type of digital token tied to real-world currency – on to Tron's blockchain network, positioning Tron to make millions in transaction fees. Because WLF collects interest on the money backing the stablecoin, the president himself stands to profit from the deal too.

And ﻿reports recently emerged that Sun was taking Tron public in the US through a merger with the Nasdaq-listed company SRM Entertainment. The deal was orchestrated by Dominari Securities, an investment bank with ties to Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. The Financial Times reported that Eric Trump was expected to take up a role at the new company – Tron Inc – though he later said on social media that he had no “public involvement” in the project.

“It is a potentially dangerous situation for the ﻿US and for the global economy when the government, which should be regulating the crypto industry, is being led by a president who has very close financial ties to individuals in the crypto industry”, said Richard Painter, chief White House ­ethics lawyer under George W Bush, about the Trump family's relationship with Sun. The White House has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest.

Sources, including former colleagues of Sun's, as well as financial and legal experts, paint a complicated picture of the crypto mogul. They call him a brilliant but money-obsessed opportunist﻿ who has made his fortune by always being in the right place at the right time. They view Sun as a man looking for ways around rules and seeking to gain access to power. He has sought to do so again with the Trump administration.

The Observer sent Sun requests for comment via email, Telegram and LinkedIn regarding the claims in this article. He did not respond.

Sun's infatuation with Donald Trump began when he was in secondary school. He told Forbes that, as a teenager in Huizhou in China, he downloaded hundreds of episodes of The Apprentice on BitTorrent – a file-sharing platform he would later acquire – to help improve his English.

The reality show, ﻿hosted by Trump for 14 seasons, which saw contestants battle through business challenges, left a lasting impression on him. As China embraced market reforms and a new wave of consumerism in the early ﻿00s, The Apprentice offered a seductive model of ambition, self-branding and western capitalist success.

After graduating from Peking University, Sun moved to the US in 2011 to pursue a master's degree. There he discovered bitcoin, spending night and day on crypto forums and becoming excited by the concept of digital currency as “money for the future”.

His growing expertise led to a position at the crypto company Ripple Labs (now Ripple), advising on its expansion into China. Around the same time, in 2013, Sun founded the dating app Peiwo, a cross between Tinder and a chatroom, where users could send each other voice notes. The app drew millions of people, but faced scrutiny from Chinese authorities when they began uploading sexually explicit audio.

Peiwo was eventually shut down by regulators for hosting content that “disrupts socialist values”, but by that point Sun had already made his millions. In 2017, he founded Tron﻿ and a year later he acquired BitTorrent﻿ for ﻿about $140m﻿. According to colleagues, Sun was by ﻿then a flamboyant millionaire who liked to flaunt his wealth. He walked around the office in squeaky-clean Gucci trainers and, according to a report from the Verge website, employees were baffled to see piles of cash pile up on the desk in his glass-walled office.

Richard Painter, lawyer

“ He's not a very technical person,” said one former colleague. Instead, like Trump, Sun's gift was showmanship. He built his crypto empire mostly by imitating the business strategies of other first movers and presenting them as innovative. A Tron white paper published in 2018 contained entire sections copied from other decentralised crypto projects, published without credit. Sun blamed poor translation from Chinese.At Tron and BitTorrent, employees faced demanding conditions. In 2020, two former Tron employees filed a civil lawsuit against Sun, with allegations ranging from fraud to verbal and physical harassment. A separate lawsuit made similar allegations in 2021. On one occasion, a witness recalled seeing Sun allegedly strike a member of his engineering team.

The following year, Sun stepped down as chief executive of Tron to become ambassador and permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization. The details of his ambassadorship have not been made public; reports speculate that Sun paid to become a permanent citizen of the Caribbean nation. (Sun has also reportedly paid for, or attempted to pay for, citizenship in St Kitts and Nevis and Malta). According to legal documents seen by The Observer, Sun tried to get out of at least one lawsuit by claiming diplomatic immunity. The cases were heard in private and eventually settled. In 2022, the Verge reported that the US ﻿justice department had opened a ﻿probe into whether Sun had committed a number of crimes, including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the ﻿US. No filings followed and, in April of this year, the Trump administration ordered prosecutors to limit their pursuit of cryptocurrency crimes. Sun has always denied any wrongdoing.

In the 2023 case that was﻿ shelved in February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Sun and related entities, including the Tron Foundation and the BitTorrent Foundation, with fraud.

The civil lawsuit alleged they had sold crypto tokens as unregistered securities, manipulated their markets through wash trading﻿ and paid celebrities – including Lindsay Lohan, Soulja Boy and Jake Paul – to promote tokens without disclosure.

“It was one of the most flagrant set of allegations that the SEC made against a crypto market participant,” said Amanda Fischer, who was senior counsellor to the chair of the SEC during this period. At the time, Sun said the lawsuit “lack[ed] merit”, but he quietly stepped down from his ambassador position as a result of the investigation. Sources say he still demands that people refer to him as “his excellency”. 

If the lawsuits and investigations knocked Sun, he did﻿ not let it show. In November, before the SEC case was shelved, the billionaire went viral when he purchased a banana duct‑taped to a wall for $6.2m﻿ and later ate it. In the past year he has attended galas and graced the cover of Forbes, and is due to travel to space ﻿with Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin company next month.

Sun's businesses, too, remain largely untouched. In 2024, Tron hosted 58% of all illicit crypto activity – more than any other blockchain. Sun has previously said “criminals are drawn to the same features that make blockchain revolutionary – speed, efficiency, and borderless transactions”, and that Tron's “transparency actually makes it harder, not easier, to launder money”.

Tron will go public in the US in ﻿a reverse merger that allows Sun to bypass the detailed disclosures and regulations required in a traditional IPO. There is ﻿no evidence of wrongdoing when it comes to the Tron deal, but Painter, the former White House ethicist, said he believes the SEC should be carefully monitoring it.

Fischer, a former employee of the regulator, is doubtful that it will. “ I, frankly, don't know why the public would have trust in the agency any more to enforce the law without political favour,” she said.

“It's flagrant that the commission alleged that the Tron token was an unregistered security that was illegally touted by celebrities that didn't disclose they were being paid, that had wash trading, and now Justin Sun is endeavouring to create an exchange traded company that holds that very token, and that they're seeking to have that trade on the Nasdaq in affiliation with the president's family.

“I am almost at a loss for words,” Fischer added.

 ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says REX Shares' latest Solana staking ETF filing with the SEC suggests the product is ready launch any day now. 

ETF provider REX Shares is on the verge of launching the first-ever Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF), following what analysts describe as a successful response to feedback from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“Rex also filed an updated prospectus, which totally filled in. Add it all up, and it appears as though all systems go for imminent launch,” ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post on Friday.

ETF Store president Nate Geraci said in an X post on the same day that it looks like the SEC are open to REX Shares incredibly rare c-corp business structure used in the fund, which the SEC previously argued conflicts with the 6C-11 rule, also known as “the ETF rule.” 

“Looks like they're comfortable pushing forward w/ their creative ‘40 Act structure,” Geraci said. “Here we go,” he added. 

He previously said on May 29 that REX Shares had taken “the regulatory end-around” with this approach.

Echoing Geraci's sentiment, ETF analyst James Seyffart said the way that REX Shares structured their Solana (SOL) staking ETF proposal was “very rare in the ETF world” as it bypasses the standard 19b-4 filing process that most other crypto ETF providers have used for staking proposals, which are all still awaiting a decision from the SEC.

Geraci said, “Looks like they believe comments have been resolved.”

“Crypto ETF summer commences,” he added. 

Balchunas cited an email screenshot to confirm that REX Shares have addressed the SEC's comments.

“So they are good to launch, it looks like. Wow,” Balchunas added.

In a post on the same day, REX Shares said that “the first-ever staked crypto ETF” in the US is coming soon.

REX Shares explained that its REX-Osprey SOL and staking ETF is designed to track the performance of Solana while generating yield through onchain staking.

“A new era of yield-generating crypto exposure is here,” REX Shares said.

Staking has been a long-awaited feature by many ETF spectators in the industry.

On March 20, BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described the firm's Ether ETF as a “tremendous success” but acknowledged that the ETF is “less perfect” without staking.

India's population is genetically one of the most diverse in the world, yet it remains underrepresented in global datasets. In a study publishing in the Cell Press journal Cell, researchers analyzed genomic data from more than 2,700 people from across India, capturing genetic variation from most geographic regions, linguistic groups, and communities. They found that most modern-day Indian people's ancestry can be traced back to Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers.

"This study fills a critical gap and reshapes our understanding of how ancient migrations, archaic admixture, and social structures have shaped Indian genetic variation," says senior author Priya Moorjani of the University of California, Berkeley. "Studying these subpopulations allows us to explore how ancient ancestry, geography, language, and social practices interacted to shape genetic variation. We hope our study will provide a deeper understanding of the origin of functional variation and inform precision health strategies in India."

The researchers used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) and generated whole-genome sequences from 2,762 individuals in India, including people who spoke a range of different languages. They used these data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of India over the past 50,000 years at fine scale, showing how history impacts adaptation and disease in present-day Indians. They showed that most Indians derive ancestry from populations related to three ancestral groups: Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers.

"In India, genetic and linguistic variation often go hand in hand, shaped by ancient migrations and social practices," says lead author Elise Kerdoncuff of UC-Berkeley. "Ensuring linguistic variation among the people whose genomes we include helps prevent biased interpretations of genetic patterns and uncover functional variation related to all major communities to inform both evolutionary research and future biomedical surveys."

One of the key goals of the study was to understand how India's complex population history has shaped genetic variation related to disease. In India, many subpopulations have an increased risk of recessive genetic disorders, which is due largely to historical isolation and marrying within communities.

Another focus was on the impact of archaic hominin ancestry -- specifically, Neanderthal and Denisovan -- on disease susceptibility. For example, some of the genes inherited from these archaic groups have an impact on immune functions.

"One of the most striking and unexpected findings was that India harbors the highest variation in Neanderthal ancestry among non-Africans," says co-lead author Laurits Skov, also of UC-Berkeley. "This allowed us to reconstruct around 50% of the Neanderthal genome and 20% of the Denisovan genome from Indian individuals, more than any other previous archaic ancestry study."

One constraint of this work was the limited availability of ancient DNA from South and Central Asia. As more ancient genomes become available, the researchers will be able to refine this work and identify the source of Neolithic Iranian farmer and Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in contemporary Indians. They also plan to continue studying the LASI-DAD cohort to enable a closer look at the source of the genetic adaptations and disease variants across India.

PTEN Connection to Autism: Up to 25% of those with brain overgrowth and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) carry variations in a gene called PTEN; PTEN-deficient mouse models exhibit ASD-like characteristics Cell-type Specific Model: PTEN loss in specific neurons leads to circuit imbalance and altered behavior Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance: Strengthened excitatory drive and loss of local inhibitory connections in an amygdala circuit Behavioral effects: This circuit imbalance results in increased fear learning and anxiety in mice -- core traits seen in ASD. Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have discovered how loss of a gene strongly associated with autism and macrocephaly (large head size) rewires circuits and alters behavior. Their findings, published in Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, reveal specific circuit changes in the amygdala resulting from PTEN loss in inhibitory neurons, providing new insights into the underlying circuit alterations that contribute to heightened fear and anxiety.

PTEN has emerged as one of the most significant autism risk genes. Variations in this gene are found in a significant proportion of people with autism who also exhibit brain overgrowth, making it a key player in understanding differences in brain function. To investigate the impact of PTEN misregulation, researchers have turned to animal models, where global reduction of PTEN results in altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and increased anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans.

But understanding how PTEN dysfunction results in specific circuit and behavioral changes has been difficult in animal models that disrupt PTEN throughout the nervous system. Therefore, MPFI research group leader Dr. McLean Bolton and her team have focused on the changes in the central lateral amygdala driven by loss of PTEN in a critical neuronal population -- somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.

Alterations in the function of inhibitory neurons in the development of ASD have been seen through both human tissue studies and genetic mouse models. Moreover, the PTEN gene is known to regulate the development of inhibitory neurons. Therefore, a cell-type-specific disruption of PTEN in inhibitory neurons was a valuable target for understanding specific circuit changes associated with ASD.

"Although a cell-type specific disruption does not replicate the genome-wide changes seen in humans, it is essential to examine how genetic risk factors operate within distinct neural circuits," explained Dr. Bolton. "Understanding these mechanisms is a crucial step toward targeted interventions for specific traits such as severe anxiety."

The team, led by Dr. Tim Holford, combined a genetic model that disrupted PTEN only in somatostatin-containing inhibitory neurons with a unique circuit mapping approach previously developed in the lab. This approach measured the electrical responses of individual neurons to the sequential optogenetic activation of hundreds of nearby neurons, allowing rapid mapping of connectivity and strength with the precision of electrical recordings and the scale of imaging approaches.

"This is a powerful method that we can use to determine changes in local neuron connectivity and strength resulting from genetic variations. We were interested in uncovering how the disruption of PTEN signaling in a single cell type would change the way the brain processes information and contribute to the broad ASD phenotype," described Dr. Holford.

The scientists focused on the circuits in the central amygdala (CeL) - a brain region known to serve as an inhibitory gate on the downstream expression of fear responses - and found striking results. Deleting PTEN specifically in somatostatin-containing interneurons disrupted local inhibitory connectivity in the CeL by roughly 50% and reduced the strength of the inhibitory connections that remained. This diminished connectivity between inhibitory connections within the CeL was contrasted by an increase in the strength of excitatory inputs received from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a nearby brain region that relays emotionally-relevant sensory information to the CeL.

Behavioral analysis of the genetic model demonstrated that this imbalance in neural signaling was linked to heightened anxiety and increased fear learning, but not alterations in social behavior or repetitive behavior traits commonly observed in ASD. The results not only confirm that PTEN loss in this specific cell type is sufficient to induce specific ASD-like behaviors, but also provide one of the most detailed maps to date of how local inhibitory networks in the amygdala are affected by genetic variations associated with neurological disorders. Importantly, the altered circuitry did not affect all ASD-relevant behaviors -- social interactions remained largely intact -- suggesting that PTEN-related anxiety and fear behaviors may stem from specific microcircuit changes.

As Dr. Holford explains, "By teasing out the local circuitry underlying specific traits, we hope to differentiate the roles of specific microcircuits within the umbrella of neurological disorders, which may one day help in developing targeted therapeutics for specific cognitive and behavioral characteristics. In future studies, we hope to evaluate these circuits in different genetic models to determine if these microcircuit alterations are convergent changes that underlie heightened fear and anxiety expression across diverse genetic profiles."

Simon Fraser University researchers are using a new approach to brain imaging that could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's disease.

The new study, published in the journal Movement Disorders, looks at why levodopa - the main drug used in dopamine replacement therapy - is sometimes less effective in patients.

The drug is typically prescribed to help reduce the movement symptoms associated with the neurodegenerative disorder.

While it is effective in improving symptoms for the vast majority of patients, not everyone experiences the same level of benefit.

In order to find out why this is the case, an SFU collaboration with researchers in Sweden has used magnetoencephalography (MEG) technology to determine how the drug affects signals in the brain.

"Parkinson's is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and it is the most rapidly increasing, in terms of incidence," says Alex Wiesman, assistant professor in biomedical physiology and kinesiology at SFU.

"Treating this disease, both in terms of helping people with their symptoms, but also trying to find ways to reverse the effects, is becoming more and more important.

"If clinicians can see how levodopa activates certain parts of the brain in a patient, it can help to inform a more personalised approach to treatment."

The study was a collaboration with researchers at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who used MEG to collect data from 17 patients with Parkinson's disease - a relatively small sample size.

Researchers mapped participants' brain signals before and after taking the drug, in order to see how and where the drug impacted brain activity.

MEG is an advanced non-invasive technology that measures the magnetic fields produced by the brain's electrical signals.

It can help clinicians and researchers to study brain disorders and diseases, including brain injuries, tumors, epilepsy, autism, mental illness and more.

Using this rare brain imaging technology, Wiesman and team developed a new analysis that lets them "search" the brain for off-target drug effects.

"With this new way of analyzing brain imaging data, we can track in real time whether or not the drug is affecting the right brain regions and helping patients to manage their symptoms," says Wiesman.

"What we found was that there's sometimes 'off target' effects of the drug. In other words, we could see the drug activating brain regions we don't want to be activating and that's getting in the way of the helpful effects.

"We found that those people who showed 'off target' effects are still being helped by the drug, but not to the same extent as others."

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning parts of the brain become progressively damaged over time. It affects predominately the dopamine-producing neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra.

People with Parkinson's disease may experience a range of movement-related symptoms, such as tremors, slow movement, stiffness and balance problems.

Wiesman hopes that a better understanding of how levodopa affects an individual's brain signals could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's.

"This might be really helpful for tracking individualized responses to these types of drugs and helping with prescribing and therapeutics," he says.

"So maybe we try different medications, maybe we adjust dosages differently. And this helps clinicians get at that question of how we prescribe personalized medicine in a way that really helps the patient.

"The more we can personalize that approach, make it more expedient, make it a bit more specific to that person, the better."

This new type of brain imaging analysis is not only for studying Parkinson's disease; any medications that affect brain signaling can be studied using the method developed by Wiesman and colleagues.

SFU's ImageTech Lab, at the Surrey Memorial Hospital, is home to the only MEG in western Canada.

"We have this really fantastic technology right here at SFU, and combined with the new analysis approaches that we're developing, it gives us a really unprecedented look into what's happening in the brain," says Wiesman.

"We can use this technology moving forward to study Parkinson's disease in ways that no one has ever done before worldwide.

"Our next step is to take our new approach and apply it to a larger patient group. We also need to translate this research to more accessible brain imaging methods, like electroencephalogram (EEG).

"Ultimately, we want to make sure this technology is useful for a diverse population and more widely accessible to patients with Parkinson's disease."

The Ninja DZ401 Foodi 6-in-1 XL air fryer is the highest-rated air fryer available for purchase on Amazon, with over 37,000 reviews and an impressive 4.7 out of 5 stars. If you need an XL air fryer that can actually do it all, this is the one to buy.

Ninja has become the brand of choice when it comes to air fryers, and this inaugural (early) Prime Day discount is open to everyone, not only Prime members. The price of $179, down from the usual $230, is the best deal for 2025 and an opportunity to outfit your kitchen with a high-end appliance.

See at Amazon

With a 10-quart total capacity and two separate 5-quart baskets, you are able to cook two foods differently simultaneously. This double-basket feature dispenses with the need to cook in batches or wait for the first dish to finish before cooking another. Whether you're preparing a main course and a side or simply want to whip up a large batch of wings, this air fryer makes it easy to feed a crowd quickly and efficiently.

The dualzone technology is a major advantage and offers two key features: Smart Finish and Match Cook. Smart Finish enables you to prepare two dishes of different settings and ensures that they are ready at the same time and consequently everything is ready simultaneously to be served. It is not the same with Match Cook which allows you to duplicate settings on both baskets for full capacity meals. The IQ Boost feature smartly shares power among the baskets and allows one to cook something as big as a 6-pound whole chicken and a side dish at the same time, without compromising on speed or quality.

With its six cooking functions—air fry, air broil, roast, bake, reheat, and dehydrate—the Ninja DZ401 Foodi has you set for quick meals. The extensive temperature range of 105°F to 450°F enables you to gently dry out fruit or blast-heated chicken wings to a crunchy texture. The cyclonic air and quick heaters in every zone ensure even cooking and the easy-to-clean baskets and dishwasher-safe crisper plates ensure that cleanup after a busy meal is easy.

What's more (and one of the main reasons why it is so popular) is that you can prepare your favorite fried food with up to 75% less fat compared to normal deep frying. The spacious 10-quart capacity enables you to cook up to 8 pounds of chicken wings at a time, perfect for family gatherings, parties, or cooking for the week.

If you're looking for an air fryer that can keep pace with big family meals, this is a smart choice.

Two wrongs do not make a right.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Bitcoin Depot Chief Legal Officer, Chris Ryan, said that police departments using brute force to open Bitcoin ATMs and seize the cash inside is bordering on law enforcement overreach. Sawing them open might even be breaking banking and criminal laws, added Ryan. The executive told Decrypt that the money inside Bitcoin Depot ATMs rightfully belongs to the company, and that any damage to its machines will be held against the offending organization.

“You've got these rogue law enforcement officers thinking that they're doing the right things by these consumers,” Ryan said. “What they're actually doing is creating another victim, which is us, with the damage of our property and seizing of our funds.”

Just last week, the Jasper County Sheriff broke into a Bitcoin Depot ATM after one of its constituents reported getting scammed out of $25,000. Although the victim went through proper channels, and they were able to secure a search warrant, the money inside the ATM is legally no longer the property of the victim. Instead, the authorities should be going after the wallet address where the cryptocurrency was deposited.

Because the Sheriff used a power tool to break open the ATM to get its contents, Bitcoin Depot said that its machine — which cost $14,000 each — was completely totaled. This is particularly unfortunate because the company said that it always cooperates with law enforcement and will open the machine for them when going through the proper channels.

Requests like this happen up to 20 times a year, Ryan said to Decrypt, and that doesn't even include cases where the police just straight up break their machines open. As for the latter, the company would charge the jurisdiction for the damage — something many can't afford.

Crypto ATMs are similar to regular deposit machines, wherein they accept cash and credit the same amount to your bank account. But instead of going into your account, it would instead go into your nominated wallet address. Depositors that use the machine are required to confirm that they're depositing the money into their own wallets, and it even warns users using third-party addresses that they might be getting scammed.

So, if someone was scammed out of their cash with a regular deposit machine, the police would not break the ATM — instead, they would coordinate with the courts and the bank to freeze the account and potentially get the money back. This should be the same pathway that victims should take when scammed through crypto. Unfortunately, many people, including law enforcement and the courts themselves, do not understand how crypto works. Because of that, we get incidents like these where police forcibly open crypto ATMs, causing damage to a third party's property.

While Bitcoin Depot and other similar operations are legitimate, they're often used by scammers because of how fast and easy it is for them to get the stolen funds. Even though you can easily track crypto transactions due to the public nature of the ledger, getting them back is often difficult because of anonymity. Moreover, if the scammer does not use an exchange that works with the authorities, it's difficult, often nearly impossible, to get the money back. Because of these attributes, scammers are increasingly switching from gift cards to Bitcoin ATMs.

While funding is being organized, TechTuber 'Peri Fratic' ropes in lots of big Commodore names from yesteryear to build new hope.

YouTube's Christian ‘Peri Fratic' Simpson claims to be “the acting CEO of Commodore Corporation.” The surprise Commodore buyout deal hinted at three weeks prior, seems to have been put into motion. In a new episode on the rebranded Retro Recipes x Commodore channel, Peri Fratic provides details of the seven-figure deal, outlines his vision for the company, and lists a growing number of ex-Commodore luminaries who will be joining him to relaunch the beloved brand. Last and definitely not least, the video ends in a signature tease – this time it's a tease for new hardware.

Concerning the deal, a key point from the above video is that Peri Fratic “signed a share purchase agreement” with the previous owners of Commodore Corporation. It has been agreed that a price “in the low seven figures” will be paid to seal the deal. That should mean the deal is worth somewhere between $1m and $5m.



Apparently many backers of this project, including Peri Fratic, have already put in lots of cash to make this buyout happen, taking out second mortgages, selling the family silver, etc. However, the search is still on for angel investors to launch the new ship. Lots of details and discussion about funding are provided, but left us wondering what would happen if not enough suitable investors come forward, and what kind of timescale needs to be adhered to, to finalize the contract?

With this agreement in place, the new Commodore has already got a new slogan. It will go forward with its ‘Retro Futurism' plans, “honoring our past, innovating the future.” Furthermore, Perifrantic has been busy appointing (acting) CEO, CFO, COO, and many more key positions – many of whom honor the past.

Some big names that will play a part in the new future Commodore include, in order of mention: Bill Herd (Commodore Pioneer), Albert Charpentier (Father of the C64), Michael Tomczyk (Vic Tzar of the Vic 20), James Harrison (Tech support manager), David Pleasance (ex VP becomes Heritage and legacy advisor), Hans Olsen (demo and convention facilitator), Tim Morgan (PR officer), and more.

Perifrantic makes an interesting point in anticipation of critics that will chime in to assert “this will never be the original Commodore.” In his defense, the retro tech enthusiast says “what if we got 47 trademarks from 1982, or original Commodore engineers back, original executives, assistants, ROMs, Amiga? I mean, at some point, it does start to become the real Commodore, right?”

Also in the FAQ section of the video we get a rendition of the aims of the new Commodore sans corporate-speak. It will exist to “streamline the usage of the brand and logo, along with releasing some of our own products,” it is stated.

As well as the financial backing, which is still not guaranteed, Peri Fratic is seeking other talented folk. Specifically, merchandise designers, social media manager, and anyone who owns a license from a classic 1980s or 90s game should get in touch with the new (acting) Commodore CEO.

We are left with a cliffhanger with regard to the new ‘Commodore ____'. The video cuts out to an unpacking/loading type screen before Peri Fratic can hoist the new device from his lap into view. That announcement seems to be 20,160 minutes away (as of yesterday), which indicates a wait of two weeks.

More VRAM and CUDA cores with increased power requirements.

Nvidia is expected to follow up its current lineup of RTX 50 series desktop GPUs with a Super refresh. According to a new set of specifications posted by reliable Nvidia hardware leaker @kopite7kimi on X/Twitter, expect Team Green to launch at least three new models including the RTX 5070 Super, RTX 5070 Ti Super, and the RTX 5080 Super. These look like pretty safe bets for inclusion in our frequently updated Best Graphics Cards for Gaming in 2025 feature.

If we go by the rumored preliminary specifications, the new Super models will offer a substantial jump over the non-Super counterparts, primarily due to the increased VRAM. The RTX 5070 Super is said to feature the GB205 GPU based on the Blackwell architecture, paired with the PG147-SKU65 PCB. It will have 6,400 CUDA cores, which represents an uplift of just over 4% compared to the 6,144 CUDA cores on the regular RTX 5070. The power draw also sees a jump from 250W on the RTX 5070 to 275W on the RTX 5070 Super.

As for the VRAM, it is expected that the RTX 5070 Super will be upgraded to 18GB of GDDR7 memory with a 28 Gbps bandwidth on a 192-bit bus interface. As we suggested in a previous report back in April around a similar set of leaked specifications, Nvidia might be planning to replace the 2GB GDDR7 memory modules on the existing RTX 50 series lineup, with 3GB modules to gain an additional boost in performance.

Moving onto the rumored specifications of the RTX 5070 Ti Super, it is expected to feature the GB203 GPU and the PG147-SKU55 PCB. Additionally, the GPU will come with 8,960 CUDA cores, and 24GB of GDDR7 memory with a 28 Gbps bandwidth and 256-bit bus interface. Like the rumored RTX 5070 Super, the RTX 5070 Ti Super will also have an increased TGP bumping the spec to 350W, which is a jump of 50W over the non-Super RTX 5070 Ti.

Lastly, there is the RTX 5080 Super which is, more or less, similar to the RTX 5070 Ti Super except with a higher CUDA core count and memory bandwidth. The leaker hasn't explicitly mentioned any of the details, however a comment on the original post by software engineer Haytam Aarab (@Tech_Meld_) suggests that the RTX 5080 Super will feature the same GB203 GPU, with increased 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM, a 256-bit memory interface, and 10,753 CUDA cores, similar to the RTX 5080. The memory bandwidth (as corrected) will be increased to 32 Gbps while the power draw will jump from 360W to 415W. With leaks like this, please add a sprinkling of salt to the asserted specs.

While the refreshed models appear promising, these specifications remain unconfirmed rumors until Nvidia makes an official announcement. That said, if accurate, the RTX 50 Super refresh, with its increased VRAM, could appeal to consumers craving more memory for high-resolution gaming, demanding workloads, or future-proofing their systems. However, given Nvidia's track record with GPU launches, it wouldn't be surprising to see high demand once again paired with inflated pricing, if and when the new RTX 50 Super series hits the market.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

The simplest ideas in mathematics can also be the most perplexing.

Take addition. It's a straightforward operation: One of the first mathematical truths we learn is that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But mathematicians still have many unanswered questions about the kinds of patterns that addition can give rise to. “This is one of the most basic things you can do,” said Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford. “Somehow, it's still very mysterious in a lot of ways.”

In probing this mystery, mathematicians also hope to understand the limits of addition's power. Since the early 20th century, they've been studying the nature of “sum-free” sets—sets of numbers in which no two numbers in the set will add to a third. For instance, add any two odd numbers and you'll get an even number. The set of odd numbers is therefore sum-free.

In a 1965 paper, the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős asked a simple question about how common sum-free sets are. But for decades, progress on the problem was negligible.

“It's a very basic-sounding thing that we had shockingly little understanding of,” said Julian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge.

Until this February. Sixty years after Erdős posed his problem, Bedert solved it. He showed that in any set composed of integers—the positive and negative counting numbers—there's a large subset of numbers that must be sum-free. His proof reaches into the depths of mathematics, honing techniques from disparate fields to uncover hidden structure not just in sum-free sets, but in all sorts of other settings.

“It's a fantastic achievement,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Erdős knew that any set of integers must contain a smaller, sum-free subset. Consider the set {1, 2, 3}, which is not sum-free. It contains five different sum-free subsets, such as {1} and {2, 3}.

Erdős wanted to know just how far this phenomenon extends. If you have a set with a million integers, how big is its biggest sum-free subset?

In many cases, it's huge. If you choose a million integers at random, around half of them will be odd, giving you a sum-free subset with about 500,000 elements.

Paul Erdős was famous for his ability to come up with deep conjectures that continue to guide mathematics research today.

In his 1965 paper, Erdős showed—in a proof that was just a few lines long, and hailed as brilliant by other mathematicians—that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset of at least N/3 elements.

Still, he wasn't satisfied. His proof dealt with averages: He found a collection of sum-free subsets and calculated that their average size was N/3. But in such a collection, the biggest subsets are typically thought to be much larger than the average.

Erdős wanted to measure the size of those extra-large sum-free subsets.

Mathematicians soon hypothesized that as your set gets bigger, the biggest sum-free subsets will get much larger than N/3. In fact, the deviation will grow infinitely large. This prediction—that the size of the biggest sum-free subset is N/3 plus some deviation that grows to infinity with N—is now known as the sum-free sets conjecture.

“It is surprising that this simple question seems to present considerable difficulties,” Erdős wrote in his original paper, “but perhaps we overlook the obvious.”

For decades, nothing obvious revealed itself. No one could improve on Erdős' proof. “The longer it went without people being able to improve on that simple bound, the more cachet this problem acquired,” said Ben Green, Bedert's doctoral adviser at Oxford. And, he added, this was precisely the kind of problem where “it's very, very hard to do any better at all.”

After 25 years without improving on Erdős' original result, mathematicians finally began inching forward. In 1990, two researchers proved that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + 1/3 elements, more commonly written as (N + 1)/3.

But since the size of a set is always a whole number, an increase of 1/3 is often inconsequential. For example, if you know that a sum-free subset has to have at least 5/3 elements, that means its size is guaranteed to be 2 or more. If you add 1/3 to 5/3, your answer is still 2. “It's funny, it means that it doesn't actually always improve it,” said David Conlon of the California Institute of Technology. “It's only when N is divisible by 3 that it improves it.”

In 1997, the mathematical legend Jean Bourgain nudged the bound up to (N + 2)/3. The result might have seemed hardly worth mentioning, but buried in Bourgain's paper was a startling breakthrough. He described an idea for how to prove that the biggest sum-free subsets would be arbitrarily bigger than that. He just couldn't pin down the details to turn it into a full proof.

“The paper's almost like, here's how I tried to solve the problem and why it didn't work,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Jean Bourgain devised a creative strategy for proving the sum-free sets conjecture.

Bourgain relied on a quantity called the Littlewood norm, which measures a given set's structure. This quantity, which comes from a field of mathematics called Fourier analysis, tends to be large if a set is more random, and small if the set exhibits more structure.

Bourgain showed that if a set with N elements has a large Littlewood norm, then it must also have a sum-free set that's much larger than N/3. But he couldn't make progress in the case where the set has a small Littlewood norm.

“Bourgain is famously competent,” said Sean Eberhard of the University of Warwick. “It's a very striking marker of how difficult this problem is.”

Bourgain ultimately had to use a different argument to get his bound of (N + 2)/3. But mathematicians read between the lines: They might be able to use the Littlewood norm to completely settle the conjecture. They just had to figure out how to deal with sets with a small Littlewood norm.

There was reason to be optimistic: Mathematicians already knew of sets with a small Littlewood norm that have massive sum-free subsets. These sets, called arithmetic progressions, consist of evenly spaced numbers, such as {5, 10, 15, 20}. Mathematicians suspected that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a very specific structure—that it's more or less a collection of many different arithmetic progressions (with a few tweaks). They hoped that if they could show this, they'd be able to use that property to prove that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a large sum-free subset.

But this task wasn't easy. “I certainly tried to prove the sum-free conjecture using [Bourgain's] ideas,” Green said, but “we still don't understand much about the structure of sets with small Littlewood norm. Everything to do with Littlewood is difficult.”

And so, though mathematicians continued to have faith in Bourgain's Littlewood-based strategy, nothing happened.

More than two decades passed. Then, in the fall of 2021, Benjamin Bedert started graduate school.

With Green as his doctoral adviser, it was inevitable that Bedert would come across the sum-free sets conjecture. Green's website lists 100 open problems; this one appears first.

Bedert perused the list shortly after he began his graduate studies. At first, he shied away from the sum-free sets problem. “I was like, this is super difficult, I'm not going to think about this,” he recalled. “I'll leave this for the future.”

The future arrived soon enough. In summer 2024, Bedert decided he was ready for a riskier project. “I'd proved some reasonably good results in my PhD so far, and kind of put a thesis together already,” he said. “I started thinking about these more, I guess, notorious problems.”

Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford, has resolved a decades-old problem that tests the role of addition in sets.

He read Bourgain's 1997 paper and began to muse about how to implement the Littlewood blueprint. Almost immediately, he had an idea for how he might approach the problem of sets with a small Littlewood norm.

So far, it had been too difficult to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always resemble collections of arithmetic progressions. But Bedert thought it might be useful to prove something more attainable: that even if these sets aren't literally built from arithmetic progressions, they share certain key, progression-like properties.

In a recent project, Bedert had come across what he saw as a good candidate for a property to focus on. In arithmetic progressions, there are many groups of numbers that have the same sum. For instance, in the set of even numbers (which is an arithmetic progression), 4 + 8 has the same sum as both 2 + 10 and 2 + 4 + 6. Bedert thought it might be enough to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always obey this property.

Within a couple of weeks, he'd succeeded in proving that the property was true. But would the result give him the level of similarity to arithmetic progressions that he needed to prove the sum-free sets conjecture?

“I was definitely excited,” he said. “Then I realized there was still so much more work to do.”

First, Bedert showed that any set with a small Littlewood norm could be “mapped” to a second set that bore an even closer resemblance to arithmetic progressions. He suspected that it was in these new sets that he would find large sum-free subsets.

The final task was to actually show what the size of such a sum-free subset would be. “Over the Christmas break, I was obsessively thinking about this problem,” Bedert said. “By New Year's, I still hadn't found the final piece of the puzzle.”

Then, a few days after he returned to Oxford in January, it came to him. “I'm not sure where it came from,” he said. “Maybe these ideas stir in your mind for a while, and then [you] finally get something out that works.”

He represented the structure of his sets using a tool called the Fourier transform, and then modified a 1981 proof to show that some of the individual components of that representation must have a large Littlewood norm. Since Bourgain had already shown how to handle sets with large Littlewood norms, that completed the proof.

In the end, Bedert showed that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + log(log N) elements. For many values of N, this gives you a sum-free subset that's only slightly bigger than Erdős' average size of N/3. Even if N is as large as 10100, for example, log(log N) is only around 5. But as N inches toward infinity, so does the difference in Bedert's and Erdős' bounds—thus settling the conjecture.

“It's a really amazing result,” said Yifan Jing of Ohio State University. Jing, who was also mentored by Green, credits the achievement to Bedert's intense focus. “Benjamin really went in depth to modify Bourgain's proof and make it work,” he said. “He spends much more time than other people on the same problem.”

There's still more to understand about sum-free subsets—and therefore about the extent to which addition influences the structure of the integers. For instance, Bedert's result resolves the question of whether the largest sum-free subset gets infinitely bigger than N/3. But mathematicians don't know precisely how fast that deviation can grow. Thanks to a 2014 paper by Green and two colleagues, they know that the deviation is slower-growing than N. But, Green said, “there remains a massive gap” between that upper bound of N and Bedert's lower bound of log(log N).

The work also provides new insight into sets that have a small Littlewood norm. Such sets are fundamental objects in the field of analysis but are very difficult to study. Bedert's result has helped mathematicians better understand their structure, which Green and others now hope to continue to explore. “It's beautiful, it's interesting, it feels natural,” Eberhard said. “You want to solve a mystery, don't you?”

For Sahasrabudhe, the takeaway is simple. “Old and difficult problem solved by brilliant kid,” he said. “The stuff he's building on, it's subtle and hard to work with. It's a really pretty result.”

Apple doesn't often discount products, and AirTags have never been on sale from the Apple website or in Apple stores. Amazon, however, occasionally surprises us with exclusive pricing on these useful Bluetooth trackers.

For the best value, a pack of AirTags is nearly always a better buy than a single one. Amazon is also running a great deal just in time for Prime Day: purchase three AirTags and receive a fourth free. That drops the price of four AirTags to just $74, down from the regular $99 ($25 each + get one free). That's one of the best discounts we've ever seen on these trackers.

AirTag is a small device that's perfect for keeping track of your keys, wallet, luggage, backpack and anything else you want to stay with. It's simple to set up and you just have to tap your iPhone (or iPad) and the AirTag is paired in an instant. Every AirTag is about the size of a large coin so it's simple to drop into pockets. It has a built-in speaker to play a sound to help you find your things and you can use Siri to have them locate it for you as well.

Precision Finding is one of the neatest aspects, and it uses the Ultra Wideband technology. On some iPhone models, this feature directs you to your AirTag with visual, haptic and auditory cues. For items far away, the AirTag uses the huge Find My network: Hundreds of millions of Apple devices collaborate to locate your lost items. When you mark your AirTag as lost, you get a notification the very moment it's detected by another device in the network.

Apple takes privacy seriously: All interactions with the Find My network are encrypted and anonymous. Location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself so your information is safe. AirTags also support sharing with up to five people able to track an item together.

Obviously, it also boasts an IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating, which makes it capable of withstanding spills, rain, and everyday handling. The device uses a user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery with a lifespan of over a year. This makes maintenance simple and hassle-free.

The AirTag is one of the smarter things you can do for your everyday items at this price range.

FIFA Club World Cup

Updated 14s ago

Two giants of the football world – Bayern Munich and Flamengo – do battle today as the round of 16 continues at the Club World Cup. 

A place in the quarter-final is the prize after both sides navigated their way through the group stages.

Flamengo topped their group ahead of Chelsea, ES Tunis and LAFC, while Bayern Munich were runners-up to Benfica as Boca Juniors and Auckland City were eliminated from the group. 

You can sign up to DAZN to watch every FIFA Club World Cup game for free.

The winner of this match will have the tough task of facing Paris Saint-Germain in the quarter-final, after the European champions rolled to a 4-0 victory over Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in Atlanta earlier today. 

PSG scored all four goals in the first half. Joao Neves got the first two, heading home unmarked in the sixth minute before finishing off a lovely team move a half hour later. A Tomas Aviles own goal accounted for the third before Achraf Hakimi added the fourth on the stroke of half-time.

Bayern Munich are strong favourites to progress to the quarter-final, but they will have to snap an impressive unbeaten run for their opponents.

Flamengo come into today's last-16 on an 11-game unbeaten streak in all competitions. Their last defeat was a domestic one, losing 2-1 against Cruzeiro on May 4.

If they avoid defeat today in 90 minutes, their unbeaten run will stretch beyond two months.

Six changes to the Flamengo team that drew 1-1 with LAFC with the headline news being the return to the line-up of Jorginho — here's the team in full:

Vincent Kompany restores the Kimmich-Goretzka axis in midfield, and picks a fluid-looking three behind Harry Kane, in Michael Olise, Kingsley Coman, and Serge Gnabry.

It's a talented group of players, but in combination they don't always function and sometimes their individual impact has been lost under the weight of all the positional rotations. Let's see.

Josip Stanisic at left-back is another area of difficulty; it might work, but I have never seen it happen. Stanisic is a better right-sided player and often looks awkward with the ball and exposed without it on the other flank.

A host of changes for Bayern Munich from their final group-stage defeat as Vincent Kompany restores his team back to full strength — here is how the Germans line up at Hard Rock Stadium:

Oh yes, a revamped tournament definitely needs a redesigned trophy — especially one carrying the name of FIFA president Gianni Infantino. Twice.

The all new Club World Cup was designed by FIFA and jewellery brand Tiffany & Co, and unveiled by Infantino alongside U.S. president Donald Trump.

As well as displaying Infantino's name (twice) the trophy also features the name of all 211 FIFA member nations.

There is a central disc and three outer rings, meaning it can be displayed as a flat shield or opened with a key to reveal “a multifaceted and orbital structure” — which I think we can all agree, sounds intriguing.

How will today's teams fare? 

Well, it's not an exact art but each day at The Athletic we have compiled our power rankings of each team, taking a look at who's hot, who's not, and how the struggle for global club supremacy is shaking out. 

Here's a look at how things are shaping up:

Manchester City — 1

Bayern Munich — 2

Club World Cup daily rankings: Manchester City seeks to tighten grip at top

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is a little different with 32 teams competing — when the previous 20 editions never brought together more than eight clubs each.

Still, the legacy of those early years will continue and a host of famous names will be looking to add to their previous victories.

Here are the most successful clubs in this competition's history:

🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 Real Madrid (2014, 2016-18, 2022) 

🏆🏆🏆 Barcelona (2009, 2011, 2015)

🏆🏆 Corinthians (2000, 2012), Bayern Munich (2013, 2020)

🏆 São Paulo (2005), Internacional (2006), Milan (2007), Manchester United (2008), Inter (2010), Liverpool (2019), Chelsea (2021), Manchester City (2023)

Here's how things looked in the table after all Bayern Munich's group C games...

As for Bayern Munich, they came through the group stage but surprisingly did not top it as they lost to Benfica in their final group game.

Here's how they made it to this stage:

Here's how things looked in the table after all Flamengo's group D games...

Flamengo have been something of a surprise package at the Club World Cup so far.

They made it through to this stage of the competition after topping their group. Here's how they did it:

Hard Rock Stadium was the site for the 2024 Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia, where Messi won his last international trophy.

Argentina prevailed 1-0 in extra time, but the match was marred by a lack of crowd control that led to a near stampede outside the stadium's gates before kick-off. It was a security disaster for the tournament's organisers (CONMEBOL) and the local government. 

I was there that day. There are scenes of unconscious men and women and crying children pressed against the gates that will stay with me forever.

The Club World Cup is another opportunity for Hard Rock Stadium to prove it can host international football matches safely before the 2026 World Cup. 

Messi will be the main attraction, but major brands like Real Madrid and Boca Juniors will attract local fan groups and neutrals alike.

Here's how things looked in the table after all Flamengo's group D games...

Flamengo have been something of a surprise package at the Club World Cup so far.

They made it through to this stage of the competition after topping their group. Here's how they did it:

Hard Rock Stadium was the site for the 2024 Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia, where Messi won his last international trophy.

Argentina prevailed 1-0 in extra time, but the match was marred by a lack of crowd control that led to a near stampede outside the stadium's gates before kick-off. It was a security disaster for the tournament's organisers (CONMEBOL) and the local government. 

I was there that day. There are scenes of unconscious men and women and crying children pressed against the gates that will stay with me forever.

The Club World Cup is another opportunity for Hard Rock Stadium to prove it can host international football matches safely before the 2026 World Cup. 

Messi will be the main attraction, but major brands like Real Madrid and Boca Juniors will attract local fan groups and neutrals alike.

ATLANTA — What we thought would happen between Inter Miami and Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup did happen.

The upstart Major League Soccer club looked every bit the part against the reigning European (and world) champions. Not even Lionel Messi, the greatest to ever play, could help David in this matchup against Goliath.

Once upon a time, Messi was bigger than Goliath.

He may still be on his best day.

Just not on this day, in his first match as a 38-year-old.

Paris Saint-Germain 4, Inter Miami 0 on Sunday, June 29, in front of 65,574 fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

PSG's João Neves scored twice (6' and 39'), Inter Miami's Tomás Avilés was credited with an own goal (44') and Achraf Hakimi put the game away before the halftime whistle (45'+3') to eliminate Inter Miami from the round of 16 at the Club World Cup.

Messi is still the biggest star in the world, even in the twilight of his career. The fans packed the stadium with excitement to see him. They wore Inter Miami jerseys, Argentina jerseys and Messi's Paris Saint-Germain jerseys.

The fans cheered every moment he touched the ball, patiently waiting for him to deliver the majestic Messi moment he has countless times in his legendary career.

Messi nearly did several times, including a free-kick opportunity in the 88th minute with all eyes and cell phone cameras on him. Sadly, he kicked it into a wall of PSG players.

Messi kept his emotions in check, but you could see his helplessness every time he looked down after looking up at the scoreboard in the first half. Still, he didn't stop pushing the envelope in the second half.

Chants of "Messi, Messi" rang loudly in the 63rd minute, and he nearly answered the call – sprinting his way toward a shot from his left boot that skid right into the PSG goalkeeper's hands.

He nearly delivered a header inside the box in the 80th minute, into the goalkeeper's hands again.

The Messi moment never came.

PSG is clearly the world champion for a reason, while Inter Miami is a club whose youth is too inexperienced, and its aging stars on the other side of their primes.

PSG players showed a mastery of being able to get the ball from midfield into the goal area with ease, while Inter Miami players were often turned around trying to catch up.

The crowd nearly exploded when Messi lofted a pass right at the feet of Luis Suarez early in the second half. The 38-year-old Uruguayan legend whiffed on his opportunity to strike and bowed his head in disappointment.

Sergio Busquets is one of the best midfielders to ever play the sport. His dribbling is one of his best skills. But he was mugged by PSG's Fabián Ruiz just outside the goal area midway in the first half.

PSG started a three-man weave that would make Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich proud: Bradley Barcola pounced on the steal, dropped it off to Ruiz, and he found Neves with their third pass in the goal area, and PSG's second goal of the match in the 39th minute.

Even Messi was a step slow on a give-and-go with Marcelo Weigandt early in the second half.

Inter Miami earned at least $21 million for participating, winning a match with two draws in the group stage, and advancing to the Round of 16 in the Club World Cup.

They carried the torch for the three MLS teams in the tournament. They pulled off North America's first win against a club from Europe when they beat FC Porto from Portugal behind an epic free kick goal from Messi just 10 days ago.

They were outclassed and outmatched 10 days later.

But this was expected.

Arsenal have decided to part ways with Thomas Partey once his contract expires on Monday. The Ghanaian midfielder was in talks with the Gunners over signing a new deal but they could not reach an agreement. The 32-year-old was a key part of Mikel Arteta's squad in the 2024-25 campaign, where he made 52 appearances across all competitions and recorded seven goal contributions.

Javier Mascherano's men were overmatched by superior team, as MLS side knocked out of FIFA's flagship club tournament

Lionel Messi couldn't work miracles and the Inter Miami team around him crumbled as a rampant PSG coasted to a 4-0 win to bounce the Herons from the Club World Cup in the round of 16. Miami had unexpectedly made it out of their group, and always seemed to be outmatched here. And their only real achievement was keeping the scoreline respectable. 

Miami shot themselves in the foot within five minutes when Maxi Falcon allowed Joao Neves - one of the shortest players on the pitch - to sneak in at the back post and head home for 1-0. And it was pretty much one-way traffic after that. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia was a constant buzzing threat on the left wing, while Vitinha and Neves ran the midfield. 

The second goal, also from Neves, rather sealed it. Sergio Busquets lost the ball on the edge of the Miami box, and the Parisians went to work. Five touches later and Neves was rolling into an empty net. They grabbed two more before half time, a Tomas Aviles own goal and rebound tap in for the marauding Achraf Hakimi.

PSG rotated throughout the second half, and Miami offered a little more fight. Messi had his moments in the final third, and forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a neat save late on. Otherwise, though, the Herons were toothless against a Parisian side that dominated on and off the ball. This wasn't an indictment on one player. PSG are simply world class. But the Herons' Club World Cup journey has come to a remarkably predictable end.

Real Madrid face another delay in their transfer push to sign Alvaro Carreras after the FIFA Club World Cup.

Xabi Alonso has hit pause on any transfer moves during the tournament as he looks to focus on winning a title in North America.

The former Spain international secured deals for Premier League duo Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold before flying out to the USA for a combined total of around £60m.

A move for Carreras is expected to form part of a new-look defensive unit under Alonso, with Trent at right back and Huijsen centrally, as Carreras comes in on the left-side.

Benfica's decision to include Carreras in their tournament squad, caused some concern over the status of the transfer, but it was ultimately viewed as a power play from Lisbon.

Real Madrid previously hoped to complete a transfer for €40m, but reports from Marca indicated they will need to pay his full €50m release clause to secure an exit from Lisbon.

Club legend Rui Costa and head coach Bruno La teamed up to fire a message of no deal being done over the 22-year-old.

Neither wanted to discuss an exit during the Club World Cup and remained steadfast on what they would request to sanction a sale.

Benfica's last 16 exit at the hands of Chelsea on June 28 will be key in Real Madrid's drive for Carreras.

The roadblock of playing in the competition has been removed, but it changes little in terms of a timetable for his arrival in Madrid, as per Mundo Deportivo.

Like all players competing in the USA, Carreras will now head off on a summer break, as sanctioned by player unions ahead of the 2025/26 season.

That could push the final confirmation of his move to the Spanish capital to late July where he will join up for the final stages of preseason training in Valdebebas.

The U.S. Women's National Team returns to action on Sunday, facing Ireland in an international friendly as part of their ongoing preparation for future competitions.

This will be the second meeting in three days between the U.S. and Ireland. In the first match, the USWNT earned a dominant 4-0 win, with goals from Avery Patterson, Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, and Alyssa Thompson.

The U.S. Women's National Team dominated their previous match against Ireland, outshooting them 28 to 1, holding 68% of the possession, and completing 526 passes to Ireland's 258. The USWNT will aim for a similar performance in Sunday's rematch as they continue building momentum ahead of official competitions later this year.

Before their win against Ireland, the USWNT had picked up a 4-0 win over Jamaica, with goals from Ally Sentnor and Lynn Biyendolo. Before that, the U.S. took down China 3-0, thanks to goals from Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Heaps.

The program is focused on developing its next generation of stars, as several key veterans begin to age out of international play. And while there will be some bumps along the way, like the 2-1 loss to Brazil on April 8, despite a first-minute goal from Macario, the overall trajectory for the U.S. remains positive.

Catch the USWNT back in action on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET, live from TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, as they face the Republic of Ireland. The match will air on NBC Universo.

The hunt for the U.S. Men's National Team's eighth Concacaf Gold Cup title continues as the knockout round begins Sunday, June 29 (7 p.m. ET on FOX).

The USA came out of the group stage undefeated while Costa Rica finished with two wins and a draw. If the USMNT advances, the Americans will take on the winner of Canada vs. Guatemala in the semifinal.

PREVIEW | BEST MOMENTS

Before that, the U.S. faces a tough Costa Rican side. Here's everything you need to know about the quarterfinal matchup:

The Gold Cup roster with 16 average caps was relatively inexperienced when announced; however, it created an opportunity for players to stake their National Team claim.

Several players, namely, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna and Patrick Agyemang are making the most of their moment in Concacaf's premier tournament. Tillman made his first USMNT appearance in 2022 and has made quite the impression heading into next year's FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Luna and Agyemang debuted earlier this year and have taken full advantage of the Gold Cup to show their value.

Tillman opened the first group match with a brace, netting his first-ever goals, and Luna recorded two assists in a 5-0 dominant win against Trinidad and Tobago. Tillman leads the USA in this tournament with three goals, and Agyemang tops the team in scoring in 2025 with five. Agyemang lifted the USMNT over Haiti with the go-ahead goal in a 2-1 victory, completing the group stage with nine points.

The USA will have a tough challenge against Costa Rican goalkeeper Keylor Navas, who is widely regarded as one of the best ‘keepers in the world.

“His career speaks for itself,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “The levels that he's played at, the experience that he has with an even younger group now, I think that they're bringing in a lot of players for a new generation in Costa Rica, he's obviously the leader of that team.”

The U.S. has faced Navas several times, including in a 2022 World Cup Qualifying match where Los Ticos won 2-0. With Navas in goal, Costa Rica has beaten the United States three out of five meetings. USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is uniquely familiar with Navas' abilities. Pochettino coached Navas at Paris Saint-Germain from 2021-22.

“Always we admired him,” Pochettino said. “His mentality and his quality as a keeper, it's going to be a fantastic moment to share tomorrow with him. He's a great player. He's a great keeper, one of the best on the world.”

It'll be a defining test for the USMNT who has scored eight goals in the tournament so far.

The USMNT finished at the top of Group D, beating Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti in the process. The Americans scored eight goals and only conceded one. The two shutouts for goalkeeper Matt Freese were tied with Canada for a group-stage best.

Costa Rica beat Suriname 4-3, the Dominican Republic 2-1 and tied Mexico 0-0. El Tri topped Group A while Costa Rica came in a close second by allowing one more goal.

USA midfielder Malik Tillman and Costa Rican forward Manfred Ugalde both have tallied three goals each, which is tied for the most in the tournament among teams yet to compete in the knockout round. However, Ugalde will be unavailable for Sunday's match after drawing a second yellow card against Mexico.

In the group stage, several Costa Rica players were shown yellow cards. Forward Manfred Ugalde and defender Joseph Mora picked up their second in the final group match and are both suspended for the quarterfinal match against the United States. Ugalde and Mora accounted for four of Costa Rica's six goals in the group stage.

Midfielders Diego Luna, Tyler Adams and Sebastian Berhalter were also issued one yellow card each. They're at risk of a semifinal suspension if another is picked up in the quarterfinal. 

This will be match No. 44 between the United States and Costa Rica. Only Mexico, the USMNT's biggest rival, has been a more common opponent with 76 games. The USA holds a slim winning record of 20-17-6 over the Concacaf foe.

The two nations last matched up at the beginning of this year in Orlando, Florida, during the January camp. Forward Patrick Agyemang scored his second international career goal in his second cap to lead the United States to a 3-0 win.

They've faced off in the Gold Cup six times with a 7-0-1 record, advantage USA. All but one of those came in the group stage. In 1993, the USA beat Costa Rica 1-0 in extra time in the semifinals.

Resting up to play in a record sixth World Cup was more important to Cristiano Ronaldo than switching teams to play in the Club World Cup.

"I had some offers to play (Club) World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long, because this is the season of the World Cup, at the end of the season," Ronaldo said in an Instagram video posted by his Saudi Arabian club, Al Nassr, after signing a two-year extension. "So I want to be ready not only for Al Nassr but also for the national team."

The 40-year-old Ronaldo helped Portugal to the Nations League trophy with a penalty shootout win over Spain three weeks ago as speculation swirled that he would transfer to another club to play in the Club World Cup currently being contested in the United States.

He and longtime Argentina rival Lionel Messi could be the first players to appear in six World Cups at next year's tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In Qatar three years ago, Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five World Cups.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's extension with Al Nassr means he will play on until at least the age of 42.

U.S. Men's National Soccer Team star Timothy Weah has opened up about what he described as the “weird” experience of standing behind Donald Trump in the Oval Office while the president fielded questions on the Iran-Israel war and attacked the idea of transgender women competing in women's sports.

Weah was at the White House with his Juventus teammates on Wednesday as part of a promotional event for the FIFA Club World Cup, ahead of the Italian side's 5-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates' Al-Ain FC.

Trump invited questions from reporters about the game and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. will host alongside Mexico and Canada.

But the Juventus players stood uncomfortably behind POTUS as he instead answered queries about the more pressing political questions of the day.

Weah, the son of former Liberian soccer star-turned-former president George Weah, later told reporters that the players had been made to attend the event.

“They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go,” he explained, reported The Athletic.

“I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird,” he added. “When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it's kind of like, I just want to play football, man.”

Part of the intrigue of this Club World Cup for Chelsea supporters is the chance it has provided for them to take a closer look at Palmeiras prodigy Estevao. The 18-year-old is hailed by many in Brazil as the best talent they have produced since Neymar and is bound for a move to Stamford Bridge this summer.

By overcoming Benfica in a marathon weather-delayed round of 16 match in Charlotte on Saturday, Chelsea have set up their closest look yet. Estevao and Palmeiras will be their quarter-final opponents at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Friday. He will be on the pitch and could serve his next club notice of his talent. He could even send them home.

It is an unusual situation, borne out of the nature of the transfer agreement that will bring Estevao from Sao Paulo to Stamford Bridge and of the timing of this inaugural, expanded FIFA Club World Cup. Here is an exploration of some of the key questions around it.

Chelsea reached a verbal agreement with Palmeiras to sign Estevao in May 2024. As detailed by The Athletic, the deal consisted of €34million (£29m; $40m) as an up-front transfer fee, with another €23m tied to performance-based incentives at his current club and his new one.

He was 17 at the time and had only made 11 professional club appearances across Brazil's Serie A and the Copa Libertadores, but he was attracting the close attention of several elite European clubs and Chelsea were determined to move quickly to sign him ahead of their rivals.

Estevao could only legally move to England once he had turned 18. His birthday is April 24, meaning the transfer was always going to be formally completed in this summer's transfer window. But the introduction of the Club World Cup complicated matters, since Chelsea and Palmeiras were both scheduled to participate.

According to sources familiar with the deal, who spoke anonymously to The Athletic, an agreement was reached between the clubs for Estevao to remain with Palmeiras until they are eliminated from the tournament, or until the day after the final if they make it that far.

Leila Pereira, the president of Palmeiras, is convinced he is heading for the top. “One day, he will be voted the best player in the world. He's a spectacular kid and he's going to shine in Europe.”

Estevao will complete his transfer to Chelsea as soon as Palmeiras' involvement in the Club World Cup is over. In an interview with ESPN Brasil, he admitted to feeling “anxiety” as his move to England nears, adding that he is struggling to keep his focus on making sure he can leave the club on a high note in the United States.

These comments prompted criticism from some quarters in Brazil, but Palmeiras manager Abel Ferreira subsequently defended his young star. “It's normal for a boy who had a dream that's becoming a reality,” he said. “It's normal that (Estevao) feels that.

“He's an 18-year-old kid, he was naive to say what he said. And a lot of you (the press) slaughtered him, which is what you do to players.”

Above all, Chelsea want Estevao's future; they believe he has the potential to become one of the best attacking players in the world. Palmeiras were eager to keep him long enough to maximise their chances of doing well in the Club World Cup, which is their biggest tournament in terms of prestige and profile, not to mention the financial rewards on offer in the United States.

Both clubs enjoy a good relationship and Chelsea did not object to Estevao playing for Palmeiras in the tournament because they believe they will get the best years of his career.

There is no rule that prevents Estevao from playing against Chelsea in the Club World Cup. He is registered in Palmeiras' squad for the tournament, so in the eyes of FIFA, he is their player. This is not a loan situation where a player cannot face their parent club, as is standard practice in the Premier League.

Only a direct agreement between the two clubs could stop Estevao from facing Chelsea, and no such stipulation was included in the transfer deal that was reached a year ago.

There are no perfect comparisons, but the situation that will immediately come to mind for many Chelsea fans is that of Thibaut Courtois, who was on loan at Atletico Madrid from Stamford Bridge when he helped knock his parent club out of the Champions League at the semi-final stage in the 2013-14 season.

Jose Mourinho did not want Courtois to play in the tie, but UEFA rules forbade Chelsea from blocking the Belgian's involvement for Atletico, or from being paid a penalty fee if they selected him. He had signed from Genk in the summer of 2011 but did not make his debut at Stamford Bridge until August 2014, after three seasons on loan in the Spanish capital.

Mario Gotze came close to providing the most infamous example. News that Bayern Munich would trigger the €37m release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract broke in April 2013, on the eve of the second leg of Dortmund's Champions League semi-final clash with Real Madrid. They triumphed 4-3 on aggregate to set up a final date with… Bayern.

It could have been awkward, but Gotze ended up missing the final — which Bayern won 2-1 — with a thigh injury sustained in the second leg of the Madrid tie.

Leon Goretzka did play against Bayern in February 2018, one month after sparking the ire of Schalke fans when he announced he would leave the club to join the Bavarian giants as a free agent the following summer.

Bayern won 2-1 at the Allianz Arena, but Goretzka was Schalke's best performer in the match, setting up an equaliser when his bicycle kick attempt fell kindly for team-mate Franco Di Santo. He ended up leading them to a second-place Bundesliga finish before moving to Munich.

United are reportedly planning to offload Onana for a cut-price deal as they prioritise the signing of Martinez from Aston Villa. The Villans are ready to part ways with the World Cup-winning Argentine this summer.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup continues its slate of round of 16 matches Sunday, with Bayern Munich and Flamengo battling it out at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

Bayern, long the dominant force in the Bundesliga, opened their Club World Cup with a 10-0 demolition of Auckland City FC. The Bavarians then eked out a 2-1 victory over Boca Juniors, but fell 1-0 to Benfica, settling for the second spot in Group C. Club legend Thomas Müller is set to exit Bayern when this tournament ends, and the team is motivated to send him out with one more trophy.

Flamengo, Brazil's most popular club, knocked off Chelsea 3-1 in one of the Club World Cup's biggest upsets thus far. The Rio de Janeiro-based side also defeated Espérance Sportive de Tunis, but needed a late equalizer against LAFC to seal the top spot in Group D. Their reward? Another shot at stunning one of Europe's aristocrats.

Here's what to know for the Bayern vs. Flamengo Club World Cup clash, including kickoff time and how to watch.

The Club World Cup round of 16 game between Bayern Munich and Flamengo is set to kick off at 4 p.m. ET at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

Cristiano Ronaldo recently penned a new deal with Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr. The Portuguese superstar has been tied down to one of the most lucrative contracts in sports history.

Ronaldo's current deal was set to expire in June and had been linked with a move away from the Saudi Pro League club for some time. There were rumors that several Club World Cup sides were interested in the 40-year-old.

Ronaldo has confirmed those claims. However, he preferred to rest as he wanted to stay fresh for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That played a major role in Ronaldo deciding to renew his deal with Al-Nassr. Speaking to the club's media, Ronaldo said:

Cristiano Ronaldo has just won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal. He is now aiming to claim the only missing major title from his trophy cabinet, the FIFA World Cup. Hence, after a Nations League campaign and a long 2024-25 season, it might have been a smart decision for Ronaldo to keep himself rested.

As for his performances for Al-Nassr, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner continues to produce regular goal contributions. He boasts a record of 93 goals and 19 assists in 105 appearances for the Saudi Pro League club so far.

No head coach wants the focus to be on them heading into critical knockout games. Yet, that situation couldn't be avoided for Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the U.S. men's national team's Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal against Costa Rica. 

Early on Saturday, a report from Ireland suggested that Pochettino had interviewed for the Brentford managerial position, which the club's former set-piece coach Keith Andrews has since filled. However, according to Pochettino himself and multiple sources, the Premier League club never reached out, let alone proceeded with an interview. 

“This club never contacted me,” Pochettino told Fox Sports. “I never talked to them.”

Previously a coach with Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton and Espanyol, Pochettino signed with the USMNT in September 2024 with the goal of leading the team through the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

While he could feasibly have been a candidate for Brentford as they looked to fill the vacancy left by Thomas Frank's appointment at Tottenham, the Premier League side would have needed to go through U.S. Soccer to engage in talks if they wanted to pursue his services. 

While Pochettino's USMNT have looked good at the Gold Cup with group stage wins against Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti and Saudi Arabia, it has not been all smooth for the Argentine boss since taking over.

Heading into the tournament, he became the first USMNT manager since 2007 to lose four straight games, following disappointing performances against Panama, Canada, Switzerland and Turkey. 

Additionally, there has also been the issue with Christian Pulisic and other star players, who are not on the American Gold Cup squad. For Pulisic, the decision came down to resting after a long season with AC Milan. However, in a CBS Sports, he added that he had wanted to play in the pre-Gold Cup friendlies against UEFA opponents, but Pochettino denied his request. 

“When I signed my contract in the federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin,” Pochettino hit back. “Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.”

Boasting an 8–3 record with the USMNT, Pochettino will hope to lead the team past Costa Rica on Sunday and into a semifinal, where they would face either Canada or Guatemala for a spot in the Gold Cup final on July 6 in Houston.

    Lionel Messi and co look to cause an upset against his former club.
  

It's a blockbuster FIFA Club World Cup clash at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta today as Inter Miami GOAT Lionel Messi faces off against his old club PSG.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full match list. 

Despite his advancing years, the Argentine legend has been in fine form during this tournament, with the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner looking particularly in Miami's 2-1 win over Porto.

Today's match against the new European champions looks set to provide a sterner challenge for Miami, however the Parisians shock defeat to Botafogo in their second match should give Messi and co hope of pulling off a major upset. 

Paris Saint-Germain takes on Inter Miami on Sunday, June 29, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT. That makes it a 5 p.m. BST start in the UK and an 2 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday morning. 

Lionel Messi made 75 appearances and contributed 32 goals and 35 assists during his time as a PSG player between 2021 and 2023. 

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

As well as dedicated apps for iOS and Android, DAZN offers a wide range of support for set-top boxes and smart TVs.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds. It can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

Corrections and clarifications: England won the World Cup in 1966. An earlier version of this story stated an incorrect year.

Whatever is wrong with the U.S. men's national team, and pull up a chair because there's lots to discuss, diversity isn't it.

That's not just an aspirational statement. There are studies to prove it. In fact, researchers who've looked at both club and national teams across the world recently found diversity actually made squads better.

"Previous research, they found a negative impact, not because of the diversity itself but how to put the team together. When you merge several players from different countries with different language, you create a barrier that makes it, at some extent, difficult to perform," said Thadeu Gasparetto, author of a paper published earlier this month titled "Multicultural teams: Does national diversity associate with performance in professional soccer?"

"More recent research is showing pretty much the opposite, where the diversity provides a set of different skills … different codes that tends to be positive.”

With less than a year until the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which U.S. Soccer officials hope will be as transformative for the game as the 1994 tournament was, the "golden generation” of the U.S. men's national team is struggling. To put it nicely.

Most of their top players, led by Christian Pulisic, are playing in Europe. Several on top teams, no less. Their coach is Mauricio Pochettino, who took Tottenham to the Champions League final.

Yet the USMNT skidded into the Concacaf Gold Cup on a four-game losing streak, its longest since 2007. Then team reached the quarterfinals of the tournament, but Sunday's game against Costa Rica will be the first real test.

As players, fans and pundits look for answers, former USMNT player and pot stirrer extraordinaire Alexi Lalas blamed the team's diversity. In addition to players from across the United States, the USMNT — like many other national teams — has multiple players who were born or raised overseas.

"I've argued that the homogeneous nature of some other countries and cultures, just in population in terms of the size, are much more manageable and there's a collective understanding and, more importantly, an agreement in, 'This is how we're going to play,'” said Lalas, who makes no secret of his willingness to be a right-wing media provocateur.

“But getting 11 men to represent this great country of 350 million people and all be on the same page, that is very, very difficult.”

Except it's really not. And there is both data, and anecdotal evidence, to prove it.

Gasparetto examined six professional leagues in Europe — England, Belgium, Germany, Cyprus, Latvia and the Netherlands — between the 2015-16 and 2020-21 seasons and found that each foreign player on a team correlated with a 0.42% increase in win percentage.

“It's much more about how well or how qualified the players are rather than where he or she's from,” Gasparetto said.

His findings are similar to those in a study by Michel Beine, Silvia Peracchi and Skerdilajda Zanaj that looked at ancestral diversity and its impact on a national team's performance. "Ancestral diversity and performance: Evidence from football data," published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization in September 2023, found ethnic diversity can lead to an additional goal scored per game.

“The idea is, basically, that more genetic diversity is going to allow more complementary skills between players,” Beine said. “Soccer is a game in which complementary skills is very important because you have different positions and these different positions, they require different type of skills. … These complementarities, these different type of skills are going to be beneficial for the team.”

Look at France. Les Bleus won the men's World Cup in 2018 and were runners-up in 2022 with a team that was a melting pot. In addition to players whose parents and grandparents and great-grandparents and — you get the idea — were born in France, about half the team was born in Africa or the French Caribbean, or had parents who were.

England, much to the country's consternation, endured decades of frustration after winning the World Cup in 1966. But it has reached the final at the last two European Championship and got to the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup with a multiracial team. Belgium had its best finish ever at the World Cup in 2018, third place, with a team that reflected the influence of immigration to that country in the 1950s and 1960s.

Conversely, teams that are homogenous — Iceland, for example, or Japan — don't fare as well.

“This mixing, in terms of skills, in terms of genetic endowment, we show in the statistical analysis that, over time, countries benefited from immigration flows and diverse immigration flows. … They improved their soccer performances,” Beine said. “On the contrary, you have countries who had very little immigration flows and who have kept quite a homogeneous population … maybe they have less benefited from this.”

Soccer is a global game — and not only because it's played everywhere in the world. Players routinely move from country to country in their club careers, and that is likely to have far more influence than the country in which they were born or the neighborhood in which they grew up.

Lionel Messi was born in Argentina, moved to Spain at 13 and spent two decades at Barcelona before going to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain. Now he's in the United States, playing for Inter Miami. Do you really think him being from Rosario has more of an impact on Argentina's national team than what he learned at Barcelona?

"The evidence is very clear that diversity is something that can be beneficial. And it is a little bit overlooked by people,” Beine said. “I think that sometimes people are not looking at the evidence. Or they are closing their eyes on what is really obvious.”

And that is that. The USMNT, much like the country it represents, is better for its diversity.

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) continues it's quest for a Gold Cup title as they face Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday night.

USMNT dominated during group stage play, winning all three matches and outscoring their opponents 8-1 in the process.

Since the bi-annual tournament was restructured to the Gold Cup in 1991, it's been dominated by the United States or Mexico, with the two countries winning 16 of the 17 tournaments over the last 34 years. The lone exception came when Canada won it all in 2000.

Costa Rica played well during the group stage, winning two one-goal affairs and a scoreless draw against Mexico in the final tune up before the elimination round.

After a fourth place finish in 2023, will the USMNT bounce back and compete for a Gold Cup title?

It all starts for the United States against Costa Rica with elimination now on the line.

Here's how to watch the Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal match on Sunday evening:

Pittsburgh Union Progress


					Published by striking workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.				

Like many preteen girls across southwestern Pennsylvania at the time, Meghan Klingenberg had been anxiously anticipating the night of July 10, 1999.

“My best friend came over because we were going to go to the *NSYNC concert,” she recalled.

There was just one problem.

“As an 11-year-old girl at that time *NSYNC was the most important thing in the world,” Klingenberg said. “What my best friend didn't know was that it was actually the second most important thing in the world to me; the first was the U.S. Women's National Team.”

Before heading out from their Gibsonia residence to see Justin Timberlake and his bandmates take to the stage at Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre — as it was then known — in Burgettstown, the Klingenberg family had some additional business on their agenda.

The United States Women's National Team was set to square off in the 1999 Women's World Cup final against China with more than 90,000 soccer fans in attendance at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., and many more tuned in on televisions across the country.

It was the first major event of the day for a local family of soccer fanatics.

“I think my friend was like, ‘When are we leaving?'” Klingenberg said. “My whole family was like, ‘Girl, sorry, we ain't leaving until this is over. We ended up watching Brandi Chastain hit the final [penalty kick], make it, win, and then after that we went to the *NSYNC concert.

“We actually ended up making it because *NSYNC came on so late,” she added. “We got the best of both worlds.”

It wouldn't be too long before Klingenberg was making history of her own on the world's stage.

Once a rabid fan, Klingenberg played every minute for the same U.S. Women's National Team she grew up idolizing on its run to the 2015 Women's World Cup title before becoming a full fledged Portland, Ore., sports icon, winning championships with National Women Soccer League's Thorns in 2017 and '22.

The Pine-Richland product — who helped the Rams win a PIAA title in 2005 — wrapped up an illustrious playing career by retiring earlier this month. She made the announcement official in an Instagram post.

It was a bittersweet moment for a player who rose to prominence on southwestern Pennsylvania's soccer pitches, who won two NCAA Division I women's soccer championships at North Carolina and got to have the local sports memory of a lifetime when she waved a “Terrible Towel” on the turf at Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium) after scoring a goal in an exhibition match with the U.S. Women's National Team in 2015.

“Those moments are just so lovely and special but, for me, if I was only playing for those moments I would have quit a long time ago,” Klingenberg said. “There's really not enough of those moments to sustain you. To me, it was about the friendships that I got to make with [former U.S. Women's National Team players] Becky Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe and people like that who have become really great friends.

“It's the thing that you never really expect, but it really does become so intertwined in the fabric of your life,” she added of soccer. “It's just provided me with so many amazing people and moments and friends.”

Family ties

While soccer would eventually take her around the world, Klingenberg said her love of the game was rooted in humble beginnings.

“Honestly, when I was first playing, I was terrible,” she said.

Klingenberg said her earliest memories of playing soccer came in the backyard of her maternal grandmother, who would host four generations of her family nearly every Sunday for dinner.

“She used to cook dinner, and my great-aunt used to bake pies,” Klingenberg said. “Everyone would come over and drink lemonade and eat good food and laugh really loud and talk about what was going on in our lives. The kids would play in the backyard, and a lot of times what we would do is just play all of the sports. My cousins, they started playing soccer in the backyard, and I was, like, ‘What is this?' I started playing with them.”

Before too long, Klingenberg said her parents had signed her up to play in a local youth league.

“I started playing, and I realized I was just so much worse than all of my peers,” she said. “I remember running over to my parents and being like, ‘Is it OK if I just stick with softball?' They were like, ‘Yeah, it's totally fine. You can play whatever you want to play.' I don't remember the reason why I ended up sticking it out with soccer, but I did. It became my favorite sport pretty quickly, and I would have just such a blast with my friends playing it.”

Fitting in

By the time she got to Pine-Richland High School, then-Rams coach Jodi Chmielewski said Klingenberg had become a force to reckon with on the WPIAL soccer scene.

“At the level when I got her, I definitely think everyone knew that she had Division I potential at that point,” said Chmielewski, who won more than 300 games, two WPIAL championships and a PIAA title during her 21-year tenure at Pine-Richland. “Just her speed, her level of compete, I think, stood out among everybody and just her technical ability and tactical awareness.”

Chmielewski said her drive to succeed was nearly unparalleled among players she coached.

“She just dreamed so big in terms of the national team and UNC and just kept meeting all those goals and exceeding them,” Chmielewski said. “Just her work rate and her focus and her passion for the game, that all can only be attributed to her achieving all that success at all those levels.”

Klingenberg played four seasons under Chmielewski and was a captain and starter of the Rams' 2005 PIAA championship team. She assisted on the goal that won the state title game before being named NSCAA and Parade All-American selections the following season in 2006.

“She was just so dynamic on the field,” Chmielewski said. “She was small, and I think that was what was pretty cool, too. She was small, but she was just so competitive. Her size didn't hold her back, and I think it gave her that fire to achieve more.”

Mastering her game

And that was certainly the case at North Carolina.

Klingenberg scored 18 goals, with 24 assists, during her four-year career in Chapel Hill. Although she played several positions under legendary coach Anson Dorrance, Klingenberg eventually settled in as a left back in the Tar Heels defensive unit.

“She just kept grinding and grinding and grinding and just wanted to be the best player she could possibly be,” said Dorrance, who won 1,106 games and 21 NCAA championships during a 47-year career leading his alma mater's women's soccer program. “As a result she did. Obviously, there are a lot of national team players that ascended because of their extraordinary talent, but Meghan ascended because of her extraordinary will, not because she was blessed with every conceivable quality. She's not that tall. She's quick, but not explosively fast. She did it by working on her skill set, mastering the ball. She became a very tactical player.”

Klingenberg said her time at North Carolina was critical to her development.

“Carolina was such an amazing experience all around,” she said. “School, soccer, socially, everything about it, I loved. Being there was one of the best moments in time in my life and in my career.

“I did finally feel free to be my authentic self,” she said. “I felt free to be as competitive as I was without judgment. I felt free to absolutely kick ass. I felt free to express myself in ways that I was never able to before because it was looked down upon in women, in girls. That environment, it wasn't looked down upon. In fact, it was celebrated.”

Klingenberg was part of NCAA championship teams in 2008 and 2009 at North Carolina and won three Atlantic Coast Conference titles. She said getting to build a relationship with Dorrance — who also coached the U.S. Women's National team from 1986 until 1994 and won a World Cup in 1991 — was critical to her development.

“One of the best things that he did in the culture was let everyone know how much he cares about you,” Klingenberg said. “He put everyone's human development first over their soccer development. He was able to see the humanity in each of the players.”

Dorrance said he is proud of the player and person Klingenberg has become.

“At her best, she was considered the best left back in the world,” he said. “I just think she had an absolutely extraordinary ascension but, also, a career. The other thing about Meghan is I just really liked her. She was funny. She was full of piss and vinegar.”

The next level

Klingenberg said making the U.S. Women's National team was a dream come true.

“I don't know why I had deluded myself into thinking this, but I always thought I was going to make it,” she said.

Klingenberg was the starting left back for the 2015 World Cup championship team. She remained with the team when it placed fifth in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.

“I don't think that there's ever been another team in the history of soccer or sport that has been so successful over such a long period of time,” said Klingenberg of the U.S. Women's National team. “I can't remember the last time that we've dropped below a Top 5 ranking in the world, maybe never. That has to be a unique stat.”

Such success has also brought about ways for members of the U.S. Women's National team to create positive change in their communities.

From championing equal play for women in professional sports to creating awareness of LGBTQ issues in American society, U.S. Women's National team players have been at the forefront of activism over the past several decades.

For Klingenberg, dealing with mental health issues and the various stressors, which come along with competing a high level have also been critical to her as a professional athlete. She said she hopes to continue to bring awareness to mental health concerns in her retirement.

“Being able to pull on a jersey and stand for the things that are the best part of the United States was something that was really special,” Klingenberg said. “It creates a different kind of bond with somebody because it's not something that most people get to experience in their lifetime.”

Klingenberg is also a 10-year veteran of the NWSL, playing two seasons with the Houston Dash, before starring for eight years in Portland. She logged 11,619 minutes with the Thorns and started 135 of her 149 appearances.

In addition to Portland's two NWSL championships during her tenure, Klingenberg's teams finished with the league's best regular-season record twice before her final professional contest in 2024.

“She's a role model in Portland for all of her years with the Thorns,” Chmielewski said. “I think it's pretty cool for her to have an impact on the game in so many different areas of the country.”

There's no doubt, though, the impact Klingenberg has had on soccer in her hometown.

“It's been cool to be able to watch from a distance and watch her in each of those different arenas and areas and just continue to excel and break those barriers,” Chmielewski said. “I'm just extremely proud of her. I know her family, obviously, are her biggest fans. She's created fans around the world and with young female players it's been great for our area for her to be the first really female player to achieve that success at that level. Our hope is there's many more to follow her.”

The future

Klingenberg said she is going to take the next year to evaluate her next steps and what her future might hold. At just 36, Klingenberg said she has plenty more in store.

U.S. Soccer, though, launched a new podcast June 9, which is hosted by David Gass and co-hosted by Klingenberg and Alejandro Bedoya. The podcast is intended to highlight the men's and women's U.S. national teams and the inside stories surrounding the teams.

“If there is anything that people take from my career, I truly hope that being yourself and just being you, you're doing the very best thing that you could possibly do for your performance and your mental health,” she said.

Dorrance said he could see Klingenberg succeeding as a broadcaster or in coaching.

“Everything she achieves, she achieves through the sweat of her brow,” he said. “Meghan worked hard and then earned absolutely everything she got.”

The U.S. men's national team is in the knockout stages of the Concacaf Gold Cup and is looking to continue its good form in the tournament when it takes on Costa Rica in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday night.

While Mauricio Pochettino's team entered the tournament with doubts after four straight losses, it thrived in the group stage, beating each of Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti to emerge as the top seed. 

Now, they take on one of the stronger Concacaf sides in Costa Rica, who finished second in their group to Mexico. While Los Ticos aren't quite at the level as they were 11 summers ago in Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, they will still provide a formidable opponent in the quarterfinal. 

Here's everything you need to know about that clash.

The U.S. men's national team have been able to quiet some of the noise a year out from the FIFA World Cup 2026 on home soil, given a stellar group stage which saw standout performances from several players. 

While Pochettino has adjusted his lineup through each match, attacking midfielder Malik Tillman and central midfielder Sebastian Berhalter have been two of the tournament's standouts, while center back Chris Richards has continued his elite level of leadership at the back. 

Expect the USMNT to rely on strong play from those three against Costa Rica, and to likely turn to Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang up top, after he scored against Haiti to clinch the perfect group stage with his second goal of the tournament. 

However, lineup decisions could be impacted by yellow card accumulation worries, as each of Berhalter and Tyler Adams would be suspended for the semifinal if they pick up one more caution.

As much as success at the Gold Cup has been of primary importance for the group donning the Stars and Stripes, there have also been recent transfer links for several players, including Agyemang's rumored move to Derby County and Tillman's links with Bayer Leverkusen, both of which have yet to come to fruition. 

After allowing just one goal through the group stage, the USMNT will hope to shut down Costa Rica's attack and keep their stingy form to clinch a spot in challenging matchups which await in the semifinals and final. 

USMNT predicted lineup vs. Saudi Arabia (4-2-3-1): Freese; Freeman, Richards, Ream, Arfsten; Berhalter, de la Torre; McGlynn, Tillman, Luna; Agyemang.

Costa Rica came within a chance of winning the group, finishing just one goal behind Mexico after a scoreless draw in their matchup. However, now they enter the quarterfinal with a chance to take down a very beatable USMNT. 

Head coach Miguel Herrera's side opened the Gold Cup with a thrilling comeback 4–3 win over Suriname, and pushed past an upstart Dominican Republic 2–1 to book their place in the quarterfinals. At the same time, they have continuously improved in 2025, with strong results in Concacaf World Cup qualifying before the Gold Cup. 

Should they find success against the USMNT, they will likely look to leading scorer Manfred Ugalde, who has three goals in as many games at the tournament, as well as New York City FC attacker Alonso Martínez, who has eight goals in 16 MLS matches this season. 

At the back, former Real Madrid star Keylor Navas continues to hold on to the starting goalkeeper position, and has maintained his form even in his waning playing years at 38 years old. 

It won't be an easy task for Costa Rica, especially with the expected crowd in Minnesota, but it won't be impossible. 

Costa Rica Predicted Lineup vs. USMNT (5-3-2): Navas; C. Mora, Mitchell, Vargas, Gamboa, Calvo; Aguilera, Galo, Alcocer; Martinez, Zamora

It's definitly not the easiest quarterfinal draw for either side, but given the advantage of playing at home and the stingy defensive form through the group stage, the USMNT likely hold the advantage against Los Ticos. However, American supporters should be prepared for some concerning moments, as it won't be a comfortable win. 

Score Prediction: USMNT 1–0 Costa Rica

It's clear that Jurgen Klopp did not have anything nice to say about the expanded FIFA Club World Cup.

During an interview with German publication Die Welt published on Friday, Klopp said the tournament “the worst idea ever implemented” in the sport.

The new format now features a 32-team event, which occurs every four years during the preseason in the summers between the major international tournaments.

The 2025 Club World Cup, which is being hosted by the United States, started earlier this month and is set to conclude on July 13.

“It's a pointless competition. Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they'll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league,” Klopp said.

“There are people who have never been involved in the day-to-day business of football and are now coming up with ideas,” he added.

Klopp, who was at the helm for Liverpool from 2015-24, also pointed out that players today do not get enough time to rest, saying that adding another tournament could be dangerous for their health.

“It's too many games. I fear that next season we will see injuries like never before. If not then, they'll come during or after the Club World Cup,” Klopp said.

The 58-year-old added: “There's no real recovery for those involved, neither physically nor mentally.”

Since moving on from coaching, Klopp now serves as the head of global soccer for Red Bull, which owns several clubs such as the New York Red Bulls in the MLS and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga.

When asked if he was interested in a potential return to coaching, Klopp shut down the idea, saying that  his new job “fufills” him.

“I don't want that anymore,” he said. “I have a job now that fulfils me and is also intense. I don't sleep in the morning and I don't go to bed later at night, but I can organize my work much better.”

Few sights in tennis strike fear quite like seeing Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard's name next to yours in a grass-court draw.

Towering at 6' 8” and hammering down aces with abandon, the 21-year-old Frenchman boasts a game tailor-made for the slick surface. Taylor Fritz, this year's fifth seed at Wimbledon, will have to confront that challenge head on Monday in one of the popcorn opening matches at the All England Club.

“My game is very fast — big serve, short rallies,” Mpetshi Perricard told ATPTour.com ahead of his Wimbledon campaign. “On a surface like grass, it can really make a difference. It can help me…

“I'm not sure what other players think, but obviously when I'm playing someone who serves big and plays fast, like [Reilly] Opelka, it's not very pleasant to know you don't have control over the points. But that's part of the game: Everyone has their style and that's what makes this sport beautiful.”



After a breakout season in 2024, during which he won his first two tour-level titles in Lyon and Basel, Mpetshi Perricard earned Most Improved Player honours at the ATP Awards. At the heart of his success is a bold tactical approach that continues to serve him well — particularly on grass.

By launching second serves at speeds comparable to his first, the World No. 36 Mpetshi Perricard often blitzes through service games and ramps up the pressure on his opponents. But there's a calculation behind the aggression.

“It's a real strategy,” said Mpetshi Perricard, who won 88.8 per cent of his service games last year. “I've got a lot of control, and that allows me to put pressure on my opponents. Playing on grass is completely different. You have to make adjustments, but it's a part of the season every player looks forward to.”

Wimbledon is a place that will highlight his potential like no other. Last year, despite falling in the final round of qualifying, Mpetshi Perricard received a lucky loser spot in the main draw after Alejandro Davidovich Fokina's withdrawal.

How to make some noise on your Wimbledon main-draw debut? Hit 51 aces… The Frenchman wore down 20th seed Sebastian Korda in his five-set opener and rode that momentum to the fourth round, in which he lost to Lorenzo Musetti.

“I've got good memories of Wimbledon, I did a few good things there,” the Frenchman modestly said. “It's the first time I won matches at a Grand Slam, I can't wait to play there again. It's a special place.”

This year, the No. 5 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fritz, will have little time to settle into his campaign at SW19. Yet ahead of his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Mpetshi Perricard, the American remained level headed and quietly assured.

“It's a scary match, because some things are more out of your control than in other matches,” said Fritz, who reached the quarter-finals last year. “It's not easy when you play someone like him. It could potentially come down to a couple of points, a couple of shots.

“But historically, I have done well against big servers. I'm going to go out there and do my job, which is to take care of my own service games. If it happens that I'm not able to break and I lose in tie-breaks, that can happen… It's not the easiest draw, but I've had a lot of good results when given tough draws.”

While Mpetshi Perricard poses a threat, Fritz can draw on his own grass-court pedigree. After triumphs already this year in Stuttgart and Eastbourne, the 27-year-old is just the second active man to win five or more titles on the surface, trailing only Novak Djokovic (8).

Fourth seed starts against Sebastian Baez on Tuesday

Draper has made eye-catching rise up rankings this year

Jack Draper has vowed to embrace being the new leader and figurehead of British tennis as he begins his Wimbledon campaign as a top contender for the championship.

Draper will face Sebastian Baez of Argentina in his first-round match on Tuesday, a long-awaited homecoming for the 23-year-old after enjoying a remarkable rise during the past year. Only a few years ago he sought out advice from Andy Murray and other top British players as he tried to understand how he could fulfil his enormous potential. The fourth seed is now the point of reference for all other British players and many have already asked him for his thoughts on their own journeys.

“It's very nice when people reach out,” Draper said. “I think within British tennis, especially, people know the work I've been through, the adversity I've gone through with injuries, the type of person I am where I'm always wanting to progress. I'm always wanting to understand how I can be better as a player.”

An example of Draper's newfound authority came last year when Hannah Klugman, one of Britain's most talented youngsters, arranged a lunch meeting with him through her coach, Ben Haran. She views Draper's advice as instrumental in helping her to find her way again. Klugman, who reached the French Open girls' final this month, will make her grand slam debut on Monday against the 29th seed Leylah Fernandez after receiving a wildcard.

“My message to her was that everyone's on their own journeys,” Draper said. “But regardless, if you look at a top player, or if you look at someone who's doing incredibly well, it doesn't necessarily mean they've got it all figured out and they're not in the state of struggle themselves. They just know how to deal with it better.

“In a sport like tennis or in any sport, people think it's easy. You go out there, win, you feel great, but the challenge is there every day to perform and to be better. So my message to her was that everyone's the same. It's just how you deal with it. So don't be afraid of the doubts and the fear and the anxiety and the struggles that come with the tennis world.”

Carlos Alcaraz, the defending men's champion, opens play on Centre Court on Monday against the veteran Italian Fabio Fognini. Other headliners on the opening day include Aryna Sabalenka, the world No 1, who begins against Carson Branstine, a Canadian qualifier, and Emma Raducanu, who faces the 17-year-old British wildcard Mimi Xu.

Draper has been handed a difficult draw as he tries to manage the elevated pressure and expectations that come with his new status but is determined to show the country his potential. “It's a great opportunity here at Wimbledon and a great chance to hopefully show the British public what I'm able to do on a tennis court, and the type of personality I am,” he said.

Along with the pressure that comes with competing in one of the biggest tournaments in the world, the players will have to deal with searing temperatures at Wimbledon throughout the first week. In a sport that frequently takes place in hot conditions, however, many of the top players were not particularly concerned about the prospect of performing in elevated temperatures. “I just tell myself I'm from Florida,” Naomi Osaka said, smiling.

The treatment of female sportspeople is particularly troubling, and the reasons behind it – including gambling – are rightly under fresh scrutiny

With temperatures forecast to be as high as 34C, spectators as well as players must arrive at the All England Lawn Tennis Club on Monday prepared to deal with conditions more familiar at grand slams in Australia and the US. But as Wimbledon opens its doors, three weeks after a French Open men's singles final that some regard as the best tennis match ever (Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner over five and a half hours), other warnings besides heat are known to be troubling some of the players.

Emma Raducanu has said she feels “comfortable” and “safe”, thanks to tighter security arrangements introduced after an unnamed man, who previously signed an agreement to stay away from her, was blocked from buying tickets. Earlier this year she became visibly distressed by his presence at a match in Dubai, after he approached her in person. But while this particular situation appears to have been dealt with, the wider picture regarding female players' experiences remains troubling – as does the wider problem of online abuse in sports, including that aimed at referees.

Earlier this month the British No 2, Katie Boulter, gave an interview highlighting the toll this behaviour takes. Other players have also described the impact of stalkers and fixated male fans. Three years ago, a different man from the one in Dubai was sentenced to 200 hours community service after repeatedly turning up at Raducanu's house.

Stalkers are not a new problem for celebrities, including sportspeople. In 1993, Monica Seles was stabbed in Hamburg by a man obsessed with her rival, Steffi Graf. But the darker side of fame has been magnified by digital media – which has changed the rules of social engagement for athletes as well as everyone else.

Since sport, for most people, is an enjoyable leisure activity, its stars are widely regarded as lucky, talented people – not obvious objects of concern. But the disproportionate harassment of female players should bother spectators and society at large, as well as those with a professional interest in their wellbeing.

To some degree such attacks are in line with women's negative experiences in other areas of public life, including politics, and part of a wider problem of escalating, technologically enabled sexism. But the role of online gambling in fomenting aggression is an element specific to sports that is rightly attracting attention. A newly released report from the Women's Tennis Association and International Tennis Federation found that 77% of abuse directed at players' personal accounts came from “frustrated gamblers”, with a handful of top female players facing a disproportionate share of hostility.

Unsurprisingly, given their well documented opposition to stronger regulation in general, gambling companies have been slow to act. But players and those tasked with safeguarding them are pushing back. The two-times Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur – who plays her first-round match on Monday – is among those who have called for betting companies to ban abusers from their platforms for life. She deserves praise for speaking out.

Sir Andy Murray, and others who have voiced concern, recognise that regulating online speech is complex. That does not mean that the status quo is acceptable. Fatalistic attitudes to the growing problem of sexualised online abuse are part of the problem that policymakers need to grip.

Jannik Sinner will kick start his Wimbledon campaign against compatriot Luca Nardi, whom he has never faced in his career. Ahead of the tournament, Sinner talked about his US Open mixed doubles partner Emma Navarro.

The US Open mixed doubles event this week has been moved to the qualifying rounds and this move attracted many top players, including Sinner. The Italian, in the pre-tournament press conference was asked about Navarro as they are “one of the most unexpected pairings“.

It was very unexpected, to be honest (laughs). I just met her yesterday for the first time, and we never talked, we never texted each other. It's actually a funny story. They kind of…the tournament…they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up.

Sinner's arch-rival Carlos Alcaraz will be playing the mixed doubles alongside Emma Raducanu, while Novak Djokovic will be competing with compatriot Olga Danilovic. Women's World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will enter the tournament with Grigor Dimitrov, while Iga Swiatek has joined forces with Casper Ruud.

Navarro will start her Wimbledon campaign against Petra Kvitova. The World No.10 has won just the Merida Open Akron this year by beating Emiliana Arango. At Wimbledon, the 24-year-old has never progressed beyond the quarterfinals, reaching the stage last year (lost to eventual runner-up Jasmine Paolini).

While Sinner will be bidding to win his fourth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, Navarro will be hoping to reach a Major final for the first time. Her best performance in a tournament of this category came in 2024 when she made it to the final of the US Open and lost the match to eventual winner Sabalenka.

Novak Djokovic was all praise for Jannik Sinner in the pre-tournament press conference at Wimbledon. He was asked about Aryna Sabalenka's controversial comments she made after her defeat to Coco Gauff.

Djokovic defended the Belarusian, saying players sometimes fail to control their emotions, especially after a defeat in a Grand Slam final. He then praised Sinner's conduct after he lost his French Open final to Carlos Alcaraz.

If you look at Sinner and Alcaraz after five and a half hours of fighting, Jannik could have been bitter after losing that match. But he was gracious in his speech, he came back, he had a good tournament a week later and he's here, he's moving on. I think it sends the right message about the rivalry and the respect they have for each other, I think it's beautiful to see.

Djokovic will be locking horns with France's Alexandre Muller to start his bid for his eighth Wimbledon title. He is chasing his 25th Grand Slam title in the tournament and has reached every final of the grass-court Major since 2018, losing in the last two seasons to Alcaraz.

The Spaniard will enter Wimbledon as the two-time defending champion and he will also aim to complete the rare Channel Slam for two consecutive seasons. He will meet Italy's Fabio Fognini in the first round and is projected to square off against Sinner in the final.

Sinner has never reached the championship match here. In 2023, Djokovic knocked him out in straight sets in the semifinals, while last year, 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev ended his run in the quarterfinals.

Sinner and Alcaraz have shared the last six Grand Slam titles between them and the last player other than them to win a Major was Djokovic at the 2023 US Open. Since that victory, Djokovic only reached one Grand Slam final (2024 Wimbledon).

LONDON (AP) — It didn't take long for Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka to patch up their relationship after this month's French Open final.Now as Wimbledon is about to start, Gauff is hoping everyone else can also forget what the top-ranked Sabalenka said in the wake of her loss to the American at Roland Garros.A day after dancing together on Wimbledon's Centre Court in a TikTok video, the two tennis players faced more questions on Saturday about the aftermath of Sabalenka's comments right after the final, when she said her loss had more to do with her own mistakes than Gauff's performance.The Belarusian later wrote to apologize to Gauff and said her comments were "unprofessional," but not before she faced some major backlash from fans and pundits—especially in the United States.

Gauff is trying to make sure the criticism stops."I'm not the person that will fuel hate in the world," said Gauff, who opens her Wimbledon campaign against Dayana Yastremska on Tuesday. "I think people were taking it too far. … It was just really targeting and saying a lot of things that I felt were not nice. I didn't want to fuel that more."Sabalenka, who faces Carson Branstine on No. 1 Court on Monday, said she hopes the TikTok video shows that all is well between the two."We are good, we are friends," the three-time major winner said. "I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now."Sabalenka reiterated that she never meant to offend Gauff."I was just completely upset with myself, and emotions got over me," she said. "I just completely lost it."

Gauff did acknowledge that she was initially tempted to hit back publicly at Sabalenka, who said the American "won the match not because she played incredible; just because I made all of those mistakes from ... easy balls."Gauff also said she was slightly surprised that it took a while for Sabalenka to reach out to apologize. But once that happened, the American was quick to bury any grudge."I preach love, I preach light," Gauff said. "I just want us to be Kumbaya, live happily, hakuna matata, and be happy here."

Mark your calendars.

Other players were also pleased to see the top two women's players getting along again."I'm happy to see that they turned the page about it," said Frances Tiafoe, who is seeded 12th in the Wimbeldon men's bracket. "That's the biggest thing, because they're the best players in the world. So those relationships you kind of need."Then the American added with a laugh: "But also it wouldn't be too bad if they were also back-and-forth. That'd kind of be cool if they kind of didn't like each other."

The third Grand Slam event of the 2025 tennis season is at hand as the best players in the world convene in London for The Championships at Wimbledon.

The 138 edition of the storied grass-court tournament takes place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

The top-ranked players automatically qualify for the main draw, which includes 32 seeded players in both the men's and women's pool. A total of 128 players comprise the field in each bracket. Play continues throughout the fortnight, with only one scheduled day off on Sunday, July 6. However, that day is frequently used to make up matches delayed or postponed by rain.

Here are the essentials to get you ready for Wimbledon 2025:

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament will begin on Monday, June 30, 2025 and be played over 14 days before concluding on Sunday, July 13, in London.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament will be broadcast on ESPN, ABC, and the Tennis Channel. Fans wanting to stream the action can watch matches on ESPN+ or Fubo.

Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is the two-time defending men's singles champion at Wimbledon and just won the French Open men's singles title for the second year in a row on the clay at Roland Garros. A three-peat would cement the 22-year-old Alcaraz with some of the all-time greats at the All England Club. Since the Open era began in 1968, only Roger Federer (2003-07), Pete Sampras (1993-95; 1997-2000) and Bjorn Borg (1976-80) have managed to win Wimbledon three years in a row.

On the women's side, Barbora Krejčíková of the Czech Republic is the defending singles champion after she outlasted Jasmine Paolini in three sets to become the second consecutive Czech winner. Markéta Vondroušová shocked the tennis world by becoming the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon when she prevailed in 2023.

Italian Jannik Sinner, the reigning Australian Open and U.S. Open champion is this year's top seed on the men's side at Wimbledon. That's despite losing to Alcaraz in an epic French Open final. Alcaraz is seeded second, followed by No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, and No. 4 seed – and hometown favorite – Jack Draper of the United Kingdom.

Aryna Sabalenka is the No. 1 women's seed ahead American Coco Gauff, who is the No. 2 seed despite beating Sabalenka in the 2025 French Open final. American Jessica Pegula is the No. 3 seed in the bracket.

Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff are among the WTA stars taking on Wimbledon, which gets underway this week.

Osaka has been drawn to face Talia Gibson in round one of Wimbledon, with WTA number two Gauff taking on Dayana Yastremska.

Andy Roddick has predicted an early Wimbledon exit for Gauff, who enters the tournament on the back of French Open success.

She defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the Roland Garros final earlier this month, although followed that up with an opening match defeat in Berlin.

Osaka lost in the French Open first round, and also lost her opener in Berlin before a round of 16 exit at the Bad Homburg Open.

The former world number one has now moved on to Wimbledon, where she discussed Gauff's French Open success in her opening press conference.

Osaka commented: “Oh, I mean, for me, I'm super proud of her. I remember I hit with her when she was quite young, but she's still young.

“But it was back when Key Biscayne was like in Key Biscayne, or Miami Open was in Key Biscayne, so that should tell you how young she was.

“But yeah, it's really cool, I would say, to see how much she's grown and it also, I guess, reminds me how much athletes can inspire people.

“And she inspires me a lot, and I hope that one day I can play as well on clay as she does, and I think it's really, really incredible how far she's come from what I first saw her.”

Gauff has indeed achieved huge success in her relatively brief career so far, with the 21-year-old now a two-time Grand Slam champion.

The American boasts 10 career titles in total, and is currently behind only Sabalenka in the WTA Tour rankings.

But Osaka ought to remember the stunning success she once achieved, which includes climbing to the top of the world rankings.

Furthermore, the 27-year-old is a seven-time WTA champion, with four of those titles involving Grand Slam success.

Currently ranked 53rd in the world, Osaka has played in four Grand Slam finals throughout her career so far, and has won all four.

And Osaka has met Gauff five times on the WTA Tour, with the latter posting three wins compared to two from the former.

Emma Raducanu continues to be asked about Carlos Alcaraz and their rumored romantic relationship that has stirred up online since it was announced last week the two would be teaming up for the newly formatted mixed doubles event at the U.S. Open later this summer.

However, the British tennis star denied the narrative once again.

In a press conference ahead of Wimbledon, which is set to start on Monday, Raducanu was asked if there was any truth behind the rumors.

She smiled and laughed at the question, but put it plainly: “We're just good friends.”

The 22-year-old and 2021 U.S. Open champion also answered a question about the pair last week in an interview with BBC and she has continued to be amused over the situation.

“But I'm glad the internet is having fun and we're providing some entertainment for everyone,” Raducanu told the outlet.

She explained that she and Alcaraz “go back a long way,” dating back to 2021. “We were like speaking and friends before anyone won anything.”

The two generated a lot of buzz when Raducanu went to support the Spanish star at the 2025 HSBC Championships in the mid-June tournament at Queen's Club in London during his semifinal match against Roberto Bautista Agut.

The 2025 French Open champion went on to the finals to beat Czech Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5), 6-2 to claim his second Queen's Club title.

After winning the U.S. Open as a stunning qualifier, Raducanu has had trouble finding consistency through various injuries and coaching changes in her young career. 

However, after making it to the fourth round of Wimbledon a year ago, she will look to find more success on the grass. 

On Tuesday, Raducanu will face fellow American Ann Li in the women's singles match at the Eastbourne International in a Wimbledon tuneup.

There was no hiding Naomi Osaka's frustration after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa at the French Open last month.

She had won the first set in a thrilling tiebreaker and battled for two hours and 21 minutes in front of an enthralled crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier. But ultimately she couldn't close out the match.

The 27-year-old struggled to speak in her news conference soon after.

"I feel like I should be doing better," she said with emotion in her voice. "I hate disappointing people. So, like, even with [coach] Patrick [Mouratoglou], I was thinking this just now, he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever [Serena Williams] to, like, 'What the f--- this is? You know what I mean?"

She quickly apologized for cursing before sitting back in her chair, and looked on the verge of tears. The moderator asked if she needed a minute to regain her composure. She agreed and left the room.

It would have been understandable if she didn't come back, maybe even expected during an earlier stage of her career, but Osaka returned soon after. When asked how the match would make her stronger, she wasn't sure, but she found a silver lining as she spoke.

"I feel like I learn little things from each match," Osaka said. "I think I lost the tiebreaker in Rome, and I didn't lose the tiebreaker here. So, I mean, I am conscious of things when I'm playing, so maybe the next match I play I'll learn little things from today."

According to Mouratoglou, who has been working with Osaka since September, she's done just that, and he is more encouraged than ever by what he's seeing as Wimbledon gets underway. Osaka has moved on fully from what happened in Paris. And despite having never advanced past the third round at the All England Club, Mouratoglou said Osaka is optimistic, and is ready for her first-round match against qualifier Talia Gibson on Monday.

As a former world No. 1 and a four-time major champion, the external expectations and attention remain high. It comes with the territory. But Osaka, Mouratoglou and the rest of the team aren't thinking about winning titles, although they do believe they will come again.

"For the last two years she hasn't won as much as she has in the past, and it can be difficult to deal with," Mouratoglou told ESPN on Thursday. "So I think at this point it's much better to not expect anything and focus again on what she can control and what she wants to achieve rather than on the outcome ... I'm not focused too much on the results, but more on the game and what she produces in terms of game. And that's important, and I really believe it because in the end, if you think about it, the result is just the reward for having done the job well. The results will come if the focus is on the right place."

After the match against the tenth-seeded Badosa, Mouratoglou said they sat down and discussed what happened -- what went wrong, why her level dipped in the second set, and why she made some of the decisions on court that she made. He believed the more they understood about the loss, the more it could benefit her in the long run.

He also understood that she desperately needed a few days away from tennis. It had been a long clay-court season, during which she played four tournaments and won her first title (at the 125K Saint-Malo event) since returning from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season. Osaka went home to Los Angeles and spent time with her almost-2-year-old daughter, Shai.

"I think that probably having [her daughter] will help her to get over her losses, being a mother," Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said last week. "I think that's a wonderful thing to have that in her life, and I think that [gives her] perspective."

That perspective is something Osaka has spoken openly about since returning to the tour. While she had struggled with her mental health prior to her pregnancy and had taken multiple breaks from competition previously, Shai has provided her with something else to focus her energy on, no matter how she has performed on the tennis court.

"Giving birth to my daughter changed my mindset a lot," Osaka told ESPN ahead of her comeback. "And it's also made me realize that my world doesn't have to revolve around me -- which might also be a little selfish too. I guess I've just found outer happiness and inner peace."

According to Mouratoglou, that attitude was on full display when a refreshed and reenergized Osaka came back to Europe to prepare for the ever-so-short grass-court season.

"This part of the season is so important and you really have to be fully focused," Mouratoglou, also the author of the just-released "Champion Mindset" self-help book, said. "If you're thinking about the tournament before, you're not really there. But I think she's really moved on. She's not thinking about Roland Garros at all."

Three weeks after her disappointment in Paris, Osaka was back on the court and playing at the Berlin Open. She lost to eventual semifinalist Liudmila Samsonova in another three-set thriller, but the team was encouraged by what it saw. Wanting to get more match experience on the surface before heading to London, Osaka then accepted a wild card for the Bad Homburg Open. In a tightly contested battle headlined by strong serving by both players, Osaka defeated Olga Danilovic 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) for her first grass-court victory of the season.

"I hope so," Osaka said after the match when asked if she was becoming a good grass-court player. "I mean, I think I have potential, but I don't know. Everyone is also really good, so I can never, I guess, take the wins for granted and [I'm] just super excited that I won today."

Mouratoglou was impressed by her ability to raise her level throughout, hold her serve and handle the break points. She lost 6-4, 6-4 in her match the next day against fifth-seeded Emma Navarro, but the team still deemed the week a success.

And most importantly, Osaka did too.

"She was very positive," Mouratoglou said. "And not fakely positive, because she's not. When she doesn't feel it, she doesn't say it or she would say something negative if she feels negative. So she's not someone who would fake it. But she said to me that she is really happy with how she is playing and that she feels that it's all going to click soon."

Mouratoglou admitted that it's been difficult at times for Osaka. Having been at tennis' peak earlier in her career, she has struggled over the years with her results and knows the expectations others have placed on her. She hasn't advanced past the third round at a major since she won the Australian Open in 2021, nor has she claimed a tour-level title in that span. She is currently ranked No. 53 in the world.

But there have been bright spots -- she reached her first WTA final in almost three years in Auckland this season before having to retire with injury, and she made the fourth round at the 1000-level events in Miami and Rome this year. And Mouratoglou believes Osaka has started to appreciate the journey and her own efforts.

"She's been No. 1 in the world, so to be No. 50 and having to be patient doing everything right, that's what she feels is difficult," Mouratoglou said. "But to be at the top of the game is very difficult, so this is just a [new] difficulty that she needs to accept, but I feel she does. I feel maybe she was not in the past month, but now she says to me, 'It's going to click, I just have to be patient.' And she is sure about it now."

Others have noticed her hard work and have seen flashes of her previous brilliance. After their match in Paris, Badosa praised Osaka's level and said, "Very, very soon she's going to be where she wants to be, for sure."

Evert believes she remains one of the best ball strikers on tour and lauded her hard work and fitness, but she thinks it's simply confidence that Osaka needs most to return to her previous glory.

"I think the No. 1 thing is, and I've watched her play a lot of matches where it's been very close, and she's not won those matches, and I think what she has lost a little bit during the time off was the belief, the belief on the big points, the belief in the big games when it's 5-all," Evert said. "Those shots, those golden shots were there for her taking when she was winning Slams for those couple of years, but that is missing. She can get it back. She can definitely get it back, but she'll need to win some more matches. She'll need to really break through and win these tight, tight matches that she seems to be losing now."

Mouratoglou doesn't disagree. He sees just how good and consistent Osaka can be in practice. and their priority is getting what he sees every single day on the practice court to translate in a match. He believes they are close.

While Osaka has gotten tough first-round opponents in several of her recent Slam appearances due to her lack of seeding, she has a relatively favorable matchup against Gibson, a 21-year-old from Australia playing in her first major main draw outside of her home country. If Osaka wins Monday, she would likely play No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic gold medalist in singles, in the second round. Zheng has won two of their three previous meetings, with both wins coming since Osaka's return, but grass is also Zheng's weakest surface. The winner of their match would not have to face another player seeded inside the top 20 until the quarterfinals.

In four career showings, Osaka has reached the Round of 32 twice (in 2017 and 2018). Last year, in her first time playing the tournament in five years, she reached the second round. But prior to the draw announcement, former world No. 1 and 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick said there was "no reason why she can't play well on grass" and sounded optimistic about her chances during a spot on the Tennis Channel.

Those around Osaka believe that as well. Although they don't mind the naysayers about her game on the surface. In fact, they believe the low expectations and her under-the-radar status entering the tournament can only benefit her.

And because of that, perhaps Wimbledon -- however unlikely that might sound -- might actually be the perfect place for everything to finally come together again for Osaka.

"We know there's less pressure for her to play well on grass," Mouratoglou said. "It's an opportunity to go there and play with less pressure and be able again to show what she's capable of and what she does in practice. We'll use that as motivation closer to [her first match] to make her feel lighter and be able to just focus on her game. The rest will follow."

Jannik Sinner is targeting Carlos Alcaraz's Wimbledon title after losing to the Spaniard in the French Open final

Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro have plenty in common. Both are incredibly successful tennis players in their early 20s, both have had deep runs at Wimbledon but want more, and both have focused almost all their tennis energy so far on singles.

At the US Open in August, they will play doubles together. On Friday, they spoke for the very first time in their lives.

"It was very unexpected to be honest," Italian world number one Sinner told reporters at the All England Club, when asked about the partnership. "I just met her on Friday for the first time. We'd never talked or texted each other."

This year's US Open mixed doubles is being held as a standalone event on 19-20 August before the hard-court Grand Slam begins on 24 August, a move by the United States Tennis Association which said it hoped would attract more high-profile singles players.

Sinner and Navarro are one of several eye-catching pairings who have been put together for the tournament where British number one Emma Raducanu and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz are also due to join forces.

The general presumption in doubles is that the better you know a person, the better you play together.

But Sinner and Navarro can take confidence from the examples of unexpected pairings going on to win slams.

For instance Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen won the 2016 Wimbledon mixed doubles title despite never playing together before the tournament and colliding with each other several times during the final.

"The tournament kind of wanted us to play together because certain teams were already set up," Sinner explained at Wimbledon, where he faces fellow Italian Luca Nardi in the first round on Tuesday.

"The choice was not big but I'm very happy to play with Emma. I told her already to not get frustrated with me for my not-very-good volleys."

He then joked: "I hope [we meet up] before the first time we walk out on court."

World number 10 Emma Navarro reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year

Sinner is a three-time Grand Slam singles champion having won the past two Australian Open titles and last year's US Open, but has never played a doubles match at a slam.

Australian Open and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Navarro, who also reached the US Open semi-finals last year, specialises in singles but has made several Grand Slam doubles appearances.

But she has never won a doubles match at the US Open.

Sinner is the world's number 589 in men's doubles whereas Navarro is ranked at 505 by the WTA.

A host of big names - including Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, Nick Kyrgios and Naomi Osaka - are also on the US Open mixed doubles entry list. Britain's Jack Draper is set to feature alongside Chinese world number six Zheng Qinwen.

Sinner predicted the new tournament will be "very exciting for the fans" and "the best singles players playing doubles is always something fun to watch".

Sinner is confident his decision to part with two core team members on the eve of Wimbledon will not affect his tournament chances.

He opted to move on from trainer Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio who had been employed by the 23-year-old since September 2024, helping him retain his Australian Open title in January and reach the French Open final in June.

"I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me," said Sinner. "I feel ready to compete. I feel free.

"We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. But I decided to do something different."

Sinner reached the quarter-finals of last year's Wimbledon where he was beaten in five sets by Russian Daniil Medvedev.

The Italian did not play a warm-up event after suffering a leg injury in the semis at Roland-Garros

Lorenzo Musetti is hoping that less proves to be more as he returns from injury at Wimbledon this fortnight.

The Italian has not played competitively since he was forced to retire in the fourth set of his semi-final with Carlos Alcaraz at Roland-Garros with a leg issue, but says he is ready to begin his campaign.

“I didn't play much, honestly,” he told reporters at Wimbledon on Sunday. “It's been tough, of course, after French Open to don't play any tournament before Wimbledon, to prepare the grass season. But the important thing is to stay healthy and to be healthy enough to play, so here we are.

“Basically I stayed without touching any racquet two full weeks, but the important thing was doing therapies and rehabilitation every day. Let's say I didn't take as a vacation the two weeks. 

“I worked hard as I could to be ready and to be fast enough to recover for be ready to be playing here. I arrived here on Monday, so let's say one week of training, which was a little bit not really one week because I was sick a little bit two days…but at least we are here. We finally are here and close enough to start and to debut.”

Having established himself in the top 10, Musetti is looking to take the next step at the majors by reaching his first final. And even if he doesn't have the miles of practice in his legs, he seems mentally refreshed.

“I wanted to be, let's say, more prepared for Wimbledon this year,” he said. “I have semi-final to defend. It's an important stage of the season, which I wanted to do great and to continue the great form that I showed in the last months.

“But I think also the positive thing is I spend some time with my family. So if I have to see the positive and the negative things, I will go more with the positive ones and try to spend time with the family, spend time with my closest friends, and enjoy a little bit of Italy, which was a long time since I was not going there.

“Hopefully this kind of time that I spend home, it's gave me an extra motivation to do well and to try to defend my semi-final here in Wimbledon.”

Among other things, the tennis world is also keeping a close eye on  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Emma Raducanu , for many believe the two youngsters are dating. They have known each other since 2021 and Alcaraz approached her to pair up with him when the US Open decided to hold the mixed doubles during the qualifying week.

Wimbledon starts on June 30. Raducanu will kick-start her campaign against compatriot Mingge Xu, whom she will be facing for the first time. In the pre-tournament press conference, when Raducanu was asked about the dating rumors with Alcaraz, she said: “We're just good friends.” That was the end of her press conference and Raducanu joked: “Way to wrap up (laughs).“

Alcaraz will be entering Wimbledon to defend his title for the second time. In the previous two finals, he upset 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. The Spaniard is also aiming to complete the Channel Slam for two consecutive seasons as before Wimbledon, he defended his French Open title by beating Jannik Sinner.

Raducanu, however, has never progressed beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon, reaching the stage in 2021 and 2024. Last year, Lulu Sun ended her campaign.

The Brit is still searching for her first title since her fairytale run at the 2021 US Open. Since that victory, the only time Raducanu was successful in winning four consecutive matches in a tournament was in this year's Miami Open, where she lost to eventual runner-up Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have ensured that tennis is in good hands after the Big 3. They have won the last six Majors, with Novak Djokovic being the last player other than them to emerge as a winner in a Grand Slam event (2023 US Open).

At Wimbledon, apart from Sinner and Alcaraz, Jack Draper too will be playing as one of the contenders. He has won one grass-court title (2024 Stuttgart Open) and this year, he lifted the Indian Wells Masters as well as reached the Madrid Open final (lost to Casper Ruud). During The Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast, Draper shared what changes he thinks Sinner and Alcaraz brought to the men's tour.

They've really set the bar for the next group of players who are kind of following in their footsteps. Tennis has become like a really aggressive power sport, and so the margins are getting smaller and smaller.

Draper is projected to square off against Djokovic in the quarterfinal, Sinner in the semifinal, and Alcaraz in the final. He has lost his only match against the Serb, while against the World No.1, the Brit holds a 1-1 head-to-head record. Draper has met the five-time Grand Slam champion six times, winning two of these matches.

But those guys are definitely stepped up after Rafa [Nadal], Roger [Federer], Novak, and, yeah, it's nice to be chasing them out like I have chased those other top ones. 100%, there's a pack of really, really good young players coming up who want to dominate like the ones before.

At Wimbledon, Alcaraz will kick-start his campaign against Fabio Fognini, while Sinner will play compatriot Luca Nardi. Draper will be facing Sebastian Baez.

Sinner has never played in the Wimbledon final, reaching the semifinal in 2023 (lost to Djokovic), while last year, Daniil Medvedev eliminated him in the quarterfinal. If Alcaraz and Sinner reach the final, they could set up a clash in a Grand Slam final for the second time.

Draper has never progressed beyond the second round of the grass-court Major, reaching the stage twice, in 2021 and 2024. Last year, compatriot Cameron Norrie ended his run.

 On 7 July 2024, Learner Tien and Nishesh Basavareddy were waiting to go on court for an ATP Challenger Tour final in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Sat together in the event's player dining area, they were watching the ongoing Grand Slam action at Wimbledon on TV. 

 Less than 12 months later and the longtime friends will, for the first time, be a part of the main-draw action at the grass-court major. Not only that, the two #NextGenATP Americans will face off in the first round on Monday in what will be a real pinch-me moment for both. 

 “We were playing at 1 p.m. and we were eating lunch right before the match,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com, when asked what he remembered about that final day at Bloomfield Hills. “I think Ben Shelton was playing. We were watching it, so it's pretty crazy that we are now playing here.” 



 It was Tien, competing in his first Challenger final, who prevailed that day in Michigan, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Both players have since risen more than 260 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings, and they capped their respective 2024 seasons with a debut appearance at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. 

 “I think it's cool, it's kind of a full-circle thing,” reflected now-World No. 67 Tien on being drawn against Basavareddy at SW19. “Last year, about a week from now, we played in what was the first Challenger final of my career. We were both ranked 300-something, and we were in the dining area watching Wimbledon. 

 "We were watching this event, and it's crazy to think that a year from then we are going to be playing first round here.”

 For many fans, a player hanging out with their opponent right before a final may seem like an oddity. Yet Basavareddy says it is not so with rivals such as Tien, against whom he has competed since they were kids in California. 

 “It's a little more common with your friends,” said the 20-year-old, who is now the World No. 100. “A lot of the guys you don't know as well on Tour. We warmed up together that day as well, so it was a strange day. 

 “It's a pretty unique draw, but it will be really fun. We played at like eight-and-under, 10-and-under, 12-and-under, so to finally be playing on one of the biggest stages in the world will be cool.” 

 Tien and Basavareddy have played only once more since Bloomfield Hills, last November at another Challenger event in Knoxville, Tennessee. Tien also prevailed on that occasion, but Basavareddy is hoping to quickly put his Challenger defeats to his friend behind him in order to make a positive start in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. 

 “I think our games match up pretty well,” said the 20-year-old. “We are both not the biggest servers, but we have a lot of baseline rallies. The matches last year were quite long, especially the first one in the final. He's a counterpuncher, he makes a lot of balls, and he's really smart out there, so he makes it tough on you. But we'll see how it goes.”

 While Tien would love to now transport his winning form against Basavareddy to Wimbledon, he won't be counting on his past Challenger successes against his fellow Californian as he looks to register his first major match win since his breakout run to the fourth round at January's Australian Open. 

 “I know that a lot of these guys, I'm going to be playing them a lot more in the future, so win or lose I don't think about it too much, I don't think,” said the 19-year-old when asked whether he felt making an ‘early statement' in a fledgling rivalry was important. “A match is a match. It doesn't carry so much weight.”

British women's number two Katie Boulter is among 50-plus home players at Wimbledon

Wimbledon 2025

Dates: 30 June-13 July Venue: All England Club

Coverage: Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.

If you want to keep tabs on all the British players at Wimbledon this year, it may need to be a multi-screen experience.

There are 23 Britons competing in the men's and women's singles at the All England Club - the most since 1984.

The home ranks exceed 50 when we add the doubles, wheelchair events and juniors.

With the grass-court Grand Slam tournament starting on Monday, here are British names and storylines to keep an eye on.

Seven of the British contingent have qualified directly through their world rankings, with players inside the top 100 guaranteed a spot.

It is only the second time this has happened since 2016.

United States-based college student Oliver Tarvet came through the qualifying tournament, while a further 15 players were handed wildcards.

Former British number one Dan Evans, 35, was notable on that list, while three teenagers - Mika Stojsavljevic, Hannah Klugman and Mimi Xu - were also given opportunities.

Wimbledon's wildcard committee considers a variety of factors - including ranking, form and previous grass-court results - when deciding recipients.

"We discuss what is right for the players and the event," British women's team captain Anne Keothavong, who is on the wildcard committee, told BBC Radio 5 Live.

"We're fortunate to have a British Grand Slam and it is in everyone's interests to support British players where we can.

"Where we can give British players opportunities and expose them to the highest level of tennis, we would like to do so."

Having 14 players inside the world's top 200 - the most since 1984 - shows Britain's growing depth of talent.

Multiple factors have contributed to this improvement.

These include Andy Murray's success inspiring the youngsters, a national tennis centre in Roehampton providing state-of-the-art training facilities, and players - notably Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley - developing in the US college system before turning professional.

British women's number three Sonay Kartal says watching friends and peers enjoy success has also helped.

"I'd say [the higher number of top-200 players] is a mix of things, there's not one specific reason," said Kartal.

"We've got a lot of good sparring partners when we're back home and we're all pushing each other. I think there's a healthy rivalry and that adds to it."

Jack Draper, ranked fourth in the world, leads home men's singles hopes.

The 23-year-old Englishman has become a title contender following a stunning rise over the past 12 months.

No British player has been seeded as high as Draper since world number one and defending champion Andy Murray in 2017.

Draper is one of 13 Britons in the men's singles, with Fearnley, Norrie and Billy Harris also earning direct entry.

Wildcard Evans became emotional on the eve of Wimbledon when he discussed his recent struggles.

How Draper became a genuine Wimbledon contender

The former world number 21 briefly slipped out of the top 200 this year but has justified his wildcard with recent eye-catching victories over top-20 players Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

"It's not the matches, it's when you feel like you've let people down, that's the tougher thing about it," said Evans.

Further wildcards went to Jay Clarke, Oliver Crawford, George Loffhagen, Johannus Monday, Jack Pinnington Jones, Henry Searle and Arthur Fery.

The home contingent increased when Tarvet - who cannot claim full prize money because of US college system rules - became the first British man to come through qualifying in eight years.

Emma Raducanu will capture plenty of attention as she looks to build on last year's run to the last 16.

Raducanu, 22, has regained her position as the British women's number one.

Generally looking happier and more relaxed, the 2021 US Open champion has reached two WTA quarter-finals and returned to the world's top 40 - but she does not "expect much" at Wimbledon after a difficult build-up.

Katie Boulter has fallen to 43rd in the rankings.

The 28-year-old remains a threat on grass with her big-striking game but has drawn Spanish ninth seed Paula Badosa in round one.

"I'm very, very excited," Boulter said. "I feel like it's a totally different situation for me coming in this year.

"I'm kind of like a dark horse and I like that feeling. I like the fact I can go out and swing free and I've got nothing to lose."

Kartal is the third British woman with direct entry, having climbed almost 250 ranking places since her Wimbledon debut last year.

Established players Jodie Burrage, Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson were also given wildcards.

Queen's champions Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash are bidding to become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles since 1936

The British doubles scene - particularly the men's side - remains in rude health.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have emerged as the standout British pairing this year and the third best in the world.

In their first full season together, Cash and Glasspool have won three ATP titles - including back-to-back at Queen's and Eastbourne.

Such form places them among the favourites for Wimbledon, with men's doubles proving fruitful for home players in recent years.

Reigning champion Henry Patten, who made his breakthrough alongside Cash before the pair split two years ago, will look to defend the trophy alongside Finland's Harri Heliovaara.

Neal Skupski won his first Slam title at the All England Club in 2023 and is looking for another with fellow Briton Joe Salisbury, whose major-winning CV is only lacking his home tournament.

In the women's draw, Olivia Nicholls is the lone British seed after enjoying a fine season with Slovakian partner Tereza Mihalikova.

The pair won their first WTA title by shocking French Open champions Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani in the recent Berlin final.

In the wheelchair events, Alfie Hewett defends the men's singles he won last year to complete a career Grand Slam.

Gordon Reid, champion in 2016, also has direct entry, with Ben Bartram and Dahnon Ward receiving wildcards.

Lucy Shuker and Cornelia Oosthuizen - Britain's leading two women - also received wildcards, as did Greg Slade to join fellow 2024 Paralympic silver medallist Andy Lapthorne in the quad wheelchair draw.

LONDON (AP) — Carlos Alcaraz's first match on a grass court came just six years ago.

He's obviously a quick study.

When Wimbledon gets started Monday, the 22-year-old from Spain will play in the first Centre Court match of this fortnight, an honor reserved for the previous year's men's champion. The contest against Fabio Fognini will open Alcaraz's a bid for a third consecutive championship at the place.

That's something only four men have achieved in the Open era, which began in 1968: Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Not bad company.

Alcaraz already is 5-0 in Grand Slam finals, which includes going 2-0 at the French Open — which he won three weeks ago via a comeback from two sets down against No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the final — and 1-0 at the U.S. Open.

Last year, the No. 2-ranked Alcaraz became the youngest man to win a major trophy on each surface: grass, clay and hard courts.

But he's got a fondness for the green stuff.

“The most beautiful tennis that we can watch is on grass. The style that the people bring to the court when they play on grass. ... The sound of the ball,” said Alcaraz, who will go into Monday on a career-best 18-match winning streak, including a title at the Queen's Club tournament last weekend. “The movement is really tough, but when you get it, it's kind of (as though) you're flying.”

He loves that it allows him to show off the variety in his game and all of the skills he possesses.

Few players smile as much as Alcaraz does while in the thick of things, no matter what challenges might be presented by the foe across the net or the tension of the moment. He is as creative as it gets with a racket in hand, sometimes to his own detriment, and admits enjoying seeing replays on arena video screens after some of his best deliveries (that technology isn't used at the All England Club, but perhaps it should be).

“I really want to hit slices, drop shots, going to the net all the time, playing aggressively,” said Alcaraz, who said he lost to two-time Wimbledon champion Andy Murray during a round of golf early in the week. “I think on grass it's the style that you have to play, so that's what I like the most.”

It's instructive to hear what Djokovic had to say about Alcaraz after a straight-set loss in last year's final at the All England Club.

“He just was better than me in every aspect of the game,” Djokovic said. “In movement, in the way he was just striking the ball beautifully, serving great. Everything.”

Those words carry weight. Djokovic has won seven of his men's-record 24 Grand Slam trophies at Wimbledon but was the runner-up to Alcaraz in 2023 and 2024.

When it comes to the idea of joining an elite group by completing a three-peat in two weeks' time, Alcaraz insisted that isn't the sort of thing he really cares about or spends time considering.

He wants the title, yes. But where it would place him in history? Leave that to others.

“I really want to lift the trophy,” Alcaraz said. “But right now, I'm not thinking about who I could join if I win three Wimbledons in a row.”

With Wimbledon set to begin Monday, John McEnroe believes the American men are closing in on winning a major title.

No American man has won a Grand Slam trophy since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. Pete Sampras was the last American man to win Wimbledon – in 2000.

But the U.S. enters the fortnight with four men ranked in the Top 13 in the world: No. 5 Taylor Fritz, No. 10 Ben Shelton, No. 12 Frances Tiafoe and No. 13 Tommy Paul. They are among 14 American men in the Top 100 in the world.

Fritz is coming off winning his fourth Eastbourne title, one of the warm-ups to Wimbledon played on grass. Fritz defeated fellow American Jenson Brooksby 7-5, 6-1 to extend his record for the most men's singles titles won in Eastbourne.

“I definitely think that we're closer than we've been in quite a while,” McEnroe said this week on an ESPN conference call with reporters. ESPN will broadcast Wimbledon beginning Monday.

“We're closer than we've been in 15 years.”

In recent years, several American men have gone deep into majors.

Last year, Fritz beat Tiafoe in the U.S. Open semifinals to become the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009, and the first at the Open since Roddick in 2006.

In the final, Fritz lost to Italian Jannik Sinner in straights sets in a jam-packed Arthur Ashe Stadium where the crowd included Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, Jon Bon Jovi, Matthew McConaughey and Noah Lyles.

Fritz, who opens Monday against huge-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, has never been past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.

Shelton reached the Australian Open semifinals this year and the U.S. Open semis in 2023. He lost in Melbourne to Sinner, who improved to 15-0 against Americans in majors.

Shelton had his best finish at Wimbledon last year when he reached the fourth round.

Tiafoe has twice reached the U.S. Open semis, but also has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon (2022).

Paul advanced to the Australian Open semis in 2023 and the quarters at Wimbledon a year ago, where he lost in straight sets to Carlos Alcaraz.

The biggest problem for the American men – actually, the two biggest problems – are Alcaraz and Sinner. They have combined to win the last six major titles and show no signs of letting up.

They have apparently picked up where the "Big 3" left off. Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer combined to win 66 major titles, depriving many other players, including all the Americans during that era, of winning majors.

“I think that some of it was we just assumed that [American men winning majors] would keep happening in the early 2000s [after Sampras and Andre Agassi], and then when we realized that it wasn't, that all of a sudden legends came in... Federer, and Nadal [and] Djokovic,” McEnroe said. “Then the more countries putting more resources into it. We were sort of falling behind.”

He added: "In terms of who we have, Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, Francis Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka. They're all sort of the same age. I think it's good when you have people pushing each other….

“Now, Shelton has come along. He's an interesting story. He's more like the type that I have been pushing. Don't focus all in it at 10 years old. Maybe play some other sports for a while. Go to college potentially. Mature as an individual. I think that's starting to make an impact in terms of our consistency.”

On the women's side, two Americans have won both majors this year, with Madison Keys capturing her first Slam crown at the Australian Open and Coco Gauff winning an epic battle over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to become the first American woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win Roland Garros.

“On the women's side you have the two Grand Slam winners already this year are American, Madison and Coco,” 18-time major champion Chrissie Evert said. “You got Jessica Pegula who reached the finals in the U.S. Open. So American tennis, both men and women joined together, has never looked so good.”

While older tennis fans will cite the days of John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg as the golden era, the sport had another renaissance around the 2010s.

No fan of the sport will ever forget the exhilarating 2008 Wimbledon final where, after rain breaks stopped play, and it got so dark visibility was poor, Spaniard Rafael Nadal beat world number one Roger Federer.

It was almost uncanny that (arguably) the greatest players of all time were active during the same epoch, with the 'big four' - Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray - all battling it out at the same time.

After Federer and Nadal retired in the early 2020s, the tennis landscape lost some of  its lustre: how could it ever reach the dizzying heights these respectful rivalries brought to the game?

However, not all is lost: now a young array of Gen Z tennis aces are bringing some sizzle back to the courts again, with their thrilling games and glamorous off-court lifestyles (including a rumoured romance between two players).

The French Open last month saw a nail biting five and a half hour match as Carlos Alcaraz come back from three match points down to beat World No. 1 Jannik Sinner. And that's not the only news swirling around Alcaraz: he is rumoured to be in a relationship with fellow player Emma Raducanu - best known for winning the US Open in 2021, at the tender age of just 18.

So it seems tennis is back with a bang, and here are some the players making it sexy again, ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on June 30 and will run through to July 13.

Coco Gauff 

US tennis champ Coco Gauff, 21, was named one of Time's Women Of The Year for 2024.

The young tennis sensation won her first slam - the US Open - in September 2023, making her the highest-paid female athlete in the world at the time, according to Sportico.

As a Black woman and tennis player, Coco has said she is especially proud of her success.

'Being a Black woman, in a sport that isn't as diverse as others are, it definitely means a lot to me,' she previously told Time Magazine. 

She added that as she grows older, she's embracing her role in the world, saying: 'There's always going to be change needed in this world. I hope I can play a small part,' she said.

The prestigious list was curated by Time editors, who said they looked to 'extraordinary leaders working toward a more equal world' and 'trailblazers fighting for a more equitable future.'

'The 12 women on our 2024 list are pivotal figures from across the globe who have dedicated themselves to lifting up others as they rise,' the article read.

Emma Raducanu

Emma Raducanu shot to global prominence in 2021 when she won the US Open at just 18-years-old - a victory she has since spoken about as playing a role in causing stress and performance anxiety.

However, she has been playing at a top level, and will no doubt be a big draw for many when it comes to Wimbledon (though she has her work cut out for her, facing some very tough opponents in the early rounds of the prestigious tournament).

As is inevitable when it comes to very famous sports stars, 22-year-old Emma has been at the centre of romance rumours with another player - Carlos Alcaraz. The two are US Open champions - after Raducanu won in 2021, Alcaraz picked up the trophy a year later - and are good friends, growing up together on the tour.  Emma finally addressed the rumours surrounding her off-court connection with Alcaraz very recently. 

The pair are due to partner in doubles at the US Open in August, but speculation about a possible bond beyond the tennis court has grown after Raducanu was seen supporting the Spanish star at the Queen's Club Championships earlier this month. 

Raducanu was seen supporting Alcaraz last Thursday and Saturday, sparking talk around Queen's that there might be ‘something going on between them', as the pair were spotted laughing and joking together and arriving at the venue just minutes apart. 

Their most recent link-up came this week, with Alcaraz being confirmed as the latest global ambassador of Evian ahead of Wimbledon - the tournament's official water supplier since 2008. Raducanu also works with Evian, her collaborative work starting after she became the hottest property in British sport by winning the US Open in 2021, which led to her signing lucrative deals with the likes of Nike and Christian Dior.

During a press conference, Raducanu was inevitably asked about the romance rumours, to which she smiled and said: 'We're just good friends.' 

Carlos Alcaraz  

Alcaraz, 22, will have the eyes of the world on him as he embarks on his Wimbledon campaign on the tail of an 18-match winning streak, including victories at the French Open and on the grass at Queen's.

Having lifted the famous Wimbledon trophy twice, he insists he's not getting distracted by the prospect of becoming only the fifth man to win three Wimbledon titles in a row. The Spaniard could join icons Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to complete a hat-trick if he can triumph on Centre Court once again. 

‘I really want to win the title, I really want to lift the trophy,' Alcaraz has said. ‘Right now, I'm not thinking about who I could join if I win three Wimbledons in a row. I am just thinking I want to be ready and to prepare myself in the best way. I feel a lot of confidence.'

Meanwhile, off court, the player have been besieged with rumours that he is dating his sometimes doubles partner Emma Raducanu - who has said the two are 'just friends'.

Despite the denials, sports marketing expert Tim Lopez, CEO of TLNT Global, says if the romance was genuine, it would catapult both players into the stratosphere.

'From a brand positioning profile and marketing perspective, it would be an absolute dream. They would be a good example of where one plus one makes three.'

They would be hugely 'complementary', he adds. 'They would join ranks of other famous power couples such as Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, or, outside of tennis, the likes of Becks and Posh.'

Jack Draper

With a current ATP ranking of number four, Draper has everything to play for as he prepares to take part in Wimbledon.

He has a tough draw - should he get through to the quarter final, he will potentially face Novak Djokovic, who has amassed a record-breaking number of slam titles during his career.

Draper was suffering with a hip injury earlier this year, but by March, he revealed he was feeling much better.

He said at the time: 'At the start of the year I was struggling a bit, but my body feels good now. I feel really strong in every area of my game.'

Speaking on Saturday, Draper, who enters Wimbledon as the fourth seeded player, discussed the prospect of filling Andy Murray's shoes as the focus of Brit tennis fans, and the man who will carry with him the hearts and hopes of millions every time he steps on to Centre Court.

‘When Andy retired they said I was next in line,' said Draper, who was 27th in the world when Murray called it quits. ‘I didn't really think about it then but I have improved so much and put myself in this position.

‘Andy has been incredibly successful and has become adored by the nation. They are obviously big shoes to fill, I'm aware of that. At the same time I'm confident in myself that I can inspire people like Andy has done.' 

Taylor Fritz 

Taylor Fritz will start his Wimbledon having won the Stuttgart Open title on June 15 (with a 6-3, 7-6 win against German player Alexander Zverev).

The American athlete will no doubt be hoping to go further in the tournament this year, after admitting he felt 'hurt' after crashing out in the quarter final in 2024.

He lost that match 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to Italian Lorenzo Musetti.

Taylor took to Instagram to share his feelings about the tournament, writing: 'All love Wimbledon.

'Tough match yesterday, always hurts to come up just short but that's part of the game. Now all I can do is rest up, get back to work, and have a good flight home,' he added. 

After winning Eastbourne yesterday, with a 7-5 6-1 victory over fellow American Jenson Brooksby, Taylor has now won seven of his eight matches on grass this year.

The world Number 5, who was last year's US Open runner-up, will no doubt now be eying that Wimbledon trophy. 

Commenting on the upcoming slam after his Eastbourne victory, Taylor said: 'I'm going to be ready to go. I'd much rather go into the tournament with confidence and a title.'

Tennis star Danielle Collins has teased Emma Raducanu after she dismissed speculation about a possible romantic relationship with Carlos Alcaraz.

Raducanu and Alcaraz are accustomed to the limelight, but have sparked even more gossip since deciding to team up for mixed doubles at the forthcoming U.S. Open. While Raducanu's immediate attention is on her opening Wimbledon match against British compatriot Mimi Xu this Monday, she was asked about her rapport with Alcaraz during a media briefing.

The 22-year-old quickly quashed suggestions of a budding romance. However, American tennis player Collins couldn't help but share Raducanu's succinct reply on social media and make a joke at the former U.S. Open champion's expense.

In the lead-up to Wimbledon, Raducanu faced the press and was quizzed about the authenticity of rumors connecting her with Alcaraz in a romantic sense. The question came after the two stars were seen together in an Evian ad shoot.

"We're just good friends," Raducanu replied. Following her comment, a journalist humorously suggested that it might be the perfect note to end the press conference. "Way to wrap up," laughed Raducanu.

Collins, who is gearing up to take on Colombia's Camila Osorio at Wimbledon this Tuesday, couldn't resist joining in on the fun. She replied to a snippet of Raducanu's press conference on Instagram with mock outrage. "Brutal! ! @emmaraducanu such a heartbreaker," Collins wrote, accompanied by a laughing emoji.

Raducanu and Alcaraz are set to light up the U.S. Open as a formidable pair in a star-studded mixed doubles lineup this August. The young Spanish sensation, fresh off clinching his fifth Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros, is all geared up to join forces with Raducanu on the iconic courts of Flushing Meadows.

"She's gonna be the boss," Alcaraz joked. "Yeah, I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have really good relationship with her.

"So it's just gonna be interesting. You know, obviously both, you know, we are gonna enjoy, for sure. I will try, you know, to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun."

Alcaraz revealed he had made a "special request" to team up with Raducanu and admitted that she initially left him hanging before giving an answer. However, Raducanu has since explained the reason behind her delay.

"Gotta keep them on their toes!" she quipped. "I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision."

Through their collaboration, Raducanu will aim to capture another major victory at Flushing Meadows, building on her stunning teenage success story from the 2021 U.S. Open singles championship. As a result, Raducanu is on high alert for the challenge posed by 17-year-old wildcard Xu at Wimbledon.

The British star and former U.S. Open champ is no stranger to Xu's playing style, having shared the court with her in practice sessions before their upcoming first-round showdown at the All England Club. "I think it's a very dangerous match, very difficult. Mimi is a really, really good player. I've practised with her a few times," Raducanu said in a press conference.

"She has a lot of weapons. She also moves really well. It's going to be a really different match. For her, it's one where there's nothing to lose. I remember when I had my first Wimbledon here and I was 18. It's a great feeling. You just feel, like, completely fearless."

Madison Keys has voiced her concerns about the current political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, suggesting it has had a negative impact on global kindness.The American tennis star, who won the Australian Open this year, is set to face Romanian player Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round of Wimbledon on June 30. However, before she attempts to break through the quarter-final barrier, she expressed her struggle to remain optimistic during Trump's second term in the White House.

"It's definitely a tough time, and it's hard to balance where you want to be informed and know what's going on, but at the same time, it's crazy," she said. These comments were made during a discussion about her non-profit organisation, Kindness Wins. The foundation, launched in 2020, aims to promote access to tennis courts and positive character development among young athletes. Keys acknowledged the challenge of staying informed about national issues without letting the turmoil distract her mental focus as a top-level athlete. "Sometimes it's hard to shut it off enough that you don't pull your hair out," she admitted.

"But also not being oblivious to what's going on and the realities of everything. It's definitely difficult at the moment."

Trump has come under fire for a series of controversial policies, from his stern stance on Iran to stringent immigration controls that have sparked nationwide protests. Over 17,200 individuals were deported in April alone, as per the latest statistics from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The US President is also facing intense scrutiny over his dealings with Canada, in addition to his proposed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' – a move potentially slashing various social programmes whilst carving out new tax reliefs. Meanwhile, Keys' philanthropic efforts are making waves. Her foundation has been busy refurbishing facilities like the JV Morris Tennis Center, reflecting its ever-growing influence in both digital realms and grassroots communities.

In a bid to foster youth development, her #KindnessWinsDay campaign in 2024 granted a £3,600 to the Denton Johnson Tennis Program in Central Florida – just one of many ventures her foundation arms are extending to uplift the nation's children.

"Tennis has always given me a safe space to grow and find who I am," declared Keys. "I want to make sure that's available for more kids who might not have that opportunity otherwise."

On the tennis court, Keys' talent continues to shine brightly. She is ranked sixth in the world heading into Wimbledon. Keys has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals twice, first in 2015 and then in 2023, when she was beaten by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

But it was 2025 that marked a turning point in Keys' career when she triumphed at the Australian Open in January. Toppling giants like Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, Keys clinched her much-deserved maiden Grand Slam title. That victory occurred just weeks after Trump resumed office in January. Regardless of how far she progresses in Wimbledon, Keys remains dedicated to her mission both on and off the court.

Prior to arriving in London for Wimbledon, the last time Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka shared a court was in the 2025 Roland Garros final. That ended with Gauff winning a three-set thriller to claim her second major singles title. Following the match, Sabalenka‘s press conference comments picked up a lot of traction, as fans believe she was downplaying Gauff's victory over her.

The world No. 1, Sabalenka, repeatedly expressed her disappointment for playing so poorly in a final, and not handling the windy conditions well. She even went on to argue that if Iga Swiatek had beaten her in the semifinals, Swiatek would've certainly defeated Gauff in the championship match. Sabalenka apologized, but her comments were immediately characterized as distasteful and dismissive of Gauff, the world No. 2 player, who has three straight wins over Swiatek.

While everyone was criticizing Sabalenka, calling her a sore loser, it was Gauff who was extending her grace. The 21-year-old sensation obviously disagreed with the comments, but she made it clear she didn't take them personally. She gave her frequent opponent the benefit of the doubt, understanding how emotional one can be after a devastating loss.

On Friday, Gauff showed how she didn't take the comments personally at all, collaborating with Sabalenka for a couple of TikToks as they shared the court with each other while preparing for Wimbledon.

Making two separate videos, Sabalenka shared one of the two doing a choreographed dance, with the caption, “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together.” The video Gauff shared was of the two lip syncing a Kim Kardashian audio saying, “Ok guys, we're back. Did you miss us? Cause we missed you.”

Gauff shared that video with a caption that read, “The olive branch was extended and accepted! We're good, so you guys should be too,” making it clear there's no beef between the two tennis stars.

While there isn't a beef, fans would love to see them meet in the Wimbledon final, as they are still the two best women's tennis players in the world. That's evident when they are on the court together, having a head-to-head record of 6-5 in Gauff's favor.

Both of Gauff's majors came with wins against Sabalenka in the final, and they could be on pace to meet in another final with Wimbledon starting on Monday. But for now, TikToks.

LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian legend Novak Djokovic agreed that Wimbledon could offer his best chance to claim a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title.

While attending the pre-Championships press conference on Saturday, the 38-year-old was asked if he believed this year's Wimbledon could be his best chance to win the 25th Grand Slam title and could it be his last dance at the grass-court Grand Slam this year.

"Whether it could be my last dance, I'm not sure, as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next," said Djokovic prior to his 20th appearance at Wimbledon.

"My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. That's the goal, but you never know at this stage."

"And yes, I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play in Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level," the seven-time Wimbledon champion continued.

Djokovic ranked Wimbledon "maybe the most consistently successful Grand Slam for me in the last 10 years", as he reached six finals in the last six editions of the tournament. He won four titles consecutively before being beaten by Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years.

"I don't chase the rankings anymore. I'm trying to play the best tennis in Grand Slams and trying to win Grand Slams. That hasn't changed," he said.

Djokovic reached the semifinals at both Australian Open and US Open this year. "I think I still played a decent level of tennis that showed me that I can still play on a very high level at the later stages."

"That's what is also giving me an extra motivation to keep going. Obviously clay court probably slightly less chances to win comparing to grass," he added.

The sixth-seeded veteran will face Frenchman Alexandre Muller in the opening round. If he reaches the semifinals, he could meet world No. 1 Jannik Sinner who defeated him in the French Open semifinals earlier this year.  ■

Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria

‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli

It was a fight between the McLaren drivers during Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring, with Lando Norris beating Oscar Piastri to the win.

Lando Norris returned to winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix after getting the better of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a head-to-head scrap for victory – title rival Max Verstappen having been eliminated in a first-lap incident.

Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed.

After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race.

While Piastri lit up the timesheets in phases across the second and third stints, Norris had just enough pace in hand to hold onto P1 and take the chequered flag – marking his third win of the season and first victory since last month's Monaco Grand Prix.

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton.

George Russell was the sole Mercedes finisher in fifth, with rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli dramatically running into Verstappen under braking for Turn 3 on the opening lap – eliminating both drivers from the action. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race.

Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber's Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion.

A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas.

Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine.

Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line.

Colapinto came close to contact with Piastri in the closing stages of the race when the McLaren man was putting a lap on him, an incident that earned the F1 returnee a five-second penalty but did not impact his finishing position.

Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid.

Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying.

Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh.

As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs.

There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. “The car is stuck in first gear,” the Spaniard said over the radio, before he eventually drove off while Race Control abandoned the start.

Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”.

When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris.

As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen's car – putting both drivers out of the race.

“I got hit like crazy,” a sweary Verstappen rued over the radio, as Antonelli admitted he simply “lost the rear”. With the Dutchman and Italian debriefing at the side of the track, the Safety Car was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track.

On Lap 3 of 70, Bernd Maylander peeled back into the pits and released the remaining 17 drivers – Norris handling the situation well to hold the lead over Piastri, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell and Gasly, with a fast-starting Albon up to seventh.

“Lewis just closed the door under braking,” argued Russell over the radio after a failed move on the seven-time World Champion for fourth at Turn 4, with several drivers engaging in battle but no more incidents occurring for the time being.

Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. “Your call on the racing situation,” came a follow-up message from the Australian's race engineer.

With Gasly's soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. The Frenchman would soon come under pressure from Bortoleto, Lawson and Alonso in the remaining top 10 spots.

On Lap 11, the lead battle kicked off again when Piastri used DRS to grab the lead from Norris into Turn 3. A lock-up at the apex left the door ajar, though, and Norris duly reclaimed P1 with a switchback on the run to Turn 4, where Piastri snatched a brake once more.

As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris' gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate?

Elsewhere, Bearman, Gasly, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Colapinto were all early stoppers as tyre strategies began to play out, while Williams' day went from bad to worse when Albon was called back to the pits to retire amid apparent technical trouble.

Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way.

“Let's see your pace in free air now,” was the message to Piastri, who opted to continue on his way rather than immediately respond to Norris – albeit with a sizeable flat spot. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed.

Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions.

As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri's engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. “The manoeuvre in Turn 4 with the front lock-up was too marginal,” he warned.

Splitting the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton, fourth-placed Lawson and fifth-placed Alonso were now the only drivers yet to pit. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6.

Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. That forced the Japanese driver back to the pits for a new front wing, while Colapinto tumbled down the order.

It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. “I have no grip... I'm about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure.

Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach.

With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Leclerc sat around 14 seconds further back in third, from Hamilton, Russell and squabbling Kick Sauber pair Bortoleto and Hulkenberg (who had charged forward with that early stop and some undercutting). Haas duo Ocon and Bearman were eighth and ninth, with Gasly – who was losing ground amid ongoing issues – circulating in 10th.

Lawson and Alonso sat just outside the points following their stops, but with the prospect of making up some places as rivals pitted for a second time, while Hadjar, Colapinto, Stroll and the penalised Tsunoda brought up the rear.

Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate's advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He's mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic.

Norris gained a bit of breathing space a few laps later when Piastri ran wide at Turn 1 and clattered the kerbs, while Hamilton's hopes of cutting the gap to team mate Leclerc and challenging for a podium were dented by a similar mistake at Turn 3.

With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don't want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least.

Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at 3.5 seconds, with a potential grandstand finish in store.

However, Piastri's efforts to cut Norris' lead were hampered by traffic. With Colapinto and Tsunoda battling for position at Turn 3, the Argentinian wildly cut back across the track and forced Piastri onto the grass – earning him a five-second penalty.

From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto's feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate's championship advantage to 15 points.

Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian's maiden F1 points finish.

Hulkenberg and Ocon were the final points scorers in ninth and 10th, from Bearman, Hadjar, Gasly and Stroll, with the penalised Colapinto and Tsunoda the final classified drivers at the end of their bruising afternoons behind the wheel.

As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz's double elimination.

“It was a tough race, pushing the whole way through – tricky, hot, tiring – but a perfect result for us a team,” said Norris. “A 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I'm very happy. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that's for sure. It was a lot of fun – for me a lot of stress, but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar. Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. He was still quick, so it was good fun.”

F1 will travel directly from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix over the weekend of July 4-6. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria

‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

Good things come in small packages, an aphorism of which you are constantly reminded staring out across the Red Bull Ring and down into the valley below.

This Mighty Mouse of a circuit never fails to deliver drama, and thanks to a Q3 spin for Pierre Gasly and consequent yellow flag, we have a grid for the Austrian Grand Prix that – other than perhaps Lando Norris on pole – isn't quite that which may have been predicted.

Oscar Piastri starts third behind Charles Leclerc, and the progress made by Ferrari's Austria upgrade was further underlined by Lewis Hamilton, starting fourth. Liam Lawson is carrying the flag on Red Bull's home turf, starting P6, one place above Max Verstappen.

Chris Medland picks out five key things to keep an eye on when the lights go out for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

From Lando Norris in dominant form to Ferrari showing signs of progress, and from a rookie chasing his first points to track limits being a major talking point, here are a five things to keep an eye on when the lights go out on race day at the Red Bull Ring…

Lando Norris arrived in Austria in a slightly tough spot, having collided with team mate Oscar Piastri last time out in Canada and losing further ground in the drivers' championship.

But it was only slightly tough because the Red Bull Ring is a track where Norris has been particularly strong in the past, securing his first podium in F1 here back in 2020.

Lando Norris and McLaren set the pace in final practice at the Red Bull Ring as drivers began to test the limits before Qualifying.

Lando Norris remained at the top of the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, fronting a McLaren 1-2 over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Norris worked his way down to a best time of 1m 04.324s on soft tyres to edge out Piastri by 0.118s, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

Several drivers had wide moments and brushes with the gravel traps, including championship leader Piastri, who spent a few minutes in the garage midway through the session while mechanics checked for damage to his floor.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and World Champion Verstappen experienced slightly bigger scares, going for full 360 spins at the final corner but avoiding any barriers, while Yuki Tsunoda dropped his Red Bull exiting Turn 1.

Uma Thurman is the matriarch of a starry family. With her ex-husband Ethan Hawke, Thurman shares two children who are finding significant success in the film and television spheres. Maya Hawke has gained recognition for her roles in “Stranger Things,” “Asteroid City,” and “Wildcat,” in addition to releasing three albums as a singer/songwriter. Levon Hawke also appeared in “Wildcat,” as well as “Blink Twice,” “The Thickett,” and “The Crowded Room.” Both have recently dipped their toes in off-Broadway shows — Maya in “Eurydice” and Levon in “Ghosts.”

 










Thurman told Seth Meyers on June 24 that she is so proud of her children (which also includes 12-year-old Luna), and that she is enjoying watching them ascend to the top echelons of the industry that made her famous.

“As a mother, you know, honestly, I'm so proud of them and they're so together, and honestly, seeing your kids kind of surpass you is awesome,” she said (via People). Meyers said that he wouldn't describe them as having “surpassed” her, but Thurman said that she thought “they're amazing.”

 










“I think they're so talented. And so you're always anxious that the circumstances all support the best outcome. The only thing that makes me nervous is I want them to have the best circumstances,” she explained. 

Thurman herself has been busy recently. Starting July 11, she will co-star in the revival of “Dexter” on Paramount+ with Showtime, and on July 2, Netflix will drop “The Old Guard 2,” in which the star returns to the action genre that buoyed her career with the “Kill Bill” films. Thurman told Jimmy Fallon on June 17 that she didn't have any training when she stepped into her “Old Guard” role.

“Oh, if only I could have trained,” she said. “No, I came on to do it kind of at the end. So I had no training. I was like, ‘Oh, yeah, a sword. I think I hold it like this.'” She added that co-star Charlize Theron was a big reason why she signed on for the film. “This one seemed different [from other action movies she was offered] because in ‘Old Guard 1' — Charlize was just so epic in it. And so I thought, ‘Well, I could go do this for her in that. Where she's kind of taking the genre there. I'll go support her and fight her and battle her out.'”

Vin Diesel surprised a crowd on Saturday at FuelFest in Southern California, saying that the final film in the Fast & Furious franchise will hit theaters in April 2027.


	Diesel, who has starred in all but one installment since 2001's original, broke more news during his remarks onstage, confirming the film will be set in Los Angeles and that it will reunite Diesel's Dominic Toretto character with Brian O'Conner, the character played by Paul Walker.


	Walker starred with Diesel in the original and appeared in five installments before he was killed in a car crash in November 2013 at age 40.

	











	Diesel previously had taken to his social media channels to urge Universal Pictures to date Fast X 2, the follow-up to 2013's Fast X which grossed $700 million-plus at the global box office. The sequel has been billed as the final film in the franchise.

	He had previously touted that the film should be set in Los Angeles, like in the the original film. Earlier this year, in the aftermath of the devastating L.A. wildfires, he said keeping the production in town was vital.


	“Los Angeles needs it now more than ever… Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago… and now Fast will finally return home,” he wrote. “All love…”


	There are currently no major films on the April 2027 release-date calendar. Notably, the most successful film in the franchise, 2015's Furious 7, was the only pic in the franchise to open in that month; it was the biggest opening frame for any F&F film with $147.2 million, on its way to a global gross of more than $1.5 billion.

Fast & Furious 11 releasing on April 2027 according to Vin Diesel at FuelFest -Brian O'Conner will return and reunite with Dom-Franchise heading back to L.A.-Return to car culture/street racinghttps://t.co/84RgtMpAmehttps://t.co/FuWwwRaLwN pic.twitter.com/UDZPaAGhb8

When “American Idol” season 23 winner Jamal Roberts performed in Atmore, Alabama, on June 14, 2025, he shared on social media how touched he was when the mayor presented him with a key to the city — an honor that many cities bestow on visiting celebrities and dignitaries. 

But when Roberts performs at the Blac & Noir Event in Laurel, Mississippi, in early August, he won't be accepting the same honor. On June 27, the R&B singer spoke to fans via Facebook Live to address a firestorm of controversy that had erupted over plans to present him with a key to the city during his concert. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

During his Facebook Live, Roberts said that his upcoming show in Laurel, located minutes away from his hometown of Meridian, has been “booked forever.” Roberts said he'd heard nothing about being given a key to the city until June 27, when local event organizer Drake Paige posted on Facebook that Mayor Magee had approved the special honor.  

But his announcement was met with swift opposition from some in Laurel who took issue with Roberts receiving a key to the city, arguing that residents who have given back to the community in various ways have not received similar honors. The comment section quickly grew heated, many more people have posted, and Roberts said he'd been notified of death threats made against him. 

“You have people sharing the post, making threats, talking about they'll have guns at the event,” the former P.E. teacher said, adding, “I worked with kids before ‘American Idol' and it's crazy that … kids can comprehend (how to behave) more than grown folk. It's a sad world we live in.” 

In the comment section of Paige's post, Roberts wrote, “Although I am appreciative, I did not ask for it, but I am thankful.”

“I don't want it, respectfully,” Roberts further clarified in his video. “You can have it. Tell them I'm appreciative, but I politely decline.”



The tradition of civic leaders handing out “keys to the city” to esteemed visitors dates back to medieval times, when cities surrounded by walls with giant gates, according to Brown University. In modern times, a non-functioning key is given to symbolize that a trusted, 

Many people have shared encouragement for Roberts on social media amid the controversy, and disappointment over all the negativity, including one person who wrote, “Some of you all are about to break a record, THE MOST HATERS, UNDER ONE POST!!!”

Another wrote, “Omg. People just can't find anything else to worry about in their life. This is ridiculous. Like you say a key is not going to stop your journey. Keep reaching for the top. God got you.”

Laurel has a population of less than 17,000 but is well known as the locale of HGTV's hit show “Home Town” starring Erin and Ben Napier. It is also the real-life hometown of multiple celebrities including actress Parker Posey, NSync member Lance Bass, opera singer Leontyne Price, blues singer Sam Myers, and Olympic Gold Medal track star Ralph Boston. 

Toward the end of Roberts' June 27 Facebook Live, he said he'd been in Los Angeles working on new music all week. Despite the bump in the road with Laurel, he said the first single from his upcoming album would be a song that serves as his ode to his home state of Mississippi. 

“I'm (gonna) dedicate a song back to the state,” Roberts said. “That's gonna be my first record. My first record I'm gonna drop is gonna be a song back to the to the state. Tell them how appreciative I am. You know, people just don't expect good things to come out of Mississippi no more, and when they do, they don't know how to handle it.”

[Editor's Note: The following article contains spoilers for “Squid Game” Season 3, Episode 6, “Humans Are…”]

Unlike a different show that also happened to premiere this week, “Squid Game” didn't return from its breakout first season with a slew of famous new guest stars. Writer and director Hwang Dong-hyak had ample opportunity to cast just about anyone he wanted in Seasons 2 and 3, considering the seemingly limitless reach of Squid Game's organizers and the hundreds of new contestants brought in for the 34th competition (as well as the off-screen budget increase given to Netflix‘s global smash hit). But, despite enlisting plenty of Korean stars for the final episodes, “Squid Game” never turned into a celebrity-spotting game of its own; it wasn't inviting audiences to point at their televisions every few minutes, like the Leonardo DiCaprio meme from “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” as plenty of other blockbuster sequels do. (Hwang did have his eye on Leo, though.)

So as the series finale ticked down toward its closing credits, there was no reason for fans to expect a cameo — especially from two-time Academy Award-winning actor, Cate Blanchett. But there she is, playing ddakji in a Los Angeles alley against a dude who's clearly down on his luck, since she's busy slapping the absolute shit out of him.

 










What gives? Well, even with proper context, the meaning behind Blanchett's appearance is a matter of minor debate. To set the stage, “Squid Game” Season 3 ends with the Front Man, Hwang In-ho (Lee Byung-hun), traveling to Los Angeles to deliver Seong Gi-hun's (Lee Jung-jae) personal effects to his daughter (including Gi-hun's remaining winnings, which In-ho took from their hotel hiding place and loaded onto a bank card). After dropping off the money and game uniform, the conflicted Front Man drives away.

Then, stopped at a red light, he hears a familiar sound. In-ho rolls down his window and looks into the alley, where a man in ragged clothes is playing ddakji with a woman (Blanchett) in a pristine gray suit. To fans, it's immediately clear what's happening: The woman is a Squid Game recruiter, and she's got a potential new player on the hook.

The mark loses the round, she looks at him, shrugs, and then slaps him across the face. While he's doubled over from the blow, the woman looks toward the street and sees In-ho watching her. His expression is static — ambiguous — but she recognizes him (or, at least, something about him) and smiles. Then the man challenges her to another round, she says, “As you wish,” and goes back to her game.

In-ho finally reacts, but he doesn't give away much. He looks down, either in contemplation, disgust, or a mixture of both. Then the window rolls back up, and he drives off. The camera swings away from his car and back to Blanchett, as she wins another game. One last slap lands right as scene cuts to black.

 










To some viewers, the cameo hints at how Netflix may choose to continue “Squid Game.” Perhaps a new season or spinoff series will focus on an American version of the games, with Blanchett's character playing the part of a pivotal recruiter. So far, the narrative has only acknowledged the South Korean edition, but now we're left to wonder how many there are and who else is running them. In theory, Netflix could greenlight a new “Squid Game” spinoff based in different territories around the globe.

But Hwang Dong-hyak (via Netflix) has only spoken about Blanchett's cameo as an ending to the original series.

“We thought having a woman as a recruiter would be more dramatic and intriguing,” Hwang said to Tudum, the Netflix-owned blog. “And as for why Cate Blanchett, she's just the best, with unmatched charisma. Who doesn't love her? So we were very happy to have her appear. We needed someone who could dominate the screen with just one or two words, which is exactly what she did.”

Hwang added that Blanchett was “amazing at playing ddakji” and “successfully flipped the ddakji on her first try.” But regarding its meaning beyond the series finale, well, he doesn't go there. (One can assume the Netflix-run website probably isn't pushing the director to give a firm answer on future plans, but he also told The Hollywood Reporter, “I think the story ended in a manner where it doesn't need a further story to be told.”)

 










“Personally, I interpret it as, despite all of the noble efforts of so many people, the world still continues as it was before,” Hwang said to Tudum, adding it's “truly an ending that fits the [show's] name.”

On this point, I have to agree. Part of “Squid Game's” broad appeal is that its anti-capitalist message is so widely applicable. Prior to the cameo, its ending is rooted in the idea that the rich and powerful (wherever they live) treat the proletariat as expendable pieces of entertainment, and they'll keep doing exactly that until their power structure falls apart. Gi-hun's last words, right before he sacrifices himself to save an innocent baby, include, “We are not horses” — a direct address to the billionaires who've been betting on the Squid Games, demanding they recognize their shared humanity with the players. Even though he can't complete his final sentence — declaring, before he dies, whether humans are good or evil — his death speaks to the hope Gi-hun maintains for the future.

Naturally, the continued existence of the Squid Games, despite our hero's extreme efforts to end them, is a more cynical take on what's next, and seeing the disillusioned Front Man come face to face with an expansion of the games — right here in America, the bastion of unchecked commercialism — only doubles down on the series' downer outlook. But there's no reason to think the games will be different — or that they'll end differently — just because they're being held somewhere else. Until capitalism's oppressive grip on society ends, the Squid Games can't either. 

 










That's the ending Hwang came to, that's the lesson he wants to leave us with, so that's how we should remember it. Rather than pretend Blanchett's cameo opens the door for a different, more hopeful conclusion — continuing a story, via Season 4 or an American spinoff, that's meant to be seen as a vicious cycle — let's see the epilogue for what it is: a punctuation mark, not a tease. 

“Squid Game” is available on Netflix.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


Prime Video's decision in early June to ditch Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino's classical ballet themed dramady Étoile after just one season sent shockwaves through the high-end drama community.


	Cast members Yanic Truesdale, Taïs Vinolo and Ivan du Pontavice put on a brave face as they touched down at the SCAD Lacoste Film Festival in France's Provence region this past week for a screening and Q&A, which was arranged prior to news of the non-renewal.


	“Of course it's a bummer, but at the same time, we're here to celebrate the fact that it existed,” said Franco-Anglo actor Pontavice.

	He plays hot-headed French dancer Gabin Roux in the drama about two world-renowned New York and Paris ballet companies that decide to collaborate and share dancers to save their financially-struggling institutions.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're just celebrating the experience. We like to tell tales about how it happened, our experience, it still feels very fresh. It just came out and we're still very excited about being a part of it,” he added.


	Canadian actor Truesdale, who plays ballet instructor Raphaël Marchand and right-hand man to Le Ballet National director Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), echoed these sentiments.


	“I'm taking it as a last celebration of the show,” he said of the SCAD screening. “One of the things I said in many interviews is that this was the one job in 36 years on which I made the most friends. At a human level, the fact that we won't be able to hang out on set anymore is a big disappointment.”

	











	Truesdale. who is a long-time Palladino collaborator through his role as Michel Gerard in Gilmore Girls, expressed regret that the show had not been renewed for a second season. 


	“I was very excited to see the second season because knowing Amy and Dan's writing, they set things in the first season, and then the second season, once everything is established, is really, when they start to fly with the material,” he said.


	He joked wryly that he had considered launching a GoFundMe, when asked whether he thought there might be potential partners out there who could salvage the show.


	Per Deadline's exclusive break on the non-renewal, the writing was on the wall for Étoile, after it failed to make it into Nielsen's weekly Top 10 for Originals on its release April 24, and also only briefly topped Prime Video's own top 10.


	Vinolo, who plays Mishi Duplessis, a U.S.-trained French ballerina who is sent back to Paris against her will, suggested the cancellation was indicative of the challenges facing the real classical ballet world, which were explored in the short-lived show.


	“It's all about the money and no longer about the art. It's like in the ballet world too. Ballet has been here for so long, but a lot of ballet companies that have potential cannot show that potential because of the financial aspect. It's very sad. This show did such a good job at showing that,” she said. 


	Pontavice also suggested that contemporary audiences were no longer prepared to persevere with a show if it does not engage them immediately.


	“Even myself, if I watch a something, and I'm not invested after a couple of episodes, I quit watching it,” he said, adding that audiences would have been prepared to invest more time in getting to know a show a decade ago. 


	Quizzed on what the legacy of the show, Truesdale pointed to its message around how the arts are under attack.


	“I always reluctant to make predictions about anything,” he said. “I never thought Gilmore would be still alive 25 years later but for me, this show is a love letter to art. I was hoping that love letter would be received on the other end, because I feel like art is under attack in America, and without art, we lose the essence of being human. For me, that's a very important message, and hopefully that's the legacy.”


	Vinolo highlighted the show's representation of the ballet community, even if the characters will not get a longer story arc.


	“All the characters are so different, with different sensibilities… even if there is no second season, the show achieved a lot in terms of representation and identity,” she said.


	Portavice believes the first season will have a long tail: “Despite the disappointment and cancellation, judging by the positive reactions I've seen online in a very short amount of time, it's had a huge impact in certain communities already.


	“So even if we don't get that season two, I actually think that in a couple years people will look back to the show, and enjoy a lot of the things in it. It might take time, it might be slow for people to really get into it, but I think it's there to stay and to grow.”

The Formula One racing pic starring Brad Pitt is the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films and had no trouble topping the chart as the 'M3GAN' sequel went up in flames.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


Apple Original Films‘ critically acclaimed F1: The Movie is off to the races. 


	The Formula One movie — directed by Joseph Kosinski of Top Gun: Maverick fame and starring Brad Pitt zoomed to an impressive $55.6 million domestic opening and an estimated $144 million globally, well ahead of expectations in the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films. Friday's haul alone was in the $55 million-$57 million range, well ahead of expectations and including a hefty $10 million in previews.




	Warner Bros. is distributing and helping Apple to market the big-budget summer tentpole, whose worldwide start includes a foreign opening of $88.4 million. Its global bow supplanted World War Z's $112 million to mark the biggest worldwide launch of Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation. F1 has a huge advantage in having a lock on Imax screens until Superman opens July 11. (On Friday, 58 percent of ticket sales were for premium auditoriums). One major caveat: the movie sports a hefty production budget of at least $200 million before marketing, so it will need to keep the pedal to the metal in the weeks ahead if it is to make its money back.

					How 'M3GAN 2.0' Star Violet McGraw Kicked Off a Wave of Good Fortune for Blumhouse		
			









F1, starring Pitt opposite Damson Idris, is a seminal moment for Apple as it tries to jump-start its theatrical ambitions after getting driven off the road with big-budget misses Killers of the Flower Moon, from Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. Kosinski's pic boasts near-perfect exit poll stats from the audience, an A CinemaScore score and strong reviews.


	In the film, Pitt plays an injured former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to team up with a younger driver, played by Idris. Javier Bardem stars as the F1 team owner who orchestrates the scheme. Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score for the movie after working with Kosinski on Top Gun: Maverick. Veteran producer Jerry Bruckheimer also worked on the big-budget pic alongside Pitt's team at Plan B. 

	











Taking on Formula One is a bold move since it has never been the marquee sport in the U.S. that it is overseas (top Apple exec Eddy Cue is a lifelong fan and sits on the board of Ferrari NV). In 2013, the wheels flew off of Ron Howard's F1 movie Rush, which topped out at $26.9 million domestically and $97 million globally. F1‘s is also pacing well ahead of the racing pic Ford v. Ferrari, a biographical action drama set against the backdrop of Europe's famous Le Mans endurance contest. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that film opened to a decent $31.5 million.


	Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton was brought aboard to produce FI alongside Hollywood vet Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, Pitt and Pitt's partners at Plan B, including Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. 


	Elsewhere, Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's horror pic M3GAN 2.0 flamed out with an estimated domestic opening of $10.2 million, only good enough for a fourth-place finish. The pic limped to $3.4 million on Friday from 3,112 cinemas in North America, including $1.5 million in previews. The Universal release had been forecasting a $20 million debut, which would still have been $10 million less than the first film's record $30.4 million record launch in January 2023, on its way to earning $117.7 million domestically and $226.3 million globally.


	The pic's global start was an equally disappointing $17.2 million. The sequel cost a modest $25 million to produce before marketing, but that's still more than double M3GAN‘s miniscule $12 million budget. 

	











Jason Blum‘s Blumhouse — which has suffered a string of misses this year — and James Wan's Atomic Monster reteamed to make the follow-up. They had hoped the movie would serve as counter-programming for younger women who have to interest in F1. While M3GAN 2.0 skewed 53 percent female, simply not enough of the target audience showed up. (Some have groused that the character has turned too Terminator-like, while the story overall is more sci-fi than horror.) In an ironic twist, the sequel earned a B+ CinemaScore, compared to a B for the first pic.


	Universal puts up the money for Blumhouse titles, in addition to marketing and distributing, but leaves creative decisions up to horror maestro Blum, the studio's longtime partner.


M3GAN 2.0 is set two years after the AI doll went on a murder spree to protect her young human charge (Violet McGraw) and was subsequently shelved. Her creator (Allison Williams), the aunt of the young girl, is now a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of AI. But when another AI creature emerges that is even more dangerous, M3GAN is resurrected and mayhem ensues. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returned to direct the sequel from a story he wrote alongside Akela Cooper, and based on characters created by Cooper and Wan.


	Actors Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return alongside McGraw and Williams, while franchise newcomers include Aristotle Athari, Timm Sharp and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement.

	











	Not all is lost for Universal as the live-action How to Train Your Dragon as it cleared the $200 million mark domestically. Now in its third weekend, the DreamWorks Animation-produced pic came in second place with an estimated $19.4 million for a North American tally of $200 million and $454.4 million globally.


	Pixar and Disney's troubled summer event pic Elio tumbled as much as 49 percent to 50 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $10.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $42.2 million. The animated title added another $11.4 million overseas for a foreign cume of $30.1 million and $72.3 million against a net budget of $150 million.


Elio came in third domestically, followed by M3GAN 2.0 and Sony's 28 Years Later, which likewise fell off sharply in its second weekend to an estimated $9.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $50.3 million. Globally, the dystopian zombie pic cleared the $100 million mark, something 28 Days didn't achieve, although the first movie was much more of an indie film.


	Like Universal, Disney wasn't entirely bereft as summer live-action hit Lilo & Stitch crossed the $400 million mark domestically and $946 million globally in a massive feat. It's only the second movie of the year so far to cross the $400 million mark domestically behind A Minecraft Movie.


Lilo, the live-action update of the beloved Disney animated film, opened over Memorial Day weekend opposite Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, which finished Sunday with a global haul of $562 million for Cruise, Paramount and Skydance.

Donald Trump threatened to force journalists to reveal sources who leaked a Pentagon intelligence assessment that concluded the U.S. air strikes on Iran only set the nation's nuclear program back “months,” contradicting administration claims that the facilities were “obliterated.”


	“You tweeted the Democrats leaked an intelligence [report],” Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo said to Trump in an interview.


	“They should be prosecuted,” the president responded.


	When Bartiromo asked “who, specifically” should be prosecuted, Trump did not name any names but said his administration would demand reporters reveal the sources of their reporting.


	“We can find out. If they want to, we can find out easily. You go up and tell the reporter, ‘National security, who gave it [to you]?' You have to do that, and I suspect we'll be doing things like that,” he said.

BARTIROMO: You tweeted that Democrats leaked intelligenceTRUMP: They should be prosecutedBARTIROMO: Who specifically?TRUMP: We can find out. You go up and tell the reporter, 'national security, who gave it?' You have to do that. And I suspect we'll be doing things like that.


	Demanding reporters reveal confidential sources is a dangerous path that could quickly escalate to prosecuting reporters who refuse to disclose them. 

	











	Both CNN and The New York Times ran stories that undermined the administration's narrative, citing an assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon's intelligence arm, that found the bombings sealed off entrances to two targeted facilities but left the underground buildings intact. Prior to the attacks, the DIA believed Iran was potentially three months away from making a nuclear bomb. After the attacks, it estimated the program had been set back less than six months. The report additionally stated that Iran had relocated a significant portion of its enriched uranium to classified locations before the U.S. attacks. Iranian officials have publicly stated that the uranium was moved before the strikes.

	











	Trump and the White House, however, have publicly claimed the mission was a “spectacular military success” that “completely and totally obliterated” key nuclear enrichment facilities and uranium supplies.

	On Fox News, Trump said that Iran couldn't have moved its uranium because it would be “very hard to do” and the uranium was “very, very heavy.”


	“I think, first of all, it's very hard to do. It's very dangerous to do,” Trump said. “It's very heavy, very, very heavy. It's a very hard thing to do. Plus, we didn't give much notice because they didn't know we were coming until just, you know, then.”

BARTIROMO: Do you think the Iranian regime hid some of the enriched uranium before the strikes?TRUMP: No


	Since the leak of the DIA report's conclusions, Trump has doubled down on his claims Iran's nuclear capabilities were destroyed and vented his increasing frustration that not everyone is buying his narrative. He has called the reports “fake news,” accusing the media outlets of having “[made] up a phony story to get some hits.”


	“The bomb went through [the nuclear facility] like it was butter, like it was absolute butter,” Trump said.


	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that the Department of Defense has launched “a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes, battle damage assessments.”


	“They did obliterate it, it turned out,” Trump told Bartiromo, insisting Iran's nuclear capabilities were destroyed. “We had to suffer the fake news with the fake news of CNN and The New York Times, [which were] saying, well, maybe it wasn't as good as Trump said. Maybe it wasn't totally obliterated.”


	“It turned out, no, it was obliterated like nobody's ever seen before,” he continued. “And that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.”

	Since the strikes, Trump has called for Israel and Iran to make peace. “We basically have two countries that are fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” he said last week, frustrated that the two sides have not brokered a deal to stop the escalation.


	Trump is eager to claim victory in Iran and end the fighting, perhaps because he has his eye on snagging himself a Nobel Peace Prize, a longtime obsession.

SUNDAY AM: It's a win for original movies. It's a win for racing car movies. It's a win for the Zack Van Amburg- and Jamie Erlicht-led Apple Original Films on the big screen, and it's another win for Warner Bros, which has showed under the Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy regime that original event movies can be launched. 


	Apple Original Films' F1 via Warner Bros is opening to $144M worldwide and $55.6M domestic.


	Said Head of Worldwide Video Van Amburg: “F1 has inspired audiences around the globe with its underdog story and perfect blend of high-octane racing and human-centered storytelling. The film's outstanding debut reflects both the excitement of Formula 1 and the deeply emotional and entertaining story crafted by the entire cast and creative team. Their dedication and innovation have fueled an unforgettable cinematic experience.”Head of Worldwide Video Erlicht added: “We're thrilled by the global response to F1 and grateful to the audiences who've embraced the film with such enthusiasm. This success is a testament to the vision of Joe, Jerry, Brad, and Lewis, along with the efforts of the entire cast and crew. Together with Formula 1, they've created an inspiring cinematic journey that captures the energy and spirit of the sport.”

			Watch on Deadline		







	Overall, F1 has been a four-year track for Van Amburg, Erlicht and Head of Features Matt Dentler, who put this massive movie together, a collaboration with Formula One shooting at live races around the world.


	For those cynics wondering why F1 didn't move the odometer past it's already overindexed $55M, we're in a 10-day holiday stretch, dummies. The fantastic buzz is out there on this Brad Pitt movie, and now everyone wants the best Imax or PLF seats in the house, so they'll wait. No one wants to sit in the first two rows. Plus, there's plenty of times to go to the movies.


	“Like a perfectly tuned F1 car, the Apple and Warner Bros. teams mounted a theatrical marketing and distribution plan that will be a blueprint for others, studios, and streamers alike, to follow moving forward and much like a crackerjack pit crew their strategy, executed with balletic precision, resulted in a successful launch while simultaneously delivering a great moviegoing experience,” said Comscore Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian, “Most importantly, “F1 The Movie‘s release took a risk and cracked the elusive code on how to take a motorsports-themed movie and take it mainstream while demonstrating to Apple and other streaming-centric companies that a theatrical release represents (for the appropriate film) a branding bonanza and prestige-building opportunity that has no peer.”

	While studios like Universal will tubthump their tentpoles through myriad tentacles of their entertainment vertical, Apple promotes its movies and series to those who own some of the 2.2 billion Apple products.


	Read, for F1 the $3 trillion company introduced the first-of-its-kind haptic trailer for iPhone, a means of marketing that has rival studios jealous. The trailer used the Taptic Engine, a component inside the handset that creates tactile feedback. The trailer was timed to key moments in the trailer from the rumble of car engines to Pitt's seat buckle.


	There was a themed F1 keynote at this year's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC25), Apple's biggest annual event, with a special screening and convo between the movie's producer Jerry Bruckheimer and Apple's Eddy Cue.


RELATED: ‘F1' Producer Jerry Bruckheimer & Adam Sandler's Happy Gilmore Announce First-Round Picks At NHL Draft In Los AngelesApple Pay offered movie ticket discounts. Apple Retail Stores came alive with special appearances by CEO Tim Cook and Pitt, alongside interactive sessions with the movie's artisans and curated in-store displays.


	Apple Maps gave moviegoers a deeper dive into Formula 1, exploring the iconic Grand Prix racetracks featured in the film. F1 was pushed on Apple Music, Apple Podcasts as well as Apple Fitness+, with a set of fast-paced new workouts inspired by the film.


Warners dropped the first teaser on July 7, roughly a year ahead of the movie's release, in a partnership with Formula One. Foreign appeal on this movie was always there given the greater popularity of the racing sport abroad. But how do you even get domestic audiences in the car? Particularly the heartland? Similar to how Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick related the ups and downs of fighter pilots, the F1 campaign as sold on the idea of triumph and the underdog overcoming. Also accessibility. F1 stunts were never a velvet rope event, but made available to all, i.e. DHL Worldwide sponsored an “unboxing” of the cars in New York City's Times Square timed to the pic's premiere there two weeks ago. More F1 for the people included Pitt dropping in at an Imax screening in Austin to 400-plus fans. Media for F1 was pushed to the NASCAR fans as well at races like the Daytona 500.


	In addition to Apple and Formula One roaring their engines for F1, there were 33 global promotional partners. Total worldwide media value was north of $100M-plus. iHeartRadio pushed the pic's soundtrack to markets like Nashville, raising its profile. Other partners included Mercedes-Benz, T-Mobile for movie ticketing, Heineken and KFC, the latter having its biggest promotion ever on a Hollywood movie.


	Mexico has been a big global stop for Warner Bros' movies' Sinners and A Minecraft Movie and was again for F1, where footage was shown from the movie, content creators gathered along with Pitt in attendance. Pitt, a la Tom Cruise and Dwayne Johnson, left no stone unturned in promoting this movie around the world.


	In regard to those on the production, promoting the film on social, RelishMix gave props to F1 producer/Formula One champion driver Lewis Hamilton, who has been talking about the movie to his 55.8M fans. Co-star Damson Idris has also been active about the movie with his 2.4M fans.The social media convo on F1 is running positive with both racing and action movie fans praising the promise of this movie. The driving scenes featured in the trailer are exciting viewers, with director Kosinski seemingly bringing the same rush he brought to fighter jets in Top Gun: Maverick to racing in this film. Sample comments: “It really looks AWESOME. I cannot wait to see the movie. Brad Pitt and F1 will be EPIC!” and “These camera angles looking fire.” Its connection to the real F1 racing community is enticing many longtime supporters: “I spotted Fernando Alonso in the trailer,” and “I can't wait. Apparently, Lewis Hamilton is a producer and trying to make it as real as possible.”











Huge thanks to @LewisHamilton and the entire cast and creative team for putting such heart and purpose into the film. Can't wait for everyone to experience F1 The Movie. https://t.co/MjcF0LnETJ


	Kosinski used a new type of Imax digital cameras to shoot the movie, creating miniatures that were fastened to the Formula One cars. The movie was promoted to be seen in all large formats. Imax screens cleared $12.8M, repping 23% of the North American debut from just 414 auditoriums, becoming the eighth film in Imax history and third year-to-date to achieve 20%+ indexing. F1 is booked in Imax for two weeks (not three, as we reported).


	Meanwhile, Universal/Blumhouse's M3GAN 2.0 got run over by F1, but not because she decided to step on the track. Less than the release date, her tanking here with $10.2M has more to do with the movie being more campy and less fearsome. 


	Total box office per Comscore is $127.5M, -18% off from a year ago, when there was the third $57.5M weekend of Inside Out 2, the $52.2M opening of A Quiet Place: Day One, and even Kevin Costner's Horizon doing $11M. However, the 2025 box office year stands at $4.1 billion, raging +15 ahead of the Jan. 1-June 29 period of last year.

SATURDAY AM: No need to change tires here, because Apple Original Films' F1 via Warner Bros is still zooming around the track with a massive $140M global opening we hear, not only the best ever for the streamer that embraced theatrical, but also a record start for a Brad Pitt movie ahead of World War Z‘s $112M global launch. 


	How that breaks out (no pun intended): $85M overseas debut and $55M 3-day. Note rivals are seeing F1 going off course to $56M-$58M. There's bound to be more gas in the tank today for F1 with hot audience exits A CinemaScore here (the second back-to-back for producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joseph Kosinski who landed an A+ on Top Gun: Maverick), 5 Stars PostTrak at 92%, and an amazing 78% definite recommend, the most powerful odometer as far as moviegoers' reactions go. Stand up and applause once again for Warner Bros in launching an original movie post Sinners, something they've been masters at with Argo, the Christopher Nolan movies, etc. Great films find their way through the noise. Pitt's Plan B and Lewis Hamilton are also producers here on F1. 












	With $25M on Friday alone stateside, F1 is just $100K shy of being Pitt's best opening day at the box office. World War Z posted $25.1M back in 2013; that movie at the domestic B.O. still the Oscar winner's best debut at $66.4M. F1 looks to be second. 


	Stateside, PLFs and Imax are driving 58% of F1 with Imax alone contributing 25%. Huge. Remember that whole stigma about moviegoers turning their noses up at racing car movies? Throw that out the car window: 40% of the audience went because it was a racing car movie, while 35% went because it's a Pitt movie. Just like Bruckheimer brought Pirate movies back from the dead, racing movies have been revived under his watch with F1 opening higher than Ford v. Ferrari‘s $31.4M domestic opening. It's also ahead (unadjusted for inflation) of the Bruckheimer produced Days of Thunder from 1990 which opened to $15.4M and topped out at $82.6M U.S./Canada, $157.9M WW.


F1 is playing evenly from coast to coast, but strong in the South Central, Mountain and West. AMC Lincoln Square is the top grossing venue in NYC with close to $119K. The young-ins are still heading to the track here for F1 with 29% between the ages of 13-24. Over/under 35 is 53%/47%. Diversity demos are 52% Caucasian, 23% Latino and Hispanic, 11% Asian American and 10% Black. 


	Yes, yes, we teased that Universal/Blumhouse's M3GAN 2.0 was going to run F1 off the course three weeks ago with a $30M+ opening, however, tracking didn't have its gears greased. Quite often franchise movies come on strong on tracking in total awareness versus originals (this always happens, remember what happened with Sinners?). However, M3GAN 2.0 is powering down to a $10.4M opening. Though she has a B+ CinemaScore, higher than her first B, nobody is making a date to play with M3GAN 2.0. Interesting enough, audience exit at 84% is higher than critics' Rotten Tomatoes at 58%; the latter putting the doll up on the shelf this time around after a 93% critical score for her first 2023 chapter. From the few who decided to go, M3GAN 2.0 has a 62% definite recommend on PostTrak, which isn't bad at all. Still, no one wants to have a dolly tea party with M3GAN 2.0. 


	In regards to why M3GAN 2.0 isn't seducing, some may want to blame the release date given that F1 is pulling in 38% women. However, there's always room in the marketplace for female counterprogramming. This was a complete rejection by the fans for the second go-round of this gimmick movie. No scares were sold to pull audiences in; just more camp which you could see in the marketing (street posters were emblazoned with ‘Hey Queens'). The response from exhibitor screenings was that the doll was a redux of Terminator 2.  


	Though social media universe reach was +27% above other horror franchises with 263M according to RelishMix, there was negative word of mouth with “some taking umbrage with the look of the titular character, ‘That face looks CG, I liked the last one which was kind of a mask, and a mix of familiar and unfamiliar,' and, ‘Is it me or did the graphics get worse?' Meanwhile, some are already hedging their bets, sharing, ‘A movie which you know how exactly it's gonna play out.' As well, ‘Changing genres was a grave mistake.  The box office will reflect that.'” 


	Any battery life for M3GAN 2.0 is in the East, South and South Central. AMC Burbank outside LA has the best gross in the country with $21K so far. Female leaning at 53%. Women and men over 25 are the leading demos at 34% a piece (note F1 brought in 27% women over 25). 18-34 rep 54% with 25-34 the biggest age demo for the movie at 32%. Caucasian 46%, Latino and Hispanic are 24%, 18% Black, 6% Asian American. 


	Nancy will have more on international in a bit, and the heat wave that's going on in Europe (apparently moviegoers there unlike New Yorkers don't flee to the movie theaters for the A.C.).

FRIDAY AFTERNOON: F1 is accelerating right now to a $55M+ opening at 3,661 theaters with potential for upside. It's by far the biggest opening ever for an Apple Original Movie on the big screen, miles ahead of Martin Scorsese's 3-hour, 26-minute Killers of the Flower Moon ($23.2M opening, $68M final domestic). Friday alone for F1 is right around Killers of the Flower Moon‘s 3-day. 


	Right now, the Jerry Bruckheimer production from director Joseph Kosinski is shaping up to be the second-best opening for Pitt as a leading man after 2013's World War Z ($66.4M). Talk about a comeback for Apple theatrically. Remember their period NASA rom-com $100M Fly Me to the Moon last summer? Remember the Pitt-George Clooney noir Wolfs? No! What are those? Even if F1 stays idle this weekend at this range, it's a still a commendable success. Word is international is very strong, which makes all the sense in the world given the international appeal of Formula One racing.


	The other beautiful thing about this Apple made, Warner Bros.' release car is that it pulled the 13-24 demo at 30% last night. That's very impressive for a movie such as this which appear older skewing. 


F1 is seriously warming up its engines, and we'll be checking its oil throughout the weekend; Warners having worked tirelessly on the marketing and distribution front to make this Apple's best. 


	RelishMix reports that F1‘s social media reach is a massive 845.6M across TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, X and Instagram “+62% above action adventure genre norms with notable late video view growth on Instagram over 400M.” F1‘s reach is right around Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (847.2M) and ahead of Fast X‘s 798M.


	Second is Universal/DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon at 4,127 locations is looking at at $5.5M today, and a third frame of $18.5M (-49%) for a running cume of $199.1M (C'mon, we gotta get that to $200M this weekend!). The Dean DeBlois directed movie stands as the fifth to cross the double century mark YTD. 

	











	Third goes to Disney/Pixar's Elio which is seeing a second weekend of $11M-$12M, -45%, steeper than Elemental‘s second frame which dipped -38% for an $18.4M second weekend. It's all about tomorrow, of course. At the high end by the EOD of Sunday, the 28th Pixar feature release stands around $43.4M.  


	There's also Universal/Blumhouse/Atomic Monster's M3GAN 2.0 at 3,112 theaters is powered down to an opening of $10M, well below where everybody was seeing it (worst case, we thought high teens). Friday is $4.3M. Thank God, she's cheap at $25M before P&A. We'll dissect her later. 


	Speaking of dismemberment, there's a chance that M3GAN 2.0 could get bitten by zombies as Sony's Danny Boyle revival 28 Years Later is looking at north of $10M, -67% in weekend 2, after a $3.3M second Friday, for a ten-day running total of $50.6M by EOD Sunday. 


  


FRIDAY AM: Apple Original Films' F1 via Warner Bros. sped to $10M in total previews from this week while Universal/Blumhouse/Atomic Monster's M3GAN 2.0 drew $1.5M.


	The Joseph Kosinski-directed, Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Formula One movie starring Brad Pitt, arguably the first-of-its-kind tentpole for Apple Original Films on the big screen, bested the preview grosses of such expensive Apple movies as Ridley Scott's Napoleon ($3M), Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon ($2.6M), Matthew Vaughn's Argylle ($1.7M) and Greg Berlanti's Fly Me to the Moon ($875K). F1 also smokes the previews of another car-racing movie, the multi-Oscar-winning, solid-grossing Ford v Ferrari, which is actually a high point for the struggling motor sports genre at the box office — the best that there has been in recent times ($2.1M previews, $31.4M opening).


	Broken out, F1 did $7M last night from showtimes that began at 3PM and another $3M from earlier week Imax and PLF previews. Based on early results, and the way the engines have been firing for this film, a $50M+ opening appears likely. Warner Bros. chipped in 50% of the global P&A. Both Apple and Warners recoup the P&A together before the Burbank, CA lot gets a distribution fee around 8%. Production costs per the filmmaker in interviews is $200M (though I constantly get phone calls with the line “But, ya know, it cost $300M…). At the end of the day, get a grip people, F1 stands to open globally to $115M+. The Pitt movie is in great shape with Rotten Tomatoes Audience score of 97% and 84% certified fresh reviews. 


M3GAN 2.0‘s previews are less than the original movie which did $2.75M and went on to a surprise $11.7M and $30.4M. M3GAN 2.0 will be lucky to clear $20M, last night's previews from 2PM showtimes at 2,700 theaters around the level of Blumhouse's Night Swim which did $1.45M and went on to post a $11.7M opening. No audience score yet. Critics loved the first movie at 93% certified fresh, but they've had enough with the robot gimmick at 59% Rotten. No audience score yet on the sequel from the franchise architect Gerard Johnstone. At the end of the day, M3GAN 2.0 is counterprogramming in the summer. The movie cost $25M before P&A versus $12M on the first. 


	In other news, Lilo & Stitch is crossing $400M this weekend, the second movie to do so this year after Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie. 


	The rest of the week went down as follows:

	











	1.) How to Train Your Dragon (Uni) Thu $4M (-15% from Wednesday), Wk $57.1M (-54%), Total $180.6M/Wk 2 


	2.) 28 Years Later (Sony) Thu $1.9M (-15%), Week $40.6M/Wk 1  


	3.) Elio (Dis) 3,750 theaters Thu $2.2M (-7%), Wk $31.4M, Wk 1


	4.) Lilo & Stitch (Dis) 3,375 theaters, Thu $1.5M (+1%), Wk $16M (-39%), Total $393.1M, Wk 5 


	5.) Mission: Impossible – Final Reckoning (Par) 2,603 theaters, Thu $722K (-14%), Wk $10M (-37%), Total $181.8M/Wk 5

Thunderbolts made a out $20 million more and cost less than F1. We can expect a total take of $400 million or less since fierce competition will take the Imax screens. Will Apple and WB be happy with these results? The summer box office isn't off to a great start considering budgets and inflation. MI is struggling too. It doesn't look like it'll reach $600 million.Megan 2.0 is DOA. They should have made it another cheap horror and released it in September. Blumhouse needs to reign in their filmmakers.

I hope the new Superman movie is good. It's the only film I might actually see at the movie theater this year.

You can glaze F1 all you want. It needs to make $1b to break even. M3gan needs to make $60m.

I live in Massachusetts. I need about $90 million to break even.

F1 looks expensive and Brad is an undeniable movie star, but there's no story here.  It's so boring.

I could see that from the trailers.

You being bored with the story doesn't mean there's no story.

Question: Understood that F1 cost multiple hundreds of millions to produce and market and so the assessments of whether it will make a profit do make sense. However, having seen the movie – which was amazing, fun and thrilling btw – it has more product placement per scene than most movies have throughout the movie. Call me naïve, but can't help wondering if the producers financed a good portion of this movie by having cos. underwrite it thru product placement? Bruckheimer, in particular, seems smart enough to have produced it almost for free..

I
've been dreaming about the Badlands again. It's a scorching July day in 2002, and Nicole and I are hauling ass in my VW Beetle across South Dakota. I'm driving; she's riding shotgun, eating a Slim Jim. We're blasting The Eminem Show with the windows down, our hair whipping in the hot desert air, when Nicole sees a sign and tells me we need to pull over.


	We've hiked a mile or so into the moonscape of the park when we come across a pink boulder with a deep split down its center, like a giant earth vulva. Nicole grins at me, strips off her clothes, and springs onto the rock. “Take a picture,” she says, arching her nakedness into a bridge over the dark cleft. I snap a photo. She shakes her curls at me upside-down and says, “Now you.” I get undressed, climb up, and thrust my hips to the sky. She takes my picture. We're getting dressed when a couple of hikers come around the bend, and we cackle all the way back to the car.


	In the summer of 2024, I began retracing our journey on a cross-country road trip, visiting people who could help me put the pieces together, trying to remember who Nicole was before everything went wrong, since a chance encounter with seven kids blew our lives apart, with a bullet ending one life and shattering countless others. Murder doesn't only happen to the person who dies.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's been two decades since the media took an incredulous phrase that fell out of Nicole's mouth — “What are you going to do, shoot us?” — and blamed her for her own death while capitalizing on it: The Village Voice called it “A Murder Made for the Front Page.” The New York Post covered the killer's trial gavel to gavel, while glossy magazines wrote about how not to let this happen to you.

	











	Things have been fucked up ever since the night when I sat in a Manhattan police station trying to comprehend that Nicole was dead, and I was not. But after 20 years, I felt like I could finally revisit her story. With a therapist guiding me, I went back to the night Nicole died over and over until something shifted. It was like a foreign object had been extracted from a wound. It still exists, but it's outside me, and I can examine it without pain. Now, I want to know how the others who loved her have coped with losing her. That's what I'm on this trip to find out.

	Nicole DuFresne was born on Jan. 5, 1977, in Wayzata, Minnesota, a wealthy suburb west of Minneapolis. Her father, Tom, was a forceful, charismatic man who worked as a commercial real-estate developer. Her mother, Linda, a knockout with turquoise eyes, was a gentle, creative woman. Nicole and her younger brother, Zach, both inherited their mother's looks, but Nicole took after her father when it came to temperament; she was a passionate, moody kid who would dominate on the soccer pitch and then write poetry in her bedroom. “I think she always felt like a little bit of an outsider, even in our family,” Zach DuFresne tells me when I visit him at his quiet suburban home in Colorado, “but she was totally unafraid to be herself.”


	Tom DuFresne wanted his kids to have the best of everything, but from a young age, Nicole bucked his attempts to insulate her with money. She hated the preppy private school her parents sent her to, and insisted on attending public school for junior high before transferring to an arts high school. When she moved to Boston to study theater at Emerson College, her father rented her a brownstone apartment in a tony neighborhood, but Nicole chafed at feeling like a rich kid. She started to work odd jobs that didn't conflict with her schooling.

	In her junior year of college, Nicole was raped in the parking lot of a bar. When she told her parents about the assault, they begged her to come home, but she refused; she'd been cast in a show that she didn't want to drop out of. She received counseling and later used the traumatic experience as inspiration for a two-woman play, Matter.


	I have a copy of the play with me on my cross-country travels. I keep returning to one line that articulates a familiar feeling: “In my dreams someone is waiting to eat me.”

	











	Nicole and I met in Seattle at Theater Schmeater in August 2001, on the first day of rehearsal for Our Country's Good, a play set in a penal colony in 1780s Australia. The director wanted everyone to be as disgusting as possible: lice, syphilis, scabies, goiters, rotten teeth. Nicole was good at getting ugly; her performance was frightening, “almost unbearably tragic,” one reviewer wrote. I played a convict named Shitty Meg and pushed the gross-out factor as far as I could. We bonded over the freedom we found in being filthy; our playacting felt like an antidote to what the world expected of us.


	She loved that I'd worked on an Alaskan salmon boat. I was mesmerized by her witchy hippie energy, lean kinetic body, and throaty laugh. After the show closed, she asked me if I would create a show with her. We wrote a two-hander inspired by a book about CIA brainwashing experiments and hit the fringe-festival circuit in the summer of 2002.


Burning Cage was an intense play. A reviewer at Minneapolis Fringe called us “feminists with an axe to grind.” We scrawled “Come see the axe-grinding feminists!” in chalk outside of every venue after that. We did better at other festivals — one critic said our show was “precisely the kind of art and passion that fringe theatre should be about.” Another called us “balls-out brave.”


	By the time we won Artistic Pick at the Seattle Fringe that fall, we'd been on the road together for most of the summer, and we weren't sick of each other, which felt monumental to me. I'd always been reserved in my friendships, but Nicole refused to allow it. She told me I needed to trust her; I told her I had a weird feeling that things with us wouldn't last. “It's going to last,” she said. I chalked up my anxiety to existential dread, and we started to plan our next collaboration.


	A couple of months later, Nicole and her fiancé, Jeffrey Sparks, were moving to New York, and she stopped by my place with a farewell gift — a little glass vase holding a paper scroll. She said it was a message for whenever I couldn't reach her and needed to hear from her. I promised her I'd be right behind her; we had things to do.


	Nicole was thrilled by the energy of New York. She started developing a pilot with Jeffrey to pitch to the Food Channel (Nikki's New York), and launched herself into the downtown theater scene, painting sets at LAByrinth Theater Company while concentrating on her own undertakings with a group she'd co-founded with Emerson classmates. She worked at a nonprofit serving seniors on the Upper West Side to pay the bills. “I feel that I can be my absolute self [in New York] since there are so many different souls here,” she wrote in her journal. “They all work like a puzzle. I suppose there are many hardships I will have here, but I am excited for all the gold I could find.”

	











	A year later, I made the trek from Seattle with my boyfriend, Scott Nath. We moved into a fifth-floor walk-up at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge, and I loved the aching feeling of climbing into the sky. We survived off cheap burgers and egg sandwiches from Mom's Diner, and $2 PBRs from Welcome to the Johnsons; we'd peer into the window of wd~50, the city's hottest new molecular gastronomy dining establishment, knowing we couldn't afford to even walk inside. The grime was exhilarating, and the glamorous boutiques opening between old-world vestiges — hat stores, bridal shops — gave the neighborhood a sense of urgency. We'd wander home at sunrise past commuters making their way to the train as we crawled into bed.


	Nicole and Jeffrey had us over for a welcome dinner, and she gave us a bag of weed mixed with lavender. “You'll need it,” she said with a laugh. She told me I should get new headshots; she'd just had hers done, and was insistent that we both had to step up our game. The following months were a glorious whirlwind of auditioning, acting, and writing. Nicole was producing new work with her theater company; I was making a living as an actor. We met up to write whenever we could, ginning each other up as we brainstormed ideas and to-do lists. We laughed so much: I can still hear her bellowing “I have to pee like a horse!” as she charged into Cafe Mogador after being stuck on the L train for an hour.


	Reading through our notebooks, I'm struck by how relentlessly confident we were in ourselves, and each other. By the time we rang in 2005 at a warehouse party in a dilapidated former church — the kind of sweaty all-night revelry I'd always dreamed of going to — I felt like we could take over the world.

His family lived in the West New Brighton housing projects in a bleak part of Staten Island where more than 15 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. Violence was a grim reality in the Fleming household; his father was shot and killed when he was a child; an older brother was given a five-year sentence for assault; another was sentenced to eight years in prison for beating a man with a baseball bat; and a third was shot and killed with his own gun during a botched robbery.

	











	Fleming struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age, according to court documents; he was diagnosed with a learning disability at the age of eight and enrolled in an individualized program by the Department of Education, but there's nothing on the record to indicate that he received any psychiatric help. In 2001, when he was 16, Fleming pulled a gun on truancy officers who picked him up for loitering. According to the police report, which designated him an emotionally disturbed person, he told arresting officers, “You should have shot me. I want you to kill me. I want to die.” He received a three-year prison sentence on a weapons charge and was sent to an upstate correctional facility more than 200 miles away.


	At an April 2004 parole hearing, he said prison had taught him to learn from his mistakes. That June, three days before his 19th birthday, Fleming was released on parole.


	In January 2005, Fleming moved into the apartment of his godfather, Servino Simmon, in the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side, a sea of tan high-rises overlooking some of the most expensive real estate in the country. Fleming had grown up close with Simmon's kids — Servisio, who was 21 years old, and Servano, who was 17 — and they were living there, too. Fleming's 18-year-old girlfriend, Ashley Evans, a well-liked high school cheerleader, also moved into the apartment.


	On the night of Jan. 26, 2005, Fleming, Evans, Servisio, and Servano, along with their 18-year-old cousin David Simmon, David's friend Kayshawn Boyd, 15, and Boyd's 14-year-old girlfriend, Tatianna McDonald, were hanging out at the apartment, smoking weed, drinking, and playing with Fleming's gun, which had been stolen from its legal owner in South Carolina in 2002. It's unclear who Fleming got it from or how long he'd had it, but he liked showing off the heavy silver six-shot .357 Magnum revolver, spinning the chamber, loading and unloading it. Servano thought the gun was cool, too; at one point, he and his brother played a mock round of Russian roulette without pulling the trigger.


	That same night, Nicole was working her first bartending shift at Rockwood Music Hall, a new venue on the Lower East Side. Scott and I met up with Jeffrey at the bar to celebrate her new gig; Nicole served us a couple of rounds, and when she finished her shift, the four of us went to a raucous hipster joint called Max Fish, where we ordered rum and cokes and played pinball.


	After a few hours at the apartment, Fleming and his friends were bored, so they went out to “start trouble,” McDonald later said. They were walking toward the Delancey-Essex subway station when they passed 22-year-old security guard Adam Chavez coming home from work. Chavez was wearing a white leather jacket that caught Fleming's eye. He chased after Chavez with David Simmon and Boyd, who punched him and demanded he give up the jacket, but after Fleming whacked him twice with his gun, Chavez managed to pull away and run into the street in front of a passing taxi. He called 911, but by the time cops showed up, the friends were on a train to Brooklyn. Chavez declined to file a police report and headed home.

	











	The friends took the J train through the rooftops of Brooklyn and got off at Broadway Junction, deep in the borough. They hung out on the subway platform, where the boys tried to goad Evans and McDonald into fighting a couple of other girls waiting for the train. When they refused, the guys made fun of them for chickening out, so when they caught a train back to Manhattan, the girls said they would fight anyone they pointed out. They got off back at the Delancey-Essex stop around 3 a.m. A surveillance camera outside Schiller's Liquor Bar captured the group walking east on Rivington toward Clinton.


	We had left Max Fish a few minutes earlier. We were buzzed, goofing around, pushing one another into snowbanks — oblivious gentrifiers on the home turf of seven friends out looking for a fight. When Evans heard us laughing as we crossed onto Clinton Street, her resentment flamed. “They were ex­tremely happy, so that made me even angrier,” she later told the police. Pissed off, she pointed us out to Fleming as the ones they should fight. Then everything happened fast.

By the time we rang in 2005 together at a warehouse party, I felt like we could take over the world. 


	I remember being stopp­ed. Shoved against a wall with a gun. My purse is yanked away. A loud bang. Scott running, screaming, “Murderer! Murderer!” Nicole on her back in the street. My bare knees on cold grit as I kneel next to her. She's looking up at Jeffrey as he leans over her, telling her to stay with him. The headlights of cars coming toward us off the Williamsburg Bridge. Then I'm in the back of a cop car, looking at Scott's crumpled face in alternating red and blue light.


	According to witnesses who later testified in court, Fleming stepped in front of us, pulled out his gun, and told us to give him our money. Scott said we didn't have any because we'd spent it all at the bar. When Jeffrey tried to push past him, Fleming smashed him in the face with the gun, opening up a gash over his eye. Then, as Nicole went to check on Jeffrey, Fleming slammed me against a security gate with the gun. He yanked my bag away and threw it to Evans and McDonald as Nicole approached him and pushed him, saying, “You got what you wanted.” Then, according to testimony from McDonald and Servano Simmon, she asked him, “What are you going to do, shoot us?” Fleming lifted the gun, pointed it at her chest, and fired. Nicole stumbled and fell into the street as they ran. The bullet had pierced her heart.


	Cops took us to the 7th Precinct station, where Scott and I waited in an interview room under buzzing fluorescents for what felt like hours until Jeffrey came back from the hospital and told us Nicole was dead. He went into another room to call her father. I remember hearing him howling.

	











	When we left the station on the morning of Jan. 27, I couldn't believe the sun was shining; it was like the world had changed shape, and no one had noticed. Scott and I went home, pulled the blinds, and lay beside each other in the darkness, not talking. At some point, I remembered her message in a bottle. I got it down from my bookshelf and unfurled the scroll. It said:


Believe in yourself like I believe in you.Sending you lots of groovey love vibes.Have faith.Listen to yourself.With love,xo Nicole


	“She died in my arms.” That was Jeffrey's heartbreaking statement to a reporter who tracked him down after a police bulletin about the shooting went out that day. The story electrified the media; the New York Post ran a cover story with Nicole's headshot under the headline “Beauty Slain.” A photo of Jeffrey, bloody from being pistol-whipped, accompanied the accounts of her murder.


	Reporters were waiting at LaGuardia Airport for Tom and Linda DuFresne when they flew in from Minnesota to identify their daughter's body; members of the media camped out on our doorstep to snag a photo of Scott and me looking pale and shell-shocked. It was surreal to read tabloid accounts that the gun had been aimed at me too, that Scott thought he had heard it go off. My reality was fracturing.


	Before internet ubiquity as we know it existed, the story of her death went viral; Nicole's face was on newsstands across the country, and every major media outlet showed up at her memorial. The Village Voice noted that “DuFresne is on her way to becoming one of New York's super-victims.”


	Surveillance videos and tips led to the seven friends being apprehended within days. The tabloids made hay in the wake of their arrests, branding them “thugs” and “fiends.” The report that our laughter had angered them was shocking; “Nicole Died for Smiling — ‘Slay' Creeps Picked on Happy Victim,” one article blared. A photo of Fleming sobbing in the back of a police car after his arrest ran under the headline “He Cries for Himself.”


	I hadn't heard Nicole say anything to Fleming, but police told reporters that bystanders had heard her say something to the effect of “What are you going to do, shoot us next?” When Evans was arrested, she said Nicole had been the aggressor, claiming that Fleming shot her only because he'd slipped after she pushed him. Evans was accused of taking the murder weapon back to the Simmon apartment, where police had found it hidden under a bed.

	











	After Evans' allegation was reported, the media narrative shifted — now Nicole's death was her fault because she'd “dared” Fleming. Safety advocates said that Nicole's “defiant” stand had prompted Fleming to shoot her, and the National Crime Prevention Council circulated a memo on how to survive a mugging, advising potential victims to “stay cool and comply with robbers.”


The Stranger, a Seattle alt-weekly, ran an anonymous letter addressing Nicole that read, in part, “It seems you misplayed your role as mugging victim. This was not street theater you were involved in. It was real-life drama, which you helped turn into a tragedy.… Your last words suggest you did not understand the material. I'm sad that you will not get another audition.”


Cosmopolitan published a feature titled “How Not to Let Your Fearlessness Go Too Far” with tips on what not to do when held at gunpoint, next to a list of mistakes that Nicole had supposedly made.


	Richard Price wrote an acclaimed novel, Lush Life, in which he echoed her purported last words; after a long night of drinking, a would-be writer is gunned down when he makes the dumb decision to tell a mugger “Not tonight, my man.” An episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent ripped the story from the headlines. In that version, it was the friends who'd set her up.


	Even after all of these years, the story has stuck. I'm listening to one of my favorite podcasts on my road trip when they bring up Nicole's murder. “She got in their faces,” one of the co-hosts says. “Like, just give them your purse … don't start an altercation.” Tears fill my eyes; I have to pull over. Nicole was fiercely protective; she was upset; her death wasn't her fault. Fleming was an angry kid with a gun that he wanted to use. Maybe Nicole would be alive if our laughter hadn't filled Evans with rage, if Fleming had gotten the help he needed at school, if the gun had gone off when he pushed me instead. Her murder was a senseless act of violence. Speculating about a different outcome only intensified the pain.


	Fleming did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him for this article; neither did any of the other six friends, who would now all be in their thirties or early forties. I want to ask them how their lives have been since the night our paths crossed; what details have stayed with them; how their age and maturity have shaped the way they think about the events of that night. But the only update I get is from Detective George Taylor, the lead investigator on the case, who tells me that he saw Servano Simmon a few years later; the only one not charged, he'd straightened his life out and was attending college.

	











	Fleming was charged with first-degree murder. He'd exhibited bizarre behavior when he was arrested, mumbling, stuffing paper towels in his mouth, and going limp in the interview room. He was admitted to Belle­vue Hospital and held under observation for several months. In a pretrial hearing, Fleming's attorney, Anthony Ricco, told the judge that Fleming was mentally incompetent; evidently, he was hearing voices telling him not to eat and hallucinating a giant marshmallow man. However, a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist testified that Fleming had gained eight pounds while under observation and that his symptoms only appeared when he knew he was being watched. Although Fleming had “fewer resources than most individuals” to cope with the stress he was under, including a lack of family support, they believed he was feigning his symptoms. He was found competent to stand trial.


	Fleming never appeared in the courtroom at his trial; he was removed before jury selection after an outburst that required several officers to restrain him. Assistant District Attorney Robert Hettleman called it a “well-timed action” for someone trying to avoid trial, and the judge agreed, ordering a CCTV video feed to be set up so Fleming could watch the proceedings from his holding cell.


	McDonald testified that Nicole's shooting was intentional: It had nothing to do with Fleming being pushed, she said. Scott and Servano Simmon also testified that Fleming had shot Nicole from an arm's length away. Jeffrey testified that, although the shock of being pistol-whipped had dazed him, his memory of holding Nicole as she lay dying in the street was crystal clear. When I was called to the stand, I could only share my scattershot version of the encounter. It didn't matter; witnesses confirmed that Nicole had been executed at point-blank range.


	On Oct. 12, 2006, the jury found Fleming guilty on nine counts, including first-degree murder, robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon. No family or friends had ever come to support him. At his sentencing, his attorney asked the court for mercy. “People rehabilitate themselves, and that's my hope for Rudy Fleming, who's in the back, cowering in his cell,” Ricco said. “He's a young person who cannot come to grips.” The judge deemed Fleming a “cold-blooded, thoroughly amoral killer” and gave him life without parole. The Post got in one last dig when Jeffrey told a reporter outside the court that he was relieved Fleming hadn't received the death penalty. The headline read “Fiancé's Pity Is Misplaced for This Vermin.”

	











	Evans and four of the others took plea deals. Servisio Simmon received a sentence of 10 years for first-degree robbery; David Simmon was sentenced to six years for first-degree attempted robbery; Boyd was referred to family court; McDonald was adjudicated a youthful offender and received a sentence of one to three years for first-degree robbery. At her sentencing, when Evans entered a guilty plea to first-degree robbery, she apologized to the DuFresne family. “If I could take it all back, I most sincerely would,” she said. Linda DuFresne replied, “Ours is a sentence of life without Nicole.” Evans got six years. Fleming appealed his sentence in 2010. It was denied.


	I went back to my restaurant job a couple of weeks after the murder. A co-worker asked me what Nicole had said to make the kid shoot her. There was a faraway ringing in my ears as someone else said, “Leave her alone, man.” I was refilling the owner's coffee when he grasped my wrist and said quietly, “Survivor guilt is a real thing.” I knew that his parents were Holocaust survivors, so I nodded at him mutely and went to the bathroom to scream into my latte-stained apron. A few weeks later, I terrorized an elderly Weight Watchers leader after our weekly meeting by telling her what had happened and that I wasn't OK. She patted my hand and told me I shouldn't come back until I felt better.


	When I went to collect my wallet from One Police Plaza, they handed it to me in a plastic bag labeled “Homicide Evidence.” A letter arrived from the New York State Office of Victim Services offering me funds for therapy. I thought it was pretty funny that I was a state-sanctioned victim. Nothing felt real. I couldn't sleep. I started drinking to anesthetize myself, making it most of the way through two bottles of wine before stumbling into bed around dawn. When I did sleep, I had nightmares. My relationship with Scott started to suffer. But I kept telling myself I was OK; I wasn't the one who died.


	For years, I tried to articulate how I felt, but I couldn't find the words. At one point, I took a solo-performance class, thinking I'd write a one-woman show about — murder? Gun violence? Grief? I can't remember, but the teacher told me I wasn't ready to address my experience. At the time, I was furious, but years later, I'm thankful for her candor. She was right; I needed time.

	











	My first stop on the road trip is in Denver, where I spend a sunny afternoon with Zach, his wife, and their two kids at a neighborhood swimming pool. As we listen to the splashing of happy children, Zach and I reminisce about the Thanksgiving dinner we had with Nicole in 2004, when the siblings walked home across the snowy Williamsburg Bridge after dinner at our place. They stopped to call Linda and sing “New York, New York” to her from the middle of the East River. It was the last weekend he had with his sister.


	After the trial and sentencings, a noose of grief tightened around the DuFresne family. Although Linda continued to set a place for her daughter at the table at holiday gatherings, Zach says that no one spoke her name: “My mom never recovered, and part of my dad died when Nicole died.” Tom has been in a care facility since suffering a debilitating stroke several years ago; Linda has Alzheimer's-related dementia, and lives in a nursing home not far from Zach.

“I remember trying to see if that sadness was still there, and I was like, ‘I don't need to dig in. It doesn't help me move forward.'” 


	Linda meets me in the lobby when I pull up for our visit. She's frail, wearing a back brace, and her face is stamped with pain, but her eyes are bright. We go to a restaurant, where we order wine and sit on the breezy patio. She asks me what I'm working on. I take a deep breath, and tell her I'm writing about Nicole. “She'd be happy that you are,” Linda says. Then she puts a hand on my arm and asks me to tell her about the night her daughter died. I tell her what I remember, and we hold hands in silence for a long time.


	Later, over dinner, Zach tells me that substance abuse dominated his life for years after Nicole was killed. One night, when he was drinking with friends, one of them said something about her that set him off; Zach got into his car in a rage and drove into the side of a mountain near Aspen. “I was fucking annihilated,” he says. “I should have died.” He credits marriage and fatherhood with averting him from his path of self-destruction. Now, his family celebrates his sister's birthday every January. “We bake a cake and tell stories about Nicole,” he says. “I'm trying to give my children some sense of their auntie.”


	Next, I visit Jeffrey in his Midwest home. Over coffee in his backyard, he tells me about proposing to Nicole. They were on a road trip to Joshua Tree. “I had this overwhelming feeling that I wanted to spend the rest of my life listening to her,” he recalls. “She was sitting next to the fire. I got down on my knee, and she starts throwing all these ‘What ifs?' at me, like, ‘What if I get a terrible disease and lose my hair?'” His answers came easily. “There wasn't anything I felt we couldn't handle.” She said she would marry him on one condition: that they move to New York.


	After she was killed, Jeffrey's grief coalesced into anger under relentless scrutiny from the media: “I was a pressure cooker of rage, trying to keep the lid on.” He went to the Middle East to work on a documentary about war widows, where he was held at gunpoint more than once. Danger felt comforting to him; at one point, he was riding in a car that narrowly missed hitting an oncoming truck. “I remember this distinct feeling of water washing over me,” Jeffrey recalls. “Like, ‘Here it comes.' And I felt myself smiling.” Now, he aspires to be a good father to his 13-year-old son in Nicole's memory. “I channel my love into being the person that she envisioned me to be,” he says. “I liked her vision of me.”

	











	A few weeks later, I meet Scott for dinner in Brooklyn; it's the first time we've seen each other in years. We stayed together until 2013, and had plenty of good times, but we had stared at each other through hell and couldn't make it work for the long haul. We order pizza and cocktails, even though Scott doesn't drink much anymore. He tells me that he didn't feel the need to self-destruct like the rest of us because his testimony helped secure Fleming's conviction — and because he entered therapy right away. “I remember trying to see if that sadness was still there,” he says, “and I was like, ‘I don't need to dig in. It doesn't help me move forward.'” Nonetheless, Nicole's murder changed his trajectory; he gave up on his dream of being an actor, and took a corporate job. Since the night Nicole died, he often thinks about how limited his time is. “There's nothing more precious than that.”


	I can see how my PTSD has played out through guilt, dissociation, and self-annihilation, but I didn't have clarity until recently. After Scott and I split up, I moved on to bad relationships with men who gave me the affection I felt I deserved, which was none. For years, happiness felt like a harbinger of bad things to come; feeling anxious and miserable was familiar. But when my last relationship flamed out, a friend recommended a form of trauma therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR. After several sessions, I felt I could finally write about Nicole, as I've wanted to do for so long. It feels good to revisit our work, to read her journals, and to drive for days, thinking about my gorgeous, funny, wild friend without feeling suffocated. Instead of dwelling on how she died, I'm remembering how brightly she lived. I can see Nicole standing in the doorway of my apartment on the night she came to pick me up for a Halloween party wearing a slinky champagne-colored dress, smoky glitter outlining her blue eyes under a cascade of curls. I asked her what her costume was. She winked at me, and said, “I'm a dream.”

Vivienne Jolie is stepping into the spotlight. The 16-year-old daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt stepped out in New York City. She turned heads during a rare solo outing. Vivienne, whom Jolie shares with ex-husband Brad Pitt, typically resides in Los Angeles but has spent significant time in NYC over the past year. As per photos published by Hola, Vivienne dressed casually yet in an effortlessly chic manner. 

She wore a white oversized t-shirt paired with off-white pants and matching sneakers. She carried bottles of water and seltzer during the outing, braving the summer heat alone as she made a quick trip to the supermarket.

Vivienne isn't just in New York for a getaway — she's been making serious moves behind the scenes. In 2024, the 16-year-old worked alongside her mom, Angelina Jolie, on The Outsiders Broadway musical, a stage adaptation of the iconic novel.

As per People, Vivienne served as a volunteer assistant on the production, and Jolie described her daughter as a “really tough assistant.”

She told People that Vivienne takes the job “very, very seriously.” The mother-daughter duo also attended the 2024 Tony Awards together in coordinating teal outfits, where The Outsiders took home four awards, including Best Musical.

“My daughter Viv loves theater,” Angelina Jolie told Deadline in June 2024. “She appreciates all theater, but she certainly knows what she feels close to and what she responds to.”

Jolie shared that Vivienne had seen “The Outsiders” at La Jolla about five times and kept encouraging her to explore the show. “She was telling me about it, and I had read the book, and I'd seen the film years ago,” Jolie added.

Moved by her daughter's enthusiasm, Jolie gave the story another look. 

A post shared by Lis Lopes 👑 (@lislopees)

“I started really watching the effect it was having on my young daughter and what she was telling me about herself,” she explained. “I was learning what about it was important to her and why it connected so deeply to her.”

While Vivienne remains close to her mother, her relationship with Brad Pitt appears to be strained. Following Jolie and Pitt's high-profile divorce, several of their children—including Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne—have reportedly dropped “Pitt” from their last names. 

A source told Us Weekly that Brad Pitt has shared with friends how “deeply emotional” the estrangement has been. “He has made several efforts to reconnect with his kids,” the source said, adding that he sees his twins, Vivienne and Knox, “periodically.” However, “the rest of the relationships are strained. It's caused him a lot of heartbreak.”

The rap duo has come under fire for encouraging audiences at the U.K. music festival to join in on shouting "death to the IDF" during their set.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Glastonbury organizer Emily Eavis has condemned anti-IDF chants made by performer Bob Vylan at the U.K. music festival.


	The rap duo has come under fire for encouraging audiences at the event in Somerset, England, to join in on shouting “death to the IDF” [the Israel Defense Forces] during their set on the West Holts stage on Saturday.




	Eavis, the youngest daughter of Glastonbury Festival co-founder Michael Eavis, posted to Instagram on Sunday to say that the team is “appalled” by the band's behavior.

	“Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech, or incitement to violence,” she wrote.

	Eavis continued: “As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism — we will always believe in — and actively campaign for — hope, unity, peace and love”, adding a performer's comments “should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs… With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share.”

	Bob Vylan isn't the only act to draw attention to the war in Gaza. At the same stage on Saturday, Irish rap trio Kneecap voiced their pro-Palestine views and used the platform to criticize the U.K. and U.S. governments, as well as the U.S. media.

	











	They thanked the Eavis family for allowing them to play despite pushback from U.K. politicians, including Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy. “A big thank you to the Eavis family,” Kneecap said. “The pressure that that family was under and they stood strong. Fair play to them.”


	In May, the Met Police said it would investigate after online videos showed the band calling for the death of British parliament ministers, as well as chanting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” It is illegal in the U.K. to express support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon, as it is considered a terrorist organization in Britain.

“Hey, I'm gonna be a star.” That was almost Sam Rockwell‘s line in “Lean on Me.” The 1989 film which starred Morgan Freeman as the real-life educator Joe Louis Clark. Rockwell was cast in the film, but — as he revealed during a recent appearance on the podcast “Happy Sad Confused” — that one line ended up going to Michael Imperioli.

“They never got to my scene,” Rockwell explained to host Josh Horowitz (via Entertainment Weekly). “So they had to let me go because they didn't want to pay me for a week. So they got to pay for a day player or pay for a week. So they… let me go. They fired me… And because they were like, ‘Ah, we can't pay them a week for one line.' And then they hired Michael, and Michael [Imperioli] got it. Michael's in the movie, but I still got residuals… I still get residual checks for that, even though I'm not in it.”

Ironically, Imperioli had joined Rockwell and Kevin Corrigan on a drive to New Jersey, where the trio auditioned for the film. But Rockwell might have dodged a bullet. Imperioli told The New Yorker in 2024 that director John G. Avildsen was “not very nice.”

 










“But I'd never been in front of a camera,” Imperiolo said. “This was the '80s. There were giant Panavision cameras, and I didn't know where to look. I really didn't know what I was doing. I mumbled the line thinking maybe they won't notice me or something. And then [Avildsen] comes and starts giving direction. He goes, ‘And you with that “Gonna be a star,” you'd better give me something or you're out of here!' I was horrified. I think, I'm horrible, I suck.”

Several years later, Rockwell found himself once again pitted against Imperioli — or at least compared to him, this time in the 1998 Woody Allen flick “Celebrity.”

“I was a part of [Leonardo] DiCaprio's entourage. And I had a few lines and they said, ‘Woody wants you to dye your hair bleach blonde,” he recalled. Rockwell countered that he would not dye his hair for five lines, but the team was insistent, “Woody wants you to do it.” Rockwell refused.

“And they're like, ‘Well, Michael Imperioli was gonna do it.' Cause he had dropped out. And I was replacing Michael — because Michael was going to do a little pilot called ‘Sopranos,' that I heard didn't go anywhere.” Rockwell said. “And so I said, “All right, I'll dye my hair.”

Rockwell is currently riding high on the major critical acclaim received by the third installment of “The White Lotus,” for which he's a frontrunner in the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category at the Emmys.

	The United States is not where it should be when it comes to the transition to renewable energy. Ask any climate scientist or reputable energy expert, and they'll tell you we're significantly behind schedule if we're hoping to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Joe Biden's administration got passed in 2022, was meant to help speed up that transition and get the country on the right track. Now, it's under attack.


	President Donald Trump's administration has been working to undo any policies that would help the world avoid a climate catastrophe, and it is now trying to use the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” to repeal most of the climate-focused initiatives contained in the IRA. Trump's signature legislation is caught up in the Senate after the House passed it last month, so it's not entirely clear what the final draft will contain, but experts agree that these climate provisions are clearly on the chopping block. 

	











	The latest version of the bill would be particularly catastrophic for wind and solar. Republicans not only want to significantly cut tax credits for these clean energy projects, they wants impose new taxes on them for the first time. Wind and solar projects completed after 2027, for instance, will be taxed unless they can prove no Chinese components were used.


	“They're proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote in a statement Saturday. “If this becomes law, it will be a shocking act of economic self-sabotage.” 

	











	Republicans also stand to cut the $7,500 tax credit for consumers who purchase a new electric vehicle, and the $4,000 credit for consumers who buy a used one.


	“It is clear that many of the grant and loan programs that were established by the IRA are at especially high risk,” Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, tells Rolling Stone. “The tax credits are a little more uncertain, but we should expect changes to at least some of the tax credit programs and the elimination of some of them.”

	It appears some tax credits, like those for nuclear and geothermal energy companies, might remain until at least 2034. Trump recently made it known that he doesn't like tax credits going to clean energy projects, but he didn't specify what he was talking about. 


	“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS' IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM,” Trump posted last week on Truth Social. “I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions.”


	The latest version of the bill slashes tax credits for wind and solar projects, while offering them for coal production. “Utterly insane and destructive,” Elon Musk wrote of the bill on Saturday. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”


	Daniel Kammen, a distinguished professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, says he doesn't think anything is off the table when it comes to cuts to the IRA, and that Republicans will have to make individual decisions about what might help or hurt them when the midterms come around next year.


	“There are Republicans who voted against the IRA who then campaigned for reelection on its merits,” Kammen says. “[The bill is] even targeting measures popular with Republicans.”


	Nearly 80 percent of renewable energy project funding in the IRA went to Republican congressional districts. Many hoped Republicans wouldn't eliminate provisions that benefited their constituents. However, with Donald Trump leading the charge, much of this funding might be cut, regardless of whether it is helping Republicans.

	“The fact that many of the incentives were provided to red states means that even Republican governors and legislators will probably be averse to abandoning them,” says Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of Earth and environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania. “So there is some hope there.”

	











	It's unclear what will become of projects that were started due to the passage of the IRA or were helped along by it. Kammen says these cuts will likely have a “big effect,” and that they may suddenly find it difficult to obtain more capital for “project expansion and grid connection,” for example. “The amount of damage that is going to be done is high,” he says.


	There is also concern about Trump administration efforts to claw back funds that were already guaranteed to certain projects, which are being challenged in the courts. If the courts rule against the Trump administration, then that funding would remain intact.


	“These recent efforts by the Trump administration to cancel validly executed contracts are ridiculous,” Webb says. “It's up to Congress to determine what gets funded, and Congress sets the priorities in a statute like the IRA.”


	While many industrialized nations, from Europe to China, are preparing for the future and investing in renewable energy, the U.S. appears determined to double down on antiquated and withering energy sources. Some of the efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in America will continue on, such as those at the state or local level, but the Trump administration is doing everything it can to kill green energy at the federal level and even trying to block many of the local initiatives to move away from fossil fuels.

	Kammen says we're “hitting pause” on renewable energy development at exactly the wrong moment, with Webb adding that America is “looking backwards” while other nations are focusing on what's ahead of us. 


	“For U.S. competitiveness, it's really important,” Webb says. “This will have huge economic impacts. Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuel energy. Any consumer who has an energy bill should care about this.”

Glastonbury bosses have said they are “appalled” by comments made by rap duo Bob Vylan during their performance at the festival yesterday.


	Rapper Bobby Vylan of the group led crowds on the West Holts Stage in chants of “Free, free Palestine” and: “Death, death to the IDF [Israel Defence League]”.


	Responding in a statement shared to social media by festival boss Emily Eavis, organizers said they were “appalled” by the comments.


	“Glastonbury Festival was created in 1970 as a place for people to come together and rejoice in music, the arts and the best of human endeavour. As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism. We will always believe in – and actively campaign for – hope, unity, peace and love,” a statement read.

A post shared by Glastonbury Festival (@glastofest)


	“With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer's presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs.

	











	“However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan yesterday. Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”


	A similar statement was issued by the BBC as they confirmed that the set will not be available to watch on demand.

	











	“Some of the comments made during Bob Vylan's set were deeply offensive,” they said. “During this live stream on iPlayer, which reflected what was happening on stage, a warning was issued on screen about the very strong and discriminatory language. We have no plans to make the performance available on demand.”


	Police are also assessing the footage of their set to see if any offences have been committed, while The Independent reports that Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has spoken to BBC Director General Tim Davie “to seek an urgent explanation about what due diligence it carried out ahead of the Bob Vylan performance”.


	Bob Vylan were performing shortly before Kneecap, who delivered one of the most anticipated sets of the weekend. The festival had faced pressure from figures including Keir Starmer to cancel the performance after the band's Liam O hAnnaidh was charged with a terror offence after it was alleged that he unfurled a Hezbollah flag and said “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” at a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town late last year.

[Editor's note: The recap of episode four publishes June 30.]   

What does the face of evil look like?

It's not a wholly academic question, as far as Squid Game is concerned. There's a reason that almost all of the show's antagonists, from the Pink Guards all the way up to the VIPs running the contest, wear masks: Yes, it's to adopt the iconography of a cold and unfeelingly “fair” system. But it's also for the simple reason that evil is easier when your face is out of view. Geum-ja could have told us, when Geum-ja was still around to tell anyone anything. (And I'll get to that tragic conclusion in a minute.) But part of the unceasing, massively pain-in-the-ass work of being a good person is looking yourself in the face every morning, staring soberly at the ways your actions affect others, and judging—usually too harshly—how much negative impact you've had on the people around you. Evil is, in some ways, the basic rejection of that process of accountability, and it's much easier to do it in the safe and enclosing dark.

This little meditation is brought to you by “It's Not Your Fault,” an episode that's very concerned with who is—and isn't—hiding their faces. For example: We get our first glimpse at the actual mugs of the aforementioned VIPs, returning from the first season to bet on the death games, trade (badly dubbed) banter with each other, and briefly don the uniforms of guards so they can enjoy the cheap thrill of killing off some of the losers left over from Hide And Seek. We'll end up spending a fair amount of time with these assholes throughout this hour, so it's worth noting that they're not much changed from when we last saw them back in the original Squid Game: They're unrepentant monsters, to a woman and man—and the show's broadest characters by far and by design. The worst of our players have some measure of internal lives; the guards are people doing a job and indoctrinated to think of the players as trash; even Hwang In-ho is following his nihilistic philosophies to their purest and darkest expressions. The VIPs, though, are simply pigs, bored dilettantes with no capacity to see their victims as human beings. Whining and joking about their failed bets in English, they're part stand-ins for the show's murder-craving audience, part symbols of the global elite. Their existence is so blithely awful that it would stretch Squid Game‘s plausibility past the breaking point and into the realm of pure satire—if not for the fact that there's a part of me that suspects the mega-rich might genuinely be this callous and full of contempt for people “beneath them.”

What they're watching, from their luxurious viewing rooms, is a reset in the aftermath of the hell that was “The Starry Night.” Squid Game zooms back out for this rebuilding effort by necessity, checking in with all the various plotlines it eschewed last episode in favor of that horrifying focus: Choi's investigation into Captain Park back on the mainland, Jun-ho's ongoing search on the boat, and No-eul's efforts to smuggle (the still-gutshot) Player 246 off the island. None of it has the sheer vitality of the material actually taking place inside the player rooms, which has always been the issue with these wider looks at Squid Game‘s world. That being said, the knowledge that the show only has three episodes left to go after this does tighten up each of these plotlines in turn, so they feel terse and quick-moving for once, instead of like simple filler. By episode's end, we've seen No-eul being set up for a possible trap, Choi getting arrested after finding irrefutable evidence that Park is a former Pink Guard, and Jun-ho discovering the spot where his brother shot him at the climax of the previous game. All of these plotlines are moving toward a climax; the only question now is how much impact they'll end up having on the action proper, which remains, as always, with the players.

And it's with that main event that Squid Game takes time to give full (and final) focus to the best supporting character to have emerged over the course of its second and third seasons: Jang Geum-ja. We watch her at her best here, the older woman attending to new mother Jun-hee, throwing herself into (unsuccessful) pleas for humanity from the O voters, and trying to inspire Gi-hun to pick his head back up and find something worth giving a shit about instead of just laying down to die. Kang Ae-shim gives a beautiful performance throughout, never letting the despair eating away at Geum-ja over the death of her son leave her eyes—but also embodying incredible warmth. (Her last monologue to Gi-hun, about the basic unfairness of life, is especially affecting.) This character could have gone too broad at about 100 different points in Squid Game‘s second and third seasons, but Kang has found her humanity throughout. It's what makes the heartbreak of her suicide hit all the harder.

Credit to writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk: He absolutely fucking got me with this one. I didn't know why the Pink Guards were walking in with a coffin after another miserable night in the player room, matching Gi-hun's just-waking confusion—until his eyes alight on Geum-ja's body, which is hanging with a sheet around her neck from a distant bunk. Hwang shoots the reveal in a far shot, letting the reality of what you're seeing sink in; the sudden dump of a few meager stacks of won into the piggy bank a few seconds later underscores the near-casual horror of the moment. It's easy to see, in hindsight; half of what Geum-ja says in this episode is a plea for mothers to live for their kids that alludes to her own feelings of failure toward Yong-sik. But the reveal is still a shock—both for viewers and Gi-hun. The last thing Geum-ja did on this Earth was ask him to give enough of a shit to keep Jun-hee and her baby safe; her final act knocks him straight out of his self-pitying funk, just in time for the next game.

Which is, as a moaning VIP who drunkenly bet on her notes, one that feels especially unfair to a brand-new mother carting around both a baby and a shattered ankle. Riffing on the first season's glass bridge, we've once again got a trap-filled span for 24 remaining contestants to cross. But instead of a sacrifice-encouraging guessing game, the gimmick this time is simpler, if also more brutal: a “jump rope”—in actuality, a metal bar, moved with deadly speed by the Red Rover robot and her new friend from last season's stinger—that sweeps a narrow bridge about once every four seconds. Cross to the other side (and over a major gap in the middle) in 20 minutes, and you live. Hesitate for the whole time limit, you get shot. Get tagged by the bar…well, hey, Nam-gyu, what happens if you get tagged by the bar, bud?

After the “one game, one episode” focus of “The Starry Night,” “It's Not Your Fault” returns to the “see the start of the game to set the stakes, then get the conclusion in the next episode” approach most of the show's games have taken, with Nam-gyu as our “oh fuck, that would suck” sacrificial dickhead du jour. Suffering pretty nasty withdrawal after losing Thanos' cross o' pills last episode, he's manipulated by a vindictive Nam-su into going first on the jump-rope bridge. And he almost makes it halfway, retrieving the thrown cross—only to freeze up when he finds out the guy he bullied so mercilessly has tricked him, swapping out the final pill for bupkus. One sweep later, and he's gone, into the pit: one more named character down.

Which leaves Gi-hun to restore himself to his position as the show's hero, racing across the bridge with Jun-hee's newborn in hand to get the babe to safety. (In a moment that feels implausibly cruel even by this show's extremely brutal standards, the baby has been declared a player at the whims of the VIPs, idiotically hoping to turn Jun-hee into “Wonder Woman” to keep her kid alive.) Turning back to try to help the young mother across, though, Gi-hun is blocked by more players crossing. That's all well and good…until the first guy who makes it turns around to “congratulate” the guy behind him by wrestling him straight into the pit. And for all my talk of masks up top, maybe I'm ultimately off-base: It would be hard to describe the true face of evil better than the look of this guy, a pure expression of the O Voter philosophy, turning to Gi-hun with shameless glee in his eyes, and declaring—right before we cut to black—”I'm playing the game!”

It's a bleak end to an episode that counts as “breathing room” only thanks to the extreme contrast of the previous hour. (That is, we only lose two named characters here, instead of four, and there are at least some moments that aren't drenched in existential horror.) Squid Game has always been a dark show, and it's only gotten darker since the voting plotline was introduced last season, transforming players from victims into active participants in their own destruction. The series is trying desperately to reforge some hope here, mostly with the emphasis on the baby, a true innocent amidst the madness. But it really feels in danger of burning the whole thing down with misery and pessimism, especially now that we have the VIPs pouring the fuel of their awfulness onto the fire. This is a strong episode, anchored by a visually interesting game, and a great (farewell) performance from one of the show's best actors. But it remains to be seen if this series can land its ending without straining our credulity or souls past their breaking points.

Those who received invitations to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's highly exclusive wedding likely gave considerable thought to what to wear. After all, this was the wedding of the year, if not the wedding of the decade. But what do you wear to the pajama party of the year?

The A-listers who attended the couple's glamorous Venice wedding looked stunning in designer suits and dresses from Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, and other renowned brands. But the feathers, lace, and velvet guests wore to the pajama party on June 28 didn't disappoint, either.

The pajamas worn to this wedding pajama party were not the kind of clothes most of these celebrities probably sleep in. This was an opportunity to showcase another carefully selected outfit. For some, it was all about creating a sexy, alluring look. For others, it was stylish comfort. 

Leonardo DiCaprio, wearing a black baseball cap pulled down low, opted for a more relaxed look in a burgundy, button-up pajama top and matching pants. Over it, he wore a black jacket.

CBS News journalist Gayle King also looked more comfortable, wearing a white tank top dress with a colorful robe thrown over it in green, blue, yellow, and tan. Her bestie, Oprah, went a little more glam in a shiny brown satin pajama set. The turtleneck top was cinched at the waist and featured feathered cuffs. 

Producer Brian Grazer was set to party and sleep in his satin animal-print button-down pajamas. 

Along with the more laid-back and casual looks were lavish and sultry looks from the Kardashians, Jenners, and others. Kris, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner were spotted together on one of the water taxis headed to the Arsenale di Venezia. 

Kendall wore a royal blue suit and shorts outfit, with a gauzy hood to match. Kylie wore a silver, fringed crop top and a white skirt, while Kris was the more extravagant of the three in her patterned gray and white outfit, featuring a black feather boa on top.

Italian model Vittoria Ceretti and former “Dancing With the Stars” contestant Brooks Nader also looked stunning, but the showstopper of the night was Kim Kardashian.

The business mogul and reality star wore a low-cut, sultry corset over a tiny tulle skirt, with sheer stockings held up by garters. She also carried a satin and tulle cape, but it did little to cover her sexy outfit.

Along with their own fancy and stylish pajamas, guests were gifted footwear from the Bezos. The men received Vibi Venezia blue velvet Venetian slippers. Women, however, were given Amazon plush, black open-toe slippers.

Denis Villeneuve was named the next director of the beloved franchise earlier this week.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	For Henry Golding, taking on the famed role of James Bond may be more of a nightmare than a dream. 


	“I think that's every actor's kind of nightmare,” The Old Guard 2 actor told People at the film's Los Angeles premiere this week. His comments on the famed movie character came after Denis Villeneuve was named the next director of the franchise, the first from Amazon MGM Studios.




	“But at the same time, [you're] also wanting to kind of add something new to a franchise,” Golding added. “Why can't they bring out more agents or more OO's? I think that would be so much more fun, because there just isn't the restraints and the expectation.”

	The Crazy Rich Asians star added, “Maybe I'm just a pussy. I don't know. But I think I would love it so much more if there wasn't that overhanging cultural pressure.” 


	Following the news of Villeneuve being named the next James Bond director, there's been speculation about which actor will take on the titular role. As for now, it's merely known that Tanya Lapointe, Villeneuve's artistic partner and wife, will serve as an executive producer alongside Amy Pascal and David Heyman.


	“Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr. No with Sean Connery. I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come,” Villeneuve said in a statement Wednesday. “This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.”

Lauren Sánchez's walk down the aisle wasn't just a bridal entrance. It was a moment filled with love, family, and deep emotion. 

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

With her sons Nikko and Evan by her side, Lauren Sánchez walked toward Jeff Bezos, her heart full of gratitude and her eyes brimming with tears—a moment that carried deep meaning and love.

The couple tied the knot in a black-tie ceremony on Friday, June 27, on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy. 

A post shared by Lauren Sánchez Bezos (@laurensanchezbezos)

In an interview with Vogue published the same day, Sánchez revealed she was already tearing up thinking about the moment: “Her two sons will walk her down the aisle,” wrote Vogue's Chloe Malle. “She tells me, apologizing that she can't help tearing up as she envisions it.”

Sánchez shares 24-year-old Nikko with former NFL player Tony Gonzalez, and 19-year-old Evan with her ex-husband, Patrick Whitesell. She also shares a daughter, Ella, born in 2008.

Bezos, 61, has four children of his own—three sons and one daughter—with his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, though their names and lives have remained largely private.

The couple's multi-day wedding celebration welcomed an A-list guest list including Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Orlando Bloom, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Leonardo DiCaprio, Usher, and Tom Brady.

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

Also in attendance were Queen Rania of Jordan, Bill Gates and his partner Paula Hurd, François-Henri Pinault, and designers Diane von Fürstenberg, Domenico Dolce, and Tommy Hilfiger.

The ceremony began with a touching performance of “Can't Help Falling in Love” by Matteo Bocelli, according to a source, to warm cheers from the guests.

The bride wore a corseted, mermaid-style gown by Dolce & Gabbana, featuring hand-appliquéd Italian lace and sheer long sleeves. Her “something blue” was a sentimental token from her Blue Origin space flight.

Dolce & Gabbana also provided borrowed earrings, completing the refined and timeless look. Her gown made its debut on the cover of Vogue, accompanied by an intimate interview.

Shortly after the ceremony, Sánchez shared the first photo from the wedding on Instagram—now updated to her married name: Lauren Sánchez Bezos.In the photo, the newlyweds are seen holding hands and smiling in a sunlit garden, surrounded by their guests. She captioned the post simply: “06/27/2025 ❤️.”

Bezos and Sánchez have been planning their wedding for nearly two years.The Amazon founder proposed in May 2023 while on vacation in Europe. Sánchez recalled the moment in a Vogue interview later that year: “I blacked out a bit,” she said, referring to the moment he presented the 30-carat ring.

The romance between Channing Tatum and his girlfriend Inka Williams seems to be heating up. The actor shared a series of pics and videos of he and Williams on a romantic seaside vacation via his Instagram story on June 27. 

The story featured various snaps from the couple's getaway, including searching for shells, exploring a cave, and relaxing on a boat. Tatum, 45, also posted a video of Williams petting a cat and another pic of her lounging on a raft in a teeny bikini. 

Tatum and his model girlfriend were spotted together on various occasions beginning with a pre-Oscars party in February 2025. Williams made their relationship Instagram official on April 26.

Williams wished her man a happy birthday on her Instagram story, which included a series of pics of the actor accompanied by the message, “Happy life to the handsomest, kindest, funniest, stoopidest most gorgeous human ever!!!” She added, “Merci for making life beautiful and fun.”

A post shared by INKA (@inkawilliams)

While it looks as though Tatum and Williams are getting cozier, a source shared with Us Weekly that the couple's relationship is “low-key.” The source also told the outlet, “Channing just got out of a long-term relationship and is not looking to settle down right now.” 

The “Magic Mike” actor and his ex Zoё Kravitz called off their engagement in October of 2024 after three years together. Prior to dating Kravitz, Tatum had an on-and-off again relationship with singer Jessie J from 2018 until 2020. Tatum was married to dancer Jenna Dewan from 2009 until 2018 and they share an 11-year-old daughter, Everly.

While Tatum's love life seems very eventful, at the end of the day his daddy duties take priority. He and Williams' sunny getaway may have kicked off the season, but Tatum plans to spend the rest of the summer with his daughter, Everly, according to Us Weekly. 

Tatum and Everly appear to have a super cute father-daughter relationship, and it seems one thing they have in common is music. In March, Tatum and Everly were spotted at a Kelsea Ballerini concert, and the daddy-daughter duo also took in several Taylor Swift performances during the singer's Eras Tour. 

The “Blink Twice” star gushed about hanging with his daughter during an appearance on “Late NIght With Seth Myers” last summer. “Seeing it with your daughter is very different because you know, you gotta like go in,” Tatum said. “I was dancing like I'd never danced before.”

	More than 30 years after he'd last played the role, Mark Hamill had a much darker idea for Luke Skywalker's life in Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi (2017).


	The Emmy winner recalled his pitch for writer/director Rian Johnson about where Luke's life had taken him in the years since Episode VI — Return of the Jedi (1983) that would make him turn his back on the Force before returning in Episode VII — The Force Awakens (2015).


	“I thought, what could make someone give up a devotion to what is basically a religious entity, to give up being a Jedi,” he explained on the Bullseye podcast.

	“Well, the love of a woman,” Hamill continued. “So, he falls in love with a woman. He gives up being a Jedi. They have a child together. At some point the child, as a toddler, picks up an unattended lightsaber, pushes the button, and is killed instantly. The wife is so full of grief, she kills herself.”


	Hamill's latest interview comes after he shot down any hopes of Luke returning for another installment in the Disney and Lucasfilm franchise, after the character died during a pivotal moment in The Last Jedi, becoming one with the Force.


	“I am so grateful to George [Lucas] for letting me be a part of that back in the days, the humble days when George called Star Wars ‘the most expensive low-budget movie ever made,'” he told ComicBook.com. “We never expected it to become a permanent franchise and a part of pop culture like that. But my view is, I had my time. I'm appreciative of that, but I really think they should focus on the future and all the new characters.”

	











	Hamill jokingly added, “And by the way, when I disappeared in [The Last Jedi], I left my robes behind. And there's no way I'm gonna appear as a naked Force ghost. I'm just letting you know that right now.”

That is such a better idea than what we got from (RY)an Johnson. Hammil knows the character. Why the hell did they not go with that idea!!!

Good thing Mark Hammill just showed up on set and spoke lines.  The guy has absolutely NO talent for anything else.

Sounds so depressing. What a terrible idea.

A reason why most writers, directors & producers hate the moment they hear “hey, actor wants to discuss story & character ideas”….

Yikes. Actors are not writers. That's clear here!

Simon's back pain became "unmanageable," says a statement released Saturday (June 28).

	Ashley Iasimone



Paul Simon has canceled two concerts this weekend, according to a statement released just hours before a performance scheduled for Saturday night (June 28) at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Simon was set to play the venue both Saturday and Sunday night.


	“Regretfully, Paul Simon must cancel two shows tonight June 28 and tomorrow night June 29 — at Philadelphia's Academy of Music,” read the statement, which can be found on Simon's Instagram account. “Paul has been struggling with chronic and intense back pain. Today it became unmanageable and demands immediate attention. Unfortunately we have to cancel these shows at this time, as we don't have the ability to reschedule them.”

	











	“We are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates,” the memo said.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The message instructed ticketholders for Simon's June 28-29 concerts, which were a part of his A Quiet Celebration Tour, to “please go to your point of purchase or local ticket provider for a full refund.”


	Though Simon, 83, had indicated his tour back in 2018 was a farewell tour — at the time, he'd said he was suffering from significant hearing loss — in February 2025, he announced a spring/summer tour after making an appearance on the televised SNL50 celebration (singing “Homeward Bound” with Sabrina Carpenter).

	











	Simon's 2025 tour, which made it to New York City just before Philadelphia, began in April and has dates scheduled through early August. At press time, his next tour date is in Long Beach, California, on July 7, followed by stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and Seattle.

	As the search for the next James Bond reaches the final stretch, Henry Golding shared his thoughts on the seemingly coveted role.


	The British actor recently explained why the 007 lead character is “every actor's kind of nightmare” following news that Denis Villeneuve will helm the next installment in the 50-year franchise.


	“But at the same time, [you're] also wanting to kind of add something new to a franchise,” he told People. “Why can't they bring out more agents or more 00's? I think that would be so much more fun, because there just isn't the restraints and the expectation.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Golding added, “Maybe I'm just a p***y. I don't know. But I think I would love it so much more if there wasn't that overhanging cultural pressure.”


Daniel Craig played the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.


	This week, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Villeneuve to direct the next installment amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Tanya Lapointe will executive produce.


	After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film.

	











	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”

Aaron Pierre.

I would think every actor's nightmare would be not getting any work, but what do I know.

“Why can't they bring out more agents or more 00's? I think that would be so much more fun”

They have already done that. It is called Mission Impossible. I am talking about the original series.

One of the main appeal of Bond is that he acts alone in most of the movie. Stick to acting bro and leave writing to the writers.

Bond is dead.
Superman is dead.TV series,
Multiple 007's was done in the first movie version of Casino Royale (admittedly a farce of Bond).
I say this as an Ian Fleming fan . Get Over It
And yes I  was disappointed Bond died but he did.

And considering the U.S. has been taken over by a fascist Putin-controlled felon and his criminal henchmen, there's no pioint in pretending Bond even matters anymore.

Bro, don't worry, you ain't never gonna get it.

Bro, don't worry, he never said he wanted it.  You ain't never gonna get it either.

Paul Simon has cancelled two shows on the A Quiet Celebration tour, his first since 2018, as he undergoes a minor surgery.


	On Saturday, the 16x Grammy winner had to cancel his June 28 and 29 shows scheduled for Philadelphia's Academy of Music following “chronic and intense back pain.”


	“Today it became unmanageable and demands immediate attention,” reads a statement on Simon's Instagram. “Unfortunately we have to cancel these shows at this time, as we don't have the ability to reschedule them.”


	The post continued, “However, we are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates.”

Of the very small number of currently working Hollywood directors who could be said to be at, or even above, the level of Christopher Nolan in terms of both producing power and name recognition, James Cameron is almost certainly the one most willing to talk a little shit. Cameron has many laudable traits as both a filmmaker and an interview subject, but holding his tongue isn't one of them—something that became obvious in a recent conversation he had with Deadline, about a new film centered on the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and where Nolan came in for some genuine critique over his blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer.

Cameron was speaking at length about Ghosts Of Hiroshima, his planned film adaptation of the book of the same name, soon to arrive from his old buddy (and fellow Titanic and nuclear war obsessive) Charles R. Pellegrino. As with underwater travel, the intricate hair-bonding rituals of the Na'vi, and basically everything else he sets his moviemaking mind to, Cameron has thought and researched about this topic a lot, it is very clear, and he sounds really excited/horrified to tell the story of the bombs dropping. And that includes doing his damnedest to center the conversation in the viewpoint of the people the bombs were actually dropped on, something he (as Spike Lee did a few years back) criticizes Nolan's movie for flinching away from. “It's interesting what he stayed away from,” Cameron noted of Nolan's film, after being reminded of the implausibility of turning Robert Oppenheimer's life story into a massive box office property.

“Look, I love the filmmaking,” Cameron acknowledges. “But I did feel that it was a bit of a moral cop out. Because it's not like Oppenheimer didn't know the effects. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see—and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film–but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I'm just stupid that way.” (When told that Nolan felt it wasn't the place of his particular film to tackle the effects of the bombs from the perspective of the people they were dropped on, Cameron quipped, “Okay, I'll put up my hand. I'll do it, Chris. No problem. You come to my premiere and say nice things.”)

Cameron has been on this particular topic for multiple decades at this point—this is the man who filmed that sequence from Terminator 2, so take it as read that he thinks about nuclear bombs more than most people—including traveling to Japan with Pellegrino to meet with Tsutomo Yamaguchi, one of the only people to have survived both bombings. (And who ultimately died of stomach cancer in his 90s.) Cameron is, among other things, un-shy about admitting he has limits on the story he wants to tell, too, saying he has no interest in using the film to discus the politics that led to the dropping of the bomb, and simply wants to capture its effects on the people who were at literal ground zero:

I don't want to get into the politics of, should it have been dropped, should they have done it, and all the bad things Japan did to warrant it, or any of that kind of moralizing and politicizing. I just want to deal in a sense with what happened, almost as if you could somehow be there and survive and see it… I just think it's so important right now for people to remember what these weapons do. This is the only case where they've been used against a human target. Setting aside all the politics and the fact that I'm going to make a film about Japanese people…I don't even speak Japanese, although I have a lot of friends there. I've been there a million times, and I may need to work with a Japanese writer, a Japanese producer, so that I am not a complete outsider to their cultural perspective. I want to keep it as a kind of neutral witness to an event that actually happened to human beings, so that we can keep that flame alive, that memory. They've only died in vain if we forget what that was like and we incur that a thousand fold upon ourselves and future generations.

Olivia Rodrigo welcomed Ed Sheeran to her stage for a surprise duet of “The A Team” in London on Friday night (June 27). Together the two pop hitmakers, guitars in hand, strummed and sang Sheeran's debut single for the U.K. crowd at Hyde Park's BST (British Summer Time) concert series, where Rodrigo was performing ahead of a headlining slot at Glastonbury later this weekend.

	Post-show, Sheeran shared footage of the moment on Instagram. The performance video shows the two musicians harmonizing on the chorus of “The A Team.”

	











	“Been a fan of Olivia's since Drivers License blew my mind back at the start of 2021,” he wrote. “Both albums are no skips for me, I'm a proper fan. We first met at the rock and roll hall of fame back in 2022, sat next to each other with her mum and my dad and went on to hang and keep in touch from there.”

	Of his Friday night plans, Sheeran said, “Was gonna go watch the show anyway but she hit me and asked to sing The A Team with her, which was such a buzz. That song turns 15 this year, and I remember playing it to rooms with no one in it in 2010, so to still be playing it to new fans with one of the brightest stars of the next generation is an honour and a privilege. Rock Glasto headline Sunday @oliviarodrigo , UK loves you x.”

	











	“you are the best ever ed!!! appreciate you so much. last night was a blast,” Rodrigo commented on the post Saturday morning.


	Also spotted at Rodrigo's Friday gig was a smiling Sabrina Carpenter who enjoyed the show from the balcony, as seen in photos published by the Daily Mail.


	“The A Team,” first released in 2011, was Sheeran's first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 16 in 2012.


	Following Rodrigo's concert, on Saturday Sheeran posted another treat for fans on TikTok: a short mashup of his “Perfect” with Rodrigo's “Happier,” sung together.


	Sheeran previously praised Rodrigo's 2021 breakthrough hit, “Drivers License,” as a flawless debut single, and noted both her debut and sophomore full-length albums, Sour and Guts, are “unskippable… it's just, as a record, just a great record.”

Jensen Ackles has spoken out on what exactly is getting in the way of Supernatural season 16. Every season of Supernatural brought a new twist to the dark fantasy series, expanding on its central relationship. Guided by creator Eric Kripke, Jensen Ackles played Dean Winchester alongside Jared Padalecki as his brother, Sam, for fifteen years. From 2005 to 2020, these brothers were the emotional core of a show that often seemed like it would never end. That's why so many fans, along with cast and crew, still contemplate another season, although it may not come for a while.

There is one standout reason why a follow-up to Supernatural season 16 may still be a long way off, according to Ackles. The Supernatural actor spoke to Collider, confirming that his schedule is being totally dominated by Amazon and the TV series he is currently filming for it. This is getting in the way of him being able to film another season of Supernatural, and Supernatural season 16 wouldn't be the same without Dean. Currently working on The Boys, Vought Rising, Gen V, and Countdown, Ackles commented on Amazon's current control over Supernatural's continuation:

Well, it sounds like Amazon's going to have to come up with an idea on that one, because they're controlling my schedule right now.

Jensen Ackles is one busy actor, which seriously limits his availability going forward, directly impacting the possibility of another season of Supernatural. Although Ackles is grateful for having hit his peak relatively late in his career, he acknowledges the disruption this causes to the show that made him. Ackles spoke about his concern about turning up to the set of The Boys as "one of" Kripke's guys and not being taken seriously, whereas his affection and loyalty to both the showrunner and Supernatural are clear. Ackles would clearly love to create another season.

The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural.

Ackles explicitly commented that "We continue to talk about it," while confirming that "If it happens, then let's go." This means that, like many fans and cast members, Ackles would be more than happy to commit a lot more time to the Winchesters in Supernatural. But Ackles would have to work with Amazon to negotiate this time between filming his other Amazon shows. The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural during breaks from Vought Rising, The Boys, Gen V, and Countdown.

 It seems apparent that Ackles will be swamped with Amazon Prime Video work for a long time, but that he could be able to find time for everyone's favorite brothers at some point. Even if The Boys' Supernatural reunion is the only time Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins get on set together in the next two years, Amazon may find it easy to schedule in some time for Ackles to film Supernatural soon after. Vought Rising is only just beginning, and Countdown is also in its early days, but The Boys is coming to an end in its next season.

Supernatural could always come back for season 16, but there is another way that the popular show could continue with far fewer difficulties.

To get around Ackles' busy schedule, Jared Padalecki's Sam Winchester could lead a Supernatural season 16 with Bobby and Castiel, but this would require narrative gymnastics. Of course, Eric Kripke, Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, and Supernatural's other core team may not be keen to run a show that doesn't center on its two focal siblings, and fans would almost certainly be upset if that were the case. But, luckily, Ackles may not be too many years away from Supernatural season 16 anyway.

The cancellation of the Frasier reboot was an insult to the legacy of Dr. Crane in more ways than one.

As incredible as Alan Ritchson may seem in Reacher, the Neagley spin-off already seems to have one major advantage with its main titular character.

The MCU's first-ever supervillain never received his official comic book codename. The franchise has finally changed that, 17 years later.

Apple TV+'s Murderbot is one of the best sci-fi shows on the entire platform, but as a big fan of the books it's based on, I'm a bit disappointed.

Chris Evans' return to the MCU as Captain America is a big question, but it would be a much better move to see him back in another franchise.

James Gunn reveals whether the DCU's Batman will wear the iconic blue-and-gray Batsuit and exterior trunks in the upcoming The Brave and the Bold.

The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is one of Studio Ghibli's best and most underrated movies, but it holds a shocking anime record that few know about.

Netflix subscribers are recommending a 'criminally overlooked' TV series with a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score.

First releasing in 2021, the two-part series managed to garner 96.7 million hours in just two years, as per figures from Flixpatrol.

With so many new titles joining Netflix, it can be a little overwhelming to chose your next binge-watch.

Advert

And even if something's previously pulled in big numbers, it may still have slipped under your radar.

If you enjoyed all 14 seasons of adult animation Archer, too, then this TV series should be next on your watch-list.

The animated sci-fi is set in the US - Washington D.C, to be exact.

It centers on Cognito, Inc., a clandestine 'Deep State' organization that employs a team of misfit specialists to manage and conceal real-world conspiracy theories - from reptilian shapeshifters to the Moon landing cover-up.

Advert

While delving into the world of the weird and wonderful, they must also balance their own personal issues as well as the never-ending slog of corporate politics.

Former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi is the brains behind the show, while Bojack Horseman's Mike Hollingsworth and Gravity Falls' Alex Hirsch serve as executive co-producers.

Lizzy Caplan, Christian Slater, Clark Duke, Tisha Campbell and Andy Daly all lend their voices for the 'binge-worthy' series.

Advert

The show in question is called Inside Job, if you hadn't already guessed.

Racking up an impressive 91 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from fans, the series premiered in two halves; Part 1 landed in October 2021, while Part 2 concluded the season in November 2022.

Fans on the site hailed the show 'binge-worthy,' as one described it 'hands down one of the greatest cartoons Netflix has released.

Over on Reddit, one subscriber was after 'hidden gem' series to get stuck into.

Advert

Among the suggestions was Inside Job, with the first person to recommend it describing it as an 'animated show that basically roasts every conspiracy theory while somehow building a heartwarming ensemble.'

"Criminally overlooked," they added - and others were quick to agree.

"Sucks that it wasn't renewed," one person said, "Theme song was a banger too."

Advert

"For people that loved Archer, this is indeed a gem," a second agreed.

"This show is hilarious and includes every single conspiracy theory," a third said.

A fourth gave their verdict: "This, OP. It became a sleeping comfort show for me after the 2nd watch-through. Ticks all the boxes."

Both parts of Inside Job are available to stream now on Netflix.

PEMBROKE:  A Massachusetts woman experienced a surprising event when she came across a mysterious viral object in the sky and recorded the situation on video. 

Colleen McCormack, resident of Pembroke, was having a relaxed time in her outdoor hot tub around 9 pm on Wednesday when she observed an unusual sight above her. “I was in the hot tub, looked up at the sky, and saw something small floating. I thought, ‘What is that?'” Colleen McCormack said in an interview with WHDH-TV. She promptly recorded the scene on her phone.



The footage exposes what appears to be a glowing object descending rapidly. “It looked as though it was on fire or something, and it was just coming down very quickly,” she described in an interview with WFXT-TV. “I have no idea what it could have been.”

Despite the spectacular visuals, the event was notably silent. “It was quiet. You couldn't hear anything, which only added to my confusion,” McCormack remarked. “Typically, when objects fly overhead, you can hear them.”

The unidentified viral object remains a mystery, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that there were no reports of debris or incidents involving aircraft in the vicinity and refrained from commenting on the video evidence.

Local police and fire departments also indicated they had received no related calls or sightings.

McCormack, still feeling unsettled by the incident, stated, “My heart was racing because I just looked up and thought, ‘Oh my God, what is about to happen?'”

This UFO sighting in Massachusetts has generated considerable interest online, with various theories ranging from meteor fragments to experimental aircraft. However, in the absence of official clarification, the nature of the mystery object remains an unresolved mystery
