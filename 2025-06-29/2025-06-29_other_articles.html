                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jensen Ackles has spoken out on what exactly is getting in the way of Supernatural season 16. Every season of Supernatural brought a new twist to the dark fantasy series, expanding on its central relationship. Guided by creator Eric Kripke, Jensen Ackles played Dean Winchester alongside Jared Padalecki as his brother, Sam, for fifteen years. From 2005 to 2020, these brothers were the emotional core of a show that often seemed like it would never end. That's why so many fans, along with cast and crew, still contemplate another season, although it may not come for a while. The Supernatural actor spoke to Collider, confirming that his schedule is being totally dominated by Amazon and the TV series he is currently filming for it. This is getting in the way of him being able to film another season of Supernatural, and Supernatural season 16 wouldn't be the same without Dean. Well, it sounds like Amazon's going to have to come up with an idea on that one, because they're controlling my schedule right now. Although Ackles is grateful for having hit his peak relatively late in his career, he acknowledges the disruption this causes to the show that made him. Ackles spoke about his concern about turning up to the set of The Boys as "one of" Kripke's guys and not being taken seriously, whereas his affection and loyalty to both the showrunner and Supernatural are clear. The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural. This means that, like many fans and cast members, Ackles would be more than happy to commit a lot more time to the Winchesters in Supernatural. The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural during breaks from Vought Rising, The Boys, Gen V, and Countdown. It seems apparent that Ackles will be swamped with Amazon Prime Video work for a long time, but that he could be able to find time for everyone's favorite brothers at some point. Even if The Boys' Supernatural reunion is the only time Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins get on set together in the next two years, Amazon may find it easy to schedule in some time for Ackles to film Supernatural soon after. To get around Ackles' busy schedule, Jared Padalecki's Sam Winchester could lead a Supernatural season 16 with Bobby and Castiel, but this would require narrative gymnastics. Of course, Eric Kripke, Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, and Supernatural's other core team may not be keen to run a show that doesn't center on its two focal siblings, and fans would almost certainly be upset if that were the case. But, luckily, Ackles may not be too many years away from Supernatural season 16 anyway. Supernatural is an American dark fantasy drama television series created by Eric Kripke. The series follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester as they hunt demons, ghosts, monsters, and other supernatural beings across the United States. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. As incredible as Alan Ritchson may seem in Reacher, the Neagley spin-off already seems to have one major advantage with its main titular character. The MCU's first-ever supervillain never received his official comic book codename. Chris Evans' return to the MCU as Captain America is a big question, but it would be a much better move to see him back in another franchise. The Tale of the Princess Kaguya is one of Studio Ghibli's best and most underrated movies, but it holds a shocking anime record that few know about.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First releasing in 2021, the two-part series managed to garner 96.7 million hours in just two years, as per figures from Flixpatrol. With so many new titles joining Netflix, it can be a little overwhelming to chose your next binge-watch. And even if something's previously pulled in big numbers, it may still have slipped under your radar. If you enjoyed all 14 seasons of adult animation Archer, too, then this TV series should be next on your watch-list. It centers on Cognito, Inc., a clandestine 'Deep State' organization that employs a team of misfit specialists to manage and conceal real-world conspiracy theories - from reptilian shapeshifters to the Moon landing cover-up. Former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi is the brains behind the show, while Bojack Horseman's Mike Hollingsworth and Gravity Falls' Alex Hirsch serve as executive co-producers. Lizzy Caplan, Christian Slater, Clark Duke, Tisha Campbell and Andy Daly all lend their voices for the 'binge-worthy' series. The show in question is called Inside Job, if you hadn't already guessed. Over on Reddit, one subscriber was after 'hidden gem' series to get stuck into. Among the suggestions was Inside Job, with the first person to recommend it describing it as an 'animated show that basically roasts every conspiracy theory while somehow building a heartwarming ensemble.' "Criminally overlooked," they added - and others were quick to agree. "This show is hilarious and includes every single conspiracy theory," a third said. It became a sleeping comfort show for me after the 2nd watch-through. Both parts of Inside Job are available to stream now on Netflix.</p>

'” Colleen McCormack said in an interview with WHDH-TV. She promptly recorded the scene on her phone. The footage exposes what appears to be a glowing object descending rapidly. You couldn't hear anything, which only added to my confusion,” McCormack remarked. “Typically, when objects fly overhead, you can hear them.” Local police and fire departments also indicated they had received no related calls or sightings. McCormack, still feeling unsettled by the incident, stated, “My heart was racing because I just looked up and thought, ‘Oh my God, what is about to happen? This UFO sighting in Massachusetts has generated considerable interest online, with various theories ranging from meteor fragments to experimental aircraft.
