            If you're someone who clicks on an article about political engagement, you're probably a person who likes keeping up with the news. Maybe you find yourself constantly scrolling social media. You care deeply about politics, and with so much happening, you want to make sure you're on top of it all.
    


            You're not alone — but most of the country doesn't share your approach to the news.
    


The latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS shows that the attention divide splits Americans roughly into thirds. There's a high-attention group, consisting of the 32% saying they frequently seek out the latest news. A middle group of 31% has people who say they follow major developments but don't seek them out. And then there's the lower-attention group: 25% who say they pay attention only when necessary and another 12% who tune out altogether.
    


            Those fault lines are key to understanding American politics. Highly engaged Americans were more averse to sending in troops to the demonstrations in Los Angeles, according to other polls this year. President Donald Trump scored better on immigration among voters who hadn't heard as much about specific, high-profile detentions or deportations. And highly engaged Americans, much more than the other groups, believe that the nation's democracy is under attack.
    


            Those at either end of the ideological spectrum are the mostly closely plugged in: Fifty-one percent of those who call themselves very liberal and 47% of those who say they're very conservative fall into this group, compared with 35% of those who call themselves only somewhat liberal, and fewer than 3 in 10 who say they're moderate (29%) or somewhat conservative (22%).
    


            Robert Timm, a 75-year-old Democrat from Ukiah, California, has a daily routine: He starts his day reading the latest headlines on Yahoo, frequently talks politics with his wife, and ends the evening watching the news on television, particularly MSNBC.
    


            “I'm typically watching it fairly closely because I'm concerned about a lot of things that are happening in the country,” said Timm, one of the 2,539 people included in the survey. Many of those concerns center on Trump, who Timm says is “obviously trying to do what he wants, regardless of how it affects the people in the country.”
    


            Older Americans are notably likelier to fall into this category: Fifty-two percent of those older than 65 say they frequently seek out political news, compared with one-third or fewer among any younger age group. Those with college degrees and in wealthier households are also somewhat more likely than average to seek out the news, as are White Americans and men.
    


            Among the highly engaged, roughly 9 in 10 say they see important differences between the parties. Asked about a series of different issues, many have no trouble picking which party better aligns with their views. And a broad majority, 60%, feel that democracy is under attack.
    


            Among those paying less attention, nearly 40% say their views don't align with either party's across a majority of the issues they were asked about in the survey. Nearly 3 in 10 see little difference between Democrats and Republicans.
    


            “Honestly, I think they're the same,” said Tyler Ruth, a mother from Hilton Head, South Carolina, who participated in the poll. “Different color, but they're the same. Go about different things differently, but they're the same because they all have money and they hold power. They don't have to worry about, ‘How am I going to make ends meet for a couple of days until I get paid?'”
    


            Nearly half of Americans who spend less time on politics say they don't see either party as capable of getting things done, 10 points higher than among the mostly highly engaged group, and just 37% see democracy as under attack.
    


            Americans younger than 45, people of color and those with lower household incomes are all relatively likely to say they follow politics only when necessary or not at all, as are people without college degrees. And although they're not making an effort to seek out political news, most aren't completely cut off from it, either.
    


            In the past, Ruth said, politics wasn't a top priority for her — she's juggling raising children with special needs while also attending college for social work. But after hearing about cuts to her children's care this year, she started following the news more closely, including efforts by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services to build a database for tracking autism.
    


            In CNN's survey, a majority even of those in the lower attention group said they still get some information about current events, and nearly half said they voted in last year's election. Overall, those who did broke in favor of Trump, a finding that dovetails with recently released data highlighting the key role infrequent voters played in securing Trump's victory. And it may reflect Trump's strength last year in winning over voters who typically don't express much trust in the political system.
    


            “I'm not a party system fan at all,” said Peter Montes, a poll respondent from Conroe, Texas, who works in the oil and gas industry. “I think that the parties need to be abolished, and we need to reset.” While he doesn't consider himself an outright Trump fan, he sees the president as bringing a business-minded ethos to the political sphere in a way he hasn't seen since Ross Perot, and said he's been paying closer attention to the news since Trump returned to office this year.
    


            But looking ahead to future elections, he doesn't see many other politicians with similar appeal. Nor, this far out, is he especially excited for next year's midterms. “I'll see the news, but I'm not going to go and stalk the news out to figure out what's going on. I'll just check in every once in a while,” he said.
    


The CNN poll was conducted among 2,539 adults nationwide by SSRS from May 5-26, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources — an address-based sample and a random-digit dial sample of prepaid cell phone numbers — and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail or by phone. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","A father's grief when a ‘light to the world' is put out","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/us/bob-milgrim-remembering-sarah","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            In May, Bob Milgrim was taking one of his regular long walks with his wife Nancy in suburban Kansas City when something struck his mind.
    


            “I said, ‘Nancy, you know, our lives are perfect. We have two beautiful children, we couldn't ask for more.'”
    


            Their only small sadness was the feeling their daughter Sarah, 26, would likely not live close to their home in Prairie Village, Kansas, when she got married and they wouldn't get to babysit grandchildren as often as they would like.
    


            Less than a week later, dreams of grandchildren were gone, and the comfort of a perfect life was shredded. On May 21, Sarah was shot dead with her boyfriend Yaron Lischinsky as they were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC. The gunman told arriving police officers, “I did it for Gaza,” a witness said.
    


            The Milgrims went from musing about babies to burying their own child. From dreaming of their daughter's bright future to being left with only memories.
    


            For Bob, there is so much to remember and admire about his only daughter.
    


            “She was everything. She did everything,” he told CNN, reeling off a proud father's list of Sarah's achievements in sports and music, and how she had sung in a choir in European cathedrals on a tour while in high school.  She also was a beekeeper and volunteered to feed injured birds of prey at a rescue center, he said.
    


            And she had an early and enduring love for dogs. Some mornings Bob would find a young Sarah sleeping with the family pet in its crate. At other times, she would make random four-legged friends.
    


            “She would bring stray dogs home,” he said. “If she saw a dog without a collar, we'd have to find a home for it or locate the owner … She loved all forms of life.”
    


            “Sarah was a light to the world from the very beginning.”
    


            Bob was getting ready to go to bed that Wednesday night last month when his phone lit up with news alerts of a shooting in Washington, DC. At first, he wasn't concerned, but each new piece of information that came out pointed more and more to Sarah and Yaron.
    


            The location of the attack was at the Capital Jewish Museum at F and 3rd in Northwest DC. He didn't know Sarah was there, but it was the kind of thing she might do — she often went to events after work.
    


            Then it was reported that staffers from the Israeli embassy were involved, and that it was an event for young professionals — just the kind of people Sarah reached out to. And then that a man and a woman had been killed together.
    


            “I knew that Sarah and Yaron were the only couple from the embassy in that age category. And so then I began to become very concerned,” Bob said.
    


            He'd already called and texted Sarah but got no response. He called police and the FBI for information, only to be told everyone was responding to the shooting. Finally, someone asked if he could supply Sarah's passport information.
    


            He went to his bedroom to look for the copy he had, inadvertently waking his wife, Nancy. She tracked Sarah's phone to the museum. “We pretty much knew it was her,” Bob said.
    


            At that moment a call from a Washington number gave the Milgrims a flash of hope that Yaron was phoning them. But it was the Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, calling to tell them their daughter was dead.
    


            They told him they already knew. But Leiter had more news. Yaron had bought an engagement ring the week before.
    


            “We knew they were very, very serious. We knew they were in love — their bond was unbelievable,” Bob said. He also knew the couple was planning to visit Israel the following week for Sarah to meet Yaron's family. But it was a surprise to learn that Yaron planned to propose in Jerusalem.
    


            Soon after her older brother Jacob had his bar mitzvah, Sarah told her parents she didn't want a big party for her own coming-of-age ceremony. But she did want it to be in Israel.
    


            Her bat mitzvah two years later was also the first time Bob had been to Israel, and he saw an almost immediate change in his then-teenaged daughter. “From that point forward, for whatever reason, we don't know, she felt more comfortable in Israel than any place else,” he said.
    


            She spent summers and a college semester there, and volunteered for Tech2Peace, an organization that brought Israelis and Palestinians together and taught them technology skills.
    


            Sarah helped with the sharing of cultures and finding opportunities to bond, like camping in the Negev Desert, Bob said, adding that she also traveled to the West Bank and made friends with Palestinian women there.
    


            Sarah had experienced antisemitism at her high school, where someone once spray-painted swastikas on a building and where hateful jokes were aimed at her. As Jews, Bob said, “we're always concerned” about the possibility of violence. When she started working at the Israeli embassy in Washington less than a month after the Hamas attacks of October 7, 2023, she became familiar with the extensive security used there.
    


            Bob said he and Nancy had felt it would be OK for her to travel to Israel with the boyfriend she'd met at the embassy and whom she had first mentioned to her dad by saying, “You're going to love this guy, he's a lot like you. He's a real gentleman.”
    


            As the relationship between the young couple became more serious, Sarah's parents tried to show him the best of Kansas City in the hopes that Yaron — who grew up in Germany and Israel — might be persuaded to stay in the US. But even though Yaron loved barbecue and Costco, Bob said they knew the couple would likely relocate to Israel.
    


            “She loved Judaism and loved Israel,” Bob said of Sarah, his voice breaking, adding he hoped love would be her legacy.
    


            “I want people to remember her and remember what she did and remember that she didn't hate anybody,” he said. “She didn't hate Palestinians. She didn't hate Muslims. She loved them all, yet many people hated her … for being Jewish.”
    


            He talked of how people Sarah had been close to had cut off contact when she began working at the embassy, how they would even post hateful messages and how none of them offered condolences to him after her death.
    


            “The people that hated her never stopped to ask her, how did she feel? And they never asked her, what is your viewpoint on how things in the Middle East should be settled? They just assumed that she was bad,” he said.
    


            A few weeks before his own family tragedy, Bob said he and Nancy were on one of the first flights into Reagan National Airport in Washington after it reopened following a military helicopter and passenger plane crash nearby that killed 67.
    


            “I realized (dozens) of people had lost their lives and (I was) thinking about all the families and the horrific grief that they were going through. And I became emotional. And little did I know that a few months later I'd be going through the same thing.”
    


            Earlier this month, Bob and Nancy traveled to Washington, DC, to clean out Sarah's home. They had helped her to move in, and Bob remembered her excitement that day as she looked forward to all that was ahead, a future now unfulfilled.
    


            “We were the first people to go into her apartment since the murder,” he said. “It was like a freeze frame in time — the cup of coffee, half drunk, was on the counter. There was a little bit of coffee left in the coffee pot … it was one of the hardest, one of the most difficult days of my life, or Nancy's life.”
    


            They had also hoped to meet Yaron's siblings in Washington at a Kennedy Center performance by the US-Israel Opera Initiative that was dedicated to the slain couple. But the outside world intruded again when airports were closed in the Iran-Israel conflict and the Lischinsky family could not travel.
    


            One of Bob Milgrim's favorite memories is from a time in Sarah's childhood when she looked to him as a teacher. They were walking outside one morning when Sarah wondered aloud why the sidewalk was dry but the grass was wet even though it hadn't been raining.
    


            “I had to explain dew to her, and she goes, ‘Dad, you know everything!'” he remembered with a chuckle.
    


            After she was killed, Bob marveled at how much Sarah had taught him, too.
    


            “I've learned how to be good and how to respect other people and how important it is for there to be love in the world and to see good in the world. And that's what Sarah saw,” he said. “And since her tragic death, I've seen much more of it. I've seen much more good, and bad.
    


            “Of course, the bad was horrific, and it could not have been any worse. But the outpouring of love, both from the Jewish community and all communities around the world is what's keeping us going right now. And it's been unbelievable.”
    


            Sarah has been laid to rest in Kansas City. Bob and Nancy have taken the pictures off the walls in Sarah's apartment, and the magnets off her refrigerator. They've kept some of her things and donated the rest. Now, Bob echoes the traditional Jewish message to the bereaved: zichronam l'vracha, or “May their memory be a blessing.”
    


            “Her memory is wonderful,” he said.  “And we need to have the courage to make it a blessing, so the world would be a better place.”
    


            Sarah's beloved goldendoodle Andy is now with her parents in Kansas. The dog was the first thing Bob thought of when a victim's assistance officer asked if he needed help with anything.
    


            “We told them the dog was locked up somewhere,” Bob said. “The agent said, ‘We'll take care of getting Andy back to Kansas City somehow.'” The dog was found at Yaron's apartment in Washington and flown to Kansas by that evening.
    


            But for the Milgrims, the hole Sarah left is huge.
    


            “The void of her personality and the aura of her being around us cannot be replaced. There's nothing that could fill that hole,” Bob said. “The three of us, Nancy and Jacob and I, will do our best.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","The Spanish town where locals soak each other with wine","https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/29/travel/spain-wine-battle-haro-rioja-batalla-del-vino","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","


            A glass of Burgundy sipped during dinner. A chilled Chardonnay while the sun goes down. A sparkling Champagne at a wedding. Typically, a glass of wine is something savored.
    


            Except in one quiet town in Northern Spain, where it's used for ammunition.
    


            Every June 29, hundreds of locals gather in Haro for a festival to celebrate the wine for which the surrounding La Rioja region is famous, culminating in La Batalla del Vino — the Battle of Wine.
    


            What once began as a religious procession to the nearby Hermitage of San Felices, a historic hilltop place of worship, has now evolved into an annual vibrant cultural celebration where thousands of participants drench each other with red wine using water guns, buckets and bottles.
    


            The chaotic and frenetic event can draw crowds of tourists eager to soak up the atmosphere. But, despite the huge quantities of wine launched through the air, local officials are now worried about visitors turning up to soak up too much booze.
    


            “We must not transform this into just another drinking event,” José Luis Pérez Pastor, La Rioja's minister of culture, tourism, sports and youth, told CNN.
    


            Events start at 7:30 a.m., when Haro's mayor and members of the San Felices Brotherhood gather and lead pilgrims to the Bilibio Cliffs, on which is perched the Hermitage.
    


            After a Mass is held at the Hermitage, a rocket marks the start of the wine battle.
    


            Participants dressed completely in white with red handkerchiefs then proceed to soak one another until their clothes turn deep purple.

            Though often portrayed as a light-hearted spectacle, the festival is rooted in deep tradition, religious history and local folklore.
    


            It is said to have begun in the sixth century, when pilgrimages in honor of Haro's patron saint, San Felice, were made to the caves where he was buried. Over time, these turned into lively celebrations featuring “wine baptisms,” which eventually became the wine fights known today.
    


            Another origin tale involves a 12th-century land dispute between Haro and the neighbouring town of Miranda De Ebro, which saw locals from both towns complete a boundary walk to ensure property lines between them were properly maintained. This was said to have lasted over 400 years until it was disregarded and both sides started throwing wine at each other.
    


            Rules of the event are outlined on the Batalla del Vino website. The goal of the festival is to stain your neighbor with wine, leaving them darker than the Pendón de Haro, a banner associated with the town of Haro.
    


            Gigantic wine tankers, each containing up to 15,000 liters (3,300 gallons) of wine, are provided by the town hall for attendees to fill their approved weapons.
    


            In total, up to 50,000 liters (11,000 gallons) can be thrown each year.
    


            While this might seem like a criminal waste of good wine, the vino used in the battle isn't suitable for bottling, as it is not of high commercial value. Much of it is leftover or low-quality product.
    


            Afterward, the wine that flows down the mountainside is absorbed back into the soil or washed away by the rain, officials said.
    


            At midday, after the battle has been raging for several hours, everyone heads back to Plaza de la Paz, in the center of Haro, where locals parade through the streets accompanied by brass bands before — because this is Spain — they head to an arena for bullfighting and other events.
    


            Participants also typically eat a traditional popular local dish of caracoles, or snails, cooked in a tomato and pepper stew at some point during the day.

            In recent years, the event has gained visibility and now attracts visitors from across the world, thanks to viral social media posts and growing tourism.
    


            Jessica and Eric Smith, American expats living in La Rioja who document rural Spanish life to more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, say they came across the event while working with a rural housing association.
    


            “The wine battle itself is only three hours,” Eric says. “It's just a fun experience. You show up and there's thousands of other people.”
    


            To reach the hilltop where the festivities take place, participants are transported part of the way by buses, with seats covered in plastic, a precaution taken to prevent damage from the wine on the return journey.
    


            “The best part is you hop on this bus and you're heading towards the wine battle, but then they stop and let you off in the vineyards. You then have to walk up the hill for about 10 to 15 minutes to get to the wine battle,” said Eric.
    


            That's when things get wild.
    


            “As you enter, these older Spanish men, who've clearly been doing the wine battle for years, are standing there with backpack sprayers full of wine,” Jessica said. “You walk in and you're just being sprayed. And then a random kid comes out of nowhere and dumps a bucket of wine over your head.”
    


            “At any point in time, people can dump wine on you,” Eric added. “The atmosphere of the wine battle is just so much fun… you don't necessarily know what to expect.”
    


            Jess said the atmosphere gave her an instant sense of belonging.
    


            “I felt like I was adopted for the day,” she added. “It's literally just every piece that we love about Spanish culture, and I feel like you get a glimpse into it when you go to this event.”
    


            “We first went to Haro for La Batalla in 2007 and have been going back every year since,” says Toby Paramor, managing director of Stoke Travel, a UK tour company that organizes trips to the festival. “It was the most surreal, joyful, authentic little discovery.”
    


            While Paramor says his company's beer and wine-inclusive package trips are also aimed at giving travelers a deeper experience of La Rioja, festival organizers are worried about its popularity and the preservation of its cultural roots.
    


            José Luis Pérez Pastor, the local culture and tourism minister, says the festival began “with faith and friendship” and he is adamant it must not turn into just another party.
    


            “This is the only way to have a truly transforming experience — with respect and authenticity,” he said.
    


            “It's not just about drinking. Attending the Mass is an important cultural moment, even if not in a religious sense. It reflects centuries of tradition.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has condemned reported calls in Iran to execute Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Rubio's comments came after Iranian newspaper Kayhan reportedly accused Grossi of spying for Israel and suggested that, if he enters the country, he should be tried and executed.

“Calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of IAEA Director General Grossi are unacceptable and should be condemned,” Rubio wrote on X on Saturday.

“We support the IAEA's critical verification and monitoring efforts in Iran and commend the Director General and the IAEA for their dedication and professionalism. We call on Iran to ensure the safety and security of IAEA personnel,” he added.

Earlier this week, Iran's parliament voted to suspend cooperation with the UN watchdog. Following the vote, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced that Grossi would be barred from entering the country.

Speaking to RT on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the Iranian public is angry at the IAEA for failing to strongly condemn recent Israeli and US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Israel has claimed the strikes were necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Baghaei reiterated that Iran's nuclear program remains peaceful, adding that there has been no weapons-grade enrichment of uranium.

BELGRADE, June 29. /TASS/. Six police officers and two civilians were injured as a result of Saturday's violent protests in Belgrade, Serbia's police director Dragan Vailjevic said in an official statement, published by the Interior Ministry's press service.

According to the official, violence broke out when one group of protestors tried marched towards another group, holding a separate rally.

""Commanders of police units forming a cordon warned participants that they will not be allowed any further. This produced no effect, and an attack on police officers followed,"" he said. ""After the attack, which lasted around five or six minutes, the police was forced to intervene. The police acted with a high degree of professionalism. Minimal force was used only to stop those attacking the police and the state.""

""A few dozens of offenders and troublemakers were detained and will be brought to justice in accordance with the law. Regrettably, six officers were injured, and reports about their condition are now being verified. Also, two civilians were wounded. They were admitted to a healthcare facility, and details about their wounds are yet unknown,"" the police director said.

Nenad Stefanovic, the head of the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade,said earlier that all those responsible for attacks on police officers and governmental institutions will be identified and brought to justice.

The rally in central Belgrade gathered around 36,000 participants, according to Serbia's interior ministry. Protestors clashed with the police, and riot control weapons were used to drive them away from several streets in the city center.

The Serbian president will make a televised address to the nation at 11:00 a.m. local time on Sunday (9:00 a.m. GMT), the Vecernje novosti newspaper reported.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

RFK Jr has direct control, but Senate testimony in May that someone else is running the agency has created confusion

Who is in charge at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? The answer is more complicated than it may seem.

With no confirmed or acting CDC director, Robert F Kennedy Jr has direct control over the agency, allowing him to sign off – or not – on vaccine recommendations, according to legal experts.

Yet Kennedy, the secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), testified before a Senate committee in May that someone else is running the agency – creating confusion that could lead to legal challenges.

“There's not a CDC director or acting director. Essentially, RFK Jr is the director of the CDC,” said Paul Offit, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.

Kennedy now has “a lot more opportunity to actually influence the outcome of these decisions and to take actions in the absence of a Senate-confirmed director”, said Renée Landers, professor and director of the health law program at Suffolk University Law School in Boston.

The dismissal of 17 independent vaccine advisers and their replacement with less experienced advisers, some of whom have histories of anti-vaccine activism, is “very concerning”, especially given Kennedy's rejection of germ theory and his own anti-vaccine activism, Landers said.

On Thursday, the independent vaccine advisers appointed by Kennedy voted to ban thimerosal, a preservative (also known as thiomersal) with a demonstrated safety record, from 4% of flu vaccines in the US.

The remaining 96% of flu vaccines, as well as all other childhood vaccines, were already free of thimerosal out of an abundance of caution, despite decades of research indicating the preservative's safety. The move will make it harder for some people to access the flu vaccine.

The recommendation would normally be taken up by the CDC director, either to reject, or to implement as official, guidance from the agency. But for now, those decisions go directly to Kennedy, who has already exercised these capabilities before.

On 13 May, “with pending confirmation of a new CDC Director”, the health secretary adopted the recommendations for Chikungunya vaccines to be officially recommended by the CDC, according to the agency's website.

Kennedy did not sign off on the committee's votes for two other vaccines against RSV and meningitis.

Those vaccines, recommended in April by the independent advisers whom Kennedy dismissed this month, still have not gotten official CDC recommendations; it's not clear whether or when they will.

Kennedy also recently directed the CDC to change its Covid vaccine recommendations, softening the recommendation for children and ending it for pregnant people entirely, despite strong evidence that pregnancy is a major risk factor for severe illness and death.

“It is concerning that the power vacuum leaves open his ability to make these decisions that are inconsistent with scientific consensus,” Landers said.

Congress introduced a new law in 2023 that directors of the CDC must now undergo Senate confirmation. This appointment is the first time the CDC director has gone through the process.

“It is a little bit of uncharted waters,” Landers said.

David Weldon was first nominated and then withdrawn hours before his Senate confirmation hearing in March.

Susan Monarez served as acting director from 23 January until she was nominated on 24 March, at which point she stepped down. Once someone has been nominated for director, they cannot serve as acting director.

Monarez testified in her Senate confirmation hearing on Wednesday, but it's not clear when lawmakers will vote on the nomination,

In the absence of an acting director, the head of HHS has control of the agency, according to the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.

Signing off – or not – on CDC recommendations cannot be “delegated down” to other officials under the vacancies act, said Anne Joseph O'Connell, a professor at Stanford Law School; “it can only go up” to the HHS secretary.

“What's unusual about this situation is that we generally think having exclusive duties go ‘up' to the agency head when there is a lower-level vacancy is a good thing. But here many don't trust the secretary on these matters,” O'Connell said.

Kennedy put forth a different name for who is in charge of the CDC in May testimony before the Senate's health, education, labor and pensions committee.

“Who is the acting CDC director?” Lisa Blunt Rochester, the Democratic senator from Delaware, asked.

“The acting director was Susan Monarez, but she is now up for permanent director, so she's been replaced by Matt Buzzelli,” Kennedy said, describing Buzzelli as “a public health expert”.

But there's no indication that Buzzelli, a lawyer who is listed as chief of staff in the office of the CDC director, is acting director, nor is he qualified for the position.

“Buzzelli cannot be the acting CDC head,” O'Connell said. He's not the first assistant to the CDC director, he's not Senate-confirmed, and he did not serve 90 days in the year before the last director of the CDC left, O'Connell said: “There is no wiggle room.”

The lack of clarity is compounded by the Trump administration's non-compliance with information requirements, experts said. The CDC, along with other agencies, is required to update each year an office of personnel management site about who holds which jobs, a deadline the agencies missed in March.

Buzzelli “has been carrying out some of the duties of the CDC Director as the Senior Official, as necessary, and is surrounded by highly qualified medical professionals and advisors to help fulfill these duties as appropriate”, Andrew Nixon, HHS director of communications, told Stat News in May. (HHS did not respond to the Guardian's media inquiry.)

Such actions could open the officials up to legal challenges. Without official documentation naming Buzzelli and other decision-makers to official positions, they would not have the designated authority to make certain decisions, which means their actions could be challenged.

For instance, they may not be authorized to enter into new contracts or end prior agreements early with state, local, tribal and territorial governments – potentially opening up any such actions to lawsuits.

“The person who takes the action has to be someone lawfully appointed to the position. To the extent that agencies try to skirt that kind of requirement, it does leave the decisions vulnerable to legal challenge,” Landers said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

MPs describe receiving veiled deselection threats as No 10 sought to quash revolt before finally backing down 

The Conservative shadow cabinet minister looked more cheerful than at any point in the 12 months since the general election. “How did they get into such a mess?” they asked. “What are they going to do?”

The answer was revealed a couple of days later when Keir Starmer and his ministers made a series of emergency concessions on their flagship welfare programme, to prevent the otherwise far-greater ignominy of the programme being voted down in the House of Commons.

U-turns of various sorts are an inevitability in government; the skill lies in how elegantly you can perform them. And this week's eventual cave-in to backbench Labour pressure – formally announced by a Downing Street statement after midnight on Thursday – was very, very messy indeed.

To return to the shadow minister's gleeful query, how did it end up like this? The narrative will depend on who you ask. But a common thread, even among some in No 10, is the idea of a government worryingly disconnected from its own MPs.

From the moment in March that Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, first set out consultative proposals to overhaul welfare payments, it was evident that a large number of backbenchers had worries about elements of the plan.

Notably, the green paper set out a significant tightening of the eligibility for personal independence payments (Pips), which help those with long-term illness or disability, causing concern not only among MPs but also numerous charities.

But armed with a 150-plus Commons majority – and what felt to some MPs like an almost messianic insistence on turning around an increasingly unaffordable social security system – Downing Street ploughed on.

“This has happened because of an arrogance from the top,” one veteran Labour MP said. “On the day of the green paper, the whips were saying they thought a maximum of 10 people would actually rebel. They were laughing at us.

“They didn't think anyone would have the guts from the new intake. But they [new Labour MPs] have been doing their own organising.”

As it turned out, there was a lot of organising, from all sides of the parliamentary party. With Starmer largely preoccupied with other subjects – including the G7 summit in Canada and a change of course over a national inquiry into grooming gangs – MPs were taking action.

The crunch point arrived on Monday with the publication of an amendment intended to kill off the welfare bill at its second reading in the Commons on 1 July. Initially signed by 108 Labour MPs, it soon had the backing of more than 120.

These were not the perennial malcontents primarily from the Labour left – the “maximum of 10” so dismissively summed up by the party whip. Signatories included a string of senior backbenchers who chair select committees, and numerous 2024-intake MPs.

How did dozens of hand-picked, newly arrived backbenchers, once thought so loyal they were dubbed “Starmtroopers”, find themselves within a year on the brink of a rebellion that could have defeated the government?

For many, the problem dates back to the very early days of the parliament and a kind of vicious discipline that resulted in seven MPs being suspended from the Labour party over a vote on the two-child benefit cap. Three of those MPs remain exiled today.

Even loyal MPs were under orders never to submit amendments – or to make their views known publicly on any subject. “It was like student politics,” said one. “Keep your mouth shut and maybe we'll let you on the entertainment committee.”

“Arrogant” is the word MPs are using most of all. It was the blithe assumption by whips and No 10 that any rebellion would fold that sent many over the edge.

“They tried to treat the PLP [parliamentary Labour party] like naughty children,” one MP said. “They all did what they were meant to do and raised the issue privately, and then got totally ignored.”

Another repeated charge within the party is that even when its hierarchy did recognise the disquiet, the response tended to be either complacency or high-handed, bungling menaces.

MPs described outreach to them as having been limited to presentations and charts showing the growing size of the welfare budget and increases in numbers going on Pip.

“We asked to see the prime minister or the chancellor and we got a presentation from officials,” one said. “They were very, very dismissive.”

MPs say they received a litany of threats, including the possibility of a general election. Those on the right of the party were warned their actions could bring about a leadership challenge that would be won by Angela Rayner. The same threat was made to those on the left, but with Wes Streeting as the looming spectre.

Others say they have received veiled threats of deselection, or that their funding for the next general election would be decided on the basis of whether or not they toed the line. One party official allegedly rang a rebellious MP's husband in order to get her to back down.

“I don't even think some of this is sanctioned by No 10,” one MP said. “Until Wednesday they had their fingers in their ears. But those who are responsible for party management have been absolutely losing it.”

After the implications of Monday's amendment became clear, outreach efforts finally began. Even Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, made a rare appearance on the Commons terrace on Wednesday evening to try to persuade MPs over a glass of rosé. “She doesn't want to be £5bn out of pocket,” one MP said.

Yet the number of rebels continued to grow, and No 10 finally bowed to the inevitable. On Thursday morning, the prime minister used a Commons statement ostensibly about international affairs to promise a welfare rethink.

Until that point, Starmer had seemed oddly detached from the issue, surfacing intermittently at summits to bat away questions about the revolt – or “noises off” as he termed it – as a distraction from the vital task of transforming welfare.

Some MPs view this as indicative of a prime minister more than usually disconnected from the everyday grid of parliamentary business, as illustrated by the statistic that since winning the election he has voted in the Commons just seven times.

A few have begun to openly speculate about what the situation means for Starmer's leadership. “It is very bad for Keir. It is one in four of his MPs [that intended to rebel]. He is toast,” one MP said.

A lot of the ire, however, has been directed at Morgan McSweeney, Starmer's chief of staff, and what one rebel called the “overexcitable boys” in the PM's team.

Inside No 10, there had been a determination to force through the plan in part because of internal polling and focus groups that suggest the public backs the changes when the context is explained – even wanting them to go further.

One adviser, a close ally of the prime minister, said they had been so determined the vote had to go ahead – concessions or not – because the symbolism of being able to get the government's agenda through the Commons was so important.

“This is a fairly moderate reform,” the adviser said. “If the government cannot make this modest saving – in a change that will not affect nine out of 10 people already on the benefit – then how can we pursue the political programme we need, to make the tough decisions the country needs us to take? It's impossible.”

Other advisers are furious about the situation they have found themselves in. “It's absolutely outrageous these people are prepared to throw away a historic majority because people were a bit mean to them on Twitter,” said one.

Another said: “Just wait and see what happens if they depose Morgan. It is over, then. Finito. Then we might as well hand the keys to Farage.”

But other advisers in government say they can see how No 10 has played it wrong. One called it “a staggering failure of political management from the people who supposedly had an iron grip on the PLP”.

For many Labour MPs, however, it is about nothing more complicated than a government machine that forgot how to listen.

“Everything the government is now realising is something MPs have been saying for months,” one MP said. “The fact that you cannot defend these cuts on the basis they will get people into work. The fact that you cannot guarantee the most disabled people won't be worse off.

“MPs are not idiots. We deserve to be listened to. We anticipated this failure. They are in this mess now because they were too arrogant to listen.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Shifting from debating difference to seeking shared meaning isn't just theoretical. I've seen it work

I was born in Iran after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when religion became the architecture of public life. But it was precisely this fusion of faith and power that forced my family to flee. We were persecuted not for breaking laws but for belonging to a minority religious community, the Bahá'ís – a persecution that continues today. This experience taught me how religion can be used to exclude, to dehumanise, to dominate. But it also taught me that ignoring religion is not the answer.

More than 80% of the world's population identifies with a religion. Yet in many parts of the world – especially in the west – religion is treated as a private matter, something best kept out of polite conversation, or at worst, a source of division and danger. We live in a paradox: a deeply religious world that increasingly doesn't know how to talk about religion.

This silence isn't neutral. It creates a kind of cultural illiteracy – especially at a time when religion continues to shape geopolitics, social movements and personal lives, from the rise of religious nationalism to faith-based responses to humanitarian crises. And in places like the United States, it's becoming even more central to public discourse, often with high political stakes.

So how do we talk about religion in a world that needs moral clarity but fears moral language?

One idea that has helped me reframe how we talk about religion comes from my own faith – the Bahá'í concept of progressive revelation. It teaches that the world's major religions are expressions of the same spiritual reality, revealed at different times to meet the evolving needs of humanity. They are not rival ideologies but chapters in a single story. Not different truths but different reflections of one truth.

Imagine if we approached religion not as a set of camps to defend or oppose but as a shared inheritance. What if we stopped asking which one is right and started asking what they're trying to show us – about justice, humility, forgiveness, the soul and the sacredness of life?

This shift – from debating difference to seeking shared meaning – isn't just theoretical. I've seen it work.

In refugee communities in the Middle East, I witnessed how grassroots interfaith efforts helped displaced people from opposing religious backgrounds begin to heal. In one camp in Jordan, Christian and Muslim women began cooking together during Ramadan and Easter, eventually hosting communal feasts for the wider community. These weren't institutional programs but quiet acts of dignity and repair – rooted in faith and in the will to see the human behind the label.

In my doctoral research on Syrian religious-minority refugees in Berlin, I found that secular integration policies often failed to account for the central role religion played in people's sense of identity, belonging and healing. Integration thrived not when religion was ignored but when it was engaged – through interfaith dialogue, shared spiritual spaces or recognition of religious holidays. These approaches didn't erase difference. They helped people move forward together. Religion became less of a dividing line and more of a connective thread.

Even here, in my suburban neighbourhood in Aotearoa New Zealand, I see glimpses of this every week. On our street families come from Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Hindu, Bahá'í and other diverse backgrounds. Every Friday afternoon I host a simple class for the children of the neighbourhood. We sing, tell stories and explore themes like kindness, truthfulness and the nobility of the human spirit. It's a space for the children to discover their spiritual identity and their capacity to contribute to the world around them. Over time this has quietly knit our community together. Parents, too, have found connection – not through sameness but through a shared desire for their children to grow into just and compassionate human beings.

This idea – that spiritual truth unfolds over time – has changed how I live. It's shaped how I raise my children, how I relate to neighbours of different beliefs and how I engage in public life. It helps me stay curious instead of defensive and to approach others not through fixed categories but with an openness to what we might learn from one another.

And that's the heart of it, really: moral imagination – the ability to see not just what is but what could be. It invites us to ask new kinds of questions:

What does it mean to live a meaningful life?

How do we hold both reverence and reason in the same hand?

What truths do our traditions carry that the world still needs?

What happens when we stop talking about religion and start listening with it?

These are not easy questions. But they matter. While secular frameworks offer many tools, they often fall short of naming the deepest yearnings of the human spirit. And while religion has been misused, it can also be reclaimed – as a source of clarity, compassion and shared purpose.

Recognising the wisdom in religion doesn't mean denying the harm it's caused. It means telling the full story – separating faith from fanaticism and choosing not silence but better language: language rooted in humility, inquiry and hope.

We don't need less religion in public life. We need better ways of talking about it – ways that allow both believers and non-believers to engage meaningfully, with honesty and depth.

Maybe it starts with a simple shift. What if the world's religions are not competing claims but reflections of one unfolding truth? What if, beneath all our differences, there's just one story being told in many tongues?

If we believed that, we might stop asking who is right –and start asking what's possible. And maybe then, we'd finally begin to build the world we all long to live in.

While China's men's soccer team has not generated much excitement in recent years, humanoid robot teams have won over fans in Beijing based more on the artificial intelligence (AI) technology involved than any athletic prowess shown.

Four teams of humanoid robots faced off in fully autonomous 3-on-3 soccer matches powered entirely by AI on Saturday night in China's capital in what was touted as a first in China and a preview for the upcoming World Humanoid Robot Games, set to take place in Beijing.

According to the organizers, a key aspect of the match was that all the participating robots operated fully autonomously using AI-driven strategies, without any human intervention or supervision.

Equipped with advanced visual sensors, the robots were able to identify the ball and navigate the field with agility

They were also designed to stand up on their own after falling. However, during the match several still had to be carried off the field on stretchers by staff, adding to the realism of the experience.

China is stepping up efforts to develop AI-powered humanoid robots, using sports competitions such as marathons, boxing, and football as a real-world proving ground.

Cheng Hao, founder and CEO of Booster Robotics, the company that supplied the robot players, said sports competitions offer the ideal testing ground for humanoid robots, helping to accelerate the development of both algorithms and integrated hardware-software systems.

He also emphasized safety as a core concern in the application of humanoid robots.

“In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans. That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe,” Cheng said. “For example, a robot and a human could play a match where winning doesn't matter, but real offensive and defensive interactions take place. That would help audiences build trust and understand that robots are safe.”

Booster Robotics provided the hardware for all four university teams, while each school's research team developed and embedded their own algorithms for perception, decisionmaking, player formations, and passing strategies — including variables such as speed, force and direction, according to Cheng.

In the final match, Tsinghua University's THU Robotics defeated the China Agricultural University's Mountain Sea team with a score of 5-3 to win the championship.

Mr Wu, a supporter of Tsinghua, celebrated their victory while also praising the competition.

“They [THU] did really well,” he said. “But the Mountain Sea team [of Agricultural University] was also impressive. They brought a lot of surprises.”

China's men have made only one World Cup appearance and have already been knocked out of next year's competition in Canada, Mexico and the US.

The US overtaking China as Taiwan's top export destination could boost industrial development and wage growth, given the US is a high-income economy, an economist said yesterday.

However, Taiwan still needs to diversify its export markets due to the unpredictability of US President Donald Trump's administration, said Chiou Jiunn-rong (邱俊榮), an economics professor at National Central University.

Taiwan's exports soared to a record US$51.74 billion last month, driven by strong demand for artificial intelligence (AI) products and continued orders, with information and communication technology (ICT) and audio/video products leading all sectors.

The US reclaimed its position as Taiwan's top export market, accounting for 30 percent of total exports — surpassing the combined 27.2 percent share of China and Hong Kong.

Commenting on the structural shift in Taiwan's exports, Chiou noted that Taiwan's previous heavy dependence on China — once exceeding 40 percent of total exports — raised concerns about over-concentration in a single market and product.

However, global supply chain realignments and rising US-China tensions have led to a significant shift in Taiwan's export structure.

Chiou explained that although Taiwan's export focus has shifted from the Chinese market and ICT products to the US market and AI goods, it may seem like the same story is repeating, but with different implications.

First, Chiou noted that since the US is the world's largest economy, a 30 percent export share to the country is not excessive.

Second, the US is not only the world's most important market but also a high-income, advanced economy, he said. While both the US and China are major export markets for Taiwan, their implications differ greatly, he added.

Looking back, Chiou recalled that when Taiwan signed the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement with China in 2010, there were concerns that closer ties would lower wages and increase unemployment. He cited concerns over the economic theory of ""factor price equalization,"" which suggests free trade equalizes wages and rents between countries.

In contrast, Chiou said deepening trade ties with the US could drive industrial development and wage growth in Taiwan. Closer access to end markets would help shift Taiwanese industries toward higher value-added segments, he added.

However, Chiou warned that to mitigate risks from Trump's erratic policies, Taiwan should pursue greater export market diversification.

Gordon Sun (孫明德), director of the Economic Forecasting Center at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, said AI servers sold mainly to the US helped push America past China as Taiwan's largest export market.

However, Sun said this structural shift in exports is largely driven by a single product category, and whether the trend will continue remains uncertain.

Given robust growth in new orders at its Taiwanese factory, coupled with its subsidiaries' improving performance, Merida said it remains confident about the bicycle market's prospects and expects steady growth in its core business this year.
CAUTION ON CHINA
However, the company must handle the Chinese market with great caution, as sales of road bikes there have declined significantly, affecting its revenue and profitability, Merida said in a statement, adding that it would

                                        Strong exports, and life insurance companies' efforts to manage currency risks indicates the NT dollar would eventually pass the 29 level, an expert said                                        The New Taiwan dollar yesterday rallied to its strongest in three years amid inflows to the nation's stock market and broad-based weakness in the US dollar.
Exporter sales of the US currency and a repatriation of funds from local asset managers also played a role, said two traders, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorized to speak publicly.
State-owned banks were seen buying the greenback yesterday, but only at a moderate scale, the traders said.
The local currency gained 0.77 percent, outperforming almost all of its Asian peers, to close at NT$29.165 per US dollar in Taipei trading yesterday.

RECORD LOW:
                                        Global firms' increased inventories, tariff disputes not yet impacting Taiwan and new graduates not yet entering the market contributed to the decrease                                        Taiwan's unemployment rate last month dropped to 3.3 percent, the lowest for the month in 25 years, as strong exports and resilient domestic demand boosted hiring across various sectors, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said yesterday.
After seasonal adjustments, the jobless rate eased to 3.34 percent, the best performance in 24 years, suggesting a stable labor market, although a mild increase is expected with the graduation season from this month through August, the statistics agency said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines, a step that follows the Baltic nations and Poland's move to boost their defense as the war rages on in Ukraine. 

The 1997 treaty, joined by over 160 countries, bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in efforts to protect civilians from the scattered explosives that could still injure them long after the conflict is over. 

""Russia has never been a party to this convention and uses anti-personnel mines extremely cynically,"" Zelensky said in justifying the decision. ""And not only now, in the war against Ukraine. This is the signature style of Russian killers — to destroy life by all methods at their disposal.

Earlier in March, the Baltic states and Poland announced their intention to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, a significant shift in defense policy that shows how countries near Ukraine are preparing for a potential war in Europe.

Anti-personnel mines are scattered across the battlefield in Ukraine, with soldiers and civilians often losing their feet or limbs due to detonations. Territories liberated by Ukraine since 2022 have been heavily covered with mines, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to clear them. Russia has used more than a dozen variants of anti-personnel mines since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to Human Rights Watch's June report. 

In a surprise move that angered Moscow, the Biden administration in 2024 approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine. Then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was to help Ukraine stall the Russian advances in the east as the front-line situation deteriorated.

""This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,"" lawmaker Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliament's defense committee, said in the Facebook post announcing a significant move forward in withdrawing from the major mine treaty. 

Now that Zelensky signed the decree enacting the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, it will land on the parliament's table, Kostenko said. The dates when the decision will take effect are still unclear.

Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine since the start its full-scale war overnight on June 29, launching 477 drones and 60 missiles towards Ukrainian cities, Ukraine's Air Force said. 

Russian missile and drone attack terrorized Ukraine overnight as air raid alarms sounded across the country, including western regions far from the front lines.

Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force, confirmed to the Associated Press that the attack had become ""the most massive airstrike"" since the beginning of Russia's full-scale in February 2022.

Russia's bombardments — a fact of life after three years of full-scale war — have intensified dramatically in May and June, with mass attacks becoming more frequent and more deadly.

Ukraine's Air Force warned late in the evening on June 28 that Russia had launched three Tu-95 bombers from the Olenya military airfield in Murmansk Oblast. The Air Force also warned that multiple groups of Russian drones were heading towards various regions.

Several hours later, the Air Force reported that a Russian MiG-31K — a jet capable of carrying Kinzhal ballistic missiles — took off from Savasleyka airfield in Russia's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. The Air Force followed this up with warnings that cruise missiles were bound for several regions, including Ternopil, Lviv, and Ivano-Frankivsk oblasts in western Ukraine. 

The Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces said it scrambled fighter jets and activated ground-based air defense units in response to the Russian aerial attacks in western Ukraine.

Explosions and strikes were reported in Mykolaiv, Kremenchuk, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy Oblast, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv as waves of attacks came throughout the night. Some regional officials shared preliminary reports of damage and casualties even as air defense continued to operate in the area. 

Civilian infrastructure was damaged and at least three people were injured in attacks on Cherkasy Oblast, Governor Ihor Taburets reported.

In Kremenchuk, Poltava Oblast, an undisclosed enterprise was hit, causing a fire, according to Governor Volodymyr Kohut. 

A production facility at an unnamed enterprise in Zaporizhzhia was hit during an overnight missile attack, Governor Ivan Fedorov said. No casualties were reported. 

After the alarms died down, officials in Lviv Oblast said that Russia attempted to strike critical infrastructure in the region. According to Lviv Mayor Andrii Sadovyi, these efforts were largely unsuccessful. 

""Despite the complexity of this overnight combined attack, no one was injured and no civilian buildings were damaged in Lviv,"" he wrote on Telegram. 

Mykolaiv Oblast Governor Vitalii Kim reported that Russia targeted the city overnight with ballistic missiles and Shahed drones, hitting an infrastructure facility. The strike caused a fire but no casualties. 

The mass missile and drone attack comes a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters that Moscow is ready to hold another round of peace talks.

Ukrainian and Russian delegations have now held two direct talks in Istanbul, but the discussions have yielded few results outside of coordinated prisoner swaps.

Moscow refuses to budge on its maximalist ambitions in Ukraine and is unwilling to enter a ceasefire unless Kyiv preemptively agrees to surrender all foreign military aid. Putin on June 20 declared that ""all Ukraine is ours"" in a bombastic speech at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.

Russian ballistics and kamikaze drones have targeted Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with renewed ferocity, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds more. Just this week, a Russian missile struck a passenger train in Dnipro, leaving 21 dead and over 300 wounded.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending tariff discussions because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting Digital Services Tax.ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to broaden his list of demands on Canada to re-open trade talks, listing his past grievances about Canada's supply management policies that control production and imports of eggs, dairy and poultry.

Mr. Trump made the comments in a pre-recorded interview with Fox News Channel host Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday morning.

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mr. Trump agreed earlier this month at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta. to negotiate an economic and security deal within 30 days.

The 30-day plan raised expectations that Canada might be able to eliminate or reduce the series of tariffs the Trump administration has imposed on Canada this year.

However, Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending those talks because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting a Digital Services Tax (DST) from large multinationals such as Netflix and Amazon as of Monday, retroactive to 2022.

Mr. Trump's statement on Friday had mentioned supply management, but said he was “terminating” all trade discussions with Canada because of the “egregious” DST.

In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked about his plan to stop all trade discussions with Canada.

“Until such time as they drop certain taxes, yeah,” he answered. “People don't realize, Canada is very nasty to deal with.”

He then repeated his past objections with Canada's agricultural policies, which set high tariffs on imports above certain exempted levels.

“Our farmers want to send it. They have to pay 200, 300, 400 per cent. People don't know that.”

He also said, “I love Canada” and “hopefully we'll be fine with Canada” before repeating his desire for Canada to be part of the U.S.

“Frankly, Canada should be the 51st state. It really should, because Canada relies entirely on the United States. We don't rely on Canada,” he said.

Prior to breaking for summer, Parliament approved the Bloc Québécois's Bill C-202, related to supply management.

The short bill aims to hamstring the government's ability to make concessions related to the existing tariffs or quotas in any trade negotiations.

Olaf Scholz reflected on his years in government as the Social Democratic Party congress bids farewell to the former chancellor. He also warned against having any illusions about Russian President Vladimir Putin's plans.

These live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading, 

Below is a roundup of stories out of Germany from Saturday, June 28:

A woman gave birth in the bathroom of nightclub in the German city of Saarbrücken, police said on Saturday.

Patrons at Discoplex A8 called emergency services after they spotted the woman going into labor on Friday night. 

A police spokesman said the child had already been born by the time ambulances arrived at the scene.

The mother and child were taken to a nearby hospital and were both doing well, police said.

More than 170,000 people turned out to watch the Windjammer Parade of sailing boats as part of Kiel Week, named after the northern German city of Kiel where the annual event takes place.

More than 120 sailing boats took part in the parade, led by the 82-metre-long (270-foot) training ship Gorch Fock, which was built in 1958.

The ship's captain was granted permission to sail faster than usual in the Kieler Förde inlet, clocking around 6.5 knots (7.5 mph; 12 km/h).

Spectators watched the sailing parade from numerous smaller boats on the water as well as from the designated area on the shore.

The annual Kiel Week festival is one of the largest sailing events in the world.

Saturday's Windjammer Parade is considered the highlight of Kiel Week, with the festival set to conclude the following day on Sunday.

On Armed Forces Day (Tag der Bundeswehr), German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of a false sense of security in Germany and called for greater defense efforts.

In his address at the Bundeswehr's Operations Command near Potsdam, Merz pointed to Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine.

""We must not take our security for granted. We must do more to ensure that we can live in freedom, peace, and security,"" the chancellor said.

Merz also thanked the soldiers for their service and called for more recognition from the public.

""I want the value of the work done by soldiers in our country to be seen and appreciated,"" he said.

The conservative chancellor also visited the Forest of Remembrance, where concrete pillars record the names of German soldiers killed in foreign missions in recent decades.

Firefighters in Breckerfeld, a town in the southeastern Ruhr area of western Germany, rescued a mother raccoon and her four cubs from a chimney. 

According to the local fire department, residents of a single-family home called rescue workers on Friday evening to report unusual occurrences in the chimney. 

One firefighter then climbed onto the roof to the chimney cap, while a second volunteer positioned himself at the cleaning hatch. When the animals finally crawled out of the chimney, the mother fled.

Since the firefighters didn't know where to take the cubs, they searched online and found an animal welfare association in Fulda, Hesse — about 250 kilometers away — whose board member, Sandra Fiedrich, is a raccoon expert.

She recommended that the firefighters place the young raccoons in an open box, leave it at the scene, and then leave. ""Raccoon mothers are very good mothers. They always return to where their cubs should be. They simply tip the box over and retrieve their cubs,"" Fiedrich explained.

According to the fire department, that's exactly what happened.

Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Turkey's Republican People's Party (CHP), called on Germany to support the Turkish opposition amid increasing government repression.

""The rise of the CHP has caused the government to panic,"" he said, speaking at the Social Democratic Party (SPD) congress in Berlin. The CHP is a sister party of the SPD.

""Since October last year, they have massively increased their pressure and attacks against our party and social opposition,"" Ozel added.

After his impassioned speech, the SPD congress unanimously passed a motion demanding the immediate release of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who has been detained since March 19, as well as all other political prisoners in Turkey.

Ozel emphasized the importance of Turkey's goal of full EU membership and stated that his party strives for a democratic Turkey based on human rights and the rule of law.

He also warned, ""In relations with Turkey, it would be a fatal mistake to prioritize short-term economic or security policy interests over democracy.""

With temperatures in many places in Germany rising, Germans head to the nearest ice cream parlor.

However, according to a YouGov survey commissioned by Germany's dpa news agency, nearly two-thirds (64%) of people in the country believe ice cream prices are too high.

Six out of 10 respondents said they ""always"" or ""occasionally"" order fewer scoops due to increased prices compared to five years ago.

However, 28% said the price has no impact on the number of scoops they buy. Most people purchase two scoops (50%) or three scoops (23%). Scoops cost between €1.30 ($1.52) and €2.80.

If it's any consolation, ice cream in Germany is relatively inexpensive, said Annalisa Carnio, spokeswoman for the Association of Italian Ice Cream Manufacturers in Germany (Uniteis).

In France, a scoop costs between €3.50 and €5, in Italy €2.50 to €4, and in Spain €3 to €4.

Filippo Grandi, the head of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), expressed regret over the German government's decision to temporarily withdraw from the organization's refugee resettlement program .

""This worries me,"" Grandi told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

""It would be nice if Germany could still take in a few refugees through this program,"" he added, mentioning a person who is unsafe in their native country because of their homosexuality as an example.

Through the resettlement program, the UNHCR refers particularly vulnerable refugees, who cannot remain in their initial host countries, to other nations. Those accepted do not need to apply for asylum and are initially allowed to stay for three years.

Germany had originally pledged to accept a total of 13,000 refugees in 2024 and 2025, but this commitment was suspended following the government change in May.

Grandi also warned against forcing Syrian refugees to return to their homeland after the fall of the Assad regime, saying that the new government is inexperienced and that the situation is fragile.

Since 2015, Germany has taken in more than one million Syrian refugees, though not through the UN mechanism.

Former Chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a farewell speech at the Social Democratic Party congress in Berlin.

He was self-critical in it, but defended the government's policies under his leadership.

Scholz also warned against having any illusions about Vladimir Putin's intentions. The Russian president wants to hold on to his conquests in Ukraine and would even like to expand them, said Scholz.

However, Putin must not be allowed to change borders by force, said the former chancellor. By doing so, the Russian leader has broken with decades of understanding in post-war Europe, Scholz added.

Consequences have been drawn from this turning point: ""The Bundeswehr will become stronger and cooperation within NATO has reached new dimensions. That is also right,"" said Scholz.

He called for high earners to contribute more towards financing defence capabilities, saying it is strange that they are even talking about tax cuts. ""That's an interesting mathematical calculation,"" said Scholz. He continued: ""I certainly believe that we are being called upon to show new solidarity in our country.""

Saskia Esken, the former co-party leader who did not stand for re-election, will also address the party congress delegates later in the day.

Guten Tag, and welcome to DW's coverage of developments in Germany on Saturday, June 28.

The center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) continues its party congress in Berlin.

On Friday, Lars Klingbeil was re-elected as co-leader of the party, receiving 65% support, a significant decrease from the 85.6% he garnered in 2023.

Labor Minister Bärbel Bas was elected co-chair with 95%, replacing Saskia Esken. Germany's February parliamentary elections saw the SPD relegated to third place in what was its worst showing in many decades.

Smoking is now forbidden on beaches, in parks and other public spaces in France. The new rules aim to protect children being harmed by passive smoking.

France has introduced new rules banning smoking on beaches, in parks and a number of other public spaces that went into force on Sunday.

The rules aim to protect children from the dangers of passive smoking, which, according to official figures, kills between 3,000 to 5,000 people a year in the country.

The rules, which were published in the official government gazette on Saturday, also forbid smoking in bus shelters and within a 10 meter (33 foot) radius of libraries, swimming pools and schools, all places frequented by children.

However, the ban does not apply to the terraces of bars and restaurants, unlike new rules that are soon to be introduced in neighboring Spain.

E-cigarettes are also not mentioned in the rules.

Anyone violating the ban could face a fine between €135 ($160) and €700, though there will be an initial grace period.

""Tobacco must disappear from places where there are children. A park, a beach, a school — these are places to play, learn and breathe. Not for smoking,"" Health and Family Minister Catherine Vautrin said.

 She said the new rules represented another step ""toward a tobacco-free generation,"" which France is targeting from 2032.

More than 30% of French adults still smoke cigarettes, making it one of the more tobacco-friendly countries in Europe and the world.

Particularly concerning for health authorities is the statistic showing that 15% of 17-year-olds also smoke.

However,  according to the French addiction agency, the OFDT, the habit is nonetheless declining in France, with the current figure ""the lowest prevalence ever recorded since 2000.""

More than 200 people in France die each day — around 75,000 a year — of illnesses related to tobacco consumption, Vautrin said in a statement on Saturday.

The relative high rate of smoking comes despite the fact that a packet of cigarettes now costs at least €12 ($14) owing to rising taxes on tobacco.

In addition, smoking has been illegal in restaurants, bars and public buildings for well over a decade.

According to a recent opinion survey, 62% of people in France are in favor of a smoking ban in public places.

In one of the biggest cocaine busts in UK history, British authorities discovered 2.4 metric tons of the drug in a ship that arrived in London from Panama. 

British authorities announced on Saturday the seizure of 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at London Gateway port, with the estimated value of 96 million pounds (€112 million or $132 million).

This is the sixth-largest seizure of cocaine since records began, according to Britain's Home Office, the UK's interior ministry.

The enormous haul of cocaine was found hidden under dozens of shipping containers on a vessel arriving from Panama.

The Home Office said that specialist officers detected the shipment earlier this month. With the port operator's help, they moved 37 large containers to access the stash.

Charlie Eastaugh, director of the UK Border Force Maritime, said the seizure was ""just one example of how dedicated Border Force maritime officers remain one step ahead of the criminal gangs who threaten our security.""

""Our message to these criminals is clear — more than ever before, we are using intelligence and international law enforcement co-operation to disrupt and dismantle your operations.""

According to Eastaugh, container ships are a primary means by which criminal organizations smuggle cocaine into the United Kingdom.

The UK government says that cocaine-related deaths in England and Wales rose 31% between 2022 and 2023. The National Crime Agency (NCA) reports that Britain is one of Europe's biggest cocaine markets.

Last February, British authorities seized 5.7 tons of cocaine at the port of Southampton in southern England. The NCA said officers believed the drugs were bound for the German city of Hamburg ""for onward delivery.""

The bill bars agents from wearing facial coverings during enforcement unless medically necessary or required for safety.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez on Saturday held a rally outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in New York City to promote her recently introduced No Masks for ICE Act.

“We would never accept it if the NYPD operated in masks without names or badges — and we shouldn't accept it from ICE either,” Velázquez (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department.

“When agents hide their faces and identities they create chaos, fear, and open the door to abuse,” she continued. “Immigrant communities are left wondering if they're being arrested or kidnapped. That's not how law enforcement should operate in a democracy. This bill is about restoring basic standards and bringing basic transparency and accountability to immigration enforcement.”

As the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works to deliver on Republican President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations, federal agents, including those with ICE, have taken immigrants into custody while wearing masks and plain clothes — sparking alarm over abuse by anonymous agents and also copycat criminals.

Velázquez's bill would bar ICE agents from wearing facial coverings during immigration enforcement, unless medically necessary or required for safety. It would also require written justification for any mask use, agents to wear clothing displaying their name and affiliation with ICE, and DHS to report annually to Congress on any related complaints and disciplinary actions.

A spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement told CBS News on Saturday that masks are optional but that “ICE law enforcement and their families are being targeted and are facing a 500% increase in assaults… due to the demonization of ICE by hostile groups and irresponsible elected officials.”

“Politicians and activists must turn the temperature down and tone down their rhetoric,” the spokesperson added.

Immigrant rights advocates, legal experts, and Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) also joined the rally. He noted in a statement that “the past few months we've seen a disturbing pattern: masked, plain-clothes agents ambushing immigrants outside courtrooms and on city streets.”

“If their operations are legitimate and above-board, why is there a need for anonymity, and why don't they need warrants to come onto private property?” Nadler asked. “This bill will put an end to those intimidation tactics, restore transparency, and ensure the public knows exactly who is wielding federal power in our communities.”

Today, outside 26 Federal Plaza, we joined Congress members @velazquez.house.gov + @nadler.house.gov, @thenyic.bsky.social, @legalaidnyc.bsky.social, and allies to spotlight the No Masks for ICE Act to call for immediate federal action to end secretive, unaccountable immigration enforcement.

The rally was held at 26 Federal Plaza, a 41-floor building in Lower Manhattan that houses an ICE field office and one of New York City's immigration courts. Earlier this month, NYC Comptroller Brad Lander — then a Democratic mayoral candidate — was arrested by federal agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court at the building.

On the 10th floor, “there is a holding area where immigration authorities have typically held a few dozen immigrants at a time for a few hours before transferring them to detention centers,” The New York Times reported a few days after Lander's arrest. “But as the Trump administration expands its immigration crackdown, the space has become overcrowded and people sleep sprawled on the floor, sometimes for days, according to those who have spent time there.”

The Times also noted a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem signed by nine of the state's Democratic members of Congress — Nadler and Velázquez plus Reps. Yvette Clarke, Adriano Espaillat, Dan Goldman, Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ritchie Torres—who want to conduct oversight of the field office, which they argue is a detention facility.

“Congressional oversight is essential to bring transparency to the conduct of the Department of Homeland Security,” they wrote. “Given the overaggressive and excessive force used to handcuff and detain elected officials in public, DHS's refusal to allow members of Congress to observe the conditions for immigrants behind closed doors begs the obvious question: What are you hiding?”

Following the introduction of Velázquez's bill, two Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and their official badges when detaining or arresting people.

That legislation is led by Goldman and Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and backed by dozens of their Democratic colleagues. Espaillat said that “if you uphold the peace of a democratic society, you should not be anonymous. DHS and ICE agents wearing masks and hiding identification echoes the tactics of secret police authoritarian regimes.”

Democrats are hoping to draw out the bill's passage while highlighting provisions expected to harm US families.

After an hourslong delay from the initial goal of noon, U.S. Senate Republicans on Saturday night kicked off the process of passing their 940-page budget reconciliation package — which the chamber's Democrats are making the clerks read in full, not only to draw out the process but also to highlight the various provisions expected to harm American families.

“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don't realize what's in it,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the chamber's floor. “If Senate Republicans won't tell the American people what's in this bill, then Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish.”

The updated bill text was released late Friday. Republicans then spent Saturday scrambling for enough support for the procedural vote. Ultimately, only Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) voted with Democrats against considering the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which U.S. President Donald Trump wants to sign by July 4, or Independence Day.

Tillis explained his position in a lengthy statement, saying in part: “I cannot support this bill in its current form. It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”

Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) pointed out Saturday that “while Republican senators are securing baubles and trinkets for their political donors, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the Senate bill will cut $930 billion from Medicaid.” That preliminary analysis doesn't account for other attacks on healthcare, including the Affordable Care Act.

“Just as before, these cruel cuts to Americans' healthcare will strike a mortal blow to rural healthcare, and threaten the health and safety of kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities, and working families across the country,” Wyden warned. “Life and death decisions of this magnitude should not be subjected to this rushed and reckless process. I urge Republican senators not to travel down this dangerous path: there is no band-aid that can heal these dangerous, deadly cuts.”

It's 2AM on a Sunday and I'm heading to the Capitol to FORCE a full reading of the Republicans' 940-page bill.This bill will rip health care coverage away from 16 million people and cut food assistance.It's sick. And we will not stand for it.

Paul suggested on social media Saturday evening that the GOP bill would add too much to the national debt. In his post on X, the senator also took a swipe at the platform's owner: the richest man on Earth, Elon Musk, who was the de facto leader of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency until his ugly exit from government last month.

Musk, meanwhile, also took to X to blast the package, criticizing the proposed taxes on wind and solar projects: “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”

While celebrating the 51-49 procedural vote — and specifically praising Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for their crucial support — Trump lashed out at both Paul and Tillis on his Truth Social platform Saturday, threatening the latter with a primary challenge.

Politico reported that “Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol shortly after 8:00 pm to break a possible tie,” with Johnson, Paul, and Tillis having already voted “no.” Johnson changed his vote after negotiations that involved Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), Majority Whip John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and the other holdouts listed by Trump.

One win for critics of the megabill is the removal of Lee's provision to force the sale of public lands, which had generated widespread opposition, including from some Republican lawmakers. Lee had tried to slip a rewritten version of the measure back into the package after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled against it earlier this week.

Storytelling is pushing back against the dominant idea that queerness and rural life are incompatible.

In the years since our now-Vice President J.D. Vance published his disingenuous memoir Hillbilly Elegy — which many Appalachians criticized as “poverty porn” designed to launch his political career — Appalachians have continued our tradition of “talking back.” We published books like What You're Getting Wrong About Appalachia (2018) and Appalachian Reckoning: A Region Responds to Hillbilly Elegy (2019) to challenge the stereotypes and misrepresentations of the region used by both Vance and the liberal pundits who jumped at the opportunity to blame the 2016 election on us.

While these responses included some depictions of queerness in Appalachia — and while the now-defunct Instagram account Queer Appalachia and its zine Electric Dirt gained significant popularity around this time — there remained a noticeable lack of books specifically focused on LGBTQ life in the region.

Many queer Appalachians felt it was crucial to speak for ourselves, and, in recent years, publishers like Haymarket Books, WVU Press, and the University Press of Kentucky have helped meet that need, releasing a wave of books that highlight the diversity of Appalachian stories.

“[W]hat I have seen is that regional presses (both indie presses and university presses) have really committed to publishing books that represent the South and Appalachia in all their complexity,” Neema Avashia, author of Another Appalachia: Coming Up Queer and Indian in a Mountain Place, told Truthout. “And so, because of that, I do think we are seeing more queer books on the shelves reflecting our stories than we did previously.”

“[T]here's definitely an upsurge of queer voices breaking into the mainstream traditional publishing platforms,” Davis Shoulders, series editor of University Press of Kentucky's Appalachian Futures: Black, Native, & Queer Voices and owner of the bookstore Atlas Books in Johnson City, Tennessee, told Truthout. His edited collection, Queer Communion: Religion in Appalachia, is set to be released in October.

“There's a hell of a boom, and I'm absolutely here for it. I want to lift every voice — Black, Brown, queer, disabled, fat, weird, excluded — across Appalachia,” Willie Edward Taylor Carver Jr., author of Gay Poems for Red States, told Truthout.

“[I]t's about damn time! There have always been queer and trans people, and writers, in Appalachia and the South. I'm so grateful folks across the region and beyond are getting to hear our stories now, after so many decades of erasure and silencing, internally and externally,” Rae Garringer, founder and director of Country Queers, told Truthout.

These authors told Truthout that it is crucial for queer Appalachians to tell our own stories, preserve the voices of our community, and make sense of our identities in a region where we face political violence and erasure — from both within and outside Appalachia.

“[N]arrative creates meaning. It changes the DNA of the world we live in. We know this instinctively,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. said. “And for a while, we were on a path — slow for some, faster for others — toward something better. Then fascism shifted the tracks. Now it's instinct again: speak or die. Tell the story. Change the DNA. We have to wrest the pen back — from the fascists and from the ‘allies' who use progressive language to climb the ladder, only to snatch the pen away from those they leave behind.”

This pride, Truthout invited these authors to discuss their work, the boom in queer Appalachia stories, and the importance of queer Appalachian storytelling.

In 2017, Garringer wrote a thesis on queerness in Appalachia titled The Republic of Fabulachia: Queer Visions for a Post-Coal Appalachian Future. At the time, I had just completed my master's degree, started a queer Appalachian zine called Marx in the Mountains, and was captivated by the idea that my identities as Appalachian and queer could coexist with each other. This is what inspired me in 2022 to publish Y'all Means All: The Emerging Voices Queering Appalachia — which gave queer Appalachians the space to describe ourselves — and co-edit Deviant Hollers: Queering Appalachian Ecologies for a Sustainable Future, a collection released in 2024 that explores what exactly is queer about Appalachia.

In the past few years, Garringer has published two books expanding on their work around queerness in the region. Their first book, Country Queers: A Love Letter, published last year, builds on their Country Queers oral history project.

“Country Queers: A Love Letter is a book of photos, oral history excerpts, and my own reflections on a decade of travelling around what is currently known as the United States interviewing rural and small town LGBTQIA2S+ [Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, and Two Spirit] folks. The Country Queers oral history project, which I founded in 2013, was born out of my frustration at how hard it was to find easily accessible rural queer stories about anything other than violence and death, and how absent rural queerness was from both local small town narratives and national queer narratives at the time,” Garringer told Truthout. “The book is a culmination of that 12-year strong project, and includes interview excerpts with folks from Massachusetts to Texas, North Carolina to Arkansas, West Virginia to California.”

Just this year, they also released an edited collection titled To Belong Here: A New Generation of Queer, Trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachian Writers, which features the voices of dozens of queer, trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachians sharing how they make sense of life in the region through poetry and essays.

“To Belong Here: A New Generation of Queer, Trans, and Two-Spirit Appalachian Writers is a collection of essays and poems by a gender expansive, multiracial group of writers raised and/or based in Appalachia. The book wrestles with how we navigate a complicated sense of belonging to a region that doesn't always love us back,” Garringer said. “I wanted to help create a queer Appalachian anthology that featured more Black, Brown, and Indigenous writers, and more trans writers than previous anthologies from the region had. And I wanted to encourage organizers who I know are brilliant writers, but who aren't often encouraged to prioritize their creative work over their movement work, to write something for this collection.”

Such queer creative nonfiction — which include essay collections, queer memoirs, poetry collections, and hybrid works that mix all three — has also grown increasingly popular. Notable works include Another Appalachia by Avashia, Tar Hollow Trans by Stacy Jane Grover, and Gay Poems for Red States by Edward Taylor Carver Jr., all of which offer powerful, nuanced perspectives on queer life in the Appalachian region.

Another Appalachia reflects on growing up queer in southern West Virginia as the daughter of Indian immigrants. “My book is about what it was like to grow up in southern West Virginia as the daughter of Indian immigrants in a community where there were very few people of color, and what it was like to make sense of my own queerness in the context of profound silence about queerness. It's also about how the experiences of my childhood continue to shape how I understand the world today,” Avashia told Truthout. “In some ways, it is an effort to complicate readers' understanding of Appalachia, and the folks who live there.”

In Tar Hollow Trans, Grover reflects on her transgender identity through the lens of Appalachian culture and tradition. Returning to the landscape of her upbringing, she sought to understand how her personal experiences intersect with the region's values and the people who shaped her early life. In doing so, she uncovered meaningful links between Appalachian and transgender identities — connections that go beyond a shared sense of marginalization.

Gay Poems for Red States responds to the ongoing harm of anti-LGBTQ+ movements by celebrating the possibility of living a life rooted in pride, beauty, and belonging.

“I wrote Gay Poems for Red States during a moment in my life when so much I had fought for — my 20-year career, the safety of my students, the feeling that I belonged — was under attack by anti-queer extremists,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. told Truthout. “In that moment, the queer kid I used to be — this kid I once saw as weak and vulnerable — spoke up. He reminded me how strong he was. How much he had always known about survival. And through a series of poems that felt like he was writing them through me, I learned how I would survive, too. Because he taught me.”

His next book, Tore All to Pieces, is a novel that is a “reminder that if we are a painting, then queer folks — gay men and women, trans kids — we can't be unpainted. We are each other's context. In all the ways, good and bad.”

This work continues a rich tradition of queer fiction writing in Appalachia. Collections like Walk Till the Dogs Get Mean: Meditations on the Forbidden from Contemporary Appalachia, published in 2015, and LGBTQ Fiction and Poetry from Appalachia, published in 2019, alongside the fiction writing of celebrated authors such as Carter Sickels and Silas House, have long brought vibrant, complex queer stories from the region to life.

For example, Sickels's The Prettiest Star is set in 1986 and follows a young queer man living with HIV who returns to his hometown in the Appalachian region of southern Ohio.

“I remember what it was like growing up then, and I wanted to document the fear and hatred and cruelty, the intense homophobia, and show how the government, families, media, and churches turned their back on people with AIDS,” Sickels told Truthout. “I also wanted to look at the crisis through the lens of rural America and explore what happens when a queer person, dying of AIDS, returns to the family and the small town that rejected him. It's a story about a family and place.”

Similarly, House's Southernmost, Lark Ascending, and The Tulip Poplars (forthcoming in 2026) explore queerness, faith, love, and resistance across vastly different genres — ranging from contemporary drama to dystopian adventure to sweeping historical romance — while centering queer characters in ways that challenge dominant narratives about both the South and Appalachia.

“My main goal in writing about queer characters is to show them in authentic ways. I think too often we're shown one of two ways: as either fun and partying with limitless resources or miserable and abused. Of course we contain multitudes,” House told Truthout. “In my books I want my queer characters to be multidimensional and I want their orientation to only be one part of them and their story.”

Together, these authors — and the communities they write with and for — are not only queering the canon of Appalachian literature but also asserting that queer and trans people have always belonged in these mountains, shaping the region's past, present, and future.

These authors emphasize that queer Appalachian stories are more vital than ever in today's political climate, pushing back against the dominant narrative that queerness and rural life are incompatible.

Rebecca Scott, co-editor of Deviant Hollers, told Truthout, “Queer stories right now are important across the board. These stories counteract the dehumanization processes going on against trans and queer people, Black and Brown people, Indigenous people, disabled people, and women in Appalachia and across the world.”

“I think queer Appalachian stories are always important, but especially now. I think they offer needed mirrors to queer folks in states whose legislative agendas seek to [enact] profound and lasting harm to queer people,” Avashia told Truthout. “At the same time, I also think they force folks outside Appalachia to reckon with demographic complexity, and not write off entire regions of the country as undeserving of solidarity. Queer people are everywhere in this country, and queer Appalachian stories only underscore that fact.”

Echoing this sentiment, House pointed out the long-standing misconception that queer people do not exist in rural areas. “For one thing, there's long been this notion that there are no queer people in Appalachia or rural places and that's obviously not true. So, we need to tell these stories to make sure people know we have existed here for as long as there have been people here,” House explained. “We are going backwards as a nation and it seems like we have been, on LGBTQ issues, ever since marriage equality passed 10 years ago. This whole faction was so outraged by that that they've been turning back the clock as hard as they can and the main focus of their bigotry and hatred is aimed at our trans siblings. So, telling these stories is important because being visible is important.”

Sickels expressed the cultural appetite driving this storytelling movement: “I think people are hungry for nuanced, complex, diverse stories that dismantle the stereotypes of Appalachia as this monolith of straightness and whiteness. Queer and trans people, Black people, people of color, immigrants, all live in Appalachia, and it feels important, even urgent, to shine a light on these stories and voices,” Sickels told Truthout. “Queer stories are stories of resistance, community, and survival, and we need those more than ever right now.”

“Appalachia is incredibly powerful,” Edward Taylor Carver Jr. said. “She is Black, Brown, queer, trans, liberal, smart, open-minded, and fierce. She is also all of the other things we say she is. And in every form, she is Appalachian.”

As threats to LGBTQ communities mount across the United States, queer Appalachian authors are not just telling their stories — they are reclaiming the narrative of an entire region and writing a future rooted in visibility, resistance, and care.

“I truly believe that Appalachian country queers are some of the kindest, most creative, most brilliant, and best organized people in the world,” Garringer told Truthout. “I think rural queer and trans folks, especially those of us living in ‘deep red' states and far from major cities, have a lot of expertise around how to survive these times, and how to take care of each other along the way.”

In the words of Shoulders: “Queer Appalachians are the future.”

            • Israeli hostage rallies: Anti-war demonstrators and the families of Israeli hostages held protests in Tel Aviv on Saturday to demand a ceasefire in Gaza following the truce between Israel and Iran. Rallygoers urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seize a “historic window of opportunity” to bring remaining hostages home.
    


            • Trump's Middle East diplomacy: Many protesters made direct appeals to US President Donald Trump to intervene in the conflict. Trump helped broker the Israel-Iran truce and his administration has quietly aimed to revive nuclear talks with Tehran, though he has also exchanged sharp words with top Iranian officials, casting doubt on the diplomatic path forward.
    


            • Funerals in Iran: Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran earlier Saturday for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed by Israeli attacks during this month's 12-day conflict.
    


Our live coverage has ended. You can read some of our latest reporting from the region here.



            Iranian state news on Saturday aired an apparent interview with Ali Shamkhani — a close aide to Iran's supreme leader who had previously been reported dead by both Israeli and Iranian media.
    


            Mystery mounted about Shamkhani's fate in the days after he was reported dead following Israel's June 13 strikes on Iran.
    


            Last Friday, multiple Iranian outlets — including IRNA, Tasnim and Fars — claimed Shamkhani had not died but instead had been “severely injured and hospitalized” in the strike. They did not, however, release new photos of him.
    


            Then Shamkhani appeared in pictures from Iranian state media coverage of Saturday's state funeral for those slain during the 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            On the same day, Iranian state news agency IRIB ran what it billed as Shamkhani's first television interview with Iranian state media since the attack.
    


            CNN cannot independently verify his identity or the date the interview was recorded.
    


More on the interview: Shamkhani is shown holding a walking stick and using a breathing aid. He references an Israeli strike on his home, saying he was trapped by rubble for three hours following the attack.
    


            “I did my morning prayer while under the rubble,” he said.
    


            IRIB also released footage of what it said was Shamkhani's home, reduced to broken concrete and rebar.
    


            “At first, I thought it was an earthquake. But when I heard the sound of vehicles, I realized it was not,” he said in the interview, adding that he sustained internal injuries in the attack and that his rib cage was fractured.
    


            “I know why they targeted me, but I cannot say,” he added.
    


            CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities for comment.
    


            Ayman Odeh, an Arab lawmaker in Israel facing impeachment proceedings, called for unity and a ceasefire at an anti-war protest in Kfar Saba, central Israel.
    


            “We must reach a comprehensive deal. We must bring back all the hostages. We must end the war on Gaza,” said Odeh, who leads the Hadash-Ta'al party in Israel's parliament. “Enough! Enough with the wars!”
    


                    In an appeal to the crowd, Odeh said, “I am your partner. And you are my partners. Yes, there are differences, there are disagreements, but I want you to know: I am your partner, because my soul still yearns for freedom. I am your partner, because I still believe in humanity.”
                





            Odeh, who was invited to speak by the organizers of the protest, concluded his remarks by calling to continue the demonstrations. “After so much death, suffering, and tears, better days will come. We will bring them,” he told the crowd.
    


Some background: Odeh faces impeachment proceedings following a post on social media at the beginning of the last Israel-Gaza ceasefire in January, which hailed the release of “(Israeli) hostages and (Palestinian) prisoners.” The post outraged right-wing members of Israel's parliament, called the Knesset, who initiated the proceedings.
    


            In a subsequent defense of the post, Odeh said many of the prisoners released were minors who had not been charged with any crime.
    


            “While it is clear that many of you tend to see primarily the Jewish suffering, I see and feel the suffering of both peoples,” Odeh said.
    


            Tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday to call for an end to the Gaza war and a return of the remaining hostages.
    


            “It's big, it's vibrant, it's noisy,” CNN's Nic Robertson, who is at the scene, said of the atmosphere.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum estimated that 30,000 people came out.
    


            Many held signs showing pictures of the hostages that said, “Bring them home now,” a frequent refrain during the weekly protests. Others held signs that appealed to US President Donald Trump to step in and demand an end to the war.
    


            One sign said, “President Trump, end the crisis in Gaza! Nobel is waiting!”
    

CNN's Nic Robertson reports from Tel Aviv where tens of thousands of anti-war protesters packed Hostages Square to call for an end to the Gaza war and the return of the remaining hostages.


            Trump was part of the effort to secure a ceasefire after 12 days of conflict between Israel and Iran. He also demanded that the Israeli military stop what the government said would be a major attack on Iran, prompted by a ballistic missile launch at northern Israel after the ceasefire went into effect. Israel instead targeted a radar north of Tehran.
    


            Trump's perceived ability to force Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hand has led many protesters to renew their calls for him to step in and force an end to the war in Gaza.
    


            Ruby Chen — the mother of Itay Chen, who was killed in the October 7, 2023, attacks and whose body is still being held in Gaza — said the right thing to do was to “return all the hostages, even at the price of ending the war.”
    


                    “Bibi, the return of the hostages is not surrender, it is being Jewish,” Chen said, addressing Netanyahu by his nickname. “Mr. Prime Minister, now is the time to go for it and not to have political considerations. Bring the 50 hostages home already.”
                





            The large rally happening now in Tel Aviv comes at the end of a day of protest in Israel, with several smaller demonstrations held across the country demanding an end to the war in Gaza and return of Israeli hostages.
    


            In the northern Israeli port city of Haifa, demonstrators held up signs demanding that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leave office.
    


            “The war must end, the hostages must return, the government must fall!” one read. “How much more blood will be spilled before the guilty one goes?” read another.
    


            At Alonim Junction in northern Israel, demonstrators held up hands covered in red paint and chanted, “We have no soldiers for the wars for Netanyahu's welfare.”
    


            In the central Israeli city of Ness Ziona, protesters held a large banner that simply said: “End this f***ing war.”
    


            The hostages held in Gaza for more than 630 days of war should not be treated as “bargaining chips,” said Israeli lawmaker Yair Golan on Saturday, calling for a ceasefire and hostage deal at an anti-government protest in Haifa.
    


            “The hostages are not bargaining chips. They are our brothers and sisters,” said Golan, head of the left-wing Democrats party. “The soldiers fighting in Gaza are our sons and daughters. And anyone who does not place their return at the top of the national priority list — is neither a Zionist nor worthy of leadership.”
    


            Golan, who has been sharply critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, added that Israel's ongoing war in Gaza “serves only the survival of the coalition.”
    


            The country's ceasefire with Iran, achieved after 12 days of conflict, has led to a renewed push from mediators to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.
    


            Protesters across Israel — forbidden from organizing their demonstrations for the last two weeks because of emergency guidelines during the conflict with Iran — are now packing the streets of major cities in Israel, including Tel Aviv and Haifa.
    


            As renewed protests against the war in Gaza begin tonight in Israel, the mother of a hostage is calling on US President Donald Trump to demand an end to the conflict.
    


            Viki Cohen, mother of 20-year-old Nimrod Cohen, told CNN she feels there is “momentum” now to end the war and to bring all of the hostages home.
    


                    “Even (though) we were disappointed before so many times, now we feel that it's a little different. Trump is very demanding and we believe in him. We trust him. And we know he has the power to stop the war,” Cohen said as she prepared to participate in a protest in Tel Aviv.
                





            “He can pressure our prime minister to do it, to finish the war in Gaza. And in this way all the hostages can come home, and my son among them.”
    


            There are 50 hostages still held in Gaza, of which at least 20 are believed to be alive.
    


            The weekly anti-war and anti-government protests that have packed the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities were forbidden during the 12-day conflict with Iran because of emergency guidelines prohibiting large gatherings. With the restrictions lifted, organizers are renewing the protests, particularly in light of the ceasefire with Iran.
    


            Trump said Friday he believes a ceasefire will be agreed to in Gaza “within the next week.”
    


                    “We hope that now it's the momentum to bring all the hostages back home after the fight with Iran,” Cohen said. “Iran gives a lot of support to Hamas, and now they don't have Iran anymore. We finished with Hezbollah, so now there is no threat, and it's time to finish the war in Gaza and to bring them all home.”
                





            CNN witnessed the Hosseini infants ceremony in Tehran, which took place Friday in the background of Iran's tensions with Israel and the US.
    


            One mother showed CNN's Fred Pleitgen a band on her baby's head, which she said is a “symbol saluting Imam Hossein … who's the leader of all the oppressed who stand against oppressors and don't submit.”
    


            Crowds chanted against the US and Israel during the ceremony while videos were shown of Iran's missile program.

            As tens of thousands gathered in Iran's capital, Tehran, for the state funeral of those killed in Israeli strikes, a post on the Iranian supreme leader's X account reiterated his vow that the Islamic nation will never surrender to the United States.
    


                    “The Iranian nation should know that the reason for the conflict with America is that they want Iran to surrender,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wrote in a post on his Farsi-language X account, echoing a portion of a previous statement. “The Americans are the ones who have committed this great insult to the Iranian nation, and that such an event will never happen,” the statement added.
                





            It was Khamenei's first post since the start of the state funeral. The message did not address the event directly.
    


            The supreme leader has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel.
    


            A top Iranian commander whose disappearance from public view after Israeli attacks sparked rumors he'd been killed attended Saturday's funeral procession in Iran's capital.
    


            Quds Force commander Esmail Qaani, thought to be a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was seen among the crowds in Tehran at the state funerals being interviewed on camera.
    


            Asked by a reporter if he had a message for the people of Iran, Qaani said that “we have been successful so far, and from now on we will also move forward successfully.”
    


            Qaani was not seen for days after the unprecedented Israeli strikes but is one of the highest-profile military figures to survive.
    


Qasem Soleimani, his predecessor in the Quds Force — the overseas branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps — was killed in a US drone strike during the first term of Donald Trump's presidency.
    


            Meanwhile, Ali Shamkhani — another high-profile Iranian military and political official previously thought to be dead — also appeared at Saturday's state funerals, according to pictures published by Iranian state media.
    


            Iran's president thanked citizens for turning out to mourn those killed in the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran that ended with a US-brokered ceasefire.
    


            “I sincerely thank you, dear people,” Masoud Pezeshkian wrote in a post on X Saturday.
    


                    “With love, you bid farewell to the martyrs of the homeland, and the voice of our unity reached the world,” he continued.
                





            He added that “serving such a free-spirited nation is the honor of my life.”
    


            Hundreds of thousands of mourners gathered in Tehran today for the state funerals of top military officials, nuclear scientists, and civilians killed by Israeli attacks earlier this month.
    


            A host of senior Iranian officials joined the mass mourning in Tehran on Saturday for those killed in Israel's attacks, but Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was absent.
    


            Khamenei, who has not appeared in public since the start of Iran's conflict with Israel, did not immediately issue a statement regarding the state funeral, which was held for 60 top military officials, nuclear scientists, and women and children killed in the 12-day conflict.
    


            The chief of staff of Iran's Armed Forces, Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi, was also not seen at the ceremony, but issued a statement praising people for showing up to what he described as a “unique and multi-million-strong funeral.”
    


            Senior officials in attendance included Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei.
    


More on Khamenei: The 86-year-old supreme leader made his first public statement since the Israel-Iran truce on Thursday, issuing the remarks in a recorded message from an undisclosed location. Khamenei declared victory in the conflict despite Israel's killing of senior Iranian leaders and the strikes on Tehran's nuclear sites.
    


This post has been updated to reflect Mousavi's statement.



            Sixty coffins made their way through Tehran, carrying military leaders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed in Israeli attacks this month, CNN's Fred Pleitgen reports.
    


            Attendees said they wanted to honor those who were killed, but also vowed revenge on both Israel and the US.
    


Watch here:



            The bodies of those killed in Israeli airstrikes have begun to arrive at a cemetery in Iran's capital for burial.
    


            The remains of Hassan Salehi, who was killed in an Israeli attack on Iran's Evin prison, have arrived at Behesht-e Zahra, the largest cemetery in Tehran, Iran's semi-official state news agency Tasnim reported.
    


            Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, one of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's closest confidants, is set to visit Washington, DC on Monday, according to a source familiar with the planning.
    


            The visit comes ahead of a meeting between Netanyahu and President Donald Trump.
    


            On Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there is no set date for a Netanyahu visit, but Trump is “very open” to it.
    


            This past week, Trump denounced an ongoing corruption trial against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt” in a social media post, which was hailed by allies of the long-time Israeli leader.
    


            Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Tehran on Saturday to commemorate the senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians killed during Iran's 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            As mourners clad in all black chanted death to Israel and America, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi acknowledged the loss of lives was “hard and painful” but pledged the nation would return to “new glory.”
    


            The  brief and bloody conflict between Iran and Israel, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon, saw casualties on both sides and ended with a US-brokered ceasefire.
    


Here's what you need to know: 



            Emirates, one of the United Arab Emirates' flagship carriers, has canceled all fights to and from Iran's capital Tehran until July 5 due to the “regional situation,” the company announced Saturday.
    


            The company said that customers connecting through Dubai with final destinations in Iran “will not be accepted for travel at their point of origin until further notice.”
    


            “We apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers. We continue to closely monitor developments,” the company said in a statement.
    


            The Israeli military detained six settlers in the occupied West Bank overnight after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) say the suspects attacked security forces.
    


            The IDF says they spotted Israeli civilians driving toward a closed military zone near the Palestinian village of Kafr Malik, where days earlier settlers set fire to homes and vehicles in an attack Palestinian officials say killed three people.
    


            When Israeli forces approached the group, the IDF says the soldiers were physically and verbally assaulted. In addition, the suspects vandalized and damaged the security forces' vehicles and attempted to ram the forces.
    


            Six suspects were apprehended and transferred to police, the IDF said.
    


                    “The IDF and Israel Police condemn any act of violence against security forces and will act firmly against any attempt to harm security personnel carrying out their duty to protect Israeli citizens,” the IDF said in a statement.
                





Some background: Israel has been ramping up military operations in the West Bank alongside the offensive in Gaza and attacks on Iran and its proxies, displacing thousands of Palestinians and razing entire communities as it targets what it says are militants operating in the territory.
    


            Earlier this week, Israeli forces shot dead a Palestinian teenager in the West Bank, Palestinian health authorities said. The Israeli military said that “terrorists hurled explosive devices at IDF forces.”
    


            Speaking on the day of state funerals for those killed in Israeli strikes, Iran's foreign minister said that the loss of lives is “hard and painful” but their “memory will live on.”
    


            Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, in a post on Instagram Saturday, stressed that the “pride of a nation is paramount” as he pledged that Iran would return to “new glory and greater strength” following its 12-day conflict with Israel.
    


            He added that the 60 who were killed and whose bodies were laid to rest Saturday – in an event which saw hundreds of thousands line the streets of Tehran – gave their “blood” but did not surrender their honor.
    


            Top military commanders, scientists and civilians were killed in the brief and bloody conflict, which Israel said aimed at preventing Iran developing a nuclear weapon. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
    


            The US military did not use bunker-buster bombs on one of Iran's largest nuclear sites last weekend because the site is so deep that the bombs likely would not have been effective, the US' top general told senators during a briefing on Thursday.
    


            The comment by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, which was described by three people who heard his remarks and a fourth who was briefed on them, is the first known explanation given for why the US military did not use the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb against the Isfahan site in central Iran.
    


            Questions have swirled over the past week about the extent of the damage to Isfahan and other sites following US strikes on three of the country's nuclear facilities.
    


            US officials believe Isfahan's underground structures house nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon.
    


            US B2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites.
    


            But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  Mary Frances Ruskell graduated from high school last month in Columbia, South Carolina. She will be attending Dartmouth College in the fall.



            The summer before sixth grade, my friend Lou and I discovered an empty lot with an abandoned dock on the lake in her neighborhood in Columbia, South Carolina.
    


            It was always magical there. We only went in the late afternoon to avoid the heat, when the light was sliding into evening and the cicadas and frogs were buzzing.We'd sit on the dock eating candy and drinking slushees for hours.
    


            Those are some of my favorite summer memories from elementary and middle school. My parents gave me a long leash as a kid, provided I was home before the streetlamps turned on.
    


            I walked long distances, especially in the summer when I had more time. I'd wander down to the neighborhood drugstore for gummy candies, or all the way to a main shopping street to try on clothes I couldn't afford. I'd walk to restaurants, coffee shops and far-flung friends' houses. It was fun, and it taught me how to be on my own in the world, in its own small way.
    


            But I was a rare free-range child among my peers. Dozens of kids my age lived in the neighborhood, but only three were allowed to walk to my house to ask if I wanted to play when we were in elementary school. The other parents didn't let their kids go off in the neighborhood on their own.
    


            Instead, they called my mom to set up playdates in what felt like the far-off future. I appreciate how much effort and organization that took, but when you're a little kid, the desire to play was immediate. It was frustrating.
    


            When I visited friends in the Netherlands in March, the Dutch kids I encountered reminded me of my own childhood roaming my neighborhood. I was staying in Haarlem, a small storybook city outside of Amsterdam, with Tracy, a family friend and American expat now living in the Netherlands. Her three kids were born there and are being raised Dutch. They were always in and out of the apartment, headed to school, restaurants and friends' houses.
    


            These kinds of comings and goings aren't unique to their family. Many Dutch children enjoy a freedom of movement that most American kids don't, which might be the key to why Dutch kids are the happiest kids in the world, according to a 2025 UNICEF report. The agency measured childhood well-being in 43 countries that are members of the European Union and/or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The US was not fully ranked in mental health because researchers were missing relevant data. 



            Even without a definitive mental health ranking for American children, I still think Dutch kids are far happier than American kids like me. Articles discussing the report offer lots of different answers as to why this happiness gap exists: better health care, ﻿high-trust culture, less pressure to excel academically. But when I asked parents and children in the Netherlands why they thought their children were so happy, they all had one answer: Dutch parents value giving their children independence, possibly above all else.
    


            American parents say they value independence, too.
    


            Nearly three-quarters of American parents with children ages 5 to 8 say “they make it a point to have their child do things themselves, when possible,” according to the 2023 C.S. Mott Children's Hospital National Poll on Children's Health. The poll also found that among parents of children ages 9 to 11, “84% agree that children benefit from having free time without adult supervision.”
    


What ‘gentle parenting' does for your kids



            So, if both American and Dutch parents value independence, why do Dutch kids seem so much happier? I wonder if the key difference lies in how both sets of parents understand what freedom for kids looks like.
    


            “Dutch parenting is all about raising self-sufficient kids,” Tracy told me. “My older two (ages 12 and 14) bike more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) daily to school since there are no school buses.
    


            “If a teacher cancels a class, students just have free time instead of a substitute. My 14-year-old had two canceled classes this morning and simply stayed home until noon. This would be a logistical nightmare for schools and parents if we didn't just expect our kids to sort it out.”
    


            Dutch parenting, according to the close to a dozen parents in the Netherlands I spoke with, emphasizes allowing children a freedom of movement that many American kids don't have. When I was in Haarlem and Amsterdam, bikes and little kids on bikes were everywhere.
    


            Dutch kids get bicycles at an early age, Tracy told me, and that gives them the ability to move around their towns and cities by themselves. I also saw plenty of kids walking with their friends to stores and restaurants. Generally speaking, Dutch children and teens are allowed to move freely through the world.
    


            Most American kids don't have anything close to this degree of freedom. Only 33% of American children between the ages of 9 and 11 are allowed to bike or walk to a friend's house alone, according to the Mott survey. One-half are allowed to find an item at a store while a parent is in another aisle, and 15% may trick-or-treat with friends on their own. They cannot move through the world without their parents there.
    


            There may be many reasons why American parents are limiting their kids' physical independence, but the main reason seems to be concern for children's safety.
    


            American parents are afraid for their children's well-being, and that makes them anxious. In fact, 40% of parents report being extremely worried about their children struggling with depression or anxiety, and 36% report being “somewhat” concerned, according to a 2023 Pew Research Center survey of American parenting. More than 4 in 10 parents describe themselves as overprotective, the survey noted. That may be why they limit their child's freedom of movement.
    


            That lack of freedom of movement might be undermining what parents say they actually want for their children: well-being. After all, don't parents protect their kids so they'll be happy and healthy?
    


            A team of researchers concluded in a 2023 study that “a primary cause of the rise in mental disorders is a decline over decades in opportunities for children and teens to play, roam, and engage in other activities independent of direct oversight and control by adults.”
    


            The study's researchers argue that independent activity in adolescents leads to the well-being that parents want. Independent activities require young people to make their own decisions and find their own solutions, leading to the development of a strong “internal locus of control,” the researchers noted.
    


            That locus refers to a person's tendency to believe they have control over their life and can solve problems as they arise. A weak internal locus of control, stemming from less independence in adolescence, often leads to anxiety or depression.
    


A father's poor mental health may harm his children's development, study finds



            My high school classmate Cal commented on this anxiety once when we were talking about how Gen Z apparently parties less. “People are too scared for their kids to go and do stuff, and I think, as a result (we) as a generation are too scared to do stuff now.”
    


            I'm not a parent, and I'm not trying to tell anyone how to raise their children. But I did just graduate from high school, so I know what modern childhood is like. I remember how wonderful and rare it was being able to wander in elementary and middle school, so I hope my perspective might be helpful to some anxious parents.
    


            This summer, consider letting your kids walk to the neighborhood park without you. Or give them money to buy an ice cream cone without your supervision. Encourage them to invite a friend. Let them have some physical freedom, and the memories that come with it.

MIAMI (AP) — Weather forecasters say a second tropical storm has formed along coastal Mexico.

Shortly after announcing Tropical Storm Barry off the country's Atlantic coast on Saturday morning, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said Tropical Storm Flossie formed along Mexico's west coast.

The storm's center was about 240 miles (about 390 kilometers) south of Acapulco and about 485 miles (780 kilometers) southeast of Manzanillo. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 40 mph (65 kph) and it was moving west at 9 mph (15 kph).

Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched its biggest aerial attack against Ukraine overnight, a Ukrainian official said Sunday, part of an escalating bombing campaign that has further dashed hopes for a breakthrough in efforts to end the 3-year-old war.

Russia fired a total of 537 aerial weapons at Ukraine, including 477 drones and decoys and 60 missiles, Ukraine's air force said. Of these, 249 were shot down and 226 were lost, likely having been electronically jammed.

The onslaught was “the most massive airstrike” on the country since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, taking into account both drones and various types of missiles, Yuriy Ihnat, head of communications for Ukraine's air force, told The Associated Press. The attack targeted several regions, including western Ukraine, far from the front line.

Poland and allied countries scrambled aircraft to ensure the safety of Polish airspace, the country's air force said.

Three people were killed in each of the drone strikes in the Kherson, Kharkiv and the Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to the three governors. 

Another person was killed by an airstrike in Kostyantynivka, local officials said. In addition to aerial attacks, a man died when Russian troops shelled the city of Kherson, and the body of a 70-year-old woman was found under the rubble of a nine-story building hit by Russian shelling in the Zaporizhzhia region.

In the far-western Lviv region, a large fire broke out at an industrial facility in the city of Drohobych following a drone attack that also cut electricity to parts of the city. 

Ukraine's air force said one of its F-16 warplanes supplied by its Western partners crashed after sustaining damage while shooting down air targets. The pilot died. 

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had shot down three Ukrainian drones overnight.

Two people were wounded in another Ukrainian drone attack on the city of Bryansk in western Russia, regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said Sunday morning, adding that seven more Ukrainian drones had been shot down over the region.




Meanwhile, Russia claimed Sunday that it had taken control of the village of Novoukrainka in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region.

Russian forces have been slowly grinding forward at some points on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, though their incremental gains have been costly in terms of troop casualties and damaged armor. 

In other developments, Russia's foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, said he had spoken on the phone with his U.S. counterpart, CIA Director John Ratcliffe.

“I had a phone call with my American counterpart and we reserved for each other the possibility to call at any time and discuss issues of interest to us,” Naryshkin said in remarks to state TV reporter Pavel Zarubin, who posted them on his Telegram channel on Sunday.

Sunday's attacks follow Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments two days ago that Moscow is ready for a fresh round of direct peace talks in Istanbul. Two recent rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul were brief and yielded no progress on reaching a settlement.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a decree to withdraw Ukraine from the Ottawa Convention banning antipersonnel land mines, a Ukrainian lawmaker said Sunday. The move follows similar recent steps by the Baltic states and Poland.

The 1997 treaty prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel land mines in an effort to protect civilians from explosives that can maim or kill long after fighting ends.

“This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,” said Roman Kostenko, secretary of the Ukrainian parliamentary committee on national security, defense and intelligence. He noted that Russia is not a party to the convention “and is massively using mines against our military and civilians.”

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday urged progress in ceasefire talks in the 20-month war in Gaza, as Israel and Hamas appeared to move closer to an agreement.

Ron Dermer, a top adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire, an Israeli official said, and plans were being made for Netanyahu to travel there in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a deal.

Netanyahu was meeting with his security Cabinet on Sunday evening, the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that hadn't been finalized.

“MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!” Trump wrote on social media early Sunday. Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be an agreement within the next week.

Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war. An eight-week ceasefire was reached just as he took office earlier this year, but Israel resumed the war in March after trying to get Hamas to accept new terms on next steps.

Some Palestinians greeted the possibility of a new truce with skepticism after watching the last ceasefire shattered.

“Since the beginning of the war, they have been promising us something like this: Release the hostages and we will stop the war,” said Abdel Hadi Al-Hour. “They did not stop the war.”

Trump also doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it “a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT.”

In the post Saturday evening, Trump said the trial interfered with ceasefire talks, saying Netanyahu “is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back.”

Last week, Trump called for the trial to be canceled. It was a dramatic interference by an ally in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. It unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity there.

The trial has repeatedly been postponed at Netanyahu's request, citing security and diplomatic developments. On Sunday, the court agreed to call off two more days of testimony by him scheduled this week.

Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over a major sticking point — whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.

Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying on social media that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. About 50 hostages remain, with less than half believed to be alive.

Netanyahu spokesperson Omer Dostri said that “Hamas was the only obstacle to ending the war,” without addressing Merdawi's claim.

During a visit Sunday to to Israel's internal security service, Shin Bet, Netanyahu said that the Israel-Iran war and subsequent ceasefire have opened many opportunities: “First of all, to rescue the hostages. Of course, we will also have to solve the Gaza issue, to defeat Hamas, but I estimate that we will achieve both tasks.”

Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war in Gaza. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something that the group refuses.

The war in Gaza began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage.

Gaza's Health Ministry on Sunday said that another 88 people have been killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, raising the war's toll among Palestinians to 56,500. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas government, doesn't distinguish between militants and civilians in its count, but says more than half of the dead are women and children.

The war has displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape and left people overwhelmingly reliant on outside aid, which Israel has limited since the end of the latest ceasefire.

Fewer than half of Gaza's hospitals are even partly functional, and more than 4,000 children need medical evacuation abroad, a new U.N. humanitarian assessment says.

“We are exhausted, we are tired. We hope to God that the war will end,” said one Palestinian, Mahmoud Wadi.

The Israeli military ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza, home to hundreds of thousands of people who had returned during the ceasefire earlier this year.

Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.

The military will expand its escalating attacks westward to the city's center, calling for people to move toward the Muwasi area in southern Gaza, Adraee said.

An Israeli military offensive aims to move Palestinians to southern Gaza, so forces can more freely operate to combat militants. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible displacement.

Watch live as the Senate is taking a prolonged procedural vote during a rare Saturday evening session as Republicans struggled to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

WASHINGTON (AP) — At some 940-pages, the legislation is a sprawling collection of tax breaks, spending cuts and other Republican priorities, including new money for national defense and deportations. Now it's up to Congress to decide whether President Donald Trump's signature's domestic policy package will become law.

Trump told Republicans, who hold majority power in the House and Senate, to skip their holiday vacations and deliver the bill by the Fourth of July. 

Senators were working through the weekend to pass the bill and send it back to the House for a final vote. Democrats are united against it.

Here's the latest on what's in the bill. There could be changes as lawmakers negotiate.

Republicans say the bill is crucial because there would be a massive tax increase after December when tax breaks from Trump's first term expire. The legislation contains roughly $3.8 trillion in tax cuts.

The existing tax rates and brackets would become permanent under the bill. It temporarily would add new tax breaks that Trump campaigned on: no taxes on tips, overtime pay or some automotive loans, along with a bigger $6,000 deduction in the Senate draft for older adults who earn no more than $75,000 a year.

It would boost the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,200 under the Senate proposal. Families at lower income levels would not see the full amount. 

A cap on state and local deductions, called SALT, would quadruple to $40,000 for five years. It's a provision important to New York and other high tax states, though the House wanted it to last for 10 years. 




There are scores of business-related tax cuts.

The wealthiest households would see a $12,000 increase from the legislation, which would cost the poorest people $1,600 a year, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office analysis of the House's version.

Middle-income taxpayers would see a tax break of $500 to $1,500, the CBO said.

The bill would provide some $350 billion for Trump's border and national security agenda, including $46 billion for the U.S.-Mexico border wall and $45 billion for 100,000 migrant detention facility beds, as he aims to fulfill his promise of the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

Money would go for hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses and a surge of Border Patrol officers, as well. The goal is to deport some 1 million people per year. 

The homeland security secretary would have a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions. The attorney general would have $3.5 billion for a similar fund, known as Bridging Immigration-related Deficits Experienced Nationwide, or BIDEN, referring to former Democratic President Joe Biden.

To help pay for it all, immigrants would face various new fees, including when seeking asylum protections.

For the Pentagon, the bill would provide billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system. The Defense Department would have $1 billion for border security.

To help partly offset the lost tax revenue and new spending, Republicans aim to cut back some long-running government programs: Medicaid, food stamps, green energy incentives and others. It's essentially unraveling the accomplishments of the past two Democratic presidents, Biden and Barack Obama.

Republicans argue they are trying to rightsize the safety net programs for the population they were initially designed to serve, mainly pregnant women, the disabled and children, and root out what they describe as waste, fraud and abuse.

The package includes new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for many adults receiving Medicaid and food stamps, including older people up to age 65. Parents of children 14 and older would have to meet the program's work requirements.

There's also a proposed new $35 co-payment that can be charged to patients using Medicaid services. 

Some 80 million people rely on Medicaid, which expanded under Obama's Affordable Care Act, and 40 million use the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. Most already work, according to analysts. 

All told, the CBO estimates that under the House-passed bill, at least 10.9 million more people would go without health coverage and 3 million more would not qualify for food stamps.

The Senate proposes a $25 billion Rural Hospital Transformation Program to help offset reduced Medicaid dollars. It's a new addition, intended to win over holdout GOP senators and a coalition of House Republicans warning that the proposed Medicaid provider tax cuts would hurt rural hospitals.

Both the House and Senate bills propose a dramatic rollback of the Biden-era green energy tax breaks for electric vehicles. They also would phase out or terminate the various production and investment tax credits companies use to stand up wind, solar and other renewable energy projects.

In total, cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy programs would be expected to produce at least $1.5 trillion in savings. 

A number of extra provisions reflect other GOP priorities.

The House and Senate both have a new children's savings program, called Trump Accounts, with a potential $1,000 deposit from the Treasury.

The Senate provided $40 million to establish Trump's long-sought “National Garden of American Heroes.”

There's a new excise tax on university endowments. A $200 tax on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns was eliminated. One provision bars money to family planning providers, namely Planned Parenthood, while $88 million is earmarked for a pandemic response accountability committee. Another section expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, a hard-fought provision from Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for those impacted by nuclear development and testing.

Billions would go for the Artemis moon mission and for exploration to Mars.

The bill would deter states from regulating artificial intelligence by linking certain federal AI infrastructure money to maintaining a freeze. Seventeen Republican governors asked GOP leaders to drop the provision.

Additionally, a provision would increase the nation's debt limit, by $5 trillion, to allow continued borrowing to pay already accrued bills.

Altogether, keeping the existing tax breaks and adding the new ones is expected to cost $3.8 trillion over the decade, the CBO says in its analysis of the House bill. An analysis of the Senate draft is pending.

The CBO estimates the House-passed package would add $2.4 trillion to the nation's deficits over the decade.

Or not, depending on how one does the math.

Senate Republicans are proposing a unique strategy of not counting the existing tax breaks as a new cost because those breaks are already “current policy.” Senators say the Senate Budget Committee chairman has the authority to set the baseline for the preferred approach.

Under the Senate GOP view, the tax provisions cost $441 billion, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation.

Democrats and others say this is “magic math” that obscures the true costs of the GOP tax breaks. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget puts the Senate tally at $4.2 trillion over the decade.

Watch live as the Senate is taking a prolonged procedural vote during a rare Saturday evening session as Republicans struggled to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans voting in a dramatic late Saturday session narrowly cleared a key procedural step as they race to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline.

Senate Republicans voting in a dramatic late Saturday session narrowly cleared a key procedural step as they race to advance President Donald Trump's package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered deportation funds by his July Fourth deadline. The tally, 51-49, came after a tumultuous session with Vice President JD Vance on hand if needed to break the tie.

The tally, 51-49, came after a tumultuous night with Vice President JD Vance at the Capitol to break a potential tie. Tense scenes played out in the chamber as voting came to a standstill, dragging for more than three hours as holdout senators huddled for negotiations, and took private meetings off the floor. In the end, two Republicans opposed the motion to proceed, joining all Democrats.

There's still a long weekend of work to come. 

Republicans are using their majorities in Congress to push aside Democratic opposition, but they have run into a series of political and policy setbacks. Not all GOP lawmakers are on board with proposals to reduce spending on Medicaid, food stamps and other programs as a way to help cover the cost of extending some $3.8 trillion in Trump tax breaks.

“It's time to get this legislation across the finish line,” said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

Ahead of roll call, the White House released a statement of administrative policy saying it “strongly supports passage” of the bill. Trump himself was at his golf course in Virginia on Saturday with GOP senators posting about the visit on social media.




But by nightfall, Trump was lashing out against holdouts, threatening to campaign against one Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who had announced he could not support the bill because of grave Medicaid cuts that he worried would leave many without health care in his state. Tillis and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted against. The president was working the phones from the Oval Office late Saturday night, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Pressure was mounting from all sides — billionaire Elon Musk criticized the package as “utterly insane and destructive.”

The 940-page “One Big Beautiful Bill Act was released shortly before midnight Friday, and senators are expected to grind through all-night debate and amendments in the days ahead. If the Senate is able to pass it, the bill would go back to the House for a final round of votes before it could reach the White House.

With the narrow Republican majorities in the House and Senate, leaders need almost every lawmaker on board. A new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the Senate bill would increase by 11.8 million the number of people without health insurance in 2034.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Republicans unveiled the bill “in the dead of night” and are rushing to finish the bill before the public fully knows what's in it. He immediately forced a full reading of the text late Saturday in the Senate, which would take hours.

The weekend session could be a make-or-break moment for Trump's party, which has invested much of its political capital on his signature domestic policy plan. Trump is pushing Congress to wrap it up and has admonished the “grandstanders” among GOP holdouts to fall in line.

The legislation is an ambitious but complicated series of GOP priorities. At its core, it would make permanent many of the tax breaks from Trump's first term that would otherwise expire by year's end if Congress fails to act, resulting in a potential tax increase on Americans. The bill would add new breaks, including no taxes on tips, and commit $350 billion to national security, including for Trump's mass deportation agenda.

But the cutbacks to Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments, which a top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said would be a “death sentence” for America's wind and solar industries, are also causing dissent within GOP ranks. 

The Republicans are relying on the reductions to offset the lost tax revenues but some lawmakers say the cuts go too far, particularly for people receiving health care through Medicaid. Meanwhile, conservatives, worried about the nation's debt, are pushing for steeper cuts.

Tillis said he spoke with Trump late Friday explaining his concerns. Paul of Kentucky had been opposed to the bill's provision to raise the nation's debt limit by $5 trillion. 

And GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who initially voted no, switched hours later after private talks to agree to advance the bill.

As the roll call teetered, attention turned to Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska who was surrounded by GOP leaders in intense conversation. She voted to proceed.

A short time later, Thune drew conservative holdouts Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, Mike Lee of Utah and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming to his office, with Vance and Johnson also joining. Talks dragged on.

Then swiftly, Vance led them all back in to vote. 

Later, Scott said he had met with the president, adding, “We all want to get to yes.” 

Lee said the group “had an internal discussion about the strategy to achieve more savings and more deficit reduction, and I feel good about the direction where this is going, and more to come.”

The release of the bill's draft had been delayed as the Senate parliamentarian reviewed the measure to ensure it complied with the chamber's strict “Byrd Rule,” named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. It largely bars policy matters from inclusion in budget bills unless a provision can get 60 votes to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate with a 53-47 GOP edge and Democrats unified against Trump's bill.

Republicans suffered a series of setbacks after several proposals, including shifting food stamp costs from the federal government to the states or gutting the funding structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were deemed out of compliance with the rules.

But over the past days, Republicans have quickly revised those proposals and reinstated them.

The final text includes a proposal for cuts to the Medicaid provider tax that had run into parliamentary hurdles and objections from several senators worried about the fate of rural hospitals. The new version extends the start date for those cuts and establishes a $25 billion fund to aid rural hospitals and providers. 

The CBO had said that under the House-passed version of the bill, some 10.9 million more people would go without health care and at least 3 million fewer would qualify for food aid. The budget office has started releasing initial assessments of the Senate draft, which proposes steeper reductions.

Top income-earners would see about a $12,000 tax cut under the House bill, while the package would cost the poorest Americans $1,600, the CBO said.

The Senate included a compromise over the so-called SALT provision, a deduction for state and local taxes that has been a top priority of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, but the issue remains unsettled.

The current SALT cap is $10,000 a year, and a handful of Republicans wanted to boost it to $40,000 a year. The final draft includes a $40,000 cap, but limits it for five years. Many Republican senators say that is still too generous, but House Republicans are not fully satisfied either.

House Speaker Mike Johnson sent his colleagues home for the weekend with plans to be on call to return to Washington.

NBA star Jonathan Isaac argues that transgender athletes competing in girls' and women's sports compromises fairness.

Tennis legend Martina Navratilova came to the defense of ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling on Saturday as the writer received criticism from actor Pedro Pascal in a recent interview.

Rowling and Pascal have clashed in the past on transgender issues, including after Rowling celebrated the United Kingdom's Supreme Court ruling on the legal definition of a woman.

""Bullies make me f------ sick,"" Pascal told Vanity Fair. ""It's a situation that deserves the utmost elegance so that something can actually happen.""

Rowling dismissed Pascal in a social media post on Friday and Navratilova added to it.

""Another Johnny come lately telling women to STFU,"" Navratilova wrote.

She has made clear in the past she is no supporter of President Donald Trump, and a quick scan of her social media posts would underscore that. However, she has lamented Democrats' inaction over the issue of transgender athletes participating in women's and girls' sports.

When Trump signed an executive order to prohibit biological males from women's and girls' sports, she fired off a fierce message toward the Democratic Party.

""I hate that the Democrats totally failed women and girls on this very clear issue of women's sports being for females only,"" she wrote in a post on X.

She also expressed her frustration in January when the House of Representatives passed the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Only two Democrats voted with Republicans on the bill.

Former Bush Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice outlines the impact of Operation Midnight Hammer on the Middle East region on 'Special Report.'

A leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report is casting doubt on President Donald Trump's claim that recent U.S. airstrikes ""completely and totally obliterated"" three Iranian nuclear facilities, instead concluding the mission only set back Iran's program by several months.

The report, published by CNN and The New York Times, comes just days after Trump approved the strikes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. In a national address immediately following the operation, Trump declared the sites ""completely and totally obliterated."" 

While members of the Trump administration have waged a new war to discredit the initial report from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, multiple experts told Fox News Digital that there is too little information available right now to accurately determine how much damage the strikes did. 

Piecing together a thorough intelligence assessment is complex and time-consuming, they said. 

FBI INVESTIGATING IRAN STRIKE LEAKER, LEAVITT SAYS: ‘THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE'

Trump said Saturday that the U.S. completed a ""very successful"" strike against Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, saying that Iran's nuclear enrichment installations have been ""obliterated.""  (Fox News)

Dan Shapiro, who previously served as the deputy assistant secretary of Defense for the Middle East and the U.S. ambassador to Israel, said he didn't put a lot of stock in both overly pessimistic or overly optimistic assessments that emerged quickly, and said that the initial assessment from DIA was likely only based on satellite imagery. 

""That's one piece of the puzzle of how you would really make this assessment,"" Shapiro, now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital. ""You'd really want to have to test all the other streams of intelligence, from signals intelligence, human intelligence, other forms of monitoring the site, potentially visits by International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors, potentially visits by other people. So that's going to take days to weeks to get a real assessment."" 

""But I think it's likely that if the munitions performed as expected, that significant damage was done, and would set back the program significantly,"" Shapiro said. 

Gen. Dan Caine, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sunday that initial battle damage assessments suggested ""all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" but he acknowledged that a final assessment would ""take some time."" 

Still, media reports based on the DIA report painted a different picture, and CNN's reporting on the initial report said that Iran's stash of enriched uranium was not destroyed in the strikes, citing seven people who had been briefed on the report. The findings were based on a battle damage assessment from U.S. Central Command, according to CNN. 

Other members of the Trump administration, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, have subsequently pushed back on the DIA report's conclusions, claiming that the report was labeled ""low confidence.""

The term is commonly used when labeling initial assessments, and means that conclusions are based on limited data, according to experts. 

Retired Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, who previously served as the director for transnational threats at the National Security Council for former President Bill Clinton, said the low confidence description is commonly used in early assessments. 

""Low confidence means the analyst is not sure of the accuracy of their assessment,"" said Montgomery, now a senior fellow at the Washington think tank the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. ""This is frequent when with a Quick Look 24-hour assessment like this one.""

Montgomery's colleague, Craig Singleton, also a senior fellow with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that the low confidence label is used in cases with thin evidence and serves as a warning to policy-makers to seek additional information. 

""Most importantly, low confidence assessments are usually issued when key facts have yet to be verified, which certainly applies in this case,"" Singleton said.

Rob Greenway, former deputy assistant to the president on Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that it will take one or two months to get a more thorough assessment with higher confidence.

Greenway also said that the strikes were designed to create damage underground, which will complicate the assessment of damage, because it is not immediately available and will require multiple sources of intelligence, such as signals or human intelligence, to draw conclusions. 

Israel had also previously conducted strikes targeting the sites, adding to the web of analysis that must be evaluated, Greenway said. 

""Each of these are one piece of a much larger puzzle, and you're trying to gauge the ultimate effect of the entirety of the puzzle, not just one particular strike,"" said Greenway, now the director of the Allison Center for National Security at The Heritage Foundation. ""All of that means it's going to take time in order to do it."" 

Even so, Greenway said that the amount of ordnance dropped on the sites – including more than 14 30,000-lb. bombs – means that the targeted facilities have been so heavily compromised they are no longer serviceable. 

""We were putting twice the amount of ordnance required to achieve the desired effect, just to make sure that we didn't have to go back,"" Greenway said.

""There's virtually no mathematical probability in which either facility can be used again by Iran for the intended purpose, if at all, which again means that everything now is within Israel's capability to strike if that's required,"" Greenway said. 

And Michael Allen, a former National Security Council senior director in the George W. Bush administration, said that even though a final judgment from the intelligence community won't be ready soon, the intelligence portrait will become ""richer"" in the coming days. 

""Stuff is pouring in, and we're out there collecting it, and they're trying to hustle it to the White House as soon as possible,"" Allen, now the managing director of advisory firm Beacon Global Strategies, told Fox News Digital. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that very few people had access to this report, and those who leaked it to the media will be held accountable as the FBI investigates who shared the document with the press. 

""That person was irresponsible with it,"" Leavitt told reporters Thursday. ""And we need to get to the bottom of it. And we need to strengthen that process to protect our national security and protect the American public.""

President Donald Trump has praised Gen. Dan Caine for years, long before nominating him to serve as his chief military adviser, and Caine has seemingly won over the president once again.

“I have to say, Gen. ‘Razin' Caine was incredible,” the president told reporters Wednesday, days after the U.S. military carried out an unprecedented operation targeting three of Iran's nuclear facilities.

The White House released photos taken of the Situation Room during the operation, showing him seated between chief of staff Susie Wiles and Vice President JD Vance.

“General Caine is detail-oriented and ruthlessly focused on carrying out President Trump's military objectives,” Vance said in a statement to the Wall Street Journal. “After about two months on the job, General Caine helped oversee a series of incredibly precise airstrikes that resulted in zero American casualties and the obliteration of Iran's nuclear capabilities. I think the best way to judge his job performance is by its results, and America is safer and stronger thanks to the successful operation he oversaw last weekend.”

While he has played a primary part in explaining the mission, his role as an apolitical and active-duty military officer has put him in a difficult position as he has stood alongside Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at two somewhat contentious press briefings this week.

During the first of those briefings, last Sunday morning, Hegseth projected an air of certainty over the strikes' success and the level of damage caused, while Caine was more cautious in his language.

Hegseth called it “an incredible and overwhelming success,” which was in line with the president's public comments, while the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman said, “It would be way too early for me to comment on what may or may not still be there.”

His unwillingness to discuss the level of damage stood out in comparison to Hegseth's projection of confidence that “Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated.”

Between then and the second briefing, which occurred on Thursday morning, a preliminary assessment from the Defense Intelligence Agency was leaked to the media and raised doubts as to whether Hegseth and Trump had accurately described the level of damage done in the attack.

As the defense secretary and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman stood in the Defense Department's briefing room on Thursday morning, Hegseth used his opening remarks to criticize the media extensively, including claiming it is in the media's “blood to cheer against Trump.”

Hegseth tore into specific outlets, including his former employer, Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC, and the Pentagon press corps broadly for its coverage of the DIA report. An investigation is underway to find out who leaked the intelligence.

The secretary claimed that the leaker provided a selective portion of the report to multiple outlets to portray the strikes negatively and hurt the president.

After Hegseth wrapped up his opening comments, Caine provided a detailed explanation of how the 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb worked, which the U.S. military used to bomb two of the three Iranian nuclear facilities targeted in the operation.

He did not weigh in on Hegseth's criticism of the media, sticking solely to the details of the planning of the operation, the attack, and the subsequent attack on the United States's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.

At one point, Caine was asked if he would agree with the president and secretary's use of the word “obliterated” to describe the destruction, to which he said the Pentagon doesn't “do [battle damage assessments],” before the secretary took another shot at the media.

“So, you bring the chairman here, who's not involved in politics, he doesn't do politics, that's my lane to understand and translate and talk about those types of things. So, I can use the word obliterated. He could use defeat, destroyed, assess, all of those things,” Hegseth said. “But ultimately, we're here to clarify what these weapons are capable of, which anyone with, you know, two ears — two eyes, some ears and a brain can recognize that kind of firepower with that specificity at that location and others is going to have a devastating effect.”

Caine denied ever feeling pressure from the president or secretary to change his assessment.

“That one's easy, no. No, I have not. And no, I would not. My job as the chairman is to offer a range of options to the president and the National Command Authority, to deliver the risks associated with each of those and then take the orders of the National Command Authority and — and go execute them,” he said.

After the briefing, Trump declared it was “one of the greatest, most professional, and most ‘confirming' News Conferences I have ever seen!”

Former White House coordinator for the Middle East Brett McGurk said Caine's briefing was “really important and just worth studying because he went through a lot of information that until now would have been classified.”

Democratic political strategist David Axelrod said Caine “deserves our admiration for the professional and credible manner in which he has briefed on the Iran mission, Sunday and today,” while Hegseth, he said, “deserves another cookie from the boss for his unhinged, attack dog antics, berating the media for reporting facts he himself acknowledged.”

DAN CAINE PRAISES OFFICERS WHO STARTED FORDOW OPERATION PLANNING 15 YEARS AGO

Trump nominated Caine to be his senior military adviser to replace Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., though the president had long touted Caine's role in the military's defeat of the Islamic State.

Trump has frequently retold a story, which Caine denied during his confirmation hearing, that the two met in December 2018, when Caine was the deputy commanding general of the Special Operations Joint Task Force in Iraq. Per Trump's retelling, Caine told him the military could defeat ISIS in a matter of weeks, offering a much shorter time frame than those given by the president's advisers, and put on a MAGA hat.

“I have never worn any political merchandise,” Caine told the Senate Armed Services Committee during his nomination hearing.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former top White House adviser Elon Musk renewed his criticism of President Donald Trump‘s “big, beautiful bill,” this time trashing the Senate‘s version of the massive tax bill as “utterly insane and destructive.”

Musk, who engaged in a fiery online public feud with Trump over the House's version of the bill earlier this month, signaled that he thinks no different of the Senate bill text, an updated version of which was released late on Friday.

“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,” Musk posted on X.

The updated version of the tax bill released by the Senate Budget Committee includes bigger cuts to clean energy as well as an earlier termination of electric vehicle tax credits, which are pertinent to Musk as CEO of Tesla.

Under the House version, EV tax credits weren't slated to expire until as late as 180 days after the bill's signing into law. The Senate accelerated the credits' termination to as soon as the end of September.

The Senate is currently engaged in an initial procedural vote on the tax bill, with a final vote on the bill likely getting pushed further into the weekend.

Musk continued his rebuke of the bill in later X posts on Saturday, calling it “utter madness” and saying the projected $5 trillion debt ceiling increase in it will put “America in the fast lane to debt slavery!”

He also shared a screenshot of a poll conducted by the Tarrance Group showing widespread agreement from Republican voters that the “big, beautiful bill” would increase the federal deficit.

SENATE GOP INCLUDES STEEPER CUTS TO CLEAN ENERGY CREDITS IN UPDATED TAX BILL

“Polls show that this bill is political suicide for the Republican Party,” Musk said.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), one of the few GOP holdouts on the bill, retweeted Musk's post, saying “it is very clear people don't want this extreme amount of debt and reckless spending.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Iran has banned the head of the United Nations‘ nuclear watchdog organization from its nuclear sites and is removing surveillance cameras from them, according to multiple reports.

On Saturday, Iranian Parliament vice speaker Hamid Reza Haji Babaei announced the barring of Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, from the regime's nuclear sites as well as the removal of the surveillance measures, moves that threaten to keep Iran‘s nuclear footprint even more in the dark following U.S. and Israeli attacks designed to dismantle their nuclear program.

Iran claimed the moves, which are the regime's latest following a ceasefire in its “12 Day War” with Israel, were made after Israel acquired “sensitive facility data.”

The new measures from Iran were announced during a mass funeral held in Tehran over the weekend for high-level Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists killed in targeted Israeli strikes earlier this month when it began its military campaign dubbed “Operation Rising Lion.”

Thousands of the regime's supporters gathered in the capital for the funeral on Saturday, where Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and two top officials thought to be dead after earlier Israeli strikes — specifically, Quds Force Cmdr. Esmail Qaani and Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei — were also present.

Footage posted by Araghchi show Iranians packed onto a main street, chanting and waving Iranian flags.

Pezeshkian and Araghchi issued statements shortly after the event, with both suggesting Iran will not back down following the strikes from Israel that decimated the top brass of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as later U.S. bombings that the Trump administration has insisted “obliterated” three nuclear sites.

“The Wave after Wave of Patriots who took to the streets in Iran to honor military commanders, scientists, researchers and civilians including women and children murdered in cold blood by the Cowardly Israeli regime, all have one message: Unlike the Feeble Israeli regime, we do NOT hide our losses; we are PROUD of our MARTYRS, who are our role models. For every fallen officer or scientist, Rest Assured 100 More Are Lining Up To Take Their Places. Until the Last Drop of Blood, the Powerful and Resilient Iranian Nation will Resist whoever attempts to decide OUR destiny,” Araghchi posted on X.

CENTRIFUGES AT IRAN'S FORDOW ‘NO LONGER OPERATIONAL,' GROSSI SAYS

The United States responded to separate threats against Grossi from Iranian officials on Saturday, specifically alleged calls for the IAEA head's arrest and execution. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called those threats “unacceptable” in a statement posted on X.

“Calls in Iran for the arrest and execution of IAEA Director General Grossi are unacceptable and should be condemned. We support the lAEA's critical verification and monitoring efforts in Iran and commend the Director General and the lAEA for their dedication and professionalism. We call on Iran to provide for the safety and security of IAEA personnel,” Rubio said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court finally slapped down this week one of the many Biden-appointed judges who have hampered President Donald Trump's deportation efforts. The court blocked Judge Brian Murphy's order creating new burdensome administrative hurdles and making it harder to deport illegal immigrants to countries they are not originally from.

One of the biggest barriers to swift and just immigration enforcement is that many countries either limit how many of their citizens they will take back from the United States each year or forbid the U.S. from sending back any of their citizens. Countries with such limits or bans include China, Cuba, India, Venezuela, and Vietnam. When these countries refuse to take back their citizens, the Department of Homeland Security is forced to house them, sometimes indefinitely, making it harder to hold and process other illegal immigrants.

Trump has sought to alleviate this bottleneck by entering into diplomatic agreements with third countries that will take deportees who are not citizens of those countries. These agreements are complex and sensitive foreign policy matters that the federal judges have no business interfering with.

More importantly, however, there is nothing in the Constitution, federal statute, or federal regulation that empowers an illegal immigrant to choose which country they are deported to. If an illegal immigrant is captured and determined to have no right to be in the U.S., then the federal government has every right to send them to whatever country is willing to take them.

Murphy of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by Senate Democrats just this past December, disagrees. He believes that illegal immigrants destined for deportation to countries other than their home country are due extra rights. Specifically, he believes they are due notice of which country the U.S. plans to deport them to, and 15 days to challenge their deportation to that country. Mind you, this is on top of the process the migrants are already due to determine if they have credible fear of torture if they are returned to their home country.

Murphy entered a nationwide injunction of all such third-country deportations this March. One Guatemalan illegal immigrant argued in Murphy's court that he should not be deported to Mexico because he was raped in the country. He wanted a hearing so that he could argue that Mexico was too unsafe for him. Murphy agreed.

The Trump administration then appealed Murphy's order, with U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer telling the Supreme Court in May that Murphy “invented” an “onerous set of procedures” that made perfectly legal third-country deportations all but impossible.

The Supreme Court did not issue a decision explaining why it agreed to hold Murphy's order, but the fact that it suspended its enforcement indicates that Murphy will most likely lose when the full case reaches the court.

Writing in dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the Trump administration, “Has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone, anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard.”

This is just false. The Trump administration honored onerous court orders from open borders Biden judges, including the order to stop deporting illegal immigrants to El Salvador. There is no evidence that the Trump administration has wrongly deported any U.S. citizens or legal residents.

BORDER SECURE, NO NEW LEGISLATION REQUIRED

Illegal immigrants are due process before they are deported, but not the same process as people are due in criminal trials. In Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, Justice Antonin Scalia said, “While aliens who have established connections in this country have due process rights in deportation proceedings, the Court long ago held that Congress is entitled to set the conditions for an alien's lawful entry into this country and that, as a result, an alien cannot claim any greater rights under the Due Process Clause.”

If an illegal immigrant would be tortured by their government upon return to their home country, then they deserve protection. But just because an illegal immigrant thinks the U.S. is safe, and all other countries are less safe, doesn't entitle them to legal status here. If illegal immigrants want to choose which country they live in next, they should self-deport. Otherwise, the U.S. government has every right to send them to any country that will take them.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Lines of communication over the U.S.'s national security between the White House and Congress are strained as speculation grows that a preliminary report on the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites was leaked out of Capitol Hill.

The White House has been put under pressure to provide more information on the bombings in Iran last weekend, as bits and pieces begin to leak to the media and House leaders threaten to limit classified briefings for rank-and-file lawmakers.

Johnson told lawmakers he thinks the leak was a “substantial setback” and guessed the leak to the two major outlets came “probably from this body.”

“It probably affects what we are able to be told because there are real risks to that,” Johnson said, following remarks from President Donald Trump that he wants to limit the flow of intelligence due to the leaks. “So, it's unfortunate. It affects how the institution works, and that's a problem, so we got to address it.”

Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) criticized the White House for not briefing the “Gang of Eight” on Capitol Hill, a group that consists of Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), and Jeffries, along with the top members of the House and Senate intelligence committees. 

Another point of frustration within the Democratic caucus came when intelligence officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, were set to brief lawmakers on the operation Tuesday, before being delayed just hours before they were set to meet.

We had a bipartisan, classified briefing on Iran scheduled today for Members of Congress—the Trump Administration canceled at the last minute. They're lying to the American people and hiding whatever intelligence they have. It's utter chaos and we need answers immediately. pic.twitter.com/vE2pxJOyFU

The briefing instead took place Friday morning — almost a full week after the strikes took place — where Democrats left unsatisfied with the information they received, saying they still have more questions. 

“It wasn't particularly enlightening and there remain a whole host of questions that need to be answered for the American people,” Jeffries told reporters leaving the briefing. 

“I still have questions and frankly, they had a hard stop and had to leave to attend to other matters, and there are a lot more members who had some questions to ask,” Rep. Gabe Amo (D-RI) told the Washington Examiner.  

Democrats are not the only party that feels this lack of trust surrounding recent international developments.

Earlier this week, before the briefing, CNN and the New York Times reported that the strikes only set Iran's nuclear program back months as opposed to years, based on an early Pentagon intelligence assessment. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt snapped back at CNN in response to the leaked intelligence. 

“This reporter wrote a lie from the intelligence community to seek a narrative she wanted to prove,” Leavitt said Thursday. “This is a reporter who has been used by people who dislike Donald Trump in this government to push fake and false narratives.”

The White House planned to limit classified information flow to Congress following the leak, which immediately prompted pushback from Democrats. Axios reported that a White House official confirmed the decision, saying the information was shared soon after it was posted to a system used to share information with Congress, CAPNET. 

The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's top members sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel requesting that they conduct an investigation into the leak, and if the perpetrator is found, they are to be prosecuted to the “fullest extent of the law.”

“As the Chairman and Ranking Member of the relevant congressional committee tasked with overseeing the U.S. Intelligence Community, these allegations of improper disclosure of national security information strike at the heart of our solemn and apolitical mission to ensure classified data never falls into the hands of our adversaries,” Chairman Rick Crawford (R-AR) and ranking member Jim Himes (D-CT) wrote in a joint statement. “We are unified in our understanding that improper disclosure of classified information has no place in our body politic, nor are such disclosures in our nation's interests.”

The White House sent legal letters to both publications following the leak, prompting a response from both outlets. 

“No retraction is needed. No apology will be forthcoming. We told the truth to the best of our ability. We will continue to do so,” the New York Times said.

CNN responded to Trump's attacks, specifically when he called on the CNN reporters to be fired, by defending their reporting.

“We stand 100% behind Natasha Bertrand's journalism and specifically her and her colleagues' reporting,” the outlet said.

Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) responded to the leaks, seemingly confirming the information found in the reports.

“To me, it still appears that we have only set back the Iranian nuclear program by a handful of months,” Murphy said. “There's no doubt there was damage done to the program, but the allegations that we have obliterated their program just don't seem to stand up to reason.”

“I just do not think the president was telling the truth when he said this program was obliterated,” Murphy added.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA), vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he had “some concern” that people are jumping to conclusions too early. He said he thinks “leaks of any crimes should be prosecuted.” 

HOUSE LAWMAKERS LEAVE IRAN BRIEFING TIGHT-LIPPED AND DIVIDED ON SATISFACTION 

“I simply wish that the administration would adhere to that same level of secrecy about classified information that shouldn't be shared on nonclassified channels, like Signal, and the fact that we still don't know whether the participants on some of those calls have ever even had their phone scrubbed for malware. That is not right,” Warner said.

In response to the attacks last Saturday, Iran launched a missile attack on Monday against a U.S. military base in Qatar that resulted in no damage or casualties. Trump then announced Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire that remains fragile.

How the left ended up disbelieving the science

Allow children to transition, or they will kill themselves. For more than a decade, this has been the strongest argument in favor of youth gender medicine—a scenario so awful that it stifled any doubts or questions about puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.

“We often ask parents, ‘Would you rather have a dead son than a live daughter?'” Johanna Olson-Kennedy of Children's Hospital Los Angeles once explained to ABC News. Variations on the phrase crop up in innumerable media articles and public statements by influencers, activists, and LGBTQ groups. The same idea—that the choice is transition or death—appeared in the arguments made by Elizabeth Prelogar, the Biden administration's solicitor general, before the Supreme Court last year. Tennessee's law prohibiting the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to treat minors with gender dysphoria would, she said, “increase the risk of suicide.”

But there is a huge problem with this emotive formulation: It isn't true. When Justice Samuel Alito challenged the ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio on such claims during oral arguments, Strangio made a startling admission. He conceded that there is no evidence to support the idea that medical transition reduces adolescent suicide rates.

At first, Strangio dodged the question, saying that research shows that blockers and hormones reduce “depression, anxiety, and suicidality”—that is, suicidal thoughts. (Even that is debatable, according to reviews of the research literature.) But when Alito referenced a systematic review conducted for the Cass report in England, Strangio conceded the point. “There is no evidence in some—in the studies that this treatment reduces completed suicide,” he said. “And the reason for that is completed suicide, thankfully and admittedly, is rare, and we're talking about a very small population of individuals with studies that don't necessarily have completed suicides within them.”

Here was the trans-rights movement's greatest legal brain, speaking in front of the nation's highest court. And what he was saying was that the strongest argument for a hotly debated treatment was, in fact, not supported by the evidence.

Read: The Democrats need an honest conversation on gender identity

Even then, his admission did not register with the liberal justices. When the court voted 6–3 to uphold the Tennessee law, Sonia Sotomayor claimed in her dissent that “access to care can be a question of life or death.” If she meant any kind of therapeutic support, that might be defensible. But claiming that this is true of medical transition specifically—the type of care being debated in the Skrmetti case—is not supported by the current research.

Advocates of the open-science movement often talk about “zombie facts”—popular sound bites that persist in public debate, even when they have been repeatedly discredited. Many common political claims made in defense of puberty blockers and hormones for gender-dysphoric minors meet this definition. These zombie facts have been flatly contradicted not just by conservatives but also by prominent advocates and practitioners of the treatment—at least when they're speaking candidly. Many liberals are unaware of this, however, because they are stuck in media bubbles in which well-meaning commentators make confident assertions for youth gender medicine—claims from which its elite advocates have long since retreated.

Perhaps the existence of this bubble shouldn't be surprising. Many of the most fervent advocates of youth transition are also on record disparaging the idea that it should be debated at all. Strangio—who works for the country's best-known free-speech organization—once tweeted that he would like to scuttle Abigail Shrier's book Irreversible Damage, a skeptical treatment of youth gender medicine. Strangio declared, “Stopping the circulation of this book and these ideas is 100% a hill I will die on.” Marci Bowers, the former head of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), the most prominent organization for gender-medicine providers, has likened skepticism of child gender medicine to Holocaust denial. “There are not two sides to this issue,” she once said, according to a recent episode of The Protocol, a New York Times podcast.

Boasting about your unwillingness to listen to your opponents probably plays well in some crowds. But it left Strangio badly exposed in front of the Supreme Court, where it became clear that the conservative justices had read the most convincing critiques of hormones and blockers—and had some questions as a result.

Trans-rights activists like to accuse skeptics of youth gender medicine—and publications that dare to report their views—of fomenting a “moral panic.” But the movement has spent the past decade telling gender-nonconforming children that anyone who tries to restrict access to puberty blockers and hormones is, effectively, trying to kill them. This was false, as Strangio's answer tacitly conceded. It was also irresponsible.

After England restricted the use of puberty blockers in 2020, the government asked an expert psychologist, Louis Appleby, to investigate whether the suicide rate for patients at the country's youth gender clinic rose dramatically as a result. It did not: In fact, he did not find any increase in suicides at all, despite the lurid claims made online. “The way that this issue has been discussed on social media has been insensitive, distressing and dangerous, and goes against guidance on safe reporting of suicide,” Appleby reported. “One risk is that young people and their families will be terrified by predictions of suicide as inevitable without puberty blockers.”

When red-state bans are discussed, you will also hear liberals say that conservative fears about the medical-transition pathway are overwrought—because all children get extensive, personalized assessments before being prescribed blockers or hormones. This, too, is untrue. Although the official standards of care recommend thorough assessment over several months, many American clinics say they will prescribe blockers on a first visit.

This isn't just a matter of U.S. health providers skimping on talk therapy to keep costs down; some practitioners view long evaluations as unnecessary and even patronizing. “I don't send someone to a therapist when I'm going to start them on insulin,” Olson-Kennedy told The Atlantic in 2018. Her published research shows that she has referred girls as young as 13 for double mastectomies. And what if these children later regret their decision? “Adolescents actually have the capacity to make a reasoned logical decision,” she once told an industry seminar, adding: “If you want breasts at a later point in your life, you can go and get them.”

Perhaps the greatest piece of misinformation believed by liberals, however, is that the American standards of care in this area are strongly evidence-based. In fact, at this point, the fairest thing to say about the evidence surrounding medical transition for adolescents—the so-called Dutch protocol, as opposed to talk therapy and other support—is that it is weak and inconclusive. (A further complication is that American child gender medicine has deviated significantly from this original protocol, in terms of length of assessments and the number and demographics of minors being treated.) Yes, as activists are keen to point out, most major American medical associations support the Dutch protocol. But consensus is not the same as evidence. And that consensus is politically influenced.

Rachel Levine, President Joe Biden's assistant secretary for health and human services, successfully lobbied to have age minimums removed for most surgeries from the standards of care drawn up by WPATH. That was a deeply political decision—Levine, according to emails from her office reviewed by the Times, believed that listing any specific limits under age 18 would give opponents of youth transition hard targets to exploit.

More recently, another court case over banning blockers and hormones, this time in Alabama, has revealed that WPATH members themselves had doubts about their own guidelines.

Read: Young trans children know who they are

In 2022, Alabama passed a law criminalizing the prescription of hormones and blockers to patients under 19. After the Biden administration sued to block the law, the state's Republican attorney general subpoenaed documents showing that WPATH has known for some time that the evidence base for adolescent transition is thin. “All of us are painfully aware that there are many gaps in research to back up our recommendations,” Eli Coleman, the psychologist who chaired the team revising the standards of care, wrote to his colleagues in 2023. Yet the organization did not make this clear in public. Laura Edwards-Leeper—who helped bring the Dutch protocol to the U.S. but has since criticized in a Washington Post op-ed the unquestioningly gender-affirmative model—has said that the specter of red-state bans made her and her op-ed co-author reluctant to break ranks.

The Alabama litigation also confirmed that WPATH had commissioned systematic reviews of the evidence for the Dutch protocol. However, close to publication, the Johns Hopkins University researcher involved was told that her findings needed to be “scrutinized and reviewed to ensure that publication does not negatively affect the provision of transgender health care.” This is not how evidence-based medicine is supposed to work. You don't start with a treatment and then ensure that only studies that support that treatment are published. In a legal filing in the Alabama case, Coleman insisted “it is not true” that the WPATH guidelines “turned on any ideological or political considerations” and that the group's dispute with the Johns Hopkins researcher concerned only the timing of publication. Yet the Times has reported that at least one manuscript she sought to publish “never saw the light of day.”

The Alabama disclosures are not the only example of this reluctance to acknowledge contrary evidence. Last year, Olson-Kennedy said that she had not published her own broad study on mental-health outcomes for youth with gender dysphoria, because she worried about its results being “weaponized.” That raised suspicions that she had found only sketchy evidence to support the treatments that she has been prescribing—and publicly advocating for—over many years.

Last month, her study finally appeared as a preprint, a form of scientific publication where the evidence has not yet been peer-reviewed or finalized. Its participants “demonstrated no significant changes in reported anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, aggressive behavior, internalizing problems or externalizing problems” in the two years after starting puberty blockers. (I have requested comment from Olson-Kennedy via Children's Hospital Los Angeles but have not yet heard back.)

The reliance on elite consensus over evidence helps make sense of WPATH's flatly hostile response to the Cass report in England, which commissioned systematic reviews and recommended extreme caution over the use of blockers and hormones. The review was a direct challenge to WPATH's ability to position itself as the final arbiter of these treatments—something that became more obvious when the conservative justices referenced the British document in their questions and opinions in Skrmetti. One of WPATH's main charges against Hilary Cass, the senior pediatrician who led the review, was that she was not a gender specialist—in other words, that she was not part of the charmed circle who already agreed that these treatments were beneficial.

Because of WPATH's hostility, many on the American left now believe that the Cass review has been discredited. “Upon first reading, especially to a person with limited knowledge of the history of transgender health care, much of the report might seem reasonable,” Lydia Polgreen wrote in the Times last August. However, after “poring over the document” and “interviewing experts in gender-affirming care,” Polgreen realized that the Cass review was “fundamentally a subjective, political document.”

Advocates of youth gender medicine have reacted furiously to articles in the Times and elsewhere that take Cass's conclusions seriously. Indeed, some people inside the information bubble appear to believe that if respectable publications would stop writing about this story, all the doubts and questions—and Republican attempts to capitalize on them electorally—would simply disappear. Whenever the Times has published a less-than-cheerleading article about youth transition, supporters of gender medicine have accused the newspaper of manufacturing a debate that otherwise would not exist. After the Skrmetti decision, Strangio was still describing media coverage of the issue as “insidious,” adding: “The New York Times, especially, has been fixated on casting the medical care as being of an insufficient quality.”

Can this misinformation bubble ever be burst? On the left, support for youth transition has been rolled together with other issues—such as police reform and climate activism—as a kind of super-saver combo deal of correct opinions. The 33-year-old democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has made funding gender transition, including for minors, part of his pitch to be New York's mayor. But complicated issues deserve to be treated individually: You can criticize Israel, object to the militarization of America's police forces, and believe that climate change is real, and yet still not support irreversible, experimental, and unproven medical treatments for children.

The polarization of this issue in America has been deeply unhelpful for getting liberals to accept the sketchiness of the evidence base. When Vice President J. D. Vance wanted to troll the left, he joined Bluesky—where skeptics of youth gender medicine are among the most blocked users—and immediately started talking about the Skrmetti judgment. Actions like that turn accepting the evidence base into a humiliating climbdown.

Acknowledging the evidence does not mean that you also have to support banning these treatments—or reject the idea that some people will be happier if they transition. Cass believes that some youngsters may indeed benefit from the medical pathway. “Whilst some young people may feel an urgency to transition, young adults looking back at their younger selves would often advise slowing down,” her report concludes. “For some, the best outcome will be transition, whereas others may resolve their distress in other ways.”

I have always argued against straightforward bans on medical transition for adolescents. In practice, the way these have been enacted in red states has been uncaring and punitive. Parents are threatened with child-abuse investigations for pursuing treatments that medical professionals have assured them are safe. Children with severe mental-health troubles suddenly lose therapeutic support. Clinics nationwide, including Olson-Kennedy's, are now abruptly closing because of the political atmosphere. Writing about the subject in 2023, I argued that the only way out of the culture war was for the American medical associations to commission reviews and carefully consider the evidence.

From the July/August 2018 issue: When children say they're trans

However, the revelations from Skrmetti and the Alabama case have made me more sympathetic to commentators such as Leor Sapir, of the conservative Manhattan Institute, who supports the bans because American medicine cannot be trusted to police itself. “Are these bans the perfect solution? Probably not,” he told me in 2023. “But at the end of the day, if it's between banning gender-affirming care and leaving it unregulated, I think we can minimize the amount of harm by banning it.” Once you know that WPATH wanted to publish a review only if it came to the group's preferred conclusion, Sapir's case becomes more compelling.

Despite the concerted efforts to suppress the evidence, however, the picture on youth gender medicine has become clearer over the past decade. It's no humiliation to update our beliefs as a result: I regularly used to write that medical transition was “lifesaving,” before I saw how limited the evidence on suicide was. And it took another court case, brought by the British detransitioner Keira Bell, for me to realize fully that puberty blockers were not what they were sold as—a “safe and reversible” treatment that gave patients “time to think”—but instead a one-way ticket to full transition, with physical changes that cannot be undone.

Read: The attack on trans rights won't end there

Some advocates for the Dutch protocol, as it's applied in the United States, have staked their entire career and reputation on its safety and effectiveness. They have strong incentives not to concede the weakness of the evidence. In 2023, the advocacy group GLAAD drove a truck around the offices of The New York Times to declare that the “science is settled.” Doctors such as Olson-Kennedy and activists such as Strangio are unlikely to revise their opinions.

For everyone else, however, the choice is still open. We can support civil-rights protections for transgender people without having to endorse an experimental and unproven set of medical treatments—or having to repeat emotionally manipulative and now discredited claims about suicide.

I am not a fan of the American way of settling political disputes, by kicking them over to an escalating series of judges. But in the case of youth gender medicine, the legal system has provided clarity and disclosure that might otherwise not exist. Thanks to the Supreme Court's oral questioning in Skrmetti and the discovery process in Alabama, we now have a clearer picture of how youth gender medicine has really been operating in the United States, and an uncomfortable insight into how advocacy groups and medical associations have tamped down their own concerns about its evidence base. Those of us who have been urging caution now know that many of our ostensible opponents had the same concerns. They just smothered them, for political reasons.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Beijing likes allies who needle the U.S., but it values stability even more.

As Israel and then the United States battered Iran this month, the reaction from China and Russia was surprisingly muted. For years, shared antagonism toward the U.S. has been pushing China, Russia, and Iran together. All three benefit from embarrassing the West in Ukraine and the Middle East, and widening the gaps between Washington and Europe. So after Israel's first strike, on June 13, China—the strongest partner in the anti-America triad—could have been expected to rush short-range missiles and other air-defense equipment to Iran. Surely, Beijing would use its growing diplomatic muscle to isolate Israel and the U.S., demand an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council, and introduce a resolution deploring the two governments that were attacking China's ally.

Instead, recent events in Iran have revealed that anti-Americanism can bind an alliance together only so much.

Read: Why isn't Russia defending Iran?

After ritually denouncing Israel's first strike as “brazen” and a “violation of Iran's sovereignty,” Beijing proceeded cautiously, emphasizing the need for diplomacy instead of further assigning blame. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi refrained from condemning Israel's actions, in a call with his Israeli counterpart on June 14, and President Xi Jinping waited four days before calling for “de-escalation” and declaring that “China stands ready to work with all parties to play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East.”

After Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, Beijing's foreign-affairs spokesperson stressed—in what looked like a warning to Iran—that the Persian Gulf is a crucial global trade route for goods and energy, and called for partners to “prevent the regional turmoil from having a greater impact on global economic growth.”

In calmer times, China, like Russia, is happy to use Iran as a battering ram against the U.S. and its allies. But when tensions turn into military confrontation and global stability is at risk, backing Iran looks like a far less sensible investment to Beijing than preserving its own economic and diplomatic relations with the West. China's mild reaction isn't just a blow to Iran; it may also suggest that the much ballyhooed “no limits” partnership between Xi and Russia's President Vladimir Putin might not be as sturdy as Moscow and Beijing advertise.

Iran, Russia, and China have different ideologies, political regimes, and strategic aims. Iran's relations with its two larger partners are wildly asymmetric.

Read: The invisible city of Tehran

China, for example, is Iran's lifeline. It buys about 90 percent of Iran's oil and supplies materials and technologies central to Iran's weapons development. Yet the trading relationship matters less to China, which gets only about 10 percent of its oil from Iran. Plus, China has an economy more than 40 times as large, and it does far more business with the U.S. and the European Union.

Russia has interests that similarly diverge from Iran's, and it, too, has conspicuously refrained from coming to the Islamic Republic's aid. But China following a similar approach toward Iran likely does not please Moscow. Although Moscow's relations with Beijing are less lopsided than Tehran's are, Russia's economy is still less than one-eighth the size of China's. One-third of Russia's state budget comes from oil sales, and China is the largest customer by far. Russia also depends on Chinese supplies for its war machine. This past March, the G7 foreign ministers called China a “decisive enabler” of Russia's war in Ukraine. But should the Kremlin begin to run out of money or soldiers, China's willingness to bail out its ally is very much in doubt.

Even among authoritarian regimes, differences in values can limit cooperation. In 2023, Xi called Russia's 1917 October Revolution a “cannon blast” that “brought Marxism-Leninism to China, demonstrating the way forward and offering a new choice for the Chinese people who were seeking a way to save China from subjugation.” Putin, despite his formative years in the Soviet-era KGB, now laments the fall of the Russian empire and describes Vladimir Lenin's coup as the deed of “political adventurists and foreign forces” who “divided the country and tore it apart for selfish benefit.” The head of China's Communist Party may resent Putin's reduction of its Russian counterpart—the country's second-largest party—to the status of another bit player in Russia's rubber-stamping parliament.

Since World War II, leaders of Western democracies have successfully collaborated in part because they have shared a common worldview. Whether Iran's Islamic theocrats can say the same about Xi, the leader of an avowedly atheist state, or Putin, who now positions himself as the champion of Orthodox Christianity, is another question entirely.

Beijing's response to Iran's predicament ought to make the West feel cautiously optimistic. If Donald Trump finally learns to distinguish the aggressor from the victim—or at least realizes that Putin has been playing him—the U.S. president could support Ukraine in earnest without worrying much about China expanding its assistance to Russia. As long as both Iran and Russia keep providing cheap oil and antagonizing the West and its allies, they are serving China's purposes. But at least for now, Beijing looks unlikely to back either of its supposed partners if they jeopardize China's interest in stability or its extensive and profitable relations with the West.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The One-and-Done Doctrine","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/trump-military-iran-nuclear/683348/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The president has railed against America's “endless wars.” But he's found a style of attack that he likes.

Weeks before he ended his first term, in December 2020, President Donald Trump was outraged that leaders in Tehran had announced plans to accelerate its nuclear program. He had a simple question: Why don't we just bomb Iran?



His advisers walked him through the options but cautioned that such an operation would likely result in the downing of American planes and the start of a regional war. Trump dropped the idea. “He didn't want to leave a shit sandwich for his successor,” a former official told us. “He also recognized it wasn't time yet.”



Last weekend, with Iranian defenses worn to a nub by days of Israeli attacks, the time finally came. The surprise assault by B-2 bombers, which dropped 30,000-pound “bunker-buster” bombs onto underground enrichment facilities, marked the most dramatic military action that Trump has ordered in either of his terms as president. The attack showed how Trump's attitudes toward the use of force have evolved as he has grown more confident in his instincts as commander in chief and surrounded himself with advisers disinclined to challenge him. But it also reflected what hasn't changed: Trump is willing to embrace serious risk in approving military operations, so long as it's in a discrete burst rather than a sustained campaign. The president described the weekend bombing as a one-off that “obliterated” Iran's nuclear program, not the start of a larger war.



If any Trump doctrine for military action does exist, it is perhaps best understood as the One-and-Done Doctrine.

“Trump likes to think he can fire a bullet and leave the O.K. Corral, that the first move is decisive and the end of activity,” Kori Schake, the director of defense and foreign-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a contributing writer at The Atlantic, told us.



It's not clear, however, that one attack will be enough. Assessments of the operation's impact on Iran's nuclear capability are divided, and Tehran is already vowing to push ahead, suggesting that additional U.S. action may be required if a diplomatic solution isn't reached.



During his first term, Trump railed against the “endless” and “forever wars” he had inherited, clashing repeatedly with his top security advisers as he sought to end counterinsurgent missions and pull troops from allied nations as part of his “America First” agenda. He also demonstrated willingness to deploy military force at significant moments, lobbing cruise missiles at Syria after chemical-weapons attacks, intensifying the air campaign against the Islamic State, and authorizing high-stakes operations such as the commando raid targeting ISIS boss Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and the drone strike killing Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani.



Trump took office in 2017 boasting that he knew better than “the generals.” But just days into the job, the first military operation he authorized—a hostage-recovery raid in Yemen—went badly awry: A Navy SEAL and numerous civilians were killed, and a $70 million aircraft was destroyed.



Other ventures were more successful: Trump oversaw a surge in progress in the campaign against ISIS, which began under President Barack Obama, as U.S. war planes beat back the militants in Syria. But when the advances slowed, Trump began to push for an end to the American presence—much to the chagrin of his military advisers. The turn revealed Trump's discomfort with sustained campaigns that didn't show measurable results, or that carried any whiff of a quagmire. In Afghanistan, the president pressed for a negotiated exit after the initial surge in military action he authorized—including the bombing of drug labs and the use of an explosive dubbed the “Mother of All Bombs”—failed to yield decisive results.



All the while, Trump was feuding with some of his closest military aides. Jim Mattis, the Marine general who served as Trump's first defense secretary, resigned in protest in 2018 after having attempted to block what he viewed as dangerous actions by the president. Mattis even defied demands from then–National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster for the Pentagon to send options for striking Iran. Trump also railed against historic arrangements he believed exploited American generosity, including U.S. support for NATO and the presence of American troops in places such as Germany and South Korea.

One outside adviser said that characterizing Trump as an isolationist misses the mark. “He has a pretty well-established history of dramatic short bursts of kinetic action, but not sustained military involvement in things,” the adviser told us. He suggested a precedent in President Andrew Jackson, who embraced nationalism and economically motivated expansionism for 19th-century America. Trump “doesn't have an ideology, but if you had to try to sum it up, it's more Jacksonian than isolationist or anti-interventionist,” the adviser told us.



Many of the president's advisers told us they believe that his blunt, tough-guy talk and his unpredictable tendencies—akin to Richard Nixon's “madman theory”—have been effective in establishing deterrence with foreign adversaries. But Trump's volatility has also at times frustrated his own advisers. In 2019, he made an eleventh-hour decision to call off a planned retaliatory strike on Iranian missile batteries in response to the country's downing of a large U.S. drone over the Strait of Hormuz. The decision was based on an estimate of potential casualties on the ground in Iran that one military official said was wildly inaccurate. Then–National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were aghast at the choice to call off the strike, which they believed was proportionate and would deter future attacks.



“He's capable of changing his mind right up until the very end, and when he's finally decided that the decision has been carried out and he can't reverse it, it's very stressful for him,” Bolton told us. He said the recent Iran strikes tracked with the president's preference for stand-alone, epic actions: “It fits with his short attention span, and it fits with the fact he doesn't have a philosophy; he doesn't have a grand strategy.”



When Bolton worked in the first Trump administration, he was frequently at odds with the president. This time around, Trump has few people questioning his calls. Even those who are leery of foreign entanglement have fallen in line to support the strikes. Vice President J. D. Vance, for instance, has led the charge in recent days in messaging that the Iran operation was not about regime change, but rather the more narrow goal of debilitating the country's nuclear program.



Vance is “going to be supportive of whatever the president wants to do, and there's never going to be any daylight between the two of them, even privately,” the outside adviser told us.



Marco Rubio, now serving as secretary of state and national security adviser, has been “very deferential” to Trump, the adviser added. CIA Director John Ratcliffe, meanwhile, has kept to his position's traditional lane, laying out the intelligence but not pushing any particular policy actions. “If he is putting his thumb on the scale one way or the other, then people aren't going to trust his intelligence,” the adviser told us.



The White House is adamant both that Trump gets the advice he needs and that he never gets his decisions wrong. “President Trump has assembled a talented, world-class team who evaluate all angles of any given issue to provide the President a fulsome view,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly wrote to us in an emailed statement. “Ultimately, the President evaluates all options and makes the decision he feels is best for the country—and he has been proven right about everything time and again.”



Retired General Frank McKenzie, who commanded U.S. forces in the Middle East when Trump targeted Soleimani, noted that the most dire possible scenarios following the Soleimani strike and after those on the nuclear sites haven't borne out—at least so far. That may be because, in his view, Trump has accrued more credibility than other American presidents when it comes to threatening Iran.



“He's got a verifiable, auditable trail. He struck Iran twice; no other American president has done that,” McKenzie told us.



Read: Trump knows Iran has wanted him dead



Trump's Iran operation marked an unexpected deviation from what has been his administration's second-term focus on negotiations. Trump has said he wants diplomatic deals that not only halt Iran's nuclear ambitions but also end the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and beyond. Now Trump may have more leverage in those talks.



“This guy really wanted a negotiation, and now he's done his one-and-done, and he wants to go back to negotiations,” Ian Bremmer, who leads the consultancy and research firm Eurasia Group, told us.



One of Trump's more curious moves since returning to office was his decision to authorize a weeks-long air campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Biden administration had occasionally struck military targets in Yemen but had judged that the Houthis were unlikely to drop their tactic of attacking commercial and naval vessels, no matter what kind of military beating they received.



Trump abruptly halted the campaign and declared victory in May, even though the Houthis retain significant military capability and vowed to continue their assaults on Israel. But Trump had moved on. That may not be so easy if Iran resumes its nuclear activity or continues to support proxy militant groups throughout the Middle East.



“You're going to have a hard time ignoring Iran,” the former official told us, “and it's going to be much harder to change the subject.”

The quiet heroism of my friend in government

Anne Romatowski noticed a small, soft something in the flesh below her collarbone just before Christmas. She wasn't concerned. It was a bump on her uppermost ribs, not a lump in her breast. Still, she figured that she might as well schedule the routine mammogram she had been putting off for 10 months.

By the time her appointment came around—on a frigid Thursday afternoon, the day before Valentine's Day—she had other worries. Donald Trump had returned to office promising to “drain the swamp” and had set up a task force to root out excess and incompetence in Washington. Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency, headed by Elon Musk, were targeting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where she had worked for three years remotely from New York. A few days earlier, Russell Vought, the acting director of the agency, had ordered all of its employees to halt their work.

The CFPB shielded taxpayers from romance scams, Ponzi schemes, excessive fees,  unbreakable contracts, and confiscatory interest rates. Romatowski specialized in artificial intelligence. She studied how criminals used deepfaked voices to rip off the elderly and how biased banking algorithms charged Black families more for mortgages than white families.

The bureau didn't require a single penny of taxpayer resources. It generated some of its budget through fines; the Federal Reserve covered the rest. Yet DOGE fired 70 newly hired or recently promoted employees at the CFPB two days before Romatowski's mammogram, sending each one an email composed so carelessly that it hadn't bothered to replace [EmployeeFirstName], [EmployeeLastName], and [JobTitle] with the recipient's own name and title. “The Agency finds that that you are not fit for continued employment,” the typo-laden email read.

When the mammogram technologist saw the bump below Romatowski's collarbone, she took the scan, referred her for an ultrasound, and told her to talk to a radiologist across the hall right away. Romatowski did not put her sweater back on, and went into the doctor's closet-size office wearing shoes and slacks on the bottom and a cloth hospital gown on top.

Two computer screens obscured the radiologist's face, and a mask muffled his voice. “I'm sorry,” Romatowski said. “Can you repeat that?” He overenunciated: “You have a lump … on your left … breast. It's extremely … likely that you have breast … cancer.” She needed a biopsy as soon as possible. “Is there any way that we can do it tomorrow?” she asked, choking back tears. “I work for the federal government, and I think Elon Musk is going to fire me.”

When she left the appointment, Romatowski sent a few texts to friends to ask for support before her phone died. She stopped in the lobby of a nearby hotel to plug it in. When she turned it back on, she was bombarded with pings on Signal and Slack. Dozens more of her colleagues had been locked out of their computers that afternoon. Her union had sent her a Zoom invitation to an emergency session for terminated workers. Elon Musk had fired her.

Romatowski joined the meeting from the corner of 23rd Street and Eighth Avenue, and ducked into a Target to get out of the cold. She didn't have headphones with her, so she listened to the call in the open, pushing an empty cart through the aisles. She couldn't figure out how to get taken off of mute to ask what would happen to her health insurance.

A biopsy performed a few days later confirmed that she had a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer known as triple-negative. At some point, a cell in the lining of one of her milk ducts had followed the commands of a damaged bit of DNA and started proliferating at an unhinged pace. Her body had failed to kill off the cell and its progeny, which grew into a mass on her chest wall and infiltrated the lymph nodes nearby. Doctors advised that she undergo chemotherapy, immunotherapy, another round of chemotherapy, and a mastectomy or lumpectomy, as well as a potential third round of chemotherapy and radiation, to eradicate the disease.

At the same time, functionaries in Washington were starting to “crush the deep state,” as Trump put it. The “steady creep of government bureaucracy” had sapped “the vitality and wealth of the people,” he had claimed, accusing civil servants of leeching taxpayer resources and subverting the will of the executive. Now he was following through on a promise he'd made on his first day in office: “We're getting rid of all the cancer.”

I was one of the people Anne texted that afternoon when she left her mammogram. We've been friends for 20 years.

A few days later, I brought a bottle of wine to her apartment and ordered us Thai food. Anne picked at her noodles, preoccupied not with her misfortune, but with planning and logistics. She had already set up consultations with multiple physicians and networked with fellow breast-cancer patients. At the same time, she was figuring out how to pass on her work to her colleagues who remained employed at the CFPB and scouring job listings for those who did not. Others had it worse than she did, she said. “A lot of people get fired when they get sick. A lot of people get fired because they are sick.”

I am biased, but Anne really is selfless and levelheaded, dry-witted and good. She worked in what bloodless McKinsey types might call “financial inclusion,” but what she describes as “policy work, close to people.” She had helped low-income mothers in Washington, D.C., find safe housing and good jobs. She had assessed anti-poverty programs while living in Kenya. She had directed philanthropic investment in distressed communities in the Bronx and Houston and protected New Yorkers from financial swindles. Getting hired by the CFPB was “a dream,” she said.

The agency is the only financial regulator specializing in direct support to the public. Over the past decade and a half, it has capped the late fees charged to 45 million credit-card holders, scrubbed medical debt from 15 million credit reports, managed as many as 50,000 complaints a week, returned $19.7 billion to consumers, and fined firms and individuals $5 billion.

Financial businesses require this kind of exacting, assertive oversight, Anne believes. They power the economy. But their tendency to engage in predatory lending and frothy speculation risks pitching individuals into bankruptcy and the whole world into recession. (Indeed, fraud is a leading indicator of downturns; flailing firms sometimes try to scam and swindle their way back into the black.) The agency gave Washington unique insight into household finances, and acted as an early-warning service for the country's systemic regulators, including the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Anne began her career during the 2008 financial crisis. She'd seen how it devastated people's lives. The CFPB, she told me, existed to “prevent it from happening again.”

But banks had long argued that the CFPB stymied good financial products instead of stamping out bad ones. The American Bankers Association cast it as a “regulator gone rogue.” The Chamber of Commerce accused it of “hurting consumers by limiting choice and diminishing competition.” And Republicans on Capitol Hill had always felt that the CFPB was so independent as to be unaccountable, because Congress has no control over its budget and little control of its operations.

The Trump administration went further. Vought, the CFPB's acting director, described the agency as “woke & weaponized.” Musk posted, “CFPB RIP” on X in his first weeks in Washington. Trump called it a “very important thing to get rid of.” (Notably, the CFPB has regulatory authority over the president's crypto token, X's forthcoming payment system, and Tesla's auto-lending arm.)

Anne thought her job might be reinstated, she told me that night in her apartment. The administration hadn't gone through the legal steps required for mass reductions in force. Plus, the Constitution obligates the president to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” A law Congress passed in 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act, had created the CFPB and tasked it with protecting Americans from “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” financial contracts. Trump was supposed to act as a faithful executor of the agency and its mission, whether he wanted to or not.

The day she was fired, a legal team representing her and her colleagues made that argument to a judge, accusing Vought and Trump of “the unlawful dismantling” of a government agency. “This a tragedy for American consumers, and it is lawless,” Deepak Gupta, an attorney, argued. DOGE was planning to fire nearly all of the CFPB's remaining employees. The plan was put on hold as the case started to work its way through the courts.

In early March, Anne joined a call to discuss her union's legal strategy, then went to Memorial Sloan Kettering for an MRI of her tumor. A similar rush of appointments and meetings and paperwork consumed the rest of the month. She had a painful ultrasound-guided biopsy of her axillary lymph nodes and consulted with advocates for the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which Trump was also trying to shut down. She had an echocardiogram and applied for unemployment insurance. She finished packing up her apartment in New York and moved back into her childhood bedroom in McLean, Virginia, then had a chest port put in for IV infusions.

On the last Saturday in March, she received an email at 9:28 p.m. Judge Amy Berman Jackson had issued a 112-page opinion excoriating the Trump administration, whose intent, a sworn affidavit revealed, was to turn the CFPB into a “room at Treasury, White House, or Federal Reserve with five men and a phone.” The president was acting in “complete disregard of the decision Congress made,” Jackson wrote—the decision that the CFPB “must exist.”

Anne had her job back. On Monday, she read the financial papers. On Tuesday, she went to Georgetown University Hospital for her first round of chemo.

It took two weeks for the CFPB to reissue Anne a laptop. She went to the agency's headquarters near the White House to pick it up, and spent three hours waiting in the lobby. The Trump administration had banned her and most other CFPB employees from entering the building. When she finally got the computer, it would not boot up.

Vought had ordered the agency's civil servants to stop what they were doing, but he had not given them any instructions on what to do instead. Anne wasn't sure what her job entailed anymore. Still, if she was drawing a salary, she was going to work. She was not allowed to hold any meetings with industry representatives. So she pulled up data on mergers and acquisitions. She could not provide technical assistance to other agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission. So she went to as many internal meetings as she could and performed “statutory” tasks specifically required by Dodd-Frank, such as monitoring fintech companies' public financial statements. Each Monday, as DOGE required, she sent an email to the Office of Personnel Management with five bullet points explaining what she had done over the past week.

Getting fired again might be a “silver lining,” her oncologist told her; that way, she could focus on her treatment. But she would lose her insurance and her income. “The whole silver-lining thing wasn't convincing,” she told me. She did wonder if she should tell her boss that she was sick. She decided against it. She felt fine. She might not later. The chemotherapy's side effects—nausea, exhaustion, anemia, brain fog, digestive problems—would intensify over time. The summer would be worse than the spring, the fall worse than the summer, the winter worse than the fall.

On April 17, she received an email with the subject line “Specific Notice of Reduction in Force.” She would lose access to her computer and email account again at the end of the following business day, DOGE told her, and she would be placed on administrative leave for two months. Then she would be let go.

That night, she joined a virtual town hall with hundreds of other laid-off employees. The CFPB had 1,700 workers when Trump came into office, and now had only 200 left. Even if the court gave Anne and her colleagues their jobs back, the agency was disintegrating. Scores of skilled civil servants had retired or taken positions outside government. The Trump administration had canceled contracts for user research and testing, financial management, “internal controls,” and “identity access software.” The remaining employees did not have the skills or capacity necessary to do the work required by law, let alone the novel work the agency had undertaken in recent years.

When I visited Anne in Virginia in late April, she told me that she worried about scammers stealing grandparents' retirement savings, thieves hacking people's bank accounts, sports-betting apps bleeding young men dry, and “buy now, pay later” companies targeting poor consumers. I worried about her. She had dyed her hair pink, but little of it remained. She moved slowly. I kept asking how she was doing. Losing your job, getting cancer, and moving back in with your parents—it was a heck of a punch line, she told me, as well as a gut punch. The thing that really upset her was the way Vought talked about his own colleagues in government. In a leaked video, he'd said he wanted “bureaucrats to be traumatically affected.” He wanted them “to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains.” He wanted to “put them in trauma.”

After I saw Anne, I reached out to Rohit Chopra, who had led the CFPB from 2021 until Trump fired him in February. In private, Chopra told me, many elected Republicans supported the agency. It had done a lot for their constituents, even if few would say that out loud. Trump was not only destroying the agency, he believed, but destroying state capacity and “the human capital that really powers” the government. He could not quite articulate what it would take for the system to heal.

Chopra has known Anne for a long time and he admires her work, he told me, though he hesitated to linger on her contributions to the agency. He worried about focusing on the plight of civil servants rather than the people they serve. And he worried about his comments sounding “almost obituary,” given her health status. The issue is personal for him. Chopra was diagnosed with thyroid cancer days after Trump won his first presidential contest. He was undergoing treatment while leading the CFPB. “You never want to feel like it's over,” he said.

Two days after my visit, Anne received an email with the subject line “Recission of Specific Notice in Reduction in Force.” (The email misspelled the word rescission.) DOGE had ignored a court order requiring it to perform a “particularized assessment” of each employee it fired, a whistleblower had testified: “All that mattered was the numbers.” Judge Jackson forced the Trump administration to reinstate Anne and her colleagues again.

At the beginning of June, I went back to Virginia to take Anne to immunotherapy and chemo. The night before the appointment, at her parents' house, we talked for hours. She showed me an email she had gotten from the Treasury's human-resources office that day, informing her that she had been overpaid and owed $11,292.50 to the government. (By her own calculations, the Treasury actually owed her interest on back wages.) I watched as she sent her weekly email, distilling her labor into DOGE-mandated bullet points.

A few weeks earlier, I had put her in touch with my friend Allison Rockey, who had just completed treatment for the same kind of aggressive breast cancer Anne has, and at the same hospital. Allison had given Anne special mitts to hold cold packs against her hands and feet during chemo, to mitigate the nerve damage the medication can cause. Anne had been meaning to reach back out to Allison so they could catch up, she told me.

I sputtered. Allison had thought she was in remission, but the cancer had metastasized to her brain. She had died two days before. Anne hadn't heard yet. “I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,” I said half a dozen times. Anne interrupted me. “I'm sorry,” she said.

The next morning, I showed up with an N95 mask on. We loaded the car and commuted across the Potomac River. At the hospital, Anne met with a nurse practitioner to discuss some gastrointestinal symptoms she had been having. The nurse ordered a CT scan of her abdomen; if it showed excessive inflammation, she would recommend that Anne skip a week of chemo. The phlebotomist struggled to find a vein to administer the contrast fluid for the scan. Anne had to go to a different part of the hospital to have another provider access the port in her chest. It took hours to get the test and the go-ahead.

In the mid-afternoon, we finally got settled at the infusion center. I persuaded her to let me get us lunch. “Literally anything,” I told her. “Literally anything you want to eat.” Why not lobster and champagne? She settled on crab cakes, which arrived in a comically fancy box. As she ate, I yapped, trying to cheer her up.

Nurses hooked her up to a pump, and I helped strap Allison's cold mitts onto her hands and feet. They did not just protect against neuropathy, but also reduced the chance that she would lose a fingernail or toenail and end up with an infection, Anne told me. “If you get sick while you have cancer, you can die,” she said. “You can get an infection that your body can't fight, and then you could die.”

As the life-destroying, lifesaving medication flowed into her, Anne drifted off. I wondered what she would be like the next time I saw her. I kept thinking about Susan Sontag's 1978 meditation on cancer, a disease she described as “spectacularly” caught in the “trappings of metaphor.” At the time, writers used cancer as an allegory for emotional repression and encumbered it with idioms of shame. In 2025, the predominant metaphors involve cancer's endogeneity. It is the sickness that comes from within.

The night before, Anne had told me how moving she'd found it to take the oath of office. Her grandfathers had enlisted in the military and fought for this country; her mother had worked on the Hill and her father for the Justice Department. She felt proud to be a public employee, sworn to “support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” When she woke up the next day, she would log on to her computer and do her job. She would try to protect consumers, as her doctors would try to protect her, as her union would try to protect the CFPB, as financial regulators would try to protect the markets, as the courts and the bureaucrats would try to protect the Constitution and the country—human beings in human systems trying to heal human faults.

For his part, Elon Musk has given up on trying to administer his radical treatment to the civil servants Trump had described as a metastatic disease. After falling out with the president and failing to make the government more efficient, Musk had fired himself from DOGE.

Gen Z is embracing emotional distress — with a new name.

It was abundantly clear to everyone that Huda wasn't doing well.

Huda Mustafa, the breakout villain on Love Island USA's seventh season, spiraled after viewers voted to separate her from Jeremiah Brown, with whom she'd developed an intense connection early in the current season. Over several episodes, she eavesdropped on Jeremiah's conversations, interrogated the woman he was re-coupled with, and broke down repeatedly. Her despondent face became a viral meme. 

Viewers, and later Huda herself, had a simple and notably Gen Z explanation for what she was experiencing: The lovelorn reality star had officially “crashed out.” 

Justin Bieber received the same label recently, for his strange behavior on social media and a viral standoff with paparazzi. While some of his fanbase voiced more serious concerns over the state of his mental health, many tagged the singer's antics as telltale signs of a typical “crashout.” 

It's not just celebrities. Go on TikTok, and users are posting videos of themselves venting, sobbing, or throwing physical tantrums with some sort of caption claiming that they've “crashed out.” In other cases, they're describing “crashing out” in response to other people. 

The catchall phrase is shorthand for the unfiltered actions of a person who is angry, anxious, confused, stressed out, or experiencing mental health issues. It can describe a range of behavior, from emotional outbursts to altercations to withdrawals. There are a lot of ways that “crashing out” can look, but like obscenity, you know it when you see it.

The term has floated around on the internet for a while now; Know Your Meme credits its popularity to rapper NBA YoungBoy, who used the term in his 2017 song, “Stepped On.” Since the 2020s, the concept has been used both humorously and in earnest to discuss the fallout from issues as global as the state of the world, as personal as relationship or work stress, or as low stakes as struggling with a hairstyle. Practically any problem, big or small, can warrant a “crashout.”

One of the most striking things about the phrase is how general it is. Why is a generation raised on pop-psychology jargon, with more access to mental health resources and experience talking about their own needs, painting these episodes with such a broad brush? Is Gen Z abandoning traditional routes of managing their mental health, or has a burnout generation found a more radical way to cope?

It's no secret that Gen Z is particularly stressed out. According to a 2024 Harmony Healthcare IT study, nearly half of Gen Zers struggle with mental health issues, with 1 in 3 taking prescription medication for mental health. Anxiety and depression are the most common conditions. The Covid-19 pandemic has been seen as a cause for the Gen Z mental health crisis, while other studies point to social media as a huge factor. 

Meanwhile, research suggests that Gen Z might be growing more resistant to traditional therapy. A study in the American Journal of Psychology this year found that 37 percent of participants born between 1997 and 2012 said that seeking counseling was “mentally weak.” This was a higher percentage than the 27 percent of millennials, Gen Xers, and baby boomers that were surveyed combined. 

If therapy's relatively unpopular, social media is booming, and it seems like many teenagers and young adults have turned to their favorite influencers and online advice to get through tough times. On TikTok, for example, “crashouts” are often encouraged as a necessary form of catharsis. Even if you aren't naturally experiencing these outbursts, users posit them as a quick and easy fix for stress and anger.

One user, @masonblakee, posted a video of himself looking relaxed in a car with the caption, “How it feels when you finally crash out on someone after keeping your mouth shut for a while.”

Another, @gazellechavez, made a video sharing the supposed benefits of occasionally “crashing out.”

“Once you hit rock bottom, there's only one way you can go — up,” she says.

Still, professionals are more skeptical of these viral directives, as they're being confronted with them at work. Rebecca Hug, a clinical counselor and core faculty in clinical mental health counseling at University of Phoenix, says she regularly encounters clients who've “absorbed the idea that emotional ‘crashing' is a valid coping strategy.” 

“This mindset discourages the development of essential skills like self-regulation, resilience, and perspective-taking,” Hug says. While she says these sorts of reactions are “developmentally appropriate for teenagers,” it's a more crucial problem for people in early adulthood. 

New York-based psychologist Sabrina Romanoff shares similar concerns about these viral “crashing outs,” saying that TikTok has become “a double-edged sword for mental health.”

“On one hand, it's a space where young people can find validation and connect with people who share similar experiences,” she says. “On the other hand, it's a platform with a high circulation of unqualified advice, often oversimplifying and promoting unhealthy ideas.” 

For instance, several videos frame the act of “crashing out” on other people as a joyful and even empowering experience. But at what point do these emotional eruptions become abusive or signal one's failure in communicating with others? 

Romanoff adds that there's a danger to the internet automatically labeling these sorts of behaviors as “crashouts” without acknowledging possible underlying causes. 

“When we see repeated posts about these breakdowns, it can inadvertently create a culture where these moments are expected or even glorified rather than seen as a signal that something deeper needs attention,” she says.

Prior to the “crashout” trend, Gen Z had already built a reputation for publicizing their emotional meltdowns online. TikTok and Instagram Stories have become increasingly popular sites for influencers and average users to cry and vent. Hug says viral “crashouts” reflect how “emotional dysregulation is increasingly externalized and even socially validated.” Rather than having these intimate moments in private with friends or family members, users can receive immediate support from strangers that they may not receive in real life. This public sharing seems, in part, symptomatic of a loneliness epidemic affecting Gen Z. According to a Pew Research Center study this year, the cohort experiences higher rates of loneliness than previous generations. 

However, vulnerability has also proven to be a recipe for virality and a strategy to build loyal audiences. Hug says the visibility of emotional struggles can “blur the line between authentic expression and performative vulnerability.” 

Hence, there's an obvious incentive for certain people to discuss and post their crashouts. Not everyone may come from a particularly dire or desperate place. After all, Hug says that many of these posters' concerns seem to reflect “normal developmental stress rather than clinical pathology.” 

Still, she says that it's important for young people to develop self-regulation skills and utilize mental health resources rather than normalizing these reactions under the guise of “crashing out.” Unfortunately, emotional maturity doesn't get as many likes.

Burritos on a payment plan, explained.

You've probably noticed it by now: You're shopping online for some makeup or a new pair of running shoes or a water table for your toddler, and when you go to check out, you have a new option — why not break up the cost into four payments, made over time? 

US consumers, especially Gen Z and millennial ones, have been embracing “buy now, pay later” services like Klarna and Afterpay with gusto the last few years. It's not hard to see the attraction: Unlike a credit card, most BNPL plans don't carry interest, and they generally don't impact your credit score (though that is now changing).

On social media people tout BNPL as a way to buy stuff you want but don't have the cash for right then — or maybe ever. And that's starting to show up in the data: Leading BNPL company Klarna — which recently partnered with the food delivery service DoorDash, spawning a thousand memes — saw its net losses from consumers not paying their loans more than double in the first quarter of this year. 

All this has Kyla Scanlon worried. Scanlon is an author and economic commentator, best known for breaking down economic issues through blog posts and videos on social media. In a video she published shortly after Klarna announced its partnership with DoorDash, Scanlon called the rise of BNPL a symptom of our “poor-impulse-control economy.”

“What I worry about is that the convenience and the impulsivity that it allows for allows for the expansion of the grift economy, of a world where people are spending money on things that they don't need to and they're just totally lost in that cycle,” Scanlon told Today, Explained co-host Noel King.

Scanlon talked to King about buy now, pay later, Gen Z's relationship to debt, and what financial responsibility looks like in today's economy. Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

You're a commentator, you're a public intellectual, you're also a member of Gen Z, and you speak directly to Gen Zers who are operating in the economy. How are young people using BNPL?

A lot of Gen Zers have had very common interactions with debt. Student loan debt is a big part of the life of a Gen Zer. Medical bills, anything involving a credit score. Debt has been so normalized for the younger generation that when they see something like BNPL, it's like, “Oh, this is just casual debt.”

For young people, they've been raised in the shadow of the 2008 crisis and student loan debt. It's just what they do with their money.

This is interesting, that debt has always been available to Gen Z. If you're an older millennial like I am, that's not really the case. You might remember getting your first credit card when you were 22, but there was no Apple Pay. You couldn't just pay for stuff on your phone. 

And it strikes me that my nieces and nephews who are teenagers, they can do that. They have this ease with paying for stuff and taking on debt for stuff that never occurred to me when I was young.

A lot of that is structural. In 2020, the government sent out unemployment checks. In 2021, the Fed had rates really close to zero. We're always talking about the deficit. We're always talking about how much money the United States as a country owes. And so I think for everybody, they're looking at that and they're like, If the government owes all this money, surely I can have a little bit of debt, too. 

And then credit scores have become such a core part of the American identity. It really informs a lot — how you can buy a house or if you can even get certain loans. I think people view debt as structural to themselves as a person, and that's increased. And I think it really has a lot to do with the environment that Gen Z has grown up in and the fact that these tools are so readily available and they're so easy to use.

Talk to me a bit about debt. Is it dangerous?

When you look at debt systemically, it's not inherently a bad thing. Like most things, it's a tool. Like social media, you could say it's bad, but it's just a tool. It's all about how you use it. Same with debt. 

BNPL in itself isn't evil, especially if you can pay it all off without having to face those high interest rates. Credit cards themselves aren't evil. But it's really about the system that encourages these sorts of products to be created. 

Real wages were stagnant for a really long time. The entry-level labor force has really deteriorated. It's very tough to get a job right now. If you're graduating from college and the college wage premium has eroded quite a bit, rent is high because we don't build enough housing. Groceries are up. People are looking at the very high prices, the impossibility of ever buying a house, the struggles that they might be facing in the labor force. 

It's like, Well, sure, it might be irresponsible to use BNPL to get a moisturizer from Sephora, but what else am I going to do? I don't see a solution before me. And so I think that's been the big thing with debt — we've used it as a tool in order to navigate some of the hairier parts about being in the United States right now. 

I think historically you might say, Look, you can't afford the Sephora lotion right now, why don't you just wait? And it sounds like what you were saying is that's a bit of a privileged or maybe old-fashioned idea of how paying for things works.

Right! I think, “Why don't you just wait?” ignores some of the ladder issues that we're facing as Gen Z, younger people — even millennials, in some capacity, are facing this broken-ladder problem where they could wait to buy that moisturizer, but that would require the entry-level labor market to free up again, that would require wages to really speed up, that would require the housing market to normalize. 

So I think a lot of people blame younger people for using debt and using BNPL. And you should be careful — I don't think you should be living above your means in an extravagant way. But it really is a psychological buffer of sorts, where people are just like, Well, I don't know what else to do, so I'm going to go buy this thing. 

It is an element of instant gratification, the same thing that we see in social media, but for Gen Z-ers and younger people. There isn't that stability, that expectation of stability in the traditional sense. And so I think these little small luxuries matter — buying that moisturizer matters because it is indulgent in a certain way, but it's also an act of agency in an economy that doesn't feel like it's allowing you into it.

It does feel like there is some American ethos here that says, To live is to be in debt, and we've all accepted that.

I mean, that's the only way you can get by sometimes. There's that misquoted statistic about living paycheck to paycheck. It's not 60 percent of Americans living paycheck to paycheck. It's far lower, but I think a lot of people just feel like, one wrong move and the whole thing could come tumbling down.

And so we have these issues that are outside of the realm of consumer packaged goods being delivered where we have to really start thinking through actual solutions to these problems, because they're not going to fix themselves. The incentives are too misaligned.

MSCI's sub-index for Latin America is up 25%, while the Eastern Europe sub-index is up 45%. That compares with an advance of less than 5% on the S&P 500.

In a banner year for emerging markets, the best returns have gone to investors who targeted regional indexes and ignored the Asia-heavy global benchmarks.

While the most widely tracked gauge of developing-nation stocks, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, is beating the S&P 500 for the first time since 2017, returns for sub-indexes in Latin America and Eastern Europe are as much as four times higher. That's because the benchmark global indexes are dominated by companies in Asia, the region most impacted by President Donald Trump's tariff threats that has also been the biggest laggard in an otherwise extraordinary year for the asset class.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Elon Musk slammed the US Senate's latest version of President Donald Trump's multi-trillion dollar tax bill Saturday, warning that the cuts to electric vehicle and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country.

Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, posted on his social media platform X about the bill, which the Senate advanced in a contentious vote late Saturday. Musk recently left Trump's side after working for several months as the head of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Any measures to ease inflation in Japan must be speedy and shouldn't impede the government's ability to fund social services, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday, in a comment reflecting his aversion to sales tax cuts as opposition parties campaign to lower the duty ahead of a key election next month. 

“We must secure the necessary funds for medical care, elderly care, and pensions. On top of that, the response to the current inflationary trends needs immediacy. It needs to be speedy,” Ishiba said on Sunday at a conference hosted by non-profit organization Japan Productivity Center. He added that measures to counter inflation must reach those most in need, and touted recent steps that eased rice and gasoline prices as examples.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday pleaded for progress in ceasefire talks in the war in Gaza, calling for a deal that would halt the fighting in the 20-month-long conflict as Israel and Hamas appeared to be inching closer to an agreement.

An Israeli official said plans were being made for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to travel to Washington in the coming weeks, a sign there may be movement on a new deal. The official declined to discuss the focus of the visit and spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not yet been finalized.

""MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!"" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social early Sunday between posts about a Senate vote on his tax and spending cuts bill.

Trump raised expectations Friday for a deal, saying there could be a ceasefire agreement within the next week. Taking questions from reporters, he said, ""We're working on Gaza and trying to get it taken care of.""

Trump has repeatedly called for Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza. Despite an eight-week ceasefire reached just as Trump was taking office earlier this year, attempts since then to bring the sides toward a new agreement have failed.

A top adviser to Netanyahu, Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer, was set to travel to Washington this week for talks on a ceasefire.

The Gaza message wasn't the only Middle East-related post by Trump. On Saturday evening, he doubled down on his criticism of the legal proceedings against Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption, calling it ""a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure.""

In the post on Truth Social, he said the trial interfered with talks on a Gaza ceasefire.

""(Netanyahu) is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING,"" Trump wrote.

The post echoed similar remarks Trump made last week when he called for the trial to be canceled. It was a dramatic interference by an international ally in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state. And it unnerved many in Israel, despite Trump's popularity in the country.

The Israeli military on Sunday ordered a mass evacuation of Palestinians in large swaths of northern Gaza, an early target of the war that has been severely damaged by multiple rounds of fighting.

Col. Avichay Adraee, a military spokesperson, posted the order on social media. It includes multiple neighborhoods in eastern and northern Gaza City, as well as the Jabaliya refugee camp.

The military will expand its escalating attacks to the city's northern section, calling for people to move southward to the Muwasi area in southern Gaza, Adraee said.

After being all but emptied earlier in the war, hundreds of thousands of people are in northern Gaza following their return during a ceasefire earlier this year.

An Israeli military offensive currently underway aims to move Palestinians to southern Gaza so forces can more freely operate to combat militants. Rights groups say their movement would amount to forcible transfer.

The war in Gaza began with Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas in which militants killed 1,200 people and took roughly 250 hostage, about 50 of whom remain captive with less than half believed to be alive.

Israel's retaliatory response has killed more than 56,000 people, according to local health authorities, who do not distinguish between militants and civilians in their count but say more than half of the dead are women and children.

The war has set off a humanitarian catastrophe, displaced most of Gaza's population, often multiple times, and obliterated much of the territory's urban landscape.

Talks between Israel and Hamas have repeatedly faltered over one major sticking point, whether the war should end as part of any ceasefire agreement.

Hamas official Mahmoud Merdawi accused Netanyahu of stalling progress on a deal, saying in remarks on the Telegram messaging app that the Israeli leader insists on a temporary agreement that would free just 10 of the hostages. A Netanyahu spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Hamas says it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and an end to the war. Israel rejects that offer, saying it will agree to end the war if Hamas disarms and goes into exile, something the group refuses.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday lashed out at prosecutors in Israel over the corruption trial that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has faced, saying Washington, having given billions of dollars worth of aid to Israel, was not going to ""stand for this"".

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in Israel on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - all of which he denies. The trial began in 2020 and involves three criminal cases. 

On Friday, the court rejected a request by Netanyahu's lawyers to delay his testimony for the next two weeks because of diplomatic and security matters following the 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran this month. 

He is due to take the stand on Monday for cross-examination.

""It is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post, asserting that the judicial process was going to interfere with Netanyahu's ability to conduct talks with Palestinian militant group Hamas, and Iran.

A spokesperson for the Israeli prosecution declined to comment on Trump's post. Netanyahu on X retweeted Trump's post and added: ""Thank you again, @realDonaldTrump. Together, we will make the Middle East Great Again!""     

Trump's second post over the course of a few days defending Netanyahu and calling for the cancellation of the trial went a step further to tie Israel's legal action to U.S. aid.

""The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar [sic] a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this,"" Trump said.

Netanyahu ""right now"" was in the process of negotiating a deal with Hamas, Trump said, without giving further details. On Friday, the Republican president told reporters that he believed a ceasefire was close.

Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining hostages in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel says it can only end it if Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.

Interest in resolving the Gaza conflict has heightened in the wake of the U.S. and Israeli bombings of Iran's nuclear facilities.

President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" cleared a key procedural hurdle in the U.S. Senate late Saturday night, pushing the massive spending package one step closer to the president's desk.

The vote on a motion to proceed to final debate on the bill passed with 51 yeas and 49 nays. Every Democrat and two Republicans, Sens. Thom Tillis, N.C., and Rand Paul, Ky., voted against it.

The actual voting took hours and the measure only passed after three Republican holdouts — Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Cynthia Lummus of Wyoming — folded and voted yes.

Sen. Ron Johnson, Wis., an outspoken critic of the bill, ultimately changed his vote to a ""yes"" from a ""no."" That additional Republican vote gave the bill 51 yeas, so Vice President JD Vance did not need to cast a vote to break a tie.

The ultimate vote was a victory for Republican Majority Leader John Thune, S.D., who has pledged to get the bill to Trump for his signature by July 4.

Trump hailed the late-night vote passage and she he was ""VERY PROUD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TONIGHT"" in an all-caps, late-night Truth Social post.

But the hours of uncertainty and last-minute wrangling underscore the tricky path ahead for the controversial package.

Saturday's procedural vote tees up a final Senate vote on the megabill that will likely happen sometime Sunday or Monday.

Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are forcing the 940-page bill to be read out loud once it heads to full debate on the Senate floor Sunday.

""We will be here all night if that's what it takes to read it,"" Schumer wrote Saturday on X.

While the package cannot officially pass the upper chamber until the final vote, the procedural vote was considered a big test for Thune.

The vote comes after weeks of turmoil and tension over the massive package that exposed bitter policy disputes and emboldened some firm Republican holdouts.

Some Republican senators repeatedly balked at the bill's impact on the national debt.

The Senate bill could add over $3.9 trillion to the national debt, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis.

The sweeping domestic policy package will also have to be passed again in the House, which just narrowly passed its own version of the bill last month.

Some House Republicans have already expressed opposition to key elements of the Senate version of the bill — most notably deep cuts to Medicaid — likely foreshadowing a close vote in the lower chamber.

Both Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson hold narrow majorities in their respective chambers, meaning they can only afford to lose the support of a small number of Republican lawmakers to pass the package in a party-line vote.

Meanwhile, Trump continues to urge lawmakers to get the package passed before Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline.

""President Trump is committed to keeping his promises, and failure to pass this bill would be the ultimate betrayal,"" the White House said in a statement of administration policy on Saturday.

When Priyanka Jain, co-founder and CEO of vaginal microbiome test and care company Evvy, is hiring, she knows what she wants to see in a candidate.

She's looking for someone ""who goes above and beyond just what your job title tells you to do,"" she says. That could mean including an ""Interests"" section on your resume that lists volunteering or outside projects, or just illustrating your passion for your field with accomplishments on the job.

She also knows what she doesn't want to see in a candidate: Someone who's only interested in doing strategy. When execution is ""outside of their zone of genius,"" she says, ""that's always a little concerning.""

Every company needs people who strategize about how to improve operations, as well as people who execute. But at a startup, where personnel and resources are limited, ""you don't have the luxury of having strategy people and execution people,"" says Jain.

Every person needs to be able to ""figure out what the problem is,"" she says, plus, ""you also need to be able to get into the weeds, figure out the solution, write it yourself, get it into the world.""

At the end of the day, when it comes to strategy and execution at a startup, ""everybody has to be able to do both.""

To suss out if candidates can both ideate and roll up their sleeves, Jain asks about a problem they had in a past company and how they solved it.

""The level of detail that anybody's able to get into as it relates to the process and not just the deliverable tells you a lot about how involved they actually were,"" she says. If they can explain exactly the steps it took to solve the problem, they probably took those steps themselves — and could do it again to solve problems at their next company.

The other element Jain is looking for in a candidate's answer is their attitude. ""If they get excited about both sides,"" she says, ""that's always a really good sign."" They'll carry that level of enthusiasm for getting things done going forward.

In this article

The S&P 500 rose to a fresh record on Friday, but macro uncertainties persist. Investors may want to consider dividend-paying stocks as a way to enhance returns in the event of choppy markets.

Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend stocks, given that these experts assign their ratings after an in-depth analysis of a company's fundamentals and its ability to generate solid cash flows to consistently pay dividends.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Fast-food chain McDonald's (MCD) is this week's first dividend pick. The company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.77 per share. With an annualized dividend of $7.08 per share, MCD stock offers a dividend yield of 2.4%. It is worth noting that McDonald's has increased its annual dividend for 49 consecutive years and is on track to becoming a dividend king.

Recently, Jefferies analyst Andy Barish reiterated a buy rating on McDonald's stock with a price target of $360. The analyst believes that MCD stock is a buy on a pullback. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on McDonald's stock and a price target of $342.

Barish sees near-term acceleration in McDonald's U.S. same-store sales (SSS) and medium-term acceleration in unit growth as the major drivers for the stock, which would help narrow the current valuation gap compared to rivals Yum Brands and Domino's. The analyst also noted improved international SSS, as the company remains a trade-down beneficiary due to its value proposition and low-price point combos.

Among other positives, Barish mentioned brand power and competitive advantages in size, scale, advertising, supply chain and most up-to-date chain of restaurants. He is also optimistic about MCD due to its defensive qualities and brand positioning during uncertain times, higher visibility in delivering low-single to mid-single digit SSS compared to rivals, acceleration of global unit growth to 4% to 5%, category-high operating margins and massive free cash flow generation to support dividends and repurchases.

""Despite a soft 1Q and well-known pressures on the low-end consumer, MCD is executing well by balancing value, innovation, and marketing,"" said Barish.

Barish ranks No. 591 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 9.9%. See McDonald's Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

We move on to EPR Properties (EPR), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on experiential properties such as movie theaters, amusement parks, eat-and-play centers and ski resorts. EPR recently announced a 3.5% increase in its monthly dividend to $0.295 per share. At an annualized dividend of $3.54 per share, EPR stock offers a dividend yield of 6.2%.

Following an extensive visit to EPR's corporate headquarters and meetings with some teams in the company, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak upgraded EPR stock to buy from hold and increased the price target to $65 from $52. TipRanks' AI analyst also has an ""outperform"" rating on EPR with a price target of $61.

Yarmak turned bullish on EPR, noting the recent rise in the stock and improvements in the cost of capital. He said that the company can ""once again return to reasonable external growth.""

Specifically, the analyst estimates that year to date, EPR's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) has improved to about 7.85% from nearly 9.3%. At these improved levels, Yarmak said that he thinks the company can start aggressively making more acquisitions and boost external growth.

Moreover, Yarmak highlighted the continued improvement in the fundamentals of the theatre industry and expects percentage rent to enhance EPR Properties' earnings over the next several years. Meanwhile, the improved cost of capital is enabling management to look at other external growth opportunities, mainly golf assets and health and wellness assets.

Yarmak ranks No. 670 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.2%. See EPR Properties Stock Charts on TipRanks.

The third stock on this week's dividend list is Halliburton (HAL), an oilfield services company that provides products and services to the energy industry. HAL offers a quarterly dividend of 17 cents per share. At an annualized dividend of 68 cents per share, Halliburton stock's dividend yield stands at 3.3%.

Following a virtual investor meeting with management, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on Halliburton stock with a price target of $24. Also, TipRanks' AI analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on HAL stock with a price target of $23.

While management acknowledged near-term risks to the North American business, Mehta noted that about 60% of HAL's revenue comes from international markets and presents a relative degree of resilience, which is not priced into the stock. Halliburton expects continued softness in certain geographic locations such as Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. However, most of HAL's international rigs are exposed to unconventional drilling, and management does not expect these rigs to experience large suspensions.

Interestingly, management expects ""idiosyncratic growth"" from four key areas: unconventional completion opportunities in Argentina and Saudi Arabia, market share growth in directional drilling, intervention opportunities as operators are more likely to spend greater time optimizing existing assets than developing greenfield assets, and artificial lift opportunities. Mehta expects these opportunities to enhance margins and support strong free cash flow conversion, making HAL stock attractive at these levels.

Despite the expected softness in pricing in North America, Halliburton expects to maintain a premium to the market due to its differentiated Zeus technology and the long-term nature of its electric contracts, noted the analyst.

Mehta ranks No. 541 among more than 9,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 9.2%. See Halliburton Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

It's not uncommon for Americans to feel like they're not saving enough for retirement — no matter their age or income level.

But earning a higher salary can help you save more, as long as you increase your contributions along with your income. So it may not be surprising that workers with higher incomes tend to have higher 401(k) balances, according to newly released data from asset management firm Vanguard. 

The median balance of defined contribution plans — which are employer-sponsored retirement plans like 401(k)s or 403(b)s — among workers making between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double what workers making $50,000 to $74,999 have invested, per Vanguard. The firm examined data from nearly 5 million participants across its defined contribution plans.

Here's how much workers have in their retirement savings plans at each income level.

Notably, the average balances are significantly higher than the median balances. The median is often a more representative figure, however, because averages can be skewed if a small number of participants have significantly higher or lower amounts invested.

And keep in mind these figures only represent savings held in Vanguard defined contribution plans. Investors may have additional retirement accounts with other plan providers or separate brokerage accounts.

Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty like stubbornly high prices and recession fears, many Americans have prioritized their long-term financial goals through retirement account contributions. 

""There has been persistent, year-over-year progress in retirement savings behaviors,"" David Stinnett, head of strategic retirement consulting at Vanguard, told CNBC Make It in an email. ""Seemingly regardless of market and economic conditions, we find that workers are getting started saving earlier, saving more of their paycheck, and investing their savings in age-appropriate asset allocations more consistently.""

Regardless of income, one factor that has helped boost savers' balances is automatic enrollment. Employees with 10 or more years of tenure who were automatically enrolled in their company's retirement plan had median account balances roughly 60% higher than those who had to opt-in to contributions, the same Vanguard study found.

The median balance among auto-enrolled investors with at least 10 years of service was $192,372 in 2024, compared with $121,094 for voluntary enrollees.

""We're encouraged by how employers design their 401(k) plans to make it easy for workers to save and invest for retirement, and automatic enrollment is a big part of that,"" Stinnett said.

In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America's and the rest of the world's dangerous vulnerability. China's latest actions show their readiness and ability to weaponize American and global dependence.

This is not a new challenge. The United States has known for over 15 years that its critical mineral supply chains were too concentrated, too fragile, and too exposed to Chinese leverage and control. And yet, across Democratic and Republican administrations, we have failed to respond with urgency or coherence. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors.

Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough — but have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?

Skepticism is high. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back.

Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described China's export license process as highly invasive — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users.

Executives say the process amounts to ""official information extraction.""

While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes.

This isn't just licensing — it's competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk.

This vulnerability did not happen overnight. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China's export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.

The first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments.

The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China's six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing's grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available.

The recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of ""weaponizing"" its control over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan. Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in recycling, substitution, and refining technologies.

Predictably, Beijing reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the plan as ""a pretext"" for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating confrontation out of fear of losing market share.

Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington's orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid.

The raw numbers are staggering. China accounts for roughly 70% of global rare earth mining but over 90% of refining capacity. It produces 92% of the world's neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. This dominance is no accident. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine.

U.S. sites like MP Materials' Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. The DoD and DOE have offered grants, and the FY2026 Trump budget looks to expand U.S. mining capacity and secure access to critical minerals. But all this remains dwarfed by China's head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector.

China moved early and decisively into Africa and Latin America, partnering with governments in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and refining infrastructure. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries.

The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China's licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction.

This is a decisive moment. China is betting that America's internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. They may be right. The U.S. needs to proves them wrong.

The United States must now treat critical minerals not as commodities, but as instruments of geopolitical power. China already does. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. From mining and refining to magnet production and recycling, every link must be strengthened through targeted investment, permitting reform, and strategic coordination.

A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance.

The six-month export reprieve from China is not a solution — it is a stress test. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. Washington must respond with urgency, unity, and a strategy equal to the scale of the challenge. There is still time, but not much.

Ethereum is back in the spotlight.

After a sleepy start to the year, $ETH is finally waking up, catching the attention of traders and long-term believers alike.

Gas fees are rising, transaction times are slowing, and users are once again feeling the pinch. Every time Ethereum gains traction, the same question returns: can it scale fast enough to support mainstream adoption?

While Ethereum grapples with these growing pains, the spotlight is shifting. A new crypto project is stepping into the Layer-2 arena – not on Ethereum, but on Bitcoin. And it's doing things a little differently.

Over the past week, Ethereum has shown serious bullish signals. It recently tested $2,6K before pulling back slightly, and analysts are again forecasting a potential push toward the long-awaited $10K mark.



Whale wallets are pouring millions into $ETH, with major players moving funds into cold storage and staking contracts.

On-chain data backs the excitement – daily transactions have crossed 1.5M, and active addresses have hit their highest levels since early 2023.

But this rise in usage is once again exposing Ethereum's Achilles' heel: high fees and network congestion. Despite multiple Layer-2 solutions offering relief, they still rely on Ethereum's foundation. And that's where Bitcoin Hyper changes the game.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is rewriting the rules for what Bitcoin can do.

While Bitcoin is the ultimate store of value, it's never been known for speed or utility. Bitcoin Hyper changes that by building a lightning-fast, low-cost Layer-2 network using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM).



That means sub-second transactions, near-zero gas fees, and full compatibility with Solana's massive DeFi and dApp ecosystem, while staying anchored to Bitcoin's security.

This isn't just another rollup or Ethereum workaround. Bitcoin Hyper is Bitcoin's execution layer, unlocking real use cases: meme coins, DAOs, dApps, NFTs, staking, trading – you name it.

And with Ethereum congested yet again, Bitcoin Hyper arrives at exactly the right moment.

Right now, you can buy $HYPER for just $0.012075. The token's still in the presale phase and has raised over $1.74M already. But forecasts suggest big upside. In 2025 alone, price predictions range from $0.15 to $0.32.



That's up to a 2,548% increase from today's price.

Let's say you grab 10K $HYPER now for about $120. With a 20% APY staking reward, you'd have 12K tokens after a year.

If the price hits just $0.15, your stack would be worth $1,8K – a 15x return. If it reaches the high estimate of $0.32, you're looking at $3,840 – a 30x gain.

It's rare to find new crypto projects with this combo of low entry price, real utility, cross-chain potential, and a fully-audited, meme-friendly roadmap. Bitcoin Hyper might just be one of the best altcoins to grab during this cycle.

Ethereum is gaining serious momentum, and a breakout could be just around the corner. But while the spotlight shines on ETH, a new story is unfolding elsewhere.

Bitcoin Hyper is showing that Bitcoin doesn't have to sit on the sidelines anymore – it can be fast, scalable, and culture-driven.

As Ethereum pushes higher, Bitcoin Hyper is quietly laying the foundation for the next wave. Don't overlook it, because the next big move might start on Bitcoin.

This isn't financial advice. Always do your research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Rallies Unlike Anything the Market Has Seen About To Kick Off for Crypto, According to Analyst","https://dailyhodl.com/2025/06/29/rallies-unlike-anything-the-market-has-seen-about-to-kick-off-for-crypto-according-to-analyst/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:45:56 GMT","

A closely followed crypto analyst is predicting a historic rally for altcoin markets based on an unprecedented technical setup.

The pseudonymous analyst known as TechDev shares a chart with his 532,000 followers on the social media platform X showing the price action of TOTAL2 – which tracks the total market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins – with a Bollinger Band indicator.

Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool used to assess price volatility and identify potential breakout or mean-reversion opportunities. When the bands are close together, it suggests that volatility is historically low and the asset is potentially due for a big move.

According to TechDev, the Bollinger Bands are tightly contracted for TOTAL2, suggesting that a huge burst to the upside for altcoins is imminent.

“Altcoin compression is at a record high.

Expansion will be unlike anything the market has seen.”

The analyst also believes that, based on the overall business cycle, Bitcoin is nowhere near its top.

“Re-evaluate your top calls.”

TechDev also uses the copper-to-gold ratio as a signal pointing to a likely massive Bitcoin surge.

The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for investor risk appetite, has formed a bottom similar to 2020 and 2016, which preceded BTC bull runs, according to TechDev.

“The steep part lies ahead.”

At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $107,165, up 4% in the last seven days.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

Analyst Michael van de Poppe suggests that the recent price movements in the altcoin market indicate a potential bottoming out, which could pave the way for a broader recovery. He attributes this to the weakening of gold prices and the possibility of changes in macroeconomic policies, such as future rate cuts, which could inject liquidity into risk assets like altcoins. Additionally, van de Poppe points to a bullish divergence forming on the OTHERS/BTC chart, a signal that often precedes major altcoin rallies. He emphasizes that the current technical patterns align with those observed at previous cycle lows, further supporting his view that the market is bottoming out.

However, not all analysts share this optimistic outlook. Tony Severino notes that Bitcoin's dominance has recently risen to 65.66%, with RSI indicators remaining strong, indicating that Bitcoin continues to outpace the rest of the market. The altcoin season index is currently low at 22, suggesting that altcoins have yet to regain momentum. This discrepancy highlights the challenge that altcoins face in reclaiming market share from Bitcoin. Traders are closely monitoring the situation to see if the tide will turn in favor of altcoins.

Altcoins have been experiencing a significant downturn, with exchange flows dropping by 40% year-over-year. This prolonged period of decline often precedes corrective movements, suggesting that the market may be poised for a strong rebound. Analysts have highlighted the potential for a 50% gain in altcoins, citing historical trends and increased institutional interest as key factors. Several top altcoins have shown bullish signals, with key support levels holding firm, indicating a potential turnaround.

Technical indicators further support the possibility of an altcoin rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for many altcoins is neither oversold nor overbought, suggesting that a positive shift in market sentiment could trigger a comeback. For instance, Dogecoin's RSI is at nearly 46, positioning it for a potential recovery if market conditions improve. Additionally, several altcoins have flashed bullish signals, hinting at a potential rebound in the near future.

Despite the challenges, the altcoin market shows signs of resilience. Historical data indicates that altcoins often experience a surge following a Bitcoin rally, although the classic altseason pattern may no longer be as pronounced. Analysts suggest that the current market conditions could signal the beginning of an altcoin season, where cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Solana could see significant gains. A drop of less than 50% in these altcoins would mark the official start of this season, potentially leading to phenomenal increases.

Several altcoins have shown promising developments that could drive their rebound. Bittensor (TAO) has gained institutional attention following a $10 million investment from Synaptogenix, signaling growing interest in decentralized AI networks. Stellar (XLM) has outperformed major coins over the past year, with a 159% annual gain, and is showing signs of a technical rebound. SUBBD, currently in its presale phase, is pioneering AI-driven content creation with staking incentives and growing adoption. NEAR Protocol has proposed cutting its inflation rate from 5% to 2.5%, which could tighten supply and potentially increase the value of the NEAR token. Story (IP) has unveiled a $10 million fund aimed at early-stage teams building at the intersection of intellectual property, AI, and finance, positioning IP as a major real-world asset class.

In summary, while the altcoin market has faced significant challenges, technical indicators and institutional interest suggest a potential rebound. Several altcoins have shown bullish signals and promising developments, positioning them for a strong recovery if market sentiment improves.

While blockchain technology promises transparency and decentralization, practical issues such as slow transaction speeds and high fees have made it challenging to meet the needs of everyday users.

Whether you're trading tokens, minting NFTs or engaging with decentralized apps, the experience often falls short of the seamless and efficient interactions people expect from modern digital platforms. On public blockchains such as Ethereum, periods of heavy demand still push transaction fees into the dollars and delay settlement for minutes—an experience that certainly falls short of mainstream expectations.

To close that gap, developers have turned to Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions: purpose-built networks that execute transactions off the main Ethereum chain, compress the results into cryptographic proofs, and post those proofs back to Layer 1 for immutable finality. The approach combines the security of a battle-tested base layer with the speed and cost efficiency required for mass-market applications—an architecture that now safeguards roughly $36 billion across thousands of decentralized apps.

A Layer 2 solution is any protocol that executes transactions off the base blockchain (Layer 1) while ultimately relying on that Layer 1 for security and final settlement. Think of it as a mall parking garage: shoppers still enter the main building (Ethereum), but the actual traffic is redirected to multi-storey ramps built next door, preventing gridlock at the front door.

Most L2s fall into two camps: rollups (Optimistic or Zero-Knowledge) and state channels/validium hybrids. Other recognized Layer 2 solutions include nested blockchains and sidechains.

While all L2s aim to enhance scalability, their methods for inheriting Layer 1 security and managing data availability vary, and some, like Validiums, introduce additional trust assumptions regarding data availability. All share the same north star: compress data, cut fees and leave heavy-duty security to Ethereum's battle-tested consensus.

An L2 batches hundreds, or even thousands of user transactions, creates a cryptographic proof of the new state, and submits that lightweight proof to Layer 1.

Optimistic rollups (e.g., Optimism and Arbitrum) assume the batch is valid unless challenged within a dispute window. Fraud proofs keep operators honest.

ZK-rollups (e.g., zkSync Era or Polygon zkEVM) generate succinct validity proofs up-front, so withdrawals finalize in minutes rather than days.

Either way, the result is a 10-100× throughput boost because only the proof, not every transaction detail, touches the L1.

Layer 2 solutions differ significantly from Layer 1 in several key aspects. In terms of throughput, Layer 1 processes around 15 to 20 transactions per second (TPS), while Layer 2 dramatically boosts this capacity, with rollups achieving over 1,000 TPS and solutions like Polygon potentially reaching up to 65,000 TPS.

Transaction fees also show a stark contrast; Layer 1 fees typically range from $0.25 to $0.50 on average but can spike to $20-$60 in times of high network congestion. On the other hand, Layer 2 fees are often below $0.05, with some solutions reducing costs to as little as $0.0196, post-Dencun upgrade.

Regarding security, Layer 1 relies on its native Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, whereas Layer 2 inherits security directly from Layer 1 through cryptographic proofs. Data availability also diverges in approach, with Layer 1 storing data entirely on-chain, while Layer 2 integrates on-chain proofs with minimal data requirements.

Finally, their use cases reflect their technical capabilities. Layer 1 is typically reserved for high-value decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and settlement processes, while Layer 2 excels in high-volume scenarios like payments and gaming due to its enhanced scalability and lower costs.

Lower fees are the headline benefit of L2s, but several second-order benefits matter just as much:

Ethereum's March 2024 Dencun upgrade introduced blob space (EIP-4844), a cheap data lane expressly for rollups. Blobs lowered average L2 transaction fees by roughly 90%, catalyzing the migration of everyday payments and micro-trades off-chain.

By shifting order-routing, AMM swaps, and NFT orders to L2 while anchoring security to L1, Ethereum keeps its decentralization ethos intact yet gains Visa-scale throughput—a feat that pure L1 scaling alone couldn't handle.

Although L2 networks provide a number of benefits over L1 in terms of cost and speed, there's no such thing as a free lunch in crypto security:

Users should generally be looking for L2s with open-sourced node software, decentralized proposers and permissionless fraud-proof systems scheduled on the roadmap.

The L2 user experience still remains a bit unintuitive: bridging ETH, switching RPCs, and wrapping gas tokens still confuse newcomers. Wallet standards like EIP-4337 (account abstraction) and gas-sponsored transactions help, but widespread education is needed. Regulators also eye cross-chain bridges as potential money-laundering chokepoints, which may impose compliance overhead on sequencer operators in 2026 and beyond.

The industry increasingly treats Ethereum as a settlement layer, a Supreme Court for finality, while thousands of L2 “city-states” handle day-to-day commerce. Optimism's Superchain will soon enable atomic cross-rollup calls, and ZK-proof hardware acceleration promises sub-cent fees. Whether one mega-rollup dominates or a mesh of specialized L2s persists, the direction is clear: scale out, not up.

Bottom Line

Layer 2 scaling solutions have moved from academic whitepapers to production rails powering millions of daily transactions. By batching computation off-chain and posting cryptographic receipts on-chain, they deliver faster, cheaper and greener crypto experiences without abandoning Ethereum's security guarantees. Expect L2s—not yet another monolithic Layer 1—to carry Web3 toward mass adoption.

What Is Layer 2?

Layer 2 is a secondary network that processes transactions off the main blockchain while anchoring final settlement back to it for security.

What's The Difference Between Layer 1 And Layer 2?

Layer 1 handles base consensus and data availability; Layer 2 executes bulk transactions and periodically submits proofs to Layer 1, achieving higher throughput and lower fees.

Can I Use My Ethereum Wallet On Layer 2 Networks?

Yes. Most L2s are EVM-compatible, so Metamask and hardware wallets work once you add the network RPC or connect via WalletConnect.

What Is The Best Layer 2 Solution Right Now?

“Best” depends on priorities: Base leads in TVL, Optimism's Superchain dominates transaction share, and ZK-rollups like zkSync offer near-instant finality with strong cryptographic guarantees.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Articles Details

I'm your AI market decoder—cutting through the chaos to show you what trends really matter (and which ones to ignore).

SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is making a bold return to crypto—and it could be the move that finally unlocks its full potential as a financial powerhouse. After exiting the crypto space in late 2023 due to regulatory hurdles, SoFi's relaunch of crypto trading and its push into blockchain-based remittances in 2025 position the company to capitalize on two of fintech's fastest-growing trends. With a $49 billion global blockchain fintech market projected by 2030, SoFi's strategic pivot could transform it from a niche player in digital banking to a leader in the next era of financial services.  

The Crypto Relaunch: Reclaiming a Niche MarketSoFi's decision to reintroduce spot trading for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) by year-end 2025 isn't just a return to past popularity—it's a calculated play to attract a younger, tech-savvy demographic. The relaunch comes with plans to expand into stablecoins, staking, and crypto-collateralized lending over the next 24 months. These features align with a growing demand for crypto integration into everyday financial tools.  

 

For context, SoFi's stock jumped over 2% on June 25, 2025, after announcing these plans, signaling investor optimism. But the real opportunity lies in user growth. Younger investors, who prioritize app-based simplicity and exposure to digital assets, could flock to SoFi's platform. This demographic is also more likely to engage with multiple financial services—lending, savings, and insurance—thereby boosting cross-selling opportunities.  

Blockchain Remittances: Tapping into a $93 Billion U.S. MarketSoFi's blockchain-powered remittance service isn't just a side project—it's a direct attack on traditional banking inefficiencies. By leveraging blockchain for near-instant transfers with transparent fees, SoFi aims to undercut legacy players like Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram (MGI). The U.S. alone sends $93 billion annually in remittances, primarily to Latin America and Asia, with global remittances exceeding $800 billion (per 2023 World Bank data).  

The service's 24/7 accessibility and support for stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to fiat—eliminate the need for currency conversion fees. For example, a Mexican immigrant in California could send USD or a USD-pegged stablecoin to a relative in Mexico City, with funds arriving in minutes rather than days. This service isn't just cost-effective; it's a gateway to deeper customer relationships. Users who send remittances via SoFi may also adopt its savings accounts, loans, or investment products, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem.  

 

Regulatory Tailwinds and Strategic InfrastructureSoFi's comeback is enabled by shifting regulatory sands. The OCC's March and May 2025 interpretive letters (1183 and 1184) explicitly permit national banks to engage in crypto custody and stablecoin activities—a green light for SoFi to operate without fear of regulatory overreach. This aligns with a broader trend under the Trump administration to foster innovation in financial services.  

Furthermore, SoFi's Galileo platform—its API-driven banking-as-a-service infrastructure—is now being opened to third-party developers. This could turn SoFi into a behind-the-scenes provider of blockchain infrastructure, akin to how Twilio (TWLO) dominates communications APIs. By monetizing its technology stack, SoFi could diversify revenue beyond its core customer base.  

The Ecosystem Play: From Banking to Blockchain HubSoFi's vision isn't limited to crypto trading or remittances. CEO Anthony Noto aims to integrate blockchain into every facet of its offerings, from crypto-collateralized loans to blockchain-backed insurance products. Imagine using Bitcoin as collateral for a mortgage or a savings account that earns yield via staking. This holistic approach could make SoFi the “Swiss Army knife” of digital finance, reducing customer churn and boosting lifetime value.  

Financially, SoFi's first-quarter 2025 results—$71 million net income and $772 million revenue—suggest it's already on solid footing. Adding crypto and remittance fees to its revenue streams could accelerate growth.  

Risks and ConsiderationsNo crypto play is without risks. Volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices could deter risk-averse users. Regulatory uncertainty, though diminished, remains a wildcard. Competitors like Block (SQ) and Coinbase (COIN) are also vying for crypto dominance. However, SoFi's existing user base of 2.5 million+ and its vertically integrated banking model give it a leg up.  

Investment Thesis: A Stock Poised for Multiples ExpansionSoFi's moves address two critical pain points: stagnant user growth and reliance on fee-based banking. Crypto and remittances could add millions of new users and billions in revenue. If successful, SoFi's valuation multiple—currently trading at roughly 2.5x revenue—could expand to match fintech peers like PayPal (PYPL), which trades at ~5x revenue.  

For investors, SOFI's stock represents a bet on two trends: the mainstreaming of crypto and the dominance of all-in-one fintech platforms. The near-term catalysts—crypto trading relaunch and remittance rollout—make 2025 a pivotal year. While risks exist, the upside for a company primed to lead the next wave of financial innovation is compelling.  

Final Take: SoFi's crypto pivot isn't just a comeback—it's a blueprint for fintech leadership. Investors who believe in a future where crypto and blockchain are mainstream should consider SoFi as a core holding in their tech portfolios.

NFT projects lost roughly $1 million in crypto over the past week when hackers posed as IT staff and struck at the heart of minting systems. The breach hit fan-token marketplace Favrr and Web3 initiatives Replicandy and ChainSaw, among others.

According to onchain investigator and cybersecurity analyst ZackXBT, the attackers pushed out mass batches of NFTs, drove floor prices to zero, then cashed in their haul before teams could react.

Based on reports, the group quietly joined development squads under false identities. They gained insider access to minting contracts. Then they minted thousands of tokens and NFTs in moments.

The sudden flood crushed floor prices and let the thieves grab hot cash in minutes. It all unfolded in under a week, and about $1 million vanished from these projects' treasuries.

Favrr suffered one of the biggest hits. The thieves dumped tokens so fast the market couldn't catch up. Replicandy and ChainSaw saw similar moves. At Replicandy, floor values hit zero almost instantly.

ChainSaw's stolen crypto still sits inactive in wallets, waiting for launderers to stir it back into exchanges. ZackXBT pointed out that nested services then further obscured the money trail.

4/ In total I estimate $310K+ from their projects was stolen and transferred primarily between the three address below.

Onchain transfers moved funds through multiple exchanges and wallets. Analysts say tracing mixed outputs can take weeks. Exchanges must review huge logs.

That slows or even blocks law enforcement from locking down accounts. In the Coinbase data leak back in May 2025, about 69,461 customers had personal info exposed.

Contractors were bribed to hand over user data, leading to an extortion bid against the exchange.

The NFT/Web3 insider episode echoes Ruby Sleet's tactics. In November 2024, that group targeted aerospace and defense firms, then shifted to IT companies via fake hiring drives.

They used social engineering to plant malware and harvest credentials. Today's blockchain and NFT hacks show that open and irreversible ledgers magnify mistakes. When insiders gain privileges, there's often no undo button.

Security experts warn teams to rethink trust models. Zero‑trust approaches limit each engineer's reach. Multi‑party approval gates could block sudden minting spikes.

Real‑time activity monitors can flag odd behavior right away. And code reviews paired with identity checks for every new hire help close gaps before they're abused.

Pudgy Penguins token has rebounded in the past few days after crossing a crucial resistance level and as its NFT sales rose.

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) price rose to a high of $0.01450 on Saturday, June 28, its highest level since May 23. It has jumped by 52% from its lowest point last week and 232% above its lowest point this year.

PENGU token jumped as third-party data showed that Pudgy Penguins' non-fungible token sales bounced back in the past seven days. Data compiled by CryptoSlam revealed that these sales jumped by 38% to $1.5 million. 

There were 68 transactions, up by 36% from the previous week. Similarly, the number of buyers and sellers rose by 48% and 32%, respectively. 

Pudgy Penguins ranked as the tenth most popular NFT collection in this period. It was overtaken by other collections like CryptoPunks, PGNFT, STRAT Option, and Gods Unchained.

Additional data indicates that its monthly sales decreased by 33% to $5.6 million, resulting in an all-time volume of over $636 million. 

PENGU price also jumped as whales and public figures bought during the recent dip, and exchange outflows rose. These public figures hold 301.7 million tokens, a 5.6% increase in the last 30 days. Whales hold 1.89 billion tokens, a 13% monthly increase, a sgn that they expect the price to keep rising. 

PENGU price also jumped as the supply of these tokens plunged to 14.7 billion, down from 15.6 billion on June 12. A drop in exchange reserves is bullish for an asset because it is a sign that investors are not selling their tokens.

The daily chart indicates that the PENGU price has rebounded over the past few days. This rebound happened after it formed a descending channel, which coincided with the higher highs and lower highs since May 14.

It has moved above the channel's upper side and the 25-period Exponential Moving Average. The Percentage Price Oscillator has moved above the zero line, a sign that it is gaining momentum.

Therefore, the token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance level at $0.01742, the highest point on May 12. A drop below the support at $0.100 will invalidate the bullish forecast.

Immutable X (IMX) is the native utility Ethereum-based token of the Immutable X platform, which is a layer-2 scaling solution for NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). 





	 Immutable X platform is designed to facilitate fast and gas-free trading of NFTs on the Ethereum network. 



	 It uses ZK-Rollups, a type of Layer-2 solution, to aggregate multiple transactions into a single proof. This significantly reduces the load on the Ethereum mainnet, making it more scalable for NFT transactions.



	 With Immutable X, users can trade NFTs on the platform without paying gas fees. The gas fees are paid in IMX tokens and are subsidized by the platform's ecosystem.



	 By using ZK-Rollups, Immutable X achieves faster transaction times compared to traditional Ethereum transactions. Users can experience near-instant settlement times for NFT trades.



	 While Immutable X operates as a Layer-2 solution, it still leverages the security of the Ethereum mainnet through the use of Zero-Knowledge proofs. This ensures the integrity of NFT transactions.



	 Moreover, NFTs minted on Immutable X are still ERC-721 compliant, which means they remain compatible with other Ethereum-based platforms and wallets.

Platform Stats (as of mid‑2024)

53,000+ user wallets

Approximately $1.95 million in total marketplace volume

 

Despite these successes, Momint struggled with unsustainable operating costs and limited user growth beyond its early adopters. In its closure announcement, the team cited challenges with fundraising in the current market environment and shifting regulatory headwinds as key reasons for shutting down.

The shutdown underscores the volatility of Web3 ventures in Africa and the broader challenge of building sustainable platforms in a still-nascent ecosystem. While Momint helped prove that there is real creator demand for digital ownership, it also shows that scaling such products into profitable businesses remains tough.

[ccpw id=""39382""]

Date: 

Written By: 





XRP may have the potential to reach three-digit prices if it becomes the go-to bridge currency for CBDCs globally.

Notably, XRP trades at $2.19 today, up over 3% this past week. However, despite the current position, many investors still see it as undervalued. This is due to its growing utility in real-world payments, especially the possibility that it could serve as a bridge currency for central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs.

Amid the growing momentum behind CBDC development, there is a rise in demand for a fast, neutral asset that can connect different currencies across borders. 

For context, more than 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are actively researching or testing CBDCs. As a result, several industry commentators have pointed to XRP, with its speed and low transaction cost, as a possible candidate to bridge these CBDCs when they launch.

However, the impact on price remains uncertain. To explore what XRP could be worth if it took on the role of a global CBDC bridge, we asked ChatGPT for an estimate based on market data and reasonable assumptions.

In its evaluation, ChatGPT presented three factors: transaction volume, liquidity needs, and XRP's supply. Today, the foreign exchange market sees more than $7.5 trillion move every day. If XRP powered just 1% to 3% of CBDC-related flows within that market, it could settle between $75 billion and $225 billion daily.

Notably, supporting that level of volume would require strong liquidity. Analysts often calculate liquidity demand using a simple formula: divide the daily transaction volume by how many times each XRP moves in a day. 

If each XRP moves five times daily, and the volume reaches $100 billion, the system would need $20 billion worth of XRP available at any given time. Spread across the current circulating supply of 55 billion XRP, this creates a base price of around $0.36 per token just to meet liquidity needs.

However, that is only part of the assessment. According to ChatGPT, that figure does not reflect market dynamics like speculation, holding, or growing scarcity. Taking those into account, ChatGPT projected a range of potential prices. 

Specifically, with basic adoption as a bridge currency, XRP could rise to somewhere between $10 and $20. If global usage expands and demand for liquidity rises, the price might reach $50 to $100. And if XRP sees wide adoption, lower velocity, and reduced supply, the price could jump to $120 or even cross $500 in the most bullish scenario.

Nonetheless, ChatGPT stressed that all of this depends on factors such as regulatory approval, large-scale adoption, and real-world use working together. While that remains uncertain, the XRPL's momentum in the CBDC space continues to grow.

Several national banks and global financial bodies already use the XRP Ledger in pilot programs. Ripple has teamed up with countries like Palau, Bhutan, Georgia, and Montenegro. While these projects do not rely on XRP itself, their use of a private ledger similar to the XRPL indicates the network's appeal for CBDCs.

XRP may have the potential to reach three-digit prices if it becomes the go-to bridge currency for CBDCs globally.

Notably, XRP trades at $2.19 today, up over 3% this past week. However, despite the current position, many investors still see it as undervalued. This is due to its growing utility in real-world payments, especially the possibility that it could serve as a bridge currency for central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs.

Amid the growing momentum behind CBDC development, there is a rise in demand for a fast, neutral asset that can connect different currencies across borders. 

For context, more than 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are actively researching or testing CBDCs. As a result, several industry commentators have pointed to XRP, with its speed and low transaction cost, as a possible candidate to bridge these CBDCs when they launch.

However, the impact on price remains uncertain. To explore what XRP could be worth if it took on the role of a global CBDC bridge, we asked ChatGPT for an estimate based on market data and reasonable assumptions.

In its evaluation, ChatGPT presented three factors: transaction volume, liquidity needs, and XRP's supply. Today, the foreign exchange market sees more than $7.5 trillion move every day. If XRP powered just 1% to 3% of CBDC-related flows within that market, it could settle between $75 billion and $225 billion daily.

Notably, supporting that level of volume would require strong liquidity. Analysts often calculate liquidity demand using a simple formula: divide the daily transaction volume by how many times each XRP moves in a day. 

If each XRP moves five times daily, and the volume reaches $100 billion, the system would need $20 billion worth of XRP available at any given time. Spread across the current circulating supply of 55 billion XRP, this creates a base price of around $0.36 per token just to meet liquidity needs.

However, that is only part of the assessment. According to ChatGPT, that figure does not reflect market dynamics like speculation, holding, or growing scarcity. Taking those into account, ChatGPT projected a range of potential prices. 

Specifically, with basic adoption as a bridge currency, XRP could rise to somewhere between $10 and $20. If global usage expands and demand for liquidity rises, the price might reach $50 to $100. And if XRP sees wide adoption, lower velocity, and reduced supply, the price could jump to $120 or even cross $500 in the most bullish scenario.

Patricia Clarke

Technology Reporter

On the evening of ﻿22 May, the biggest investors in the $Trump memecoin – the US president's personal crypto token – descended on the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia for an exclusive black-tie event.

Invited guests were the top 220 $Trump holders. Blockchain analysis suggests that more than half were probably foreign investors who had collectively poured millions into the token. “What's happening tonight at Trump's golf course … is in effect putting a ‘for sale' sign on the White House,” said Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal﻿ to reporters before the event, who called it “corruption”. The White House rejected the claim.

So did Justin Sun, the coin's largest investor. “All the haters need to really pay attention,” said Sun ﻿on the ﻿CoinDesk website the following day, denying that he was buying access to the president. “There are positive things happening in the [crypto] industry.” Later, he posted a picture of himself on social media, fist in the air, standing in front of the American flag. On his wrist was a $100,000 watch made of 18-carat gold. The caption read: “I was awarded a Trump Golden Tourbillon watch by Trump!”

Sun, a 34-year-old billionaire worth about $8.5﻿bn from crypto ventures, including the blockchain platform Tron, reportedly invested $20m﻿ in the memecoin to secure his place at the dinner. He had already poured a separate $75m into the Trump family's crypto ﻿company World Liberty Financial (WLF). In February, five weeks after ﻿Trump became president, the US securities regulator shelved a 2023 civil fraud case against Sun that could have cost him millions in fines and repayments.

Since February, Sun's business ties with the Trumps have deepened, even as questions surrounding his crypto empire remain unanswered. The entrepreneur is alleged to have made billions by finding ways around rules, selling hype and pushing the boundaries of the law. But instead of facing greater scrutiny, it appears Sun now finds himself closer than ever to the seat of American power.

In June, WLF moved its stablecoin – a type of digital token tied to real-world currency – on to Tron's blockchain network, positioning Tron to make millions in transaction fees. Because WLF collects interest on the money backing the stablecoin, the president himself stands to profit from the deal too.

And ﻿reports recently emerged that Sun was taking Tron public in the US through a merger with the Nasdaq-listed company SRM Entertainment. The deal was orchestrated by Dominari Securities, an investment bank with ties to Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump. The Financial Times reported that Eric Trump was expected to take up a role at the new company – Tron Inc – though he later said on social media that he had no “public involvement” in the project.

“It is a potentially dangerous situation for the ﻿US and for the global economy when the government, which should be regulating the crypto industry, is being led by a president who has very close financial ties to individuals in the crypto industry”, said Richard Painter, chief White House ­ethics lawyer under George W Bush, about the Trump family's relationship with Sun. The White House has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest.

Sources, including former colleagues of Sun's, as well as financial and legal experts, paint a complicated picture of the crypto mogul. They call him a brilliant but money-obsessed opportunist﻿ who has made his fortune by always being in the right place at the right time. They view Sun as a man looking for ways around rules and seeking to gain access to power. He has sought to do so again with the Trump administration.

The Observer sent Sun requests for comment via email, Telegram and LinkedIn regarding the claims in this article. He did not respond.

Sun's infatuation with Donald Trump began when he was in secondary school. He told Forbes that, as a teenager in Huizhou in China, he downloaded hundreds of episodes of The Apprentice on BitTorrent – a file-sharing platform he would later acquire – to help improve his English.

The reality show, ﻿hosted by Trump for 14 seasons, which saw contestants battle through business challenges, left a lasting impression on him. As China embraced market reforms and a new wave of consumerism in the early ﻿00s, The Apprentice offered a seductive model of ambition, self-branding and western capitalist success.

After graduating from Peking University, Sun moved to the US in 2011 to pursue a master's degree. There he discovered bitcoin, spending night and day on crypto forums and becoming excited by the concept of digital currency as “money for the future”.

His growing expertise led to a position at the crypto company Ripple Labs (now Ripple), advising on its expansion into China. Around the same time, in 2013, Sun founded the dating app Peiwo, a cross between Tinder and a chatroom, where users could send each other voice notes. The app drew millions of people, but faced scrutiny from Chinese authorities when they began uploading sexually explicit audio.

Peiwo was eventually shut down by regulators for hosting content that “disrupts socialist values”, but by that point Sun had already made his millions. In 2017, he founded Tron﻿ and a year later he acquired BitTorrent﻿ for ﻿about $140m﻿. According to colleagues, Sun was by ﻿then a flamboyant millionaire who liked to flaunt his wealth. He walked around the office in squeaky-clean Gucci trainers and, according to a report from the Verge website, employees were baffled to see piles of cash pile up on the desk in his glass-walled office.

‘The government that should be regulating crypto is being led by a president with financial ties to it'

Richard Painter, lawyer

“ He's not a very technical person,” said one former colleague. Instead, like Trump, Sun's gift was showmanship. He built his crypto empire mostly by imitating the business strategies of other first movers and presenting them as innovative. A Tron white paper published in 2018 contained entire sections copied from other decentralised crypto projects, published without credit. Sun blamed poor translation from Chinese.At Tron and BitTorrent, employees faced demanding conditions. In 2020, two former Tron employees filed a civil lawsuit against Sun, with allegations ranging from fraud to verbal and physical harassment. A separate lawsuit made similar allegations in 2021. On one occasion, a witness recalled seeing Sun allegedly strike a member of his engineering team.

The following year, Sun stepped down as chief executive of Tron to become ambassador and permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization. The details of his ambassadorship have not been made public; reports speculate that Sun paid to become a permanent citizen of the Caribbean nation. (Sun has also reportedly paid for, or attempted to pay for, citizenship in St Kitts and Nevis and Malta). According to legal documents seen by The Observer, Sun tried to get out of at least one lawsuit by claiming diplomatic immunity. The cases were heard in private and eventually settled. In 2022, the Verge reported that the US ﻿justice department had opened a ﻿probe into whether Sun had committed a number of crimes, including wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the ﻿US. No filings followed and, in April of this year, the Trump administration ordered prosecutors to limit their pursuit of cryptocurrency crimes. Sun has always denied any wrongdoing.

In the 2023 case that was﻿ shelved in February, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Sun and related entities, including the Tron Foundation and the BitTorrent Foundation, with fraud.

The civil lawsuit alleged they had sold crypto tokens as unregistered securities, manipulated their markets through wash trading﻿ and paid celebrities – including Lindsay Lohan, Soulja Boy and Jake Paul – to promote tokens without disclosure.

“It was one of the most flagrant set of allegations that the SEC made against a crypto market participant,” said Amanda Fischer, who was senior counsellor to the chair of the SEC during this period. At the time, Sun said the lawsuit “lack[ed] merit”, but he quietly stepped down from his ambassador position as a result of the investigation. Sources say he still demands that people refer to him as “his excellency”. 

If the lawsuits and investigations knocked Sun, he did﻿ not let it show. In November, before the SEC case was shelved, the billionaire went viral when he purchased a banana duct‑taped to a wall for $6.2m﻿ and later ate it. In the past year he has attended galas and graced the cover of Forbes, and is due to travel to space ﻿with Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin company next month.

Sun's businesses, too, remain largely untouched. In 2024, Tron hosted 58% of all illicit crypto activity – more than any other blockchain. Sun has previously said “criminals are drawn to the same features that make blockchain revolutionary – speed, efficiency, and borderless transactions”, and that Tron's “transparency actually makes it harder, not easier, to launder money”.

Tron will go public in the US in ﻿a reverse merger that allows Sun to bypass the detailed disclosures and regulations required in a traditional IPO. There is ﻿no evidence of wrongdoing when it comes to the Tron deal, but Painter, the former White House ethicist, said he believes the SEC should be carefully monitoring it.

Fischer, a former employee of the regulator, is doubtful that it will. “ I, frankly, don't know why the public would have trust in the agency any more to enforce the law without political favour,” she said.

“It's flagrant that the commission alleged that the Tron token was an unregistered security that was illegally touted by celebrities that didn't disclose they were being paid, that had wash trading, and now Justin Sun is endeavouring to create an exchange traded company that holds that very token, and that they're seeking to have that trade on the Nasdaq in affiliation with the president's family.

“I am almost at a loss for words,” Fischer added.

More than a quarter of South Koreans in their 20s to 50s now own digital assets, with their crypto investments making up 14% of their total financial portfolios, according to a new report from the Hana Institute of Finance released Sunday.

The study, titled 2050 Generation's Virtual Asset Investment Trends, shows that interest in crypto cuts across age groups. Those in their 40s led participation at 31%, followed by people in their 30s at 28% and 50s at 25%.

78% of respondents in their 50s said they use crypto as a way to amass funds, while 53% said they were preparing for retirement through crypto investments. More respondents now cite growth potential, diversification, and structured savings plans as key motivations for investing.

Meanwhile, 70% of respondents expressed interest in expanding crypto investments in the future. 42% said they would invest more if traditional financial institutions took a larger role in crypto markets, while 35% cited stronger legal protections as a key factor in boosting confidence.

Korean investors make regular crypto purchases

Investment patterns are also maturing. The proportion of investors making regular purchases rose from 10% to 34%, and mid-term trading increased from 26% to 47%, while short-term trading fell slightly.

The way investors get information is also changing. Per the report, reliance on word-of-mouth has declined, while the use of official exchanges and analytical platforms has risen.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the primary choice, with six in ten investors including BTC in their holdings. As experience grows, however, many diversify into altcoins or stablecoins. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and security tokens (STOs) remain niche, with nine in ten investors sticking exclusively to coins.

“Virtual assets play a major role within investors' portfolios,” said Yoon Sun-young, a researcher at Hana Financial Research Institute. “Investors expect legal institutionalization and expansion of the role of the existing financial sector.” 

A major pain point highlighted was the restriction preventing linking multiple bank accounts with crypto exchanges. Seven in ten investors said they would favor their primary bank if this rule were relaxed.

Concerns about market volatility remain widespread (56%), while worries over exchange or fraud risks were more pronounced among those hesitant to invest further.

Korea's crypto boom fueled by desperation

Last week, Eli Ilha Yune, chief product officer at Anzaetek, said the surge in crypto South Korea's crypto adoption isn't driven by optimism about blockchain technology.

Speaking at German Blockchain Week, Yune argued that many young Koreans are turning to crypto out of financial desperation, seeking quick profits rather than supporting Web3 ideals.

Youth unemployment in South Korea is a key factor, standing at 6.6%, more than double the national average. Yune explained that South Korea's once high-growth economy has stalled, leaving many young people jobless and unable to afford real estate or see meaningful returns from traditional investments like stocks.

Amid this economic pressure, crypto has become the only viable investment option for Korea's younger generation, according to Yune. He noted that while some young investors understand crypto's technology, many are unaware of its infrastructure.

 Human Rights Foundation's Alex Gladstein told a group of US political leaders that Bitcoin has “essentially saved” citizens living under dictatorships. 

A Human Rights Foundation executive told a room full of US politicians that Bitcoin continues to prove itself as a powerful tool against authoritarian control, offering an alternative to the mounting ways fiat currency can be manipulated and controlled.

“With Bitcoin, the ability of these leaders to do these things is completely decimated,” Human Rights Foundation chief strategy officer Alex Gladstein said at the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington, D.C. on Thursday.

“Bitcoin is bad for dictators,” he added.

Gladstein — who described the audience as a “hall full of American leaders” — explained that governments find it much harder to track individuals when Bitcoin (BTC) is used correctly. “If they use Bitcoin in the right way, without linking their ID to it,” he added.

Gladstein reiterated that people who keep control of their own wallets are protected from the many ways that dictators try to control people.

“If you're self-custoding your Bitcoin, governments can't delete or freeze your stuff, and they certainly can't hyperinflate you,” he said. Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, especially during hyperinflation, when prices rise quickly due to unstable economies.

Gladstein declared:

He said the Human Rights Foundation first recognized Bitcoin's potential in 2013, during Ukraine's pro-democracy protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych. 

He said many of the protestors had their bank accounts frozen, and they “wanted to do democracy work, which later ended up becoming Maidan Square.”

“This was very early in Bitcoin's life cycle; Bitcoin was worth like a hundred bucks at the time; we were very skeptical that this would work,” he said, adding that they were open-minded to the idea, and it ended up working.

“It got the value to them where traditional money couldn't go,” he said. Gladstein has served at the nonprofit organization since 2007.

The foundation is focused on promoting and protecting human rights globally — particularly in countries where its people live “under authoritarian rule.”

 ETF analyst Eric Balchunas says REX Shares' latest Solana staking ETF filing with the SEC suggests the product is ready launch any day now. 

ETF provider REX Shares is on the verge of launching the first-ever Solana staking exchange-traded fund (ETF), following what analysts describe as a successful response to feedback from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

“Rex also filed an updated prospectus, which totally filled in. Add it all up, and it appears as though all systems go for imminent launch,” ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post on Friday.

ETF Store president Nate Geraci said in an X post on the same day that it looks like the SEC are open to REX Shares incredibly rare c-corp business structure used in the fund, which the SEC previously argued conflicts with the 6C-11 rule, also known as “the ETF rule.” 

“Looks like they're comfortable pushing forward w/ their creative ‘40 Act structure,” Geraci said. “Here we go,” he added. 

He previously said on May 29 that REX Shares had taken “the regulatory end-around” with this approach.

Echoing Geraci's sentiment, ETF analyst James Seyffart said the way that REX Shares structured their Solana (SOL) staking ETF proposal was “very rare in the ETF world” as it bypasses the standard 19b-4 filing process that most other crypto ETF providers have used for staking proposals, which are all still awaiting a decision from the SEC.

Geraci said, “Looks like they believe comments have been resolved.”

“Crypto ETF summer commences,” he added. 

Balchunas cited an email screenshot to confirm that REX Shares have addressed the SEC's comments.

“So they are good to launch, it looks like. Wow,” Balchunas added.

In a post on the same day, REX Shares said that “the first-ever staked crypto ETF” in the US is coming soon.

REX Shares explained that its REX-Osprey SOL and staking ETF is designed to track the performance of Solana while generating yield through onchain staking.

“A new era of yield-generating crypto exposure is here,” REX Shares said.

Staking has been a long-awaited feature by many ETF spectators in the industry.

On March 20, BlackRock's head of digital assets, Robbie Mitchnick, described the firm's Ether ETF as a “tremendous success” but acknowledged that the ETF is “less perfect” without staking.

 Kenya's crypto startups fear a Binance-linked lobby group could tilt new regulations in the exchange's favor under the proposed VASP bill. 

Some crypto startups are raising concerns over Kenya's proposed virtual asset service providers (VASP) Bill, warning it could hand outsized influence to a Binance-linked lobby group, potentially undermining fair competition in the country's digital asset industry.

According to disclosures seen by The Kenyan Wall Street, a private think tank called the Virtual Asset Chamber of Commerce (VAC) will be included on the regulatory board established under the draft law.

Some crypto stakeholders in Kenya claim that VAC has run Binance-sponsored regulatory talks, lacks independence and acts as a proxy for the exchange.

“All regulation convos by VAC that happened recently have been sponsored by Binance. Then VAC, a private consulting entity, with a non-compete with Binance ‘magically' gets a regulatory seat? How is this fair? How is this constitutional?” one stakeholder told The Kenyan Wall Street.

The report claimed that Binance pays VAC $6,000 per country each month for policy advocacy, citing a confidential agreement. This raises fears that the lobby group could skew Kenya's crypto rules to benefit Binance and sideline local players.

Critics also reportedly noted similarities with VAC's reported attempts to insert itself into Rwanda's regulatory process.

“If an entity of poor international reputation or one with clear conflict of interest becomes our crypto regulator, Kenya shall never leave FATF and EU greylists,” warned another stakeholder.

In a comment to The Kenyan Wall Street, VAC's director Basil Ogolla defended VAC's role, pointing out its two-year campaign of consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and Parliament.

“The National Assembly's decision to include VAC as a nominator in the regulatory board reflects the trust and confidence built through this track record of meaningful engagement,” Ogolla reportedly said.

Notably, the new regulatory body in Kenya will also include representatives from the National Treasury, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), along with a lawyer and an accountant.

Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment but had not received a response by publication.

In May, Binance signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Kyrgyzstan's National Agency for Investments to introduce crypto payment infrastructure and blockchain education in the country.

In an interview on April 17, CEO Richard Teng revealed that Binance is actively advising several governments on building strategic Bitcoin reserves and crafting crypto policies.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng said.

Earlier, on April 7, former CEO Changpeng Zhao was named an adviser to Pakistan's newly launched Crypto Council, which will oversee the country's blockchain and digital asset initiatives.

India's population is genetically one of the most diverse in the world, yet it remains underrepresented in global datasets. In a study publishing in the Cell Press journal Cell, researchers analyzed genomic data from more than 2,700 people from across India, capturing genetic variation from most geographic regions, linguistic groups, and communities. They found that most modern-day Indian people's ancestry can be traced back to Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers.

""This study fills a critical gap and reshapes our understanding of how ancient migrations, archaic admixture, and social structures have shaped Indian genetic variation,"" says senior author Priya Moorjani of the University of California, Berkeley. ""Studying these subpopulations allows us to explore how ancient ancestry, geography, language, and social practices interacted to shape genetic variation. We hope our study will provide a deeper understanding of the origin of functional variation and inform precision health strategies in India.""

The researchers used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) and generated whole-genome sequences from 2,762 individuals in India, including people who spoke a range of different languages. They used these data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of India over the past 50,000 years at fine scale, showing how history impacts adaptation and disease in present-day Indians. They showed that most Indians derive ancestry from populations related to three ancestral groups: Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers.

""In India, genetic and linguistic variation often go hand in hand, shaped by ancient migrations and social practices,"" says lead author Elise Kerdoncuff of UC-Berkeley. ""Ensuring linguistic variation among the people whose genomes we include helps prevent biased interpretations of genetic patterns and uncover functional variation related to all major communities to inform both evolutionary research and future biomedical surveys.""

One of the key goals of the study was to understand how India's complex population history has shaped genetic variation related to disease. In India, many subpopulations have an increased risk of recessive genetic disorders, which is due largely to historical isolation and marrying within communities.

Another focus was on the impact of archaic hominin ancestry -- specifically, Neanderthal and Denisovan -- on disease susceptibility. For example, some of the genes inherited from these archaic groups have an impact on immune functions.

""One of the most striking and unexpected findings was that India harbors the highest variation in Neanderthal ancestry among non-Africans,"" says co-lead author Laurits Skov, also of UC-Berkeley. ""This allowed us to reconstruct around 50% of the Neanderthal genome and 20% of the Denisovan genome from Indian individuals, more than any other previous archaic ancestry study.""

One constraint of this work was the limited availability of ancient DNA from South and Central Asia. As more ancient genomes become available, the researchers will be able to refine this work and identify the source of Neolithic Iranian farmer and Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in contemporary Indians. They also plan to continue studying the LASI-DAD cohort to enable a closer look at the source of the genetic adaptations and disease variants across India.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Brain scan breakthrough reveals why Parkinson's drugs don't always work","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250629033415.htm","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 08:37:35 GMT","

Simon Fraser University researchers are using a new approach to brain imaging that could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's disease.

The new study, published in the journal Movement Disorders, looks at why levodopa - the main drug used in dopamine replacement therapy - is sometimes less effective in patients.

The drug is typically prescribed to help reduce the movement symptoms associated with the neurodegenerative disorder.

While it is effective in improving symptoms for the vast majority of patients, not everyone experiences the same level of benefit.

In order to find out why this is the case, an SFU collaboration with researchers in Sweden has used magnetoencephalography (MEG) technology to determine how the drug affects signals in the brain.

""Parkinson's is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and it is the most rapidly increasing, in terms of incidence,"" says Alex Wiesman, assistant professor in biomedical physiology and kinesiology at SFU.

""Treating this disease, both in terms of helping people with their symptoms, but also trying to find ways to reverse the effects, is becoming more and more important.

""If clinicians can see how levodopa activates certain parts of the brain in a patient, it can help to inform a more personalised approach to treatment.""

The study was a collaboration with researchers at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who used MEG to collect data from 17 patients with Parkinson's disease - a relatively small sample size.

Researchers mapped participants' brain signals before and after taking the drug, in order to see how and where the drug impacted brain activity.

MEG is an advanced non-invasive technology that measures the magnetic fields produced by the brain's electrical signals.

It can help clinicians and researchers to study brain disorders and diseases, including brain injuries, tumors, epilepsy, autism, mental illness and more.

Using this rare brain imaging technology, Wiesman and team developed a new analysis that lets them ""search"" the brain for off-target drug effects.

""With this new way of analyzing brain imaging data, we can track in real time whether or not the drug is affecting the right brain regions and helping patients to manage their symptoms,"" says Wiesman.

""What we found was that there's sometimes 'off target' effects of the drug. In other words, we could see the drug activating brain regions we don't want to be activating and that's getting in the way of the helpful effects.

""We found that those people who showed 'off target' effects are still being helped by the drug, but not to the same extent as others.""

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning parts of the brain become progressively damaged over time. It affects predominately the dopamine-producing neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra.

People with Parkinson's disease may experience a range of movement-related symptoms, such as tremors, slow movement, stiffness and balance problems.

Wiesman hopes that a better understanding of how levodopa affects an individual's brain signals could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's.

""This might be really helpful for tracking individualized responses to these types of drugs and helping with prescribing and therapeutics,"" he says.

""So maybe we try different medications, maybe we adjust dosages differently. And this helps clinicians get at that question of how we prescribe personalized medicine in a way that really helps the patient.

""The more we can personalize that approach, make it more expedient, make it a bit more specific to that person, the better.""

This new type of brain imaging analysis is not only for studying Parkinson's disease; any medications that affect brain signaling can be studied using the method developed by Wiesman and colleagues.

SFU's ImageTech Lab, at the Surrey Memorial Hospital, is home to the only MEG in western Canada.

""We have this really fantastic technology right here at SFU, and combined with the new analysis approaches that we're developing, it gives us a really unprecedented look into what's happening in the brain,"" says Wiesman.

""We can use this technology moving forward to study Parkinson's disease in ways that no one has ever done before worldwide.

""Our next step is to take our new approach and apply it to a larger patient group. We also need to translate this research to more accessible brain imaging methods, like electroencephalogram (EEG).

""Ultimately, we want to make sure this technology is useful for a diverse population and more widely accessible to patients with Parkinson's disease.""

A team of researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC's Mark and Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute (Stevens INI) has identified a new brain imaging benchmark that may improve how researchers classify biologically meaningful changes associated with Alzheimer's disease, especially in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White populations. The new study, published in Imaging Neuroscience, is part of the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD), a multi-university collaboration led by the University of North Texas Health Science Center and supported by the National Institute on Aging.

Using an advanced brain imaging scan called tau PET, the research team studied over 675 older adults from HABS-HD, aiming to identify the optimal brain signal that distinguishes individuals with clinically-relevant biological markers of AD from those who are aging normally.

Tau PET enables researchers to visualize abnormal proteins in the brain which contribute to Alzheimer's disease, known as tau, by using a small amount of a special radioactive tracer that highlights areas where tau has accumulated. With these scans, researchers can establish tau cut-points, a new type of biomarker used to determine whether a scan shows an amount of tau protein in the brain high enough to suggest possible early signs of Alzheimer's disease or related conditions. This new benchmark could eventually inform the way clinicians interpret tau PET scans and better identify who may be at risk for AD.

In this study, researchers compared tau PET scans of study participants who were cognitively impaired with those who were not impaired based on cognitive tests to establish a tau cut-point that would indicate a higher risk for Alzheimer's disease. They found one -- but it was only effective in certain circumstances.

""Our tau cut-point was able to distinguish whether study participants had cognitive impairment - but only when another abnormal protein, amyloid, was also present in those with cognitive impairment, and only in Hispanic and non-Hispanic White participants,"" said senior author Meredith N. Braskie, PhD, assistant professor of neurology. ""In non-Hispanic Black participants, the tau cut-point did not perform as expected. This suggests that other pathologies or conditions may be driving cognitive decline in this group. Our study is an important step toward better understanding how tau relates to cognition in diverse populations and has important implications for future clinical trials that aim to target tau.""

The team used a new imaging tracer called 18F-PI-2620, to measure tau protein buildup in the brain. They found that when tau levels in the medial temporal lobe­ -- a region deep in the brain -- exceeded a certain threshold, it strongly indicated cognitive impairment related to AD.

""While our findings support prior research linking medial temporal lobe tau to cognitive impairment, establishing a cut-point in this region using 18F-PI-2620, marks an important step toward defining tau positivity for both research and clinical applications. At the same time, the limited reliability of tau as an indicator of cognitive impairment in non-Hispanic Black participants highlights the need for more diverse populations in research and for future studies to examine both biological and social determinants of Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead author Victoria R. Tennant, a PhD candidate in USC's Neuroscience Graduate Program.

The findings reflect a growing focus in AD research on making sure diagnostic tools work for everyone -- not just in narrow clinical trial populations. Alzheimer's disease is known to affect the brain in stages. While amyloid plaques often build up early, tau tangles are more closely tied to memory loss and other symptoms.

""This type of imaging is critical for understanding who is at risk and how the disease develops,"" said Stevens INI director Arthur W. Toga, PhD. ""These findings are just the latest to come from HABS-HD, which is the most comprehensive study of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in diverse communities. HABS-HD has already produced key findings related to ethnic variations in AD biomarkers, the influences of social determinants on cognitive health, and vascular contributions to dementia, just to name a few. We hope this work will lead to more personalized care and better outcomes for all communities.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New Orleans is sinking—and so are its $15 billion flood defenses","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250627234122.htm","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 03:55:15 GMT","

Parts of New Orleans and its surrounding wetlands are gradually sinking, and while most of the city remains stable, a new study from Tulane University researchers suggests that sections of the region's $15 billion post-Katrina flood protection system may need regular upgrades to outpace long-term land subsidence.

The study, published in Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track subtle shifts in ground elevation across Greater New Orleans between 2002 and 2020. The study found that some neighborhoods, wetlands and even sections of floodwalls are sinking by more than an inch per year -- with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters (nearly 2 inches) of elevation loss annually.

""In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,"" said Simone Fiaschi, lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira.

The findings underscore how both natural and human-driven forces are reshaping the city's landscape. Causes of the sinking -- known as subsidence -- include natural soil compaction, groundwater pumping, industrial development and the legacy of wetland drainage for urban growth.

The study used a remote sensing technique called InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar), which detects millimeter-scale changes in land surface elevation by comparing satellite radar images taken over time. This allowed the researchers to build the most detailed map yet of vertical land motion in New Orleans -- including areas like wetlands that had previously lacked reliable data.

Among the most troubling findings: some of the concrete floodwalls and levees built to protect the city after Katrina are themselves sinking. In a few cases, parts of the Hurricane and Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) are losing elevation faster than sea levels are rising, reducing their capacity to block storm surges.

""These results are a wake-up call,"" said co-author Prof. Mead Allison, also of Tulane. ""We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.""

The study also found pockets of sinking around industrial sites, the airport and newer residential developments -- areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors. In contrast, some areas such as parts of Michoud showed modest land uplift, likely due to the halt of industrial groundwater pumping and recovery of the water table.

Wetlands east of the city, long known for their ecological importance, are also sinking rapidly in places. In some spots, the loss of elevation could transform marshes into open water within a decade if trends continue. This has implications not just for wildlife but also for storm protection, as wetlands help buffer storm surges.

New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on an elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals to keep water out. As sea levels rise and the ground sinks, the margin for error narrows.

Experts say that without sustained monitoring, including satellite data and ground-based measurements, it's difficult to know where to reinforce levees or how to plan for future storms.

""This research shows that land movement isn't uniform, and understanding these patterns is crucial for protecting lives and property in a city where inches truly matter,"" Fiaschi said. ""However, it's crucial to remember that our results still require careful ground-truthing. This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.""

The study highlights the potential of satellite monitoring to guide infrastructure maintenance and urban planning, not just in New Orleans but in coastal cities worldwide facing similar challenges.

PTEN Connection to Autism: Up to 25% of those with brain overgrowth and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) carry variations in a gene called PTEN; PTEN-deficient mouse models exhibit ASD-like characteristics Cell-type Specific Model: PTEN loss in specific neurons leads to circuit imbalance and altered behavior Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance: Strengthened excitatory drive and loss of local inhibitory connections in an amygdala circuit Behavioral effects: This circuit imbalance results in increased fear learning and anxiety in mice -- core traits seen in ASD. Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have discovered how loss of a gene strongly associated with autism and macrocephaly (large head size) rewires circuits and alters behavior. Their findings, published in Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience, reveal specific circuit changes in the amygdala resulting from PTEN loss in inhibitory neurons, providing new insights into the underlying circuit alterations that contribute to heightened fear and anxiety.

PTEN has emerged as one of the most significant autism risk genes. Variations in this gene are found in a significant proportion of people with autism who also exhibit brain overgrowth, making it a key player in understanding differences in brain function. To investigate the impact of PTEN misregulation, researchers have turned to animal models, where global reduction of PTEN results in altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and increased anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans.

But understanding how PTEN dysfunction results in specific circuit and behavioral changes has been difficult in animal models that disrupt PTEN throughout the nervous system. Therefore, MPFI research group leader Dr. McLean Bolton and her team have focused on the changes in the central lateral amygdala driven by loss of PTEN in a critical neuronal population -- somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons.

Alterations in the function of inhibitory neurons in the development of ASD have been seen through both human tissue studies and genetic mouse models. Moreover, the PTEN gene is known to regulate the development of inhibitory neurons. Therefore, a cell-type-specific disruption of PTEN in inhibitory neurons was a valuable target for understanding specific circuit changes associated with ASD.

""Although a cell-type specific disruption does not replicate the genome-wide changes seen in humans, it is essential to examine how genetic risk factors operate within distinct neural circuits,"" explained Dr. Bolton. ""Understanding these mechanisms is a crucial step toward targeted interventions for specific traits such as severe anxiety.""

The team, led by Dr. Tim Holford, combined a genetic model that disrupted PTEN only in somatostatin-containing inhibitory neurons with a unique circuit mapping approach previously developed in the lab. This approach measured the electrical responses of individual neurons to the sequential optogenetic activation of hundreds of nearby neurons, allowing rapid mapping of connectivity and strength with the precision of electrical recordings and the scale of imaging approaches.

""This is a powerful method that we can use to determine changes in local neuron connectivity and strength resulting from genetic variations. We were interested in uncovering how the disruption of PTEN signaling in a single cell type would change the way the brain processes information and contribute to the broad ASD phenotype,"" described Dr. Holford.

The scientists focused on the circuits in the central amygdala (CeL) - a brain region known to serve as an inhibitory gate on the downstream expression of fear responses - and found striking results. Deleting PTEN specifically in somatostatin-containing interneurons disrupted local inhibitory connectivity in the CeL by roughly 50% and reduced the strength of the inhibitory connections that remained. This diminished connectivity between inhibitory connections within the CeL was contrasted by an increase in the strength of excitatory inputs received from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a nearby brain region that relays emotionally-relevant sensory information to the CeL.

Behavioral analysis of the genetic model demonstrated that this imbalance in neural signaling was linked to heightened anxiety and increased fear learning, but not alterations in social behavior or repetitive behavior traits commonly observed in ASD. The results not only confirm that PTEN loss in this specific cell type is sufficient to induce specific ASD-like behaviors, but also provide one of the most detailed maps to date of how local inhibitory networks in the amygdala are affected by genetic variations associated with neurological disorders. Importantly, the altered circuitry did not affect all ASD-relevant behaviors -- social interactions remained largely intact -- suggesting that PTEN-related anxiety and fear behaviors may stem from specific microcircuit changes.

As Dr. Holford explains, ""By teasing out the local circuitry underlying specific traits, we hope to differentiate the roles of specific microcircuits within the umbrella of neurological disorders, which may one day help in developing targeted therapeutics for specific cognitive and behavioral characteristics. In future studies, we hope to evaluate these circuits in different genetic models to determine if these microcircuit alterations are convergent changes that underlie heightened fear and anxiety expression across diverse genetic profiles.""

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

The simplest ideas in mathematics can also be the most perplexing.

Take addition. It's a straightforward operation: One of the first mathematical truths we learn is that 1 plus 1 equals 2. But mathematicians still have many unanswered questions about the kinds of patterns that addition can give rise to. “This is one of the most basic things you can do,” said Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford. “Somehow, it's still very mysterious in a lot of ways.”

In probing this mystery, mathematicians also hope to understand the limits of addition's power. Since the early 20th century, they've been studying the nature of “sum-free” sets—sets of numbers in which no two numbers in the set will add to a third. For instance, add any two odd numbers and you'll get an even number. The set of odd numbers is therefore sum-free.

In a 1965 paper, the prolific mathematician Paul Erdős asked a simple question about how common sum-free sets are. But for decades, progress on the problem was negligible.

“It's a very basic-sounding thing that we had shockingly little understanding of,” said Julian Sahasrabudhe, a mathematician at the University of Cambridge.

Until this February. Sixty years after Erdős posed his problem, Bedert solved it. He showed that in any set composed of integers—the positive and negative counting numbers—there's a large subset of numbers that must be sum-free. His proof reaches into the depths of mathematics, honing techniques from disparate fields to uncover hidden structure not just in sum-free sets, but in all sorts of other settings.

“It's a fantastic achievement,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Erdős knew that any set of integers must contain a smaller, sum-free subset. Consider the set {1, 2, 3}, which is not sum-free. It contains five different sum-free subsets, such as {1} and {2, 3}.

Erdős wanted to know just how far this phenomenon extends. If you have a set with a million integers, how big is its biggest sum-free subset?

In many cases, it's huge. If you choose a million integers at random, around half of them will be odd, giving you a sum-free subset with about 500,000 elements.

Paul Erdős was famous for his ability to come up with deep conjectures that continue to guide mathematics research today.

In his 1965 paper, Erdős showed—in a proof that was just a few lines long, and hailed as brilliant by other mathematicians—that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset of at least N/3 elements.

Still, he wasn't satisfied. His proof dealt with averages: He found a collection of sum-free subsets and calculated that their average size was N/3. But in such a collection, the biggest subsets are typically thought to be much larger than the average.

Erdős wanted to measure the size of those extra-large sum-free subsets.

Mathematicians soon hypothesized that as your set gets bigger, the biggest sum-free subsets will get much larger than N/3. In fact, the deviation will grow infinitely large. This prediction—that the size of the biggest sum-free subset is N/3 plus some deviation that grows to infinity with N—is now known as the sum-free sets conjecture.

“It is surprising that this simple question seems to present considerable difficulties,” Erdős wrote in his original paper, “but perhaps we overlook the obvious.”

For decades, nothing obvious revealed itself. No one could improve on Erdős' proof. “The longer it went without people being able to improve on that simple bound, the more cachet this problem acquired,” said Ben Green, Bedert's doctoral adviser at Oxford. And, he added, this was precisely the kind of problem where “it's very, very hard to do any better at all.”

After 25 years without improving on Erdős' original result, mathematicians finally began inching forward. In 1990, two researchers proved that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + 1/3 elements, more commonly written as (N + 1)/3.

But since the size of a set is always a whole number, an increase of 1/3 is often inconsequential. For example, if you know that a sum-free subset has to have at least 5/3 elements, that means its size is guaranteed to be 2 or more. If you add 1/3 to 5/3, your answer is still 2. “It's funny, it means that it doesn't actually always improve it,” said David Conlon of the California Institute of Technology. “It's only when N is divisible by 3 that it improves it.”

In 1997, the mathematical legend Jean Bourgain nudged the bound up to (N + 2)/3. The result might have seemed hardly worth mentioning, but buried in Bourgain's paper was a startling breakthrough. He described an idea for how to prove that the biggest sum-free subsets would be arbitrarily bigger than that. He just couldn't pin down the details to turn it into a full proof.

“The paper's almost like, here's how I tried to solve the problem and why it didn't work,” Sahasrabudhe said.

Jean Bourgain devised a creative strategy for proving the sum-free sets conjecture.

Bourgain relied on a quantity called the Littlewood norm, which measures a given set's structure. This quantity, which comes from a field of mathematics called Fourier analysis, tends to be large if a set is more random, and small if the set exhibits more structure.

Bourgain showed that if a set with N elements has a large Littlewood norm, then it must also have a sum-free set that's much larger than N/3. But he couldn't make progress in the case where the set has a small Littlewood norm.

“Bourgain is famously competent,” said Sean Eberhard of the University of Warwick. “It's a very striking marker of how difficult this problem is.”

Bourgain ultimately had to use a different argument to get his bound of (N + 2)/3. But mathematicians read between the lines: They might be able to use the Littlewood norm to completely settle the conjecture. They just had to figure out how to deal with sets with a small Littlewood norm.

There was reason to be optimistic: Mathematicians already knew of sets with a small Littlewood norm that have massive sum-free subsets. These sets, called arithmetic progressions, consist of evenly spaced numbers, such as {5, 10, 15, 20}. Mathematicians suspected that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a very specific structure—that it's more or less a collection of many different arithmetic progressions (with a few tweaks). They hoped that if they could show this, they'd be able to use that property to prove that any set with a small Littlewood norm has a large sum-free subset.

But this task wasn't easy. “I certainly tried to prove the sum-free conjecture using [Bourgain's] ideas,” Green said, but “we still don't understand much about the structure of sets with small Littlewood norm. Everything to do with Littlewood is difficult.”

And so, though mathematicians continued to have faith in Bourgain's Littlewood-based strategy, nothing happened.

More than two decades passed. Then, in the fall of 2021, Benjamin Bedert started graduate school.

With Green as his doctoral adviser, it was inevitable that Bedert would come across the sum-free sets conjecture. Green's website lists 100 open problems; this one appears first.

Bedert perused the list shortly after he began his graduate studies. At first, he shied away from the sum-free sets problem. “I was like, this is super difficult, I'm not going to think about this,” he recalled. “I'll leave this for the future.”

The future arrived soon enough. In summer 2024, Bedert decided he was ready for a riskier project. “I'd proved some reasonably good results in my PhD so far, and kind of put a thesis together already,” he said. “I started thinking about these more, I guess, notorious problems.”

Benjamin Bedert, a graduate student at the University of Oxford, has resolved a decades-old problem that tests the role of addition in sets.

He read Bourgain's 1997 paper and began to muse about how to implement the Littlewood blueprint. Almost immediately, he had an idea for how he might approach the problem of sets with a small Littlewood norm.

So far, it had been too difficult to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always resemble collections of arithmetic progressions. But Bedert thought it might be useful to prove something more attainable: that even if these sets aren't literally built from arithmetic progressions, they share certain key, progression-like properties.

In a recent project, Bedert had come across what he saw as a good candidate for a property to focus on. In arithmetic progressions, there are many groups of numbers that have the same sum. For instance, in the set of even numbers (which is an arithmetic progression), 4 + 8 has the same sum as both 2 + 10 and 2 + 4 + 6. Bedert thought it might be enough to show that sets with a small Littlewood norm always obey this property.

Within a couple of weeks, he'd succeeded in proving that the property was true. But would the result give him the level of similarity to arithmetic progressions that he needed to prove the sum-free sets conjecture?

“I was definitely excited,” he said. “Then I realized there was still so much more work to do.”

First, Bedert showed that any set with a small Littlewood norm could be “mapped” to a second set that bore an even closer resemblance to arithmetic progressions. He suspected that it was in these new sets that he would find large sum-free subsets.

The final task was to actually show what the size of such a sum-free subset would be. “Over the Christmas break, I was obsessively thinking about this problem,” Bedert said. “By New Year's, I still hadn't found the final piece of the puzzle.”

Then, a few days after he returned to Oxford in January, it came to him. “I'm not sure where it came from,” he said. “Maybe these ideas stir in your mind for a while, and then [you] finally get something out that works.”

He represented the structure of his sets using a tool called the Fourier transform, and then modified a 1981 proof to show that some of the individual components of that representation must have a large Littlewood norm. Since Bourgain had already shown how to handle sets with large Littlewood norms, that completed the proof.

In the end, Bedert showed that any set of N integers has a sum-free subset with at least N/3 + log(log N) elements. For many values of N, this gives you a sum-free subset that's only slightly bigger than Erdős' average size of N/3. Even if N is as large as 10100, for example, log(log N) is only around 5. But as N inches toward infinity, so does the difference in Bedert's and Erdős' bounds—thus settling the conjecture.

“It's a really amazing result,” said Yifan Jing of Ohio State University. Jing, who was also mentored by Green, credits the achievement to Bedert's intense focus. “Benjamin really went in depth to modify Bourgain's proof and make it work,” he said. “He spends much more time than other people on the same problem.”

There's still more to understand about sum-free subsets—and therefore about the extent to which addition influences the structure of the integers. For instance, Bedert's result resolves the question of whether the largest sum-free subset gets infinitely bigger than N/3. But mathematicians don't know precisely how fast that deviation can grow. Thanks to a 2014 paper by Green and two colleagues, they know that the deviation is slower-growing than N. But, Green said, “there remains a massive gap” between that upper bound of N and Bedert's lower bound of log(log N).

The work also provides new insight into sets that have a small Littlewood norm. Such sets are fundamental objects in the field of analysis but are very difficult to study. Bedert's result has helped mathematicians better understand their structure, which Green and others now hope to continue to explore. “It's beautiful, it's interesting, it feels natural,” Eberhard said. “You want to solve a mystery, don't you?”

For Sahasrabudhe, the takeaway is simple. “Old and difficult problem solved by brilliant kid,” he said. “The stuff he's building on, it's subtle and hard to work with. It's a really pretty result.”

The worst part of travel is the planning: the faff of finding and booking transport, accommodation, restaurant reservations—the list can feel endless. To help, the latest wave of AI agents, such as OpenAI's Operator and Anthropic's Computer Use claim they can take these dreary, cumbersome tasks from befuddled travelers and do it all for you. But exactly how good are they are digging out the good stuff?

What better way to find out than deciding on a last-minute weekend away. I tasked Operator, which is available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers, with booking me something budget-friendly, with good food and art, and told it that I'd prefer to travel by train. What's fascinating is that you can actually watch its process in real time—the tool opens a browser window and starts, much as I would, searching for destinations accessible by rail. It scrolls a couple of articles, then offers two suggestions: Paris or Bruges. “I recently went to Paris,” I type in the chat. “Let's do Bruges!”

Armed with my decision, Operator goes on to look up train times on the Eurostar website and finds a return ticket that will take me to Brussels and includes onward travel within Belgium. I intervene, however, when I see the timings: It selected an early-morning train out on Saturday, and an equally early train back on Sunday—not exactly making the most of the weekend, I point out. It finds a later return option.

So far impressed, I wait to double-check my calendar before committing. When I return, however, the session has timed out. Unlike ChatGPT, Operator closes conversations between tasks, and I have to start again from scratch. I feel irrationally slighted, as if my trusty travel assistant has palmed me off to a colleague. Alas, the fares have already changed, and I find myself haggling with the AI: can't it find something cheaper? Tickets eventually selected, I take over to enter my personal and payment details. (I may be trusting AI to blindly send me across country borders, but I'm not giving it my passport information.)

Using ChatGPT's Operator to book a train ticket to Bruges.

Trains booked, Operator thinks its job is done. But I'll need somewhere to stay, I remind it—can it book a hotel? It asks for more details and I'm purposefully vague, specifying that it should be comfy and conveniently located. Comparing hotels is perhaps my least favorite aspect of travel planning, so I'm happy to leave it scrolling through Booking.com. I restrain myself from jumping in when I see it's set the wrong dates, but it corrects this itself. It spends a while surveying an Ibis listing, but ends up choosing a three-star hotel called Martin's Brugge, which I note users have rated as having an excellent location.

Now all that's left is an itinerary. Here, Operator seems to lose steam. It offers a perfunctory one-day schedule that appears to have mainly been cribbed from a vegetarian travel blog. On day 2, it suggests I “visit any remaining attractions or museums.” Wow, thanks for the tip.

The day of the trip arrives, and, as I drag myself out of bed at 4:30AM, I remember why I usually avoid early departures. Still, I get to Brussels without issue. My ticket allows for onward travel, but I realize I don't know where I'm going. I fire up Operator on my phone and ask which platform the next Bruges-bound train departs from. It searches the Belgian railway timetables. Minutes later, it's still searching. I look up and see the details on a station display. I get to the platform before Operator has figured it out.

Bruges is delightful. Given Operator's lackluster itinerary, I branch out. This kind of research task is perfect for a large language model, I realize—it doesn't require agentic capabilities. ChatGPT, Operator's OpenAI sibling, gives me a much more thorough plan, plotting activities by the hour with suggestions of not just where to eat, but what to order (Flemish stew at De Halve Mann brewery). I also try Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and their plans are similar: Walk to the market square; see the belfry tower; visit the Basilica of the Holy Blood. Bruges is a small city, and I can't help but wonder if this is simply the standard tourist route, or if the AI models are all getting their information from the same sources.

Various travel-specific AI tools are trying to break through this genericness. I briefly try MindTrip, which provides a map alongside a written itinerary, offers to personalize recommendations based on a quiz, and includes collaborative features for shared trips. CEO Andy Moss says it expands on broad LLM capabilities by leveraging a travel-specific “knowledge base” containing things like weather data and real-time availability.

After lunch, I admit defeat. According to ChatGPT's itinerary I should spend the afternoon on a boat tour, taking photos in another square, and visiting a museum. It has vastly overestimated the stamina of a human who's been up since 4:30AM. I go to rest at my hotel, which is basic, but indeed ideally located. I'm coming around to Operator's lazier plans: I'll do the remaining attractions tomorrow.

As a final task, I ask the agent to make a dinner reservation—somewhere authentic but not too expensive. It gets bamboozled by a dropdown menu during the booking process but manages a workaround after a little encouragement. I'm impressed as I walk past the obvious tourist traps to a more out-of-the-way dining room that serves classic local cuisine and is themed around pigeons. It's a good find—and one that doesn't seem to appear on the top 10 lists of obvious guides like TripAdvisor or The Fork.

On the train home, I muse on my experience. The AI agent certainly required supervision. It struggled to string tasks together and lacked an element of common sense, such as when it tried to book the earliest train home. But it was refreshing to outsource decision-making to an assistant that could present a few select options, rather than having to scroll through endless listings. For now, people mainly use AI for inspiration, says Emma Brennan at travel agent trade association ABTA; it doesn't beat the human touch. “An increasing number of people are booking with the travel agents for the reason that they want someone there if something goes wrong,” she says.

It's easy to imagine AI tools taking over the information gateway role from search and socials, with businesses clamoring to appear in AI-generated suggestions. “Google isn't going to be the front door for everything in the future,” says Moss. Are we ready to give this power to a machine?

But then, perhaps that ship has sailed. When planning travel myself, I'll reflexively check a restaurant's Google rating, look up a hotel on Instagram, or read TripAdvisor reviews of an attraction, despite desires to stay away from the default tourist beat. Embarking on my AI trip, I worried I'd spend more time staring at my screen. By the end, I realize I've probably spent less.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Fairphone Has a New Plan to Get You to Care","https://www.wired.com/story/fairphone-proves-you-really-dont-give-a-damn/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Fairphone has released a new phone, the Fairphone 6. The series began in 2013, and there's still nothing else quite like it, anywhere. These mobile phones are what almost all other tech is not: ethically admirable.

Fairphone strives for more sustainably sourced raw materials, for better pay and better conditions for factory workers. And on your side as the end user, the phones are modular, easily repairable. Fairphone promises its new phone will get eight years of software updates, including an eyebrow-raising seven major Android system upgrades.

The Fairphone 6 has 12 modular elements you can replace, from the battery and display to the speakers, camera, and USB port. Indeed, you can still buy replacement cameras and screens for the Fairphone 2, which was released in pre-Trump, pre-Brexit 2015. And Fairphones remain the only smartphones—ever—to be rated 10/10 for repairability by iFixit. Every model since the Fairphone 2 has achieved that score.

Sounds great, right? But there's a big problem. It looks like hardly anyone gives a damn.

Fairphone is stuck in a rut. We know this because Fairphone is not just a pioneer of smartphones you don't feel dirty just for owning. It's unusually transparent, too. Its own reports tell us Fairphone sales have flatlined at around 100,000 a year.

Put 100,000 phones in a room and it will seem like a heck of a lot. But, for context, Apple is estimated to have sold 37 million iPhone 16s in the series' first weekend, before the phones were even out.

Does no one really care about sustainable tech? The answer from one analyst we talked to is kinda, yeah. “There's really no one else who does anything kind of close to what Fairphone does from a sustainability point of view. The issue I have with Fairphone is that it's quite niche,” says Jan Stryjak, Counterpoint's European and Sustainability research lead.

“It's still not the kind of primary driver for people when it comes to buying a phone. The number one is still very much price and brand, particularly in Europe.”

Fairphone isn't a household name. And while the Fairphone 6 is actually cheaper than the Fairphone 5 was at launch in 2023, at £499/€599, it has masses of price competition from companies where any ethics angle can seem, at most, little more than a marketing tick box. For less cash, you could buy a more powerful and excellent Pixel 9a, for example.

The company made a concerted effort to get out of this rut in 2023, investing big in marketing and expansion. It led to a €20 million loss for that year, followed by the departure of CEO Eva Gouwens, and 2024 sales just a smidgen over 100,000, yet again.

And Fairphone's much bigger rivals are going to be forced to apply at least a pinch of Fairphone-style seasoning to their phones going forward, thanks to the EU's Ecodesign Directive. This came into force on June 20. It demands five-year software support and applies stronger rules on repairability.

“I can't see any significant growth over the next few years,” says Stryjak. “Other companies have caught up a little bit in terms of making things more durable and sustainable and repairable, and with consumers a key driver is still pricing and brand. Fairphone will have its loyal fan base, but I can't see that significantly expanding anytime soon.”

We put to Fairphone the idea it may have to make do pootling along with this same niche audience. “I will say it's nonsense, right?” Fairphone CEO Raymond van Eck told WIRED.

“I would never have started at a company … if we feel there is no potential. Nobody wants to, as we say in Dutch, pull on a dead horse to see if it's going to walk.” Fairphone is based in Amsterdam, and van Eck was appointed CEO in August 2024.

“In the next five years, we really have the intention to quadruple our addressable market and to take our fair share of that,” says van Eck. The company has also set a goal of “double digit growth” just for this year. The obvious question: how?

Part of Fairphone's strategy is of course seen in the Fairphone 6 itself. It has some neat ideas such as a slider that puts the phone into an Essentials mode. This pares back the interface to help you get away from the distractions of, for example, social media.

There's a breezy lifestyle angle here Fairphones have arguably not had before. And fostering that was a part of the rebrand the company kicked off at the beginning of 2025, which included binning the stiff-looking, all-caps company logo of old for something a bit more friendly.

Van Eck says it's about “changing the order” of priorities, of putting the device itself at pole position rather than the ethics it represents. “In the end, it also is clarifying Fairphone's vision, because the rebrand gave us a more friendly, more approachable identity,"" he says. ""It's a bit less paternalistic.”

The message is that Fairphone isn't just a phone for eco warriors. And chief technology officer Chandler Elizabeth Hatton suggests that image, that classic Fairphone message, may have actually proved off-putting for some.

“When we are marketing the device, we don't lead with that. Not in our advertising campaigns, not in our communication, and also not the way that I would like to convey it to you,” says Hatton. “It can become preachy in some markets. That message is resonating less right now. There are people that are in panic but also completely exhausted by the climate crisis or questions of ethics.”

So … is it time to de-woke Fairphone? That seems too blunt an interpretation, because there's no indication that Fairphone plans to dilute its standards. It's just not going to harp on about them quite as overtly.

“Fairphone was founded 12 years ago, basically to tackle the social and environmental issues embedded in the electronics industry,” says Van Eck. “What we also saw is that Fairphone was quite situated around telling that story … which meant that the Fairphone was for a lesser addressable market.”

This new approach also involves not having too bold a take on things like AI, which owing to its environmental impact could be seen as antithetical to one part of the old Fairphone message.

“I don't think it is pragmatic, if you start more revolutionary thinking saying, ‘OK, we're totally against it, and we're going to do nothing with it,'” says Ven Eck. AI is “part of our industry, right? It's part of the everyday use of customers. So it will be almost naive to say we're not going to do anything with it. It's part of everyday life.”

The Fairphone 6 doesn't have its own AI assistant, but does feature Google's Gemini AI.

Turning down the volume on the environmental and ethical messaging might be compared to how some vegetarian food brands now consider people cutting down on meat, or meat-eaters looking for a healthy choice, as important a part of their audience.

CTO Hatten would rather you tell a friend to think of the Fairphone 6 as “the last phone that they'll have to buy for a while” rather than dwell on the ethics of the mining operations used to harvest the cobalt for its battery.

But there's a big problem here, too. In 1924, the American automobile market began reaching saturation point. To maintain sales, General Motors executive Alfred P. Sloan Jr. suggested annual model-year design changes to cajole car owners into buying replacements each year. This strategy came to be referred to as planned obsolescence.

In an ideal world, Fairphone wants their phones to be “the last phone that you'll have to buy”—and they'll try their darnedest to make sure you've the software and spare parts to make this happen. There's no planned obsolescence here. None at all.

Now, that's laudable, but this also means that, once Fairphone has tapped that global market of the relatively tiny number of phone users who really care about our planet above the wonders of Apple's Dynamic Island, very few will need to rebuy or upgrade on their initial ethical purchase. Not for many, many years, anyway. How can you significantly grow a business like that?

Will Fairphone's new strategy of diversifying its offering with the 6's breezy lifestyle angle work? Thanks to the company's wonderful transparency we can all find out once Fairphone drops its 2025 Impact Report some time in early 2026.

Everybody prints. At least everyone I know. Yet as digital tickets and phone camera scanning become increasingly common, more homes are operating without a printer at all. For those who have realized they do need to print stuff from time to time, or who just moved to a home office and really need a workhorse, I've got you covered.

In addition to writing for WIRED as a freelancer, I have a side hustle selling trading cards online. I'm printing packing slips, shipping labels, and even scanning cards on a daily basis. A printer is a commonly used tool in my life, so I can understand how frustrating it is when they don't work right.

I've spent hours printing out countless labels, slips, coloring book pages, and full-color photos of my dog on every printer I could get my hands on. Below are my favorites based on their printing quality, cost efficiency, and how often they gave me a headache. While I prefer laser printers for their ease of use and consistency, ink tank options are quickly becoming more appealing, and I have great options for both, as well as your classic ink cartridge-based devices.

Looking for more of the best home office gear? Be sure to check out our guides to the Best Computer Monitors, Best Standing Desks, Best Office Chairs, and Best Laptops.

Ink or Laser

Before anything else, you'll have to decide between ink and laser. I'll get into the details when it comes to each model, but the most important consideration is paper type, because it's a limitation rather than a benefit. Laser printers use heat in the bonding process, which means if you regularly print on windowed envelopes or photo paper, you'll need to either use an ink printer or change to a thermally-safe alternative, which can be cost prohibitive if you print a lot.

Inkjets are the most common flavor of home printer, and they work like you might expect, by boiling ink until it splatters through a series of tiny holes. You didn't expect that? Me neither! Pretty exciting stuff.

Inkjet printers come in two flavors, with either pre-filled cartridges or built-in tanks. The latter is quickly becoming more popular thanks to better pricing, more convenience, and a massive reduction in wasted plastic. If you're buying a new printer in 2025 you should opt for an ink tank, if not a laser printer. They're a little more work to setup and maintain, since you have to keep the tanks topped off, and they should remain in one place on a flat surface to avoid leaks. I can't imagine many situations where a printer would be constantly moving and tilting, but it's a consideration.

You thought InkJets were cool? Laser printers work by blasting a tube full of dried plastic particles, then fusing them to the paper with heat. They tend to cost more upfront, but the cost per page is overall much lower. Where a $20 ink cartridge might print 200 pages, a $60 toner cartridge could print 2000. They tend to be a lot faster than inkjet printers, and you don't have to worry about them drying out. Plus, the pages come out of the printer nice and warm, and you can't really put a price on that.

Laser printers are my preferred type, as long as your paper type and budget can support them.

Connectivity

While Wi-Fi is increasingly common, especially on high-end printers, it isn't a given. If your home has a dedicated desktop, you can often plug in the printer through USB and share the connection over the network, but otherwise you may need to find a spot with an Ethernet cable. If you don't have a desktop or a convenient spot next to the router, Wi-Fi will make your life a lot easier.

You'll also want to keep an eye out for different interface options. Basic models may have no screen at all, or a single line of dot-matrix characters. Upgrades often include a color LCD for clearer error messages, or even a touchscreen for advanced configuration without an app. I generally find these are most important during the initial setup, and become less useful over time. The exception here is on machines with copying and scanning features, where a good interface can save you time shuffling through settings.

Copy and Scan

I can't tell you definitively whether you need a scanner, but if you've used the feature in the last two years, and your phone camera hasn't sufficed, it's worth the upgrade. You don't want to have to shop for a standalone scanner, or buy an entirely new printer just to make copies twice a year. Most models come in scan-ful and scan-less varieties that are otherwise identical, so it shouldn't complicate the decision much.

Document feeders are really only necessary for situations where you're regularly scanning stacks of pages, like signed invoices for digitizing. A flatbed is more than sufficient for occasional forms, preferable for photos, and will often produce a higher quality scan anyway.

Brother

Staples

Amazon

Even though the Brother HL-L2460DW runs nice and quiet, it was one of the faster printers in my testing, making it a great choice for a home office or classroom that doesn't need color. If you're printing out dozens of pages per day, all of them in black and white, and never scanning, you'll save a lot of cash going with the laser option.

Setup isn't entirely intuitive. There's only a single line readout, and limited buttons for entering a Wi-Fi password, but I only had to struggle with it once. Once it's running, it requires little to no upkeep or changing settings. It's fast, cheap to run daily, fits cleanly onto any shelf, and just needs a power cable.

Brother

As long as you don't need a scanner, I'd check out the Brother HL-3280CDW. It printed slower than the black and white model, but still fast for the group, with a nice crisp detail level, and it isn't too noisy. The touchscreen makes setup and adjusting options straightforward, and I was able to set it and forget it.

This no-frills printer is great for mostly black and white with occasional color printing, with a fairly compact footprint and a second manual feed paper tray. The only downside here is that it's fairly new, so the updated toner cartridges haven't had a chance to come down in price yet.

Epson

Staples

Amazon

Setting up and maintaining an ink tank printer adds a few extra steps, and I was a little wary of them at first. This Epson EcoTank ET-2980 was the most straightforward and non-threatening I tested. The ink bottles mount right into keyed holes, so you can't mix them up, with no extra drips or dribbles, and there were no extra bits to install or configure, just a one-time scan sheet to check the alignment. It was also the easiest to secure if I needed to move it without getting ink everywhere.

Print quality is excellent, and slower than the laser printers, but quick enough for most home use. It also includes a flatbed scanner, making it one of the best equipped printers for the price, particularly when you take into account the savings from refillable ink. My only minor complaint here is that it uses a vertical feeding paper tray from the rear, which means a lower 100 page print capacity. The upshot is that means better paper compatibility, since the pages don't have to make a complete turn.

HP

Staples

Amazon

The HP Color LaserJet Pro MFP 3301sdw is probably more feature-packed than most casual users would need, but if I showed up to work one day and it was near my desk, I'd say Santa came early. This would be a great fit for a home office where multiple people are often printing out full color promotional sheets or invitations.

It's fully connected, with Dual-Band Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and USB, so you could park this anywhere in your small office and have the whole team printing. It's fast enough I won't be waiting on someone else to finish their job, and quiet enough I wouldn't be mad to sit nearby.

My only minor complaint here is that the document feeder up top likes to crunch documents if you don't get the holders positioned exactly right, so just make sure to use the flatbed for anything important.

HP

Staples

Amazon

While I think Ink Tank and laser printers offer a better value and user experience, I can understand feeling more comfortable dealing with classic ink cartridges. This upgraded HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e is the newer model of the printer that powered my business for the last year or so. It's fully featured, with both a flatbed and document scanner, and it was one the speedier printers I tested with full color printing.

It also boasts the widest support for paper types and sizes on the list, although it doesn't always grab the right number of pages when working with thicker stock, something I noticed on the older version as well. With an easy setup process, minimal software needed, and wide feature set, this would be a great option for people who don't want to think about their printer often, they just want it to work when they need it.

HP LaserJet M209d ($130): While HP's minimalist black and white laser printer might be wallet-friendly, it's quite noisy and lacks some crucial connectivity. Even just adding Ethernet would sweeten the pot here a lot, but if you want something basic for USB-only use, it'll get the job done.

A group of “very wealthy people” is set to buy short-form video app TikTok, according to President Donald Trump.

“We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,” Trump said in a Fox News interview on Sunday morning. “I think I'll need probably China's approval. I think President Xi [Jinping] will probably do it.”

Trump declined to share more details about the buyers, saying only that he would reveal their identities in two weeks (apparently his favorite unit of time). 

Trump has repeatedly delayed a bill forcing owner ByteDance to sell the app or see it banned in the United States. In January, he said his “initial thought” was to create “a joint venture between the current owners and/or new owners whereby the U.S. gets a 50% ownership.”

He's also said he was open to allies Larry Ellison or Elon Musk buying the app, although Musk seems like a less likely candidate now.

Apple doesn't often discount products, and AirTags have never been on sale from the Apple website or in Apple stores. Amazon, however, occasionally surprises us with exclusive pricing on these useful Bluetooth trackers.

For the best value, a pack of AirTags is nearly always a better buy than a single one. Amazon is also running a great deal just in time for Prime Day: purchase three AirTags and receive a fourth free. That drops the price of four AirTags to just $74, down from the regular $99 ($25 each + get one free). That's one of the best discounts we've ever seen on these trackers.

See 4-pack AirTags on Amazon

AirTag is a small device that's perfect for keeping track of your keys, wallet, luggage, backpack and anything else you want to stay with. It's simple to set up and you just have to tap your iPhone (or iPad) and the AirTag is paired in an instant. Every AirTag is about the size of a large coin so it's simple to drop into pockets. It has a built-in speaker to play a sound to help you find your things and you can use Siri to have them locate it for you as well.

Precision Finding is one of the neatest aspects, and it uses the Ultra Wideband technology. On some iPhone models, this feature directs you to your AirTag with visual, haptic and auditory cues. For items far away, the AirTag uses the huge Find My network: Hundreds of millions of Apple devices collaborate to locate your lost items. When you mark your AirTag as lost, you get a notification the very moment it's detected by another device in the network.

Apple takes privacy seriously: All interactions with the Find My network are encrypted and anonymous. Location data and history are never stored on the AirTag itself so your information is safe. AirTags also support sharing with up to five people able to track an item together.

Obviously, it also boasts an IP67 water- and dust-resistance rating, which makes it capable of withstanding spills, rain, and everyday handling. The device uses a user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery with a lifespan of over a year. This makes maintenance simple and hassle-free.

The AirTag is one of the smarter things you can do for your everyday items at this price range.

If you're looking for a reliable computer without spending $1,000 or $2,000, HP is always a solid choice thanks to its wide range of dependable products. Right now, though, Amazon is offering a deal that's hard to ignore: there's an HP 14-inch laptop which is at an all-time low price, likely the lowest ever for an HP laptop of this kind.

For just $179, a discount from the regular price of $230, you get a compact, lightweight laptop with Windows 11 Home preinstalled and one year of Microsoft 365. This price that's perfect for students and infrequent users looking for an efficient device for everyday tasks.

See at Amazon

The snowflake white finish gives it a clean, modern look, and the 14-inch micro-edge HD display provides a large screen without taking up too much bezel. With the 79% screen-to-body ratio and 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel, you get more screen real estate in a smaller footprint which is ideal for watching videos and browsing the web. The HD screen (1366 x 768) is sufficiently sharp for day-to-day activities and the onboard Intel UHD Graphics 600 even makes it possible to play 4K content smoothly.

This laptop comes with an Intel Celeron N4020 dual-core processor: It is designed for performance and reliability and provides adequate performance for web surfing, email, word processing and streaming of videos. It's not a gaming monster so don't expect to run resource-intensive games and graphics-hungry creative software but for office tasks and general web surfing, it gets along fine without complaint. The 4 GB of RAM is enough to keep things humming along.

Storage is handled by a 64 GB embedded multimedia card which is flash-based to support quick boot time and quick access to your content. While 64 GB isn't massive, it's sufficient for the essentials apps and files. With Windows 11 Home, you get the new Microsoft features and security updates, and the laptop is ready to be used out of the box. What really provides more value, though, is a year's subscription to Microsoft 365 included with your purchase. This gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more productivity applications, and it is easy to start getting started staying organized and productive right from day one.

If you're looking for a budget-friendly laptop that covers the essentials, this is a fantastic (early) Prime Day deal.

Amazon has begun Prime Day early this year and the best news is that these deals are accessible to everyone (not just Prime members). One of the best deals currently on sale is on the GMKtec mini PC (i7, 1TB SSD, 32GB DDR4 RAM, Windows 11 Pro) which is a diminutive desktop with XL performance and a price that's hard to believe.

If you're looking for a powerful desktop computer but don't want to spend $2,000 on a high-end model, this is a smart pick. Now, the GMKtec mini PC featuring Intel Core i7-1195G7 processor, 32GB DDR4 RAM, and 1TB NVMe SSD is available for just $409, down from the normal price tag of $640. That's a 36% off and lowest price ever available for this configuration.

See at Amazon

The 11th Gen Intel Core i7-1195G7 processor is capable of speeds up to 5.0 GHz which is far more than enough power for intensive applications. With 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM, you'll have plenty to do some multitasking and the board can be expanded to 64GB if you need more power down the line. The 1TB NVMe SSD has boot times and file access that are as quick as lightning and you can upgrade up to 2TB of storage via the M.2 2280 slot or 2TB via the M.2 2242 SATA slot.

Graphics performance is also an added advantage thanks to the Intel Iris Xe GPU included. With it, you can smoothly play 4K UHD content and power up to three screens simultaneously (two via HDMI and one via USB Type-C), all at 4K resolution at 60Hz.

Connectivity is also robust with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 offering fast wireless connections and widespread device support. You will also have the ability to use high-speed wired internet from the 2.5Gbps LAN port if you need it for large file downloads or steadfast online gaming. You will also have a good number of ports like USB4.0 to easily connect all your peripherals and accessories. The compact design, weighing just a few pounds, makes it easy to fit this mini PC anywhere.

This small computer comes preloaded with Windows 11 Pro but it will also run Ubuntu and Linux, so if you prefer a different operating system, you're good to go.

If you're looking for a desktop that delivers premium performance without the premium price tag, this mini PC is one of the best deals we've seen recently.

The Ninja DZ401 Foodi 6-in-1 XL air fryer is the highest-rated air fryer available for purchase on Amazon, with over 37,000 reviews and an impressive 4.7 out of 5 stars. If you need an XL air fryer that can actually do it all, this is the one to buy.

Ninja has become the brand of choice when it comes to air fryers, and this inaugural (early) Prime Day discount is open to everyone, not only Prime members. The price of $179, down from the usual $230, is the best deal for 2025 and an opportunity to outfit your kitchen with a high-end appliance.

See at Amazon

With a 10-quart total capacity and two separate 5-quart baskets, you are able to cook two foods differently simultaneously. This double-basket feature dispenses with the need to cook in batches or wait for the first dish to finish before cooking another. Whether you're preparing a main course and a side or simply want to whip up a large batch of wings, this air fryer makes it easy to feed a crowd quickly and efficiently.

The dualzone technology is a major advantage and offers two key features: Smart Finish and Match Cook. Smart Finish enables you to prepare two dishes of different settings and ensures that they are ready at the same time and consequently everything is ready simultaneously to be served. It is not the same with Match Cook which allows you to duplicate settings on both baskets for full capacity meals. The IQ Boost feature smartly shares power among the baskets and allows one to cook something as big as a 6-pound whole chicken and a side dish at the same time, without compromising on speed or quality.

With its six cooking functions—air fry, air broil, roast, bake, reheat, and dehydrate—the Ninja DZ401 Foodi has you set for quick meals. The extensive temperature range of 105°F to 450°F enables you to gently dry out fruit or blast-heated chicken wings to a crunchy texture. The cyclonic air and quick heaters in every zone ensure even cooking and the easy-to-clean baskets and dishwasher-safe crisper plates ensure that cleanup after a busy meal is easy.

What's more (and one of the main reasons why it is so popular) is that you can prepare your favorite fried food with up to 75% less fat compared to normal deep frying. The spacious 10-quart capacity enables you to cook up to 8 pounds of chicken wings at a time, perfect for family gatherings, parties, or cooking for the week.

If you're looking for an air fryer that can keep pace with big family meals, this is a smart choice.

More VRAM and CUDA cores with increased power requirements.

Nvidia is expected to follow up its current lineup of RTX 50 series desktop GPUs with a Super refresh. According to a new set of specifications posted by reliable Nvidia hardware leaker @kopite7kimi on X/Twitter, expect Team Green to launch at least three new models including the RTX 5070 Super, RTX 5070 Ti Super, and the RTX 5080 Super. These look like pretty safe bets for inclusion in our frequently updated Best Graphics Cards for Gaming in 2025 feature.

If we go by the rumored preliminary specifications, the new Super models will offer a substantial jump over the non-Super counterparts, primarily due to the increased VRAM. The RTX 5070 Super is said to feature the GB205 GPU based on the Blackwell architecture, paired with the PG147-SKU65 PCB. It will have 6,400 CUDA cores, which represents an uplift of just over 4% compared to the 6,144 CUDA cores on the regular RTX 5070. The power draw also sees a jump from 250W on the RTX 5070 to 275W on the RTX 5070 Super.

As for the VRAM, it is expected that the RTX 5070 Super will be upgraded to 18GB of GDDR7 memory with a 28 Gbps bandwidth on a 192-bit bus interface. As we suggested in a previous report back in April around a similar set of leaked specifications, Nvidia might be planning to replace the 2GB GDDR7 memory modules on the existing RTX 50 series lineup, with 3GB modules to gain an additional boost in performance.

Moving onto the rumored specifications of the RTX 5070 Ti Super, it is expected to feature the GB203 GPU and the PG147-SKU55 PCB. Additionally, the GPU will come with 8,960 CUDA cores, and 24GB of GDDR7 memory with a 28 Gbps bandwidth and 256-bit bus interface. Like the rumored RTX 5070 Super, the RTX 5070 Ti Super will also have an increased TGP bumping the spec to 350W, which is a jump of 50W over the non-Super RTX 5070 Ti.

Lastly, there is the RTX 5080 Super which is, more or less, similar to the RTX 5070 Ti Super except with a higher CUDA core count and memory bandwidth. The leaker hasn't explicitly mentioned any of the details, however a comment on the original post by software engineer Haytam Aarab (@Tech_Meld_) suggests that the RTX 5080 Super will feature the same GB203 GPU, with increased 24GB of GDDR7 VRAM, a 256-bit memory interface, and 10,753 CUDA cores, similar to the RTX 5080. The memory bandwidth (as corrected) will be increased to 32 Gbps while the power draw will jump from 360W to 415W. With leaks like this, please add a sprinkling of salt to the asserted specs.

While the refreshed models appear promising, these specifications remain unconfirmed rumors until Nvidia makes an official announcement. That said, if accurate, the RTX 50 Super refresh, with its increased VRAM, could appeal to consumers craving more memory for high-resolution gaming, demanding workloads, or future-proofing their systems. However, given Nvidia's track record with GPU launches, it wouldn't be surprising to see high demand once again paired with inflated pricing, if and when the new RTX 50 Super series hits the market.

While funding is being organized, TechTuber 'Peri Fratic' ropes in lots of big Commodore names from yesteryear to build new hope.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


YouTube's Christian ‘Peri Fratic' Simpson claims to be “the acting CEO of Commodore Corporation.” The surprise Commodore buyout deal hinted at three weeks prior, seems to have been put into motion. In a new episode on the rebranded Retro Recipes x Commodore channel, Peri Fratic provides details of the seven-figure deal, outlines his vision for the company, and lists a growing number of ex-Commodore luminaries who will be joining him to relaunch the beloved brand. Last and definitely not least, the video ends in a signature tease – this time it's a tease for new hardware.

Concerning the deal, a key point from the above video is that Peri Fratic “signed a share purchase agreement” with the previous owners of Commodore Corporation. It has been agreed that a price “in the low seven figures” will be paid to seal the deal. That should mean the deal is worth somewhere between $1m and $5m.



Apparently many backers of this project, including Peri Fratic, have already put in lots of cash to make this buyout happen, taking out second mortgages, selling the family silver, etc. However, the search is still on for angel investors to launch the new ship. Lots of details and discussion about funding are provided, but left us wondering what would happen if not enough suitable investors come forward, and what kind of timescale needs to be adhered to, to finalize the contract?

With this agreement in place, the new Commodore has already got a new slogan. It will go forward with its ‘Retro Futurism' plans, “honoring our past, innovating the future.” Furthermore, Perifrantic has been busy appointing (acting) CEO, CFO, COO, and many more key positions – many of whom honor the past.

Some big names that will play a part in the new future Commodore include, in order of mention: Bill Herd (Commodore Pioneer), Albert Charpentier (Father of the C64), Michael Tomczyk (Vic Tzar of the Vic 20), James Harrison (Tech support manager), David Pleasance (ex VP becomes Heritage and legacy advisor), Hans Olsen (demo and convention facilitator), Tim Morgan (PR officer), and more.

Perifrantic makes an interesting point in anticipation of critics that will chime in to assert “this will never be the original Commodore.” In his defense, the retro tech enthusiast says “what if we got 47 trademarks from 1982, or original Commodore engineers back, original executives, assistants, ROMs, Amiga? I mean, at some point, it does start to become the real Commodore, right?”

Also in the FAQ section of the video we get a rendition of the aims of the new Commodore sans corporate-speak. It will exist to “streamline the usage of the brand and logo, along with releasing some of our own products,” it is stated.

As well as the financial backing, which is still not guaranteed, Peri Fratic is seeking other talented folk. Specifically, merchandise designers, social media manager, and anyone who owns a license from a classic 1980s or 90s game should get in touch with the new (acting) Commodore CEO.

We are left with a cliffhanger with regard to the new ‘Commodore ____'. The video cuts out to an unpacking/loading type screen before Peri Fratic can hoist the new device from his lap into view. That announcement seems to be 20,160 minutes away (as of yesterday), which indicates a wait of two weeks.

Two wrongs do not make a right.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Bitcoin Depot Chief Legal Officer, Chris Ryan, said that police departments using brute force to open Bitcoin ATMs and seize the cash inside is bordering on law enforcement overreach. Sawing them open might even be breaking banking and criminal laws, added Ryan. The executive told Decrypt that the money inside Bitcoin Depot ATMs rightfully belongs to the company, and that any damage to its machines will be held against the offending organization.

“You've got these rogue law enforcement officers thinking that they're doing the right things by these consumers,” Ryan said. “What they're actually doing is creating another victim, which is us, with the damage of our property and seizing of our funds.”

Just last week, the Jasper County Sheriff broke into a Bitcoin Depot ATM after one of its constituents reported getting scammed out of $25,000. Although the victim went through proper channels, and they were able to secure a search warrant, the money inside the ATM is legally no longer the property of the victim. Instead, the authorities should be going after the wallet address where the cryptocurrency was deposited.

Because the Sheriff used a power tool to break open the ATM to get its contents, Bitcoin Depot said that its machine — which cost $14,000 each — was completely totaled. This is particularly unfortunate because the company said that it always cooperates with law enforcement and will open the machine for them when going through the proper channels.

Requests like this happen up to 20 times a year, Ryan said to Decrypt, and that doesn't even include cases where the police just straight up break their machines open. As for the latter, the company would charge the jurisdiction for the damage — something many can't afford.

Crypto ATMs are similar to regular deposit machines, wherein they accept cash and credit the same amount to your bank account. But instead of going into your account, it would instead go into your nominated wallet address. Depositors that use the machine are required to confirm that they're depositing the money into their own wallets, and it even warns users using third-party addresses that they might be getting scammed.

So, if someone was scammed out of their cash with a regular deposit machine, the police would not break the ATM — instead, they would coordinate with the courts and the bank to freeze the account and potentially get the money back. This should be the same pathway that victims should take when scammed through crypto. Unfortunately, many people, including law enforcement and the courts themselves, do not understand how crypto works. Because of that, we get incidents like these where police forcibly open crypto ATMs, causing damage to a third party's property.

While Bitcoin Depot and other similar operations are legitimate, they're often used by scammers because of how fast and easy it is for them to get the stolen funds. Even though you can easily track crypto transactions due to the public nature of the ledger, getting them back is often difficult because of anonymity. Moreover, if the scammer does not use an exchange that works with the authorities, it's difficult, often nearly impossible, to get the money back. Because of these attributes, scammers are increasingly switching from gift cards to Bitcoin ATMs.

Women's Soccer

Ali Krieger retired from professional soccer two years ago after winning the 2023 NWSL Championship with Gotham FC, but that doesn't mean she's stopped playing.

And it definitely doesn't mean she's stopped winning.

The two-time World Cup winner joined her former teammates, as well as some new faces, to form the US Women's team at The Soccer Tournament (TST) in Cary, North Carolina, earlier this month. A goal from the U.S. Under-23 and University of North Carolina midfielder Evelyn Shores, assisted by Krieger's former national team teammate Heather O'Reilly, earned the group a second consecutive title at the seven-on-seven tournament and the $1million prize.

“It was incredible,” Krieger told The Athletic, describing joining O'Reilly and other former teammates such as Jo Lohman, Carli Lloyd, as well as former Arsenal defender and girlfriend Jen Beattie. “It's just enjoyable to play with my former teammates again, who I've won championships with over the years, and then just to see the young talent rise.”

Sitting in 100-degree heat in the heart of Manhattan, Krieger spoke to The Athletic while getting ready for another short-side match. This time it was to play in a five-on-five charity match called Showdown, organized by her friend, Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Famer and soccer enthusiast Steve Nash, via his eponymous foundation. The mini-tournament featured former and current professional basketball and soccer players to raise money for children in need.

“I miss the game so much, so kind of dabbling in it one weekend at a time every year is enough for me,” Krieger told The Athletic on Tuesday ahead of the event.

The hunger to grow the game hasn't left her. And while she's no longer lacing up her boots at the highest level, she is expanding her investment portfolio to give back and stay in the game.

Earlier this year, Krieger invested equity in League One Volleyball (LOVB). She said she sees women's sports not just as a place where she used to compete, but as an ecosystem worth investing in.

“I'd love to get into women's hockey as well as basketball, and of course, I want to keep expanding my role in the NWSL,” she said, and not only as an analyst, a job she's had with ESPN since 2024.

“I want to be an owner and invest fully in an organization so that I can have more of an impact on the day-to-day side of things,” Krieger said.

She's part of a growing wave of former U.S. women's national team players betting on women's sports, particularly on the league they bruised their legs for many years. After retiring from the team, Alex Morgan became a minority investor in the San Diego Wave FC, the club where she closed out her playing career and where her jersey will be retired in the fall. Lauren Holiday joined the ownership group of the North Carolina Courage, while Abby Wambach and Mia Hamm are both part of the high-profile investor group behind Angel City FC. Aly Wagner is part of the Bay FC ownership group, together with Brandi Chastain, Danielle Slaton, and Leslie Osborne.

Krieger retired from professional soccer as the NWSL was hitting a major inflection point, when investors were lining up and franchise valuations were soaring into the double-digit millions. Today, her vision includes helping shape where the game goes next. While the NWSL has announced new expansion teams in Boston and Denver, Krieger believes there's more fertile ground in the U.S.

“I think Las Vegas would be amazing,” she said. “Arizona, Atlanta, Austin, these are all amazing cities for soccer.”

One close to the Virginia-native's home is Philadelphia, and she thinks it deserves a team. She also sees room for another team in the New York area, where she finished her career.

“I'd love to see another team in New York someday,” she added. “Rivalries matter. They grow the game.”

But rivalries alone won't sustain the next phase of women's soccer. For that, Krieger thinks it's time for the NWSL teams to think and act like clubs.

“It would be great to have that model, just like it is in Europe, where you start at the youth level and you move through the ranks. That consistency breeds elite talent. It's not just kids coming to play; there is a structure, but it's going to take some time.”

That development also involves the national team players, like her former TST teammate, Shores, who benefited from a half-year of camps dedicated to developing the under-23 age group.

“That pathway hasn't always been smooth. (U.S. head coach) Emma (Hayes) is fixing that,” Krieger said. “Giving these young rookies a real chance? It's exciting. And they deserve it if they're showing up in the league.”

The development adds a level of competition, too, Krieger believes. “No one is guaranteed a spot, and that's how it should be.”

As for Krieger's role, she'll continue to do what she can from the sidelines, even as that desire to be in the middle of the action remains.

“When I'm not playing, I'm more nervous,” she admitted. “You can't control anything. On the field, at least you feel like you can help. Off it, you're just watching, and yelling doesn't do much.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=women's+us+soccer","Why Cincinnati is USWNT Rose Lavelle's Dream Vacation","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/06/why-cincinnati-ohio-rose-lavelle-dream-vacation-uswnt-ireland","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:31:22 GMT","

If anyone asks Rose Lavelle of her dream vacation, she simply answers, “Cincinnati, Ohio.”

The love Lavelle has for her hometown makes her homecoming all the sweeter. Lavelle and the USWNT face the Republic of Ireland at TQL Stadium on Sunday at 3 p.m. ET, and the midfielder relishes the opportunity to return and play in front of a hometown crowd.

“I love being home as much as possible,” Lavelle said. “I'm really excited to show everybody else what a great place it is, what a great atmosphere the stadium is.”

The city shaped Lavelle into the person and player she's become. Lavelle recalls the U.S. Women's National Team visiting Cincinnati when she was a child in October 2004. The U.S. beat New Zealand 6-0 in an international friendly in front of more than 18,000 fans, and a young Lavelle was forever changed.

“I already was obsessed with them, but I think being able to see Mia Hamm, Julie [Foudy], Kristine Lilly, all of them in person just made me really, really want to be in their shoes one day,” Lavelle said. “I kind of credit that moment to helping inspire me to get here.”

Hamm and Lilly scored in the shutout victory as the USWNT was just months removed from winning its second Olympic gold medal. Now, Lavelle is in their shoes, almost a year after helping the U.S. earn its fifth gold medal. It was the midfielder's first significant tournament win since the 2019 World Cup.

Lavelle played once before in her favorite place in 2021, where she scored a goal and recorded three assists in the USA's 8-0 rout over Paraguay. This time, she's coming off an ankle injury that required surgery in January 2025. While she says she doesn't feel 100 percent, that didn't stop her from taking over the first match against Ireland. In her first game back, Lavelle contributed a goal and an assist.

“Rose is a world-class football player,” head coach Emma Hayes said. “I've said it so many times, when I came into this job, she was probably the one player I was really looking forward to working with. I think the structure in the team has allowed her game to elevate to another level, and what we saw the other night was how much we've missed her.”

On Thursday against Ireland, she became the 19th player in USWNT history to record 25 or more goals and assists, joining the likes of Hamm, Lilly and Foudy — the same players she grew up idolizing. Now, Lavelle hopes to be that inspiration to young soccer fans.

“I feel like it's kind of a full-circle moment to be able to give back to the sport in the same way that it gave to me,” Lavelle said. “Hopefully, every girl and boy in Cincinnati can look up to me and realize that they can be in this position, too.”

The U.S. Women's National Team returns to action on Sunday, facing Ireland in an international friendly as part of their ongoing preparation for future competitions.

This will be the second meeting in three days between the U.S. and Ireland. In the first match, the USWNT earned a dominant 4-0 win, with goals from Avery Patterson, Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, and Alyssa Thompson.

The U.S. Women's National Team dominated their previous match against Ireland, outshooting them 28 to 1, holding 68% of the possession, and completing 526 passes to Ireland's 258. The USWNT will aim for a similar performance in Sunday's rematch as they continue building momentum ahead of official competitions later this year.

Before their win against Ireland, the USWNT had picked up a 4-0 win over Jamaica, with goals from Ally Sentnor and Lynn Biyendolo. Before that, the U.S. took down China 3-0, thanks to goals from Catarina Macario, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Heaps.

The program is focused on developing its next generation of stars, as several key veterans begin to age out of international play. And while there will be some bumps along the way, like the 2-1 loss to Brazil on April 8, despite a first-minute goal from Macario, the overall trajectory for the U.S. remains positive.

Catch the USWNT back in action on Sunday at 2:30 p.m. ET, live from TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio, as they face the Republic of Ireland. The match will air on NBC Universo.

Pittsburgh Union Progress


					Published by striking workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.				

Like many preteen girls across southwestern Pennsylvania at the time, Meghan Klingenberg had been anxiously anticipating the night of July 10, 1999.

“My best friend came over because we were going to go to the *NSYNC concert,” she recalled.

There was just one problem.

“As an 11-year-old girl at that time *NSYNC was the most important thing in the world,” Klingenberg said. “What my best friend didn't know was that it was actually the second most important thing in the world to me; the first was the U.S. Women's National Team.”

Before heading out from their Gibsonia residence to see Justin Timberlake and his bandmates take to the stage at Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre — as it was then known — in Burgettstown, the Klingenberg family had some additional business on their agenda.

The United States Women's National Team was set to square off in the 1999 Women's World Cup final against China with more than 90,000 soccer fans in attendance at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., and many more tuned in on televisions across the country.

It was the first major event of the day for a local family of soccer fanatics.

“I think my friend was like, ‘When are we leaving?'” Klingenberg said. “My whole family was like, ‘Girl, sorry, we ain't leaving until this is over. We ended up watching Brandi Chastain hit the final [penalty kick], make it, win, and then after that we went to the *NSYNC concert.

“We actually ended up making it because *NSYNC came on so late,” she added. “We got the best of both worlds.”

It wouldn't be too long before Klingenberg was making history of her own on the world's stage.

Once a rabid fan, Klingenberg played every minute for the same U.S. Women's National Team she grew up idolizing on its run to the 2015 Women's World Cup title before becoming a full fledged Portland, Ore., sports icon, winning championships with National Women Soccer League's Thorns in 2017 and '22.

The Pine-Richland product — who helped the Rams win a PIAA title in 2005 — wrapped up an illustrious playing career by retiring earlier this month. She made the announcement official in an Instagram post.

It was a bittersweet moment for a player who rose to prominence on southwestern Pennsylvania's soccer pitches, who won two NCAA Division I women's soccer championships at North Carolina and got to have the local sports memory of a lifetime when she waved a “Terrible Towel” on the turf at Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium) after scoring a goal in an exhibition match with the U.S. Women's National Team in 2015.

“Those moments are just so lovely and special but, for me, if I was only playing for those moments I would have quit a long time ago,” Klingenberg said. “There's really not enough of those moments to sustain you. To me, it was about the friendships that I got to make with [former U.S. Women's National Team players] Becky Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe and people like that who have become really great friends.

“It's the thing that you never really expect, but it really does become so intertwined in the fabric of your life,” she added of soccer. “It's just provided me with so many amazing people and moments and friends.”

Family ties

While soccer would eventually take her around the world, Klingenberg said her love of the game was rooted in humble beginnings.

“Honestly, when I was first playing, I was terrible,” she said.

Klingenberg said her earliest memories of playing soccer came in the backyard of her maternal grandmother, who would host four generations of her family nearly every Sunday for dinner.

“She used to cook dinner, and my great-aunt used to bake pies,” Klingenberg said. “Everyone would come over and drink lemonade and eat good food and laugh really loud and talk about what was going on in our lives. The kids would play in the backyard, and a lot of times what we would do is just play all of the sports. My cousins, they started playing soccer in the backyard, and I was, like, ‘What is this?' I started playing with them.”

Before too long, Klingenberg said her parents had signed her up to play in a local youth league.

“I started playing, and I realized I was just so much worse than all of my peers,” she said. “I remember running over to my parents and being like, ‘Is it OK if I just stick with softball?' They were like, ‘Yeah, it's totally fine. You can play whatever you want to play.' I don't remember the reason why I ended up sticking it out with soccer, but I did. It became my favorite sport pretty quickly, and I would have just such a blast with my friends playing it.”

Fitting in

By the time she got to Pine-Richland High School, then-Rams coach Jodi Chmielewski said Klingenberg had become a force to reckon with on the WPIAL soccer scene.

“At the level when I got her, I definitely think everyone knew that she had Division I potential at that point,” said Chmielewski, who won more than 300 games, two WPIAL championships and a PIAA title during her 21-year tenure at Pine-Richland. “Just her speed, her level of compete, I think, stood out among everybody and just her technical ability and tactical awareness.”

Chmielewski said her drive to succeed was nearly unparalleled among players she coached.

“She just dreamed so big in terms of the national team and UNC and just kept meeting all those goals and exceeding them,” Chmielewski said. “Just her work rate and her focus and her passion for the game, that all can only be attributed to her achieving all that success at all those levels.”

Klingenberg played four seasons under Chmielewski and was a captain and starter of the Rams' 2005 PIAA championship team. She assisted on the goal that won the state title game before being named NSCAA and Parade All-American selections the following season in 2006.

“She was just so dynamic on the field,” Chmielewski said. “She was small, and I think that was what was pretty cool, too. She was small, but she was just so competitive. Her size didn't hold her back, and I think it gave her that fire to achieve more.”

Mastering her game

And that was certainly the case at North Carolina.

Klingenberg scored 18 goals, with 24 assists, during her four-year career in Chapel Hill. Although she played several positions under legendary coach Anson Dorrance, Klingenberg eventually settled in as a left back in the Tar Heels defensive unit.

“She just kept grinding and grinding and grinding and just wanted to be the best player she could possibly be,” said Dorrance, who won 1,106 games and 21 NCAA championships during a 47-year career leading his alma mater's women's soccer program. “As a result she did. Obviously, there are a lot of national team players that ascended because of their extraordinary talent, but Meghan ascended because of her extraordinary will, not because she was blessed with every conceivable quality. She's not that tall. She's quick, but not explosively fast. She did it by working on her skill set, mastering the ball. She became a very tactical player.”

Klingenberg said her time at North Carolina was critical to her development.

“Carolina was such an amazing experience all around,” she said. “School, soccer, socially, everything about it, I loved. Being there was one of the best moments in time in my life and in my career.

“I did finally feel free to be my authentic self,” she said. “I felt free to be as competitive as I was without judgment. I felt free to absolutely kick ass. I felt free to express myself in ways that I was never able to before because it was looked down upon in women, in girls. That environment, it wasn't looked down upon. In fact, it was celebrated.”

Klingenberg was part of NCAA championship teams in 2008 and 2009 at North Carolina and won three Atlantic Coast Conference titles. She said getting to build a relationship with Dorrance — who also coached the U.S. Women's National team from 1986 until 1994 and won a World Cup in 1991 — was critical to her development.

“One of the best things that he did in the culture was let everyone know how much he cares about you,” Klingenberg said. “He put everyone's human development first over their soccer development. He was able to see the humanity in each of the players.”

Dorrance said he is proud of the player and person Klingenberg has become.

“At her best, she was considered the best left back in the world,” he said. “I just think she had an absolutely extraordinary ascension but, also, a career. The other thing about Meghan is I just really liked her. She was funny. She was full of piss and vinegar.”

The next level

Klingenberg said making the U.S. Women's National team was a dream come true.

“I don't know why I had deluded myself into thinking this, but I always thought I was going to make it,” she said.

Klingenberg was the starting left back for the 2015 World Cup championship team. She remained with the team when it placed fifth in the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janiero, Brazil.

“I don't think that there's ever been another team in the history of soccer or sport that has been so successful over such a long period of time,” said Klingenberg of the U.S. Women's National team. “I can't remember the last time that we've dropped below a Top 5 ranking in the world, maybe never. That has to be a unique stat.”

Such success has also brought about ways for members of the U.S. Women's National team to create positive change in their communities.

From championing equal play for women in professional sports to creating awareness of LGBTQ issues in American society, U.S. Women's National team players have been at the forefront of activism over the past several decades.

For Klingenberg, dealing with mental health issues and the various stressors, which come along with competing a high level have also been critical to her as a professional athlete. She said she hopes to continue to bring awareness to mental health concerns in her retirement.

“Being able to pull on a jersey and stand for the things that are the best part of the United States was something that was really special,” Klingenberg said. “It creates a different kind of bond with somebody because it's not something that most people get to experience in their lifetime.”

Klingenberg is also a 10-year veteran of the NWSL, playing two seasons with the Houston Dash, before starring for eight years in Portland. She logged 11,619 minutes with the Thorns and started 135 of her 149 appearances.

In addition to Portland's two NWSL championships during her tenure, Klingenberg's teams finished with the league's best regular-season record twice before her final professional contest in 2024.

“She's a role model in Portland for all of her years with the Thorns,” Chmielewski said. “I think it's pretty cool for her to have an impact on the game in so many different areas of the country.”

There's no doubt, though, the impact Klingenberg has had on soccer in her hometown.

“It's been cool to be able to watch from a distance and watch her in each of those different arenas and areas and just continue to excel and break those barriers,” Chmielewski said. “I'm just extremely proud of her. I know her family, obviously, are her biggest fans. She's created fans around the world and with young female players it's been great for our area for her to be the first really female player to achieve that success at that level. Our hope is there's many more to follow her.”

The future

Klingenberg said she is going to take the next year to evaluate her next steps and what her future might hold. At just 36, Klingenberg said she has plenty more in store.

U.S. Soccer, though, launched a new podcast June 9, which is hosted by David Gass and co-hosted by Klingenberg and Alejandro Bedoya. The podcast is intended to highlight the men's and women's U.S. national teams and the inside stories surrounding the teams.

“If there is anything that people take from my career, I truly hope that being yourself and just being you, you're doing the very best thing that you could possibly do for your performance and your mental health,” she said.

Dorrance said he could see Klingenberg succeeding as a broadcaster or in coaching.

“Everything she achieves, she achieves through the sweat of her brow,” he said. “Meghan worked hard and then earned absolutely everything she got.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Diversity is not what's dragging down U.S. men's national team. Data proves it","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2025/06/29/usmnt-diversity-gold-cup-opinion/84394488007/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 10:08:21 GMT","

Corrections and clarifications: England won the World Cup in 1966. An earlier version of this story stated an incorrect year.

Whatever is wrong with the U.S. men's national team, and pull up a chair because there's lots to discuss, diversity isn't it.

That's not just an aspirational statement. There are studies to prove it. In fact, researchers who've looked at both club and national teams across the world recently found diversity actually made squads better.

""Previous research, they found a negative impact, not because of the diversity itself but how to put the team together. When you merge several players from different countries with different language, you create a barrier that makes it, at some extent, difficult to perform,"" said Thadeu Gasparetto, author of a paper published earlier this month titled ""Multicultural teams: Does national diversity associate with performance in professional soccer?""

""More recent research is showing pretty much the opposite, where the diversity provides a set of different skills … different codes that tends to be positive.”

With less than a year until the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico, which U.S. Soccer officials hope will be as transformative for the game as the 1994 tournament was, the ""golden generation” of the U.S. men's national team is struggling. To put it nicely.

Most of their top players, led by Christian Pulisic, are playing in Europe. Several on top teams, no less. Their coach is Mauricio Pochettino, who took Tottenham to the Champions League final.

Yet the USMNT skidded into the Concacaf Gold Cup on a four-game losing streak, its longest since 2007. Then team reached the quarterfinals of the tournament, but Sunday's game against Costa Rica will be the first real test.

As players, fans and pundits look for answers, former USMNT player and pot stirrer extraordinaire Alexi Lalas blamed the team's diversity. In addition to players from across the United States, the USMNT — like many other national teams — has multiple players who were born or raised overseas.

""I've argued that the homogeneous nature of some other countries and cultures, just in population in terms of the size, are much more manageable and there's a collective understanding and, more importantly, an agreement in, 'This is how we're going to play,'” said Lalas, who makes no secret of his willingness to be a right-wing media provocateur.

“But getting 11 men to represent this great country of 350 million people and all be on the same page, that is very, very difficult.”

Except it's really not. And there is both data, and anecdotal evidence, to prove it.

Gasparetto examined six professional leagues in Europe — England, Belgium, Germany, Cyprus, Latvia and the Netherlands — between the 2015-16 and 2020-21 seasons and found that each foreign player on a team correlated with a 0.42% increase in win percentage.

“It's much more about how well or how qualified the players are rather than where he or she's from,” Gasparetto said.

His findings are similar to those in a study by Michel Beine, Silvia Peracchi and Skerdilajda Zanaj that looked at ancestral diversity and its impact on a national team's performance. ""Ancestral diversity and performance: Evidence from football data,"" published in the Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization in September 2023, found ethnic diversity can lead to an additional goal scored per game.

“The idea is, basically, that more genetic diversity is going to allow more complementary skills between players,” Beine said. “Soccer is a game in which complementary skills is very important because you have different positions and these different positions, they require different type of skills. … These complementarities, these different type of skills are going to be beneficial for the team.”

Look at France. Les Bleus won the men's World Cup in 2018 and were runners-up in 2022 with a team that was a melting pot. In addition to players whose parents and grandparents and great-grandparents and — you get the idea — were born in France, about half the team was born in Africa or the French Caribbean, or had parents who were.

England, much to the country's consternation, endured decades of frustration after winning the World Cup in 1966. But it has reached the final at the last two European Championship and got to the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup with a multiracial team. Belgium had its best finish ever at the World Cup in 2018, third place, with a team that reflected the influence of immigration to that country in the 1950s and 1960s.

Conversely, teams that are homogenous — Iceland, for example, or Japan — don't fare as well.

“This mixing, in terms of skills, in terms of genetic endowment, we show in the statistical analysis that, over time, countries benefited from immigration flows and diverse immigration flows. … They improved their soccer performances,” Beine said. “On the contrary, you have countries who had very little immigration flows and who have kept quite a homogeneous population … maybe they have less benefited from this.”

Soccer is a global game — and not only because it's played everywhere in the world. Players routinely move from country to country in their club careers, and that is likely to have far more influence than the country in which they were born or the neighborhood in which they grew up.

Lionel Messi was born in Argentina, moved to Spain at 13 and spent two decades at Barcelona before going to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain. Now he's in the United States, playing for Inter Miami. Do you really think him being from Rosario has more of an impact on Argentina's national team than what he learned at Barcelona?

""The evidence is very clear that diversity is something that can be beneficial. And it is a little bit overlooked by people,” Beine said. “I think that sometimes people are not looking at the evidence. Or they are closing their eyes on what is really obvious.”

And that is that. The USMNT, much like the country it represents, is better for its diversity.

The United States Men's National Team (USMNT) continues it's quest for a Gold Cup title as they face Costa Rica in the quarterfinals on Sunday night.

USMNT dominated during group stage play, winning all three matches and outscoring their opponents 8-1 in the process.

Since the bi-annual tournament was restructured to the Gold Cup in 1991, it's been dominated by the United States or Mexico, with the two countries winning 16 of the 17 tournaments over the last 34 years. The lone exception came when Canada won it all in 2000.

Costa Rica played well during the group stage, winning two one-goal affairs and a scoreless draw against Mexico in the final tune up before the elimination round.

After a fourth place finish in 2023, will the USMNT bounce back and compete for a Gold Cup title?

It all starts for the United States against Costa Rica with elimination now on the line.

The U.S. men's national team is in the knockout stages of the Concacaf Gold Cup and is looking to continue its good form in the tournament when it takes on Costa Rica in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Sunday night.

While Mauricio Pochettino's team entered the tournament with doubts after four straight losses, it thrived in the group stage, beating each of Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti to emerge as the top seed. 

Now, they take on one of the stronger Concacaf sides in Costa Rica, who finished second in their group to Mexico. While Los Ticos aren't quite at the level as they were 11 summers ago in Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, they will still provide a formidable opponent in the quarterfinal. 

Here's everything you need to know about that clash.

The U.S. men's national team have been able to quiet some of the noise a year out from the FIFA World Cup 2026 on home soil, given a stellar group stage which saw standout performances from several players. 

While Pochettino has adjusted his lineup through each match, attacking midfielder Malik Tillman and central midfielder Sebastian Berhalter have been two of the tournament's standouts, while center back Chris Richards has continued his elite level of leadership at the back. 

Expect the USMNT to rely on strong play from those three against Costa Rica, and to likely turn to Charlotte FC's Patrick Agyemang up top, after he scored against Haiti to clinch the perfect group stage with his second goal of the tournament. 

However, lineup decisions could be impacted by yellow card accumulation worries, as each of Berhalter and Tyler Adams would be suspended for the semifinal if they pick up one more caution.

As much as success at the Gold Cup has been of primary importance for the group donning the Stars and Stripes, there have also been recent transfer links for several players, including Agyemang's rumored move to Derby County and Tillman's links with Bayer Leverkusen, both of which have yet to come to fruition. 

After allowing just one goal through the group stage, the USMNT will hope to shut down Costa Rica's attack and keep their stingy form to clinch a spot in challenging matchups which await in the semifinals and final. 

USMNT predicted lineup vs. Saudi Arabia (4-2-3-1): Freese; Freeman, Richards, Ream, Arfsten; Berhalter, de la Torre; McGlynn, Tillman, Luna; Agyemang.

Costa Rica came within a chance of winning the group, finishing just one goal behind Mexico after a scoreless draw in their matchup. However, now they enter the quarterfinal with a chance to take down a very beatable USMNT. 

Head coach Miguel Herrera's side opened the Gold Cup with a thrilling comeback 4–3 win over Suriname, and pushed past an upstart Dominican Republic 2–1 to book their place in the quarterfinals. At the same time, they have continuously improved in 2025, with strong results in Concacaf World Cup qualifying before the Gold Cup. 

Should they find success against the USMNT, they will likely look to leading scorer Manfred Ugalde, who has three goals in as many games at the tournament, as well as New York City FC attacker Alonso Martínez, who has eight goals in 16 MLS matches this season. 

At the back, former Real Madrid star Keylor Navas continues to hold on to the starting goalkeeper position, and has maintained his form even in his waning playing years at 38 years old. 

It won't be an easy task for Costa Rica, especially with the expected crowd in Minnesota, but it won't be impossible. 

Costa Rica Predicted Lineup vs. USMNT (5-3-2): Navas; C. Mora, Mitchell, Vargas, Gamboa, Calvo; Aguilera, Galo, Alcocer; Martinez, Zamora

It's definitly not the easiest quarterfinal draw for either side, but given the advantage of playing at home and the stingy defensive form through the group stage, the USMNT likely hold the advantage against Los Ticos. However, American supporters should be prepared for some concerning moments, as it won't be a comfortable win. 

Score Prediction: USMNT 1–0 Costa Rica

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","The USMNT's Mentality Heading into Gold Cup Quarterfinal","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/06/usmnt-mentality-concacaf-gold-cup-quarterfinal-malik-tillman","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 17:31:26 GMT","

Entering the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup group stage, the U.S. Men's National Team had one aim: to win all three matches.

The Americans accomplished the objective, trouncing Trinidad and Tobago 5-0, overcoming Saudi Arabia 1-0 and finishing off Haiti 2-1.

“Nine points in three games, you can't write it any better than that,” midfielder Brenden Aaronson said. “... I think that we're really flying at the moment.”

Aaronson scored a goal in the first match off the bench and tallied an assist in the third game. Midfielder Malik Tillman came away with three goals, tied for No. 1 in the tournament, and striker Patrick Agyemang scored two goals to lead the USA with a total of five goals in 2025. 

The United States and Panama are the only teams to finish the group stage with nine points. The USMNT is also tied with Canada for allowing the fewest goals (one) in the first three games.

Up next, the USA will face a formidable Costa Rica June 29 at 7 p.m. ET at U.S. Bank Stadium. Costa Rica finished Group A in second place. Los Ticos won two games then drew with defending Gold Cup champion Mexico, who took the group's top spot.

Five Costa Rica players were shown yellow cards in the third group match. Defender Joseph Mora and forward Manfred Ugalde picked up a second yellow and won't be available against the USA. Mora and Ugalde accounted for four of Costa Rica's six goals in the first phase.

However, that shouldn't cause a relatively inexperienced USMNT team to grow complacent. After falling to UEFA opponents in the June international window, the group wants to keep building confidence.

“The steps that we've made are huge from two not great results with Turkey and Switzerland. It's tough. You get down on yourself,” Aaronson said. “What I see from this group is that bounce-back mentality. You come into the tournament, you could let it bother you, you can let the negativity bother you, but I think the biggest thing with this group is we tune everything out and we just keep going.”

Not only that, they're not satisfied with just three wins. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino liked the second-half effort versus Haiti, entering the final 45 minutes tied 1-1. The U.S. scored the go-ahead goal after two attempts were called back. Still, the head coach said his team wanted to score more.

 “It's definitely something to build on. It's definitely something positive,” Tillman said. “In the end, the game was so close, so maybe we have to score more goals.”

After playing six games in about two weeks, the USMNT has some time to prepare for its quarterfinal opponent. When the USA's Gold Cup Quarterfinal kicks off Sunday from Minneapolis, it'll be one week since they last played, so the USMNT will have fresh legs to take on its next challenge. 

“Our goal was to win all three, and we did so,” Agyemang said. “That's the minimum. That's what we were hoping for. So now, we go to the next round.”

No head coach wants the focus to be on them heading into critical knockout games. Yet, that situation couldn't be avoided for Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the U.S. men's national team's Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal against Costa Rica. 

Early on Saturday, a report from Ireland suggested that Pochettino had interviewed for the Brentford managerial position, which the club's former set-piece coach Keith Andrews has since filled. However, according to Pochettino himself and multiple sources, the Premier League club never reached out, let alone proceeded with an interview. 

“This club never contacted me,” Pochettino told Fox Sports. “I never talked to them.”

Previously a coach with Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton and Espanyol, Pochettino signed with the USMNT in September 2024 with the goal of leading the team through the 2026 FIFA World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

While he could feasibly have been a candidate for Brentford as they looked to fill the vacancy left by Thomas Frank's appointment at Tottenham, the Premier League side would have needed to go through U.S. Soccer to engage in talks if they wanted to pursue his services. 

While Pochettino's USMNT have looked good at the Gold Cup with group stage wins against Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti and Saudi Arabia, it has not been all smooth for the Argentine boss since taking over.

Heading into the tournament, he became the first USMNT manager since 2007 to lose four straight games, following disappointing performances against Panama, Canada, Switzerland and Turkey. 

Additionally, there has also been the issue with Christian Pulisic and other star players, who are not on the American Gold Cup squad. For Pulisic, the decision came down to resting after a long season with AC Milan. However, in a CBS Sports, he added that he had wanted to play in the pre-Gold Cup friendlies against UEFA opponents, but Pochettino denied his request. 

“When I signed my contract in the federation, I am the head coach. I am not a mannequin,” Pochettino hit back. “Players need to listen and to stick with our plan. They cannot dictate the plan.”

Boasting an 8–3 record with the USMNT, Pochettino will hope to lead the team past Costa Rica on Sunday and into a semifinal, where they would face either Canada or Guatemala for a spot in the Gold Cup final on July 6 in Houston.

U.S. Men's National Soccer Team star Timothy Weah has opened up about what he described as the “weird” experience of standing behind Donald Trump in the Oval Office while the president fielded questions on the Iran-Israel war and attacked the idea of transgender women competing in women's sports.

Weah was at the White House with his Juventus teammates on Wednesday as part of a promotional event for the FIFA Club World Cup, ahead of the Italian side's 5-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates' Al-Ain FC.

Trump invited questions from reporters about the game and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. will host alongside Mexico and Canada.

But the Juventus players stood uncomfortably behind POTUS as he instead answered queries about the more pressing political questions of the day.

Weah, the son of former Liberian soccer star-turned-former president George Weah, later told reporters that the players had been made to attend the event.

“They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go,” he explained, reported The Athletic.

“I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird,” he added. “When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it's kind of like, I just want to play football, man.”

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup continues its slate of round of 16 matches Sunday, with Bayern Munich and Flamengo battling it out at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.

Bayern, long the dominant force in the Bundesliga, opened their Club World Cup with a 10-0 demolition of Auckland City FC. The Bavarians then eked out a 2-1 victory over Boca Juniors, but fell 1-0 to Benfica, settling for the second spot in Group C. Club legend Thomas Müller is set to exit Bayern when this tournament ends, and the team is motivated to send him out with one more trophy.

Flamengo, Brazil's most popular club, knocked off Chelsea 3-1 in one of the Club World Cup's biggest upsets thus far. The Rio de Janeiro-based side also defeated Espérance Sportive de Tunis, but needed a late equalizer against LAFC to seal the top spot in Group D. Their reward?

Resting up to play in a record sixth World Cup was more important to Cristiano Ronaldo than switching teams to play in the Club World Cup.

""I had some offers to play (Club) World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long, because this is the season of the World Cup, at the end of the season,"" Ronaldo said in an Instagram video posted by his Saudi Arabian club, Al Nassr, after signing a two-year extension. ""So I want to be ready not only for Al Nassr but also for the national team.""

The 40-year-old Ronaldo helped Portugal to the Nations League trophy with a penalty shootout win over Spain three weeks ago as speculation swirled that he would transfer to another club to play in the Club World Cup currently being contested in the United States.

He and longtime Argentina rival Lionel Messi could be the first players to appear in six World Cups at next year's tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In Qatar three years ago, Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five World Cups.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's extension with Al Nassr means he will play on until at least the age of 42.

It's clear that Jurgen Klopp did not have anything nice to say about the expanded FIFA Club World Cup.

During an interview with German publication Die Welt published on Friday, Klopp said the tournament “the worst idea ever implemented” in the sport.

The new format now features a 32-team event, which occurs every four years during the preseason in the summers between the major international tournaments.

The 2025 Club World Cup, which is being hosted by the United States, started earlier this month and is set to conclude on July 13.

“It's a pointless competition. Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they'll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league,” Klopp said.

“There are people who have never been involved in the day-to-day business of football and are now coming up with ideas,” he added.

Klopp, who was at the helm for Liverpool from 2015-24, also pointed out that players today do not get enough time to rest, saying that adding another tournament could be dangerous for their health.

“It's too many games. I fear that next season we will see injuries like never before. If not then, they'll come during or after the Club World Cup,” Klopp said.

The 58-year-old added: “There's no real recovery for those involved, neither physically nor mentally.”

Since moving on from coaching, Klopp now serves as the head of global soccer for Red Bull, which owns several clubs such as the New York Red Bulls in the MLS and RB Leipzig in the Bundesliga.

When asked if he was interested in a potential return to coaching, Klopp shut down the idea, saying that  his new job “fufills” him.

“I don't want that anymore,” he said. “I have a job now that fulfils me and is also intense. I don't sleep in the morning and I don't go to bed later at night, but I can organize my work much better.”

    Lionel Messi and co look to cause an upset against his former club.
  

It's a blockbuster FIFA Club World Cup clash at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta today as Inter Miami GOAT Lionel Messi faces off against his old club PSG.

Below, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens, wherever you are in the world. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full match list. 

Despite his advancing years, the Argentine legend has been in fine form during this tournament, with the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner looking particularly in Miami's 2-1 win over Porto.

Today's match against the new European champions looks set to provide a sterner challenge for Miami, however the Parisians shock defeat to Botafogo in their second match should give Messi and co hope of pulling off a major upset. 

Paris Saint-Germain takes on Inter Miami on Sunday, June 29, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Kickoff is set for 12 p.m. ET or 9 a.m. PT. That makes it a 5 p.m. BST start in the UK and an 2 a.m. AEST kickoff in Australia on Monday morning. 

Lionel Messi made 75 appearances and contributed 32 goals and 35 assists during his time as a PSG player between 2021 and 2023. 

The great news for footy fans is that sports streaming platform DAZN is set to broadcast all 63 matches of the FIFA Club World Cup free in almost every country, with coverage available in multiple languages.

Existing DAZN subscribers or Freemium members can watch every game of the tournament as part of their current membership.

If you're not a member, it's easy to sign up for a free DAZN Freemium account using your email address to watch all the action at no cost through the DAZN app.

If you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with all the FIFA Club World Cup soccer action while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy and security when streaming. 

It encrypts your traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds. It can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of protection for your devices and logins. VPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy and security. 

However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN use to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance. 

If you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN use is crucial.

ExpressVPN is our current best VPN pick for people who want a reliable and safe VPN that works on a variety of devices. It's normally $13 a month, but if you sign up for an annual subscription for $100, you'll get three months free and save 49%. That's the equivalent of $6.67 a month.

Note that ExpressVPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Footy fans in the UK have a second, free option for watching FIFA Club World Cup matches, in addition to DAZN.

Free-to-air broadcaster Channel 5 is set to show 23 select features live during the tournament, including this fixture.

Resting up to play in a record sixth World Cup was more important to Cristiano Ronaldo than switching teams to play in the Club World Cup.

""I had some offers to play (Club) World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long, because this is the season of the World Cup, at the end of the season,"" Ronaldo said in an Instagram video posted by his Saudi Arabian club, Al Nassr, after signing a two-year extension. ""So I want to be ready not only for Al Nassr but also for the national team.""

The 40-year-old Ronaldo helped Portugal to the Nations League trophy with a penalty shootout win over Spain three weeks ago as speculation swirled that he would transfer to another club to play in the Club World Cup currently being contested in the United States.

He and longtime Argentina rival Lionel Messi could be the first players to appear in six World Cups at next year's tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In Qatar three years ago, Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five World Cups.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's extension with Al Nassr means he will play on until at least the age of 42.

Cristiano Ronaldo recently penned a new deal with Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr. The Portuguese superstar has been tied down to one of the most lucrative contracts in sports history.

Ronaldo's current deal was set to expire in June and had been linked with a move away from the Saudi Pro League club for some time. There were rumors that several Club World Cup sides were interested in the 40-year-old.

Ronaldo has confirmed those claims. However, he preferred to rest as he wanted to stay fresh for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That played a major role in Ronaldo deciding to renew his deal with Al-Nassr. Speaking to the club's media, Ronaldo said:

Cristiano Ronaldo has just won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal. He is now aiming to claim the only missing major title from his trophy cabinet, the FIFA World Cup. Hence, after a Nations League campaign and a long 2024-25 season, it might have been a smart decision for Ronaldo to keep himself rested.

As for his performances for Al-Nassr, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner continues to produce regular goal contributions. He boasts a record of 93 goals and 19 assists in 105 appearances for the Saudi Pro League club so far.

Portuguese star says he'd rather prepare himself for a ‘very long' season, which ends with the FIFA World Cup 2026.

Cristiano Ronaldo says he preferred to take a rest rather than play in the revamped FIFA Club World Cup as he aims to prolong his playing career for club and country.

The Portuguese international, who recently led his country to the UEFA Nations League title, made the comments on Saturday, two days after extending his stay at Saudi Pro League side Al Nassr.

Al Nassr announced on Thursday that Ronaldo had signed a two-year contract which would keep him at the club past his 42nd birthday and possibly his last appearance in the FIFA World Cup at its next iteration in the United States, Canada and Mexico in 2026.

Speculation over the 40-year-old's plans intensified last month when FIFA President Gianni Infantino said discussions were under way about Ronaldo playing in the Club World Cup, despite Al Nassr failing to qualify, but the star forward swiftly brushed them aside.

“I had some offers to play in the [Club] World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long as it is the World Cup season at the end of the year,” Ronaldo said in a video posted by Al Nassr on X.

“I want to be ready not only for Al Nassr but also for the national team. So, this is why I decided to play the last game for the Nations League and not listen to anything,” he added.

“And of course, to be in this club, which I love”.

— AlNassr FC (@AlNassrFC_EN) June 26, 2025



Ronaldo scored for Portugal in the Nations League final against Spain earlier this month, which ended 2-2 before his side went on to beat the European champions on penalties.

The Portugal captain said his aim in staying at Al Nassr was to win a major trophy with the Riyadh-based side.

“My goal, it's always to win something important for Al-Nassr. And of course I still believe in that,” Ronaldo added. “This is why I renewed the two years more because I believe that I will be a champion in Saudi Arabia.”

Ronaldo, who joined Al Nassr in 2022 after leaving Manchester United as a free agent, has scored 93 goals in 105 appearances for them in all competitions.

Ronaldo is also eyeing the 1,000-goal milestone in his career. He has scored 794 goals in club football and 138 for Portugal, taking his tally to 932.

The £60 million-rated Brighton star is leaning toward a move to Stamford Bridge, with Chelsea intensifying negotiations after their initial £58 million bid was rebuffed by the Seagulls.

Cristiano Ronaldo has explained why he turned down “some offers” from teams at the FIFA Club World Cup in order to sign a new contract with Al-Nassr.

After seeing his previous deal in Riyadh run down, five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo has committed to more record-breaking terms that ensure he remains the highest-paid sports star on the planet.

Ronaldo had been heavily linked with a move away from Al-Nassr before agreeing to stay put, with the evergreen 40-year-old said to have grown frustrated with the lack of tangible success that he has enjoyed over the last two-and-a-half years.

A number of sides from South America and Europe that have figured at the Club World Cup in the United States expressed interest in CR7. He was, however, to shun those advances in favour of enjoying a relaxed summer break with partner Georgina Rodriguez and his children.

Ronaldo has told Al-Nassr's official media team: “I had some offers to play in the World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long as it is the World Cup season at the end of the year.

“I want to be ready not only for Al-Nassr but also for the national team. So, this is why I decided to play the last game for the Nations League and not listen to anything. And of course, to be in this club, which I love.”

Ronaldo has signed a new two-year deal with Al-Nassr that will take him beyond his 42nd birthday. He continues to chase down 1,000 career goals and will be hoping to land an elusive global title when captaining Portugal at the 2026 World Cup.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United wonderkid JJ Gabriel, dubbed “Kid Messi” at Old Trafford, has reportedly agreed an extended stay with the Red Devils.

There were fears that the 14-year-old could look to move on this summer after attracting interest from across Europe. Several Premier League clubs are said to be monitoring the talented youngster.

Gabriel holds an Irish passport - allowing him to play in the European Union from the age of 16, instead of 18 - and that is said to have brought him to the attention of La Liga giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, along with Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.

A rival academy scout has told the Daily Mail of hot prospect Gabriel: “United is a big club, a huge club, and it fits JJ's profile and JJ fits United's profile, he's something they haven't got at all. But United have to be careful they don't get things wrong with him. They know they are in a fight to keep him.”

The Mail are now reporting that London-born Gabriel - who has spent time in the youth ranks at Chelsea, Arsenal and West Ham - has committed his future to the United. It is claimed that “the 14-year-old looked set to leave this summer before a crucial intervention from Jason Wilcox and Matt Hargreaves. Key meetings in past week swung it.”

While being billed as “Kid Messi”, Gabriel is considered to be more of a Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar clone. He impressed CR7 after joining United in the same summer of 2021 and has also spent time in the company of Barcelona wonderkid Lamine Yamal.

ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during Wimbledon.

Shintaro Mochizuki
The 22-year-old's ability to take the ball early, hit flat groundstrokes and finish points at net makes him a tricky opponent on grass, a surface on which Mochizuki has plenty of experience. In 2019, Mochizuki won the Wimbledon boys' singles event as a 16-year-old, becoming the first Japanese male player in history to win a junior Slam.

Mochizuki advanced through qualifying and will now look to improve upon his 10-2 grass-court record (across all levels) this season. He finished runner-up at the grass Nottingham Challenger, where former Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic beat Mochizuki to lift the trophy. Mochizuki also made the semi-finals in Ilkley.

Read our Mochizuki feature: Former junior No. 1 & conqueror of Alcaraz

Jack Pinnington Jones
One of the home hopes in the draw, Pinnington Jones showed his grass-court prowess and heavy firepower earlier this month by reaching the Ilkley Challenger final in just his fourth event at that level this season. The 22-year-old recently completed his junior season at Texas Christian University, following in the footsteps of countrymen Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley, who both played for TCU and are now inside the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings.

Pinnington Jones is turning pro and will look to seize a memorable moment in his first major main-draw appearance. A two-time ITA All-American, Pinnington Jones is a repeat qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which focuses on increasing the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system.

Henry Searle
The #NextGenATP British lefty will look to lean on home support while returning to the All England Club, where he is competing as a wild card for the second consecutive year. Flashback to 2023 and Searle was crowned champion at the Wimbledon boys' singles event, doing so without dropping a set. Searle, then 17, became the first British male since 1962 to win that junior tournament.
At 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Searle is trying to push for a qualifying spot for the 20-and-under the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Earlier this season, the Wolverhampton native reached his maiden Challenger final on indoor hard courts in Nottingham. Searle starts against American Ethan Quinn, who made the third round of Roland Garros as a qualifier and is at a career-high No. 89.
Leandro Riedi
The Swiss was overcome with emotion on Thursday when he advanced through qualifying to secure his first major main-draw appearance. Riedi's tears meant more than playing in the field of 128, but rather they were reflective of how difficult the past year has been for him. In 2024, Riedi let slip a two-sets-to-love lead in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying and even held a match point, but Australian Alex Bolt spoiled the party and claimed a dramatic five-set win.
Riedi then dealt with knee pain throughout the North American hard-court swing and opted for surgery in September, and needed another surgery in January. Riedi did not compete for nine months. This year's Wimbledon marks just the third tournament in his comeback. Riedi opens against Oliver Tarvet, with a potential showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz looming in the second round.
Filip Misolic
The Austrian has recently been enjoying some of his best form. Since May, Misolic is 20-2 across all levels, including a third-round run at Roland Garros as a qualifier, only falling to 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic.

Henry Searle
The #NextGenATP British lefty will look to lean on home support while returning to the All England Club, where he is competing as a wild card for the second consecutive year. Flashback to 2023 and Searle was crowned champion at the Wimbledon boys' singles event, doing so without dropping a set. Searle, then 17, became the first British male since 1962 to win that junior tournament.
At 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Searle is trying to push for a qualifying spot for the 20-and-under the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Earlier this season, the Wolverhampton native reached his maiden Challenger final on indoor hard courts in Nottingham. Searle starts against American Ethan Quinn, who made the third round of Roland Garros as a qualifier and is at a career-high No. 89.
Leandro Riedi
The Swiss was overcome with emotion on Thursday when he advanced through qualifying to secure his first major main-draw appearance. Riedi's tears meant more than playing in the field of 128, but rather they were reflective of how difficult the past year has been for him. In 2024, Riedi let slip a two-sets-to-love lead in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying and even held a match point, but Australian Alex Bolt spoiled the party and claimed a dramatic five-set win.
Riedi then dealt with knee pain throughout the North American hard-court swing and opted for surgery in September, and needed another surgery in January. Riedi did not compete for nine months. This year's Wimbledon marks just the third tournament in his comeback. Riedi opens against Oliver Tarvet, with a potential showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz looming in the second round.
Filip Misolic
The Austrian has recently been enjoying some of his best form. Since May, Misolic is 20-2 across all levels, including a third-round run at Roland Garros as a qualifier, only falling to 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Tien & Basavareddy: From under-8 opponents to a Wimbledon showdown","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tien-basavareddy-wimbledon-2025-fierce-feuds-feature","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 14:08:14 GMT","

 On 7 July 2024, Learner Tien and Nishesh Basavareddy were waiting to go on court for an ATP Challenger Tour final in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. Sat together in the event's player dining area, they were watching the ongoing Grand Slam action at Wimbledon on TV. 

 Less than 12 months later and the longtime friends will, for the first time, be a part of the main-draw action at the grass-court major. Not only that, the two #NextGenATP Americans will face off in the first round on Monday in what will be a real pinch-me moment for both. 

 “We were playing at 1 p.m. and we were eating lunch right before the match,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com, when asked what he remembered about that final day at Bloomfield Hills. “I think Ben Shelton was playing. We were watching it, so it's pretty crazy that we are now playing here.” 



 It was Tien, competing in his first Challenger final, who prevailed that day in Michigan, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Both players have since risen more than 260 spots in the PIF ATP Rankings, and they capped their respective 2024 seasons with a debut appearance at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. 

 “I think it's cool, it's kind of a full-circle thing,” reflected now-World No. 67 Tien on being drawn against Basavareddy at SW19. “Last year, about a week from now, we played in what was the first Challenger final of my career. We were both ranked 300-something, and we were in the dining area watching Wimbledon. 

 ""We were watching this event, and it's crazy to think that a year from then we are going to be playing first round here.”

 For many fans, a player hanging out with their opponent right before a final may seem like an oddity. Yet Basavareddy says it is not so with rivals such as Tien, against whom he has competed since they were kids in California. 

 “It's a little more common with your friends,” said the 20-year-old, who is now the World No. 100. “A lot of the guys you don't know as well on Tour. We warmed up together that day as well, so it was a strange day. 

 “It's a pretty unique draw, but it will be really fun. We played at like eight-and-under, 10-and-under, 12-and-under, so to finally be playing on one of the biggest stages in the world will be cool.” 

 Tien and Basavareddy have played only once more since Bloomfield Hills, last November at another Challenger event in Knoxville, Tennessee. Tien also prevailed on that occasion, but Basavareddy is hoping to quickly put his Challenger defeats to his friend behind him in order to make a positive start in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. 

 “I think our games match up pretty well,” said the 20-year-old. “We are both not the biggest servers, but we have a lot of baseline rallies. The matches last year were quite long, especially the first one in the final. He's a counterpuncher, he makes a lot of balls, and he's really smart out there, so he makes it tough on you. But we'll see how it goes.”

 While Tien would love to now transport his winning form against Basavareddy to Wimbledon, he won't be counting on his past Challenger successes against his fellow Californian as he looks to register his first major match win since his breakout run to the fourth round at January's Australian Open. 

 “I know that a lot of these guys, I'm going to be playing them a lot more in the future, so win or lose I don't think about it too much, I don't think,” said the 19-year-old when asked whether he felt making an ‘early statement' in a fledgling rivalry was important. “A match is a match. It doesn't carry so much weight.”

Jack Pinnington Jones fondly remembers the early mornings when Jack Draper would pick him up for training. Draper, then 17 years old, would swing by Pinnington Jones' house around 6:15 a.m. and make the 45-minute drive to the LTA National Tennis Centre in southwest London. The catch? Pinnington Jones' practice did not start until 11. 


So why the brutally early start and hours of waiting?


“He can't sit in traffic, or he'd hate to sit in traffic,” Pinnington Jones said of Draper, speaking with ATPTour.com earlier this month. “He'd also have to be doing something. So I'd be there at 7 a.m. with nothing to do. That's sort of how we met, got on really well. He's a good friend of mine and I always chat to him and get his opinion.”


Those drives sparked a bond between the two Jacks. Draper was new behind the wheel and also just beginning his professional career on the ATP Challenger Tour. Meanwhile, in the passenger seat, Pinnington Jones was sharpening his skills as a teenager, just 15 months younger than Draper.


It is a fun, full-circle memory for the two Britons, both set to compete at Wimbledon this fortnight. Draper carries the home hopes as the fourth seed while Pinnington Jones prepares for his major main-draw debut.




The 22-year-old Pinnington Jones completed his junior season at Texas Christian University in May and will not return to college. Instead, he is turning pro.


“Me and my coach have a little joke that, ‘I'll go pro after Wimbledon'. Like, let me just enjoy this time and still be a bit of an amateur and soak up all the experience,” Pinnington Jones said. “And then come end of Wimbledon, it's my profession. It's exciting. It's obviously quite scary as well.”


By attending TCU, Pinnington Jones followed the path of countrymen Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley, who both attended the university in Fort Worth and are now inside the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings. Pinnington Jones and Fearnley even lived together for two years.


“He was always the guy that I looked up to in my college career that really made sure he maximised everything he got on the tennis court and in the gym,” Pinnington Jones said of his friend Fearnley.


Last season, Fearnley enjoyed a rapid breakthrough on the ATP Challenger Tour, posting a 27-3 match record at that level, including four titles. Fearnley also turned heads at Wimbledon by taking a set off seven-time champion Novak Djokovic on Centre Court in a second-round clash.


“I remember chatting to [Jake] a lot last year because I was playing some Challengers as well and just seeing how well he was doing, he just said that he found some belief and that he was just taking it one match at a time. I think that's sort of my logic,” Pinnington Jones said. “I mean, I'm trying to be Jack Pinnington Jones. I have great role models and people to talk to.”

Pinnington Jones has competed in just four Challenger events this season, highlighted by a run to the Ilkley final two weeks ago. At a career-high No. 282 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Pinnington Jones is also a repeat qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which focuses on increasing the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system.
""I definitely think playing these Challengers for college guys and young juniors is so invaluable and it's really creating a pathway, just like golf would do with their PGA Tour cards,"" Pinnington Jones said.
""I think it's what tennis needs. I think it's essential that we keep pushing young talent and growing the game that way as well. I think it's great and I always love seeing college guys and young guys do well. It's always inspiring and it pushes me to want to do just as well.""

Pinnington Jones' earliest memories with the sport date back to age seven when he would play with a sponge ball in Tunbridge Wells, alongside one of his three younger sisters.

It did not take him long to fall in love with tennis. Soon he was hitting against a wall nonstop. It was during this time that Pinnington Jones was — as he puts it — “obsessed with” Andy Murray, former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

At age 12, Pinnington Jones began to realise he had something special in tennis. He reached the final of the Open Super 12 Auray, a prestigious junior tournament in France.
That same year, 2015, the Auray draw featured future stars like Holger Rune, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard and Hamad Medjedovic, whom Pinnington Jones beat in the round of 16. It was one of Pinnington Jones' first trips abroad to compete in a tennis tournament.

Pinnington Jones will not have to travel far this week. But the stakes will be as high as they have ever been for the player who is beginning his professional tennis career.

“I think for me, the main thing is, I'm only 22 once and I'm getting to play all these cool tournaments and don't treat it like it's life or death,” Pinnington Jones said. “It's just tennis, but I want to try and maximise what I can do.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","Naomi Osaka explains what Coco Gauff's French Open title reminded her about tennis, ‘she inspires me'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/naomi-osaka-explains-what-coco-gauffs-french-open-title-reminded-her-about-tennis-she-inspires-me/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Naomi Osaka and Coco Gauff are among the WTA stars taking on Wimbledon, which gets underway this week.

Osaka has been drawn to face Talia Gibson in round one of Wimbledon, with WTA number two Gauff taking on Dayana Yastremska.

Andy Roddick has predicted an early Wimbledon exit for Gauff, who enters the tournament on the back of French Open success.

She defeated world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the Roland Garros final earlier this month, although followed that up with an opening match defeat in Berlin.

Osaka lost in the French Open first round, and also lost her opener in Berlin before a round of 16 exit at the Bad Homburg Open.

The former world number one has now moved on to Wimbledon, where she discussed Gauff's French Open success in her opening press conference.

Osaka commented: “Oh, I mean, for me, I'm super proud of her. I remember I hit with her when she was quite young, but she's still young.

“But it was back when Key Biscayne was like in Key Biscayne, or Miami Open was in Key Biscayne, so that should tell you how young she was.

“But yeah, it's really cool, I would say, to see how much she's grown and it also, I guess, reminds me how much athletes can inspire people.

“And she inspires me a lot, and I hope that one day I can play as well on clay as she does, and I think it's really, really incredible how far she's come from what I first saw her.”

Gauff has indeed achieved huge success in her relatively brief career so far, with the 21-year-old now a two-time Grand Slam champion.

The American boasts 10 career titles in total, and is currently behind only Sabalenka in the WTA Tour rankings.

But Osaka ought to remember the stunning success she once achieved, which includes climbing to the top of the world rankings.

Furthermore, the 27-year-old is a seven-time WTA champion, with four of those titles involving Grand Slam success.

Currently ranked 53rd in the world, Osaka has played in four Grand Slam finals throughout her career so far, and has won all four.

And Osaka has met Gauff five times on the WTA Tour, with the latter posting three wins compared to two from the former.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=roland+garros+tennis","After a tough French Open, Naomi Osaka is optimistic about Wimbledon","https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45598793/naomi-osaka-wimbledon-2025","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:33:00 GMT","

There was no hiding Naomi Osaka's frustration after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa at the French Open last month.

She had won the first set in a thrilling tiebreaker and battled for two hours and 21 minutes in front of an enthralled crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier. But ultimately she couldn't close out the match.

The 27-year-old struggled to speak in her news conference soon after.

""I feel like I should be doing better,"" she said with emotion in her voice. ""I hate disappointing people. So, like, even with [coach] Patrick [Mouratoglou], I was thinking this just now, he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever [Serena Williams] to, like, 'What the f--- this is? You know what I mean?""

She quickly apologized for cursing before sitting back in her chair, and looked on the verge of tears. The moderator asked if she needed a minute to regain her composure. She agreed and left the room.

It would have been understandable if she didn't come back, maybe even expected during an earlier stage of her career, but Osaka returned soon after. When asked how the match would make her stronger, she wasn't sure, but she found a silver lining as she spoke.

""I feel like I learn little things from each match,"" Osaka said. ""I think I lost the tiebreaker in Rome, and I didn't lose the tiebreaker here. So, I mean, I am conscious of things when I'm playing, so maybe the next match I play I'll learn little things from today.""

According to Mouratoglou, who has been working with Osaka since September, she's done just that, and he is more encouraged than ever by what he's seeing as Wimbledon gets underway. Osaka has moved on fully from what happened in Paris. And despite having never advanced past the third round at the All England Club, Mouratoglou said Osaka is optimistic, and is ready for her first-round match against qualifier Talia Gibson on Monday.

As a former world No. 1 and a four-time major champion, the external expectations and attention remain high. It comes with the territory. But Osaka, Mouratoglou and the rest of the team aren't thinking about winning titles, although they do believe they will come again.

""For the last two years she hasn't won as much as she has in the past, and it can be difficult to deal with,"" Mouratoglou told ESPN on Thursday. ""So I think at this point it's much better to not expect anything and focus again on what she can control and what she wants to achieve rather than on the outcome ... I'm not focused too much on the results, but more on the game and what she produces in terms of game. And that's important, and I really believe it because in the end, if you think about it, the result is just the reward for having done the job well. The results will come if the focus is on the right place.""

After the match against the tenth-seeded Badosa, Mouratoglou said they sat down and discussed what happened -- what went wrong, why her level dipped in the second set, and why she made some of the decisions on court that she made. He believed the more they understood about the loss, the more it could benefit her in the long run.

He also understood that she desperately needed a few days away from tennis. It had been a long clay-court season, during which she played four tournaments and won her first title (at the 125K Saint-Malo event) since returning from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season. Osaka went home to Los Angeles and spent time with her almost-2-year-old daughter, Shai.

""I think that probably having [her daughter] will help her to get over her losses, being a mother,"" Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said last week. ""I think that's a wonderful thing to have that in her life, and I think that [gives her] perspective.""

That perspective is something Osaka has spoken openly about since returning to the tour. While she had struggled with her mental health prior to her pregnancy and had taken multiple breaks from competition previously, Shai has provided her with something else to focus her energy on, no matter how she has performed on the tennis court.

""Giving birth to my daughter changed my mindset a lot,"" Osaka told ESPN ahead of her comeback. ""And it's also made me realize that my world doesn't have to revolve around me -- which might also be a little selfish too. I guess I've just found outer happiness and inner peace.""

According to Mouratoglou, that attitude was on full display when a refreshed and reenergized Osaka came back to Europe to prepare for the ever-so-short grass-court season.

""This part of the season is so important and you really have to be fully focused,"" Mouratoglou, also the author of the just-released ""Champion Mindset"" self-help book, said. ""If you're thinking about the tournament before, you're not really there. But I think she's really moved on. She's not thinking about Roland Garros at all.""

Three weeks after her disappointment in Paris, Osaka was back on the court and playing at the Berlin Open. She lost to eventual semifinalist Liudmila Samsonova in another three-set thriller, but the team was encouraged by what it saw. Wanting to get more match experience on the surface before heading to London, Osaka then accepted a wild card for the Bad Homburg Open. In a tightly contested battle headlined by strong serving by both players, Osaka defeated Olga Danilovic 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) for her first grass-court victory of the season.

""I hope so,"" Osaka said after the match when asked if she was becoming a good grass-court player. ""I mean, I think I have potential, but I don't know. Everyone is also really good, so I can never, I guess, take the wins for granted and [I'm] just super excited that I won today.""

Mouratoglou was impressed by her ability to raise her level throughout, hold her serve and handle the break points. She lost 6-4, 6-4 in her match the next day against fifth-seeded Emma Navarro, but the team still deemed the week a success.

And most importantly, Osaka did too.

""She was very positive,"" Mouratoglou said. ""And not fakely positive, because she's not. When she doesn't feel it, she doesn't say it or she would say something negative if she feels negative. So she's not someone who would fake it. But she said to me that she is really happy with how she is playing and that she feels that it's all going to click soon.""

Mouratoglou admitted that it's been difficult at times for Osaka. Having been at tennis' peak earlier in her career, she has struggled over the years with her results and knows the expectations others have placed on her. She hasn't advanced past the third round at a major since she won the Australian Open in 2021, nor has she claimed a tour-level title in that span. She is currently ranked No. 53 in the world.

But there have been bright spots -- she reached her first WTA final in almost three years in Auckland this season before having to retire with injury, and she made the fourth round at the 1000-level events in Miami and Rome this year. And Mouratoglou believes Osaka has started to appreciate the journey and her own efforts.

""She's been No. 1 in the world, so to be No. 50 and having to be patient doing everything right, that's what she feels is difficult,"" Mouratoglou said. ""But to be at the top of the game is very difficult, so this is just a [new] difficulty that she needs to accept, but I feel she does. I feel maybe she was not in the past month, but now she says to me, 'It's going to click, I just have to be patient.' And she is sure about it now.""

Others have noticed her hard work and have seen flashes of her previous brilliance. After their match in Paris, Badosa praised Osaka's level and said, ""Very, very soon she's going to be where she wants to be, for sure.""

Evert believes she remains one of the best ball strikers on tour and lauded her hard work and fitness, but she thinks it's simply confidence that Osaka needs most to return to her previous glory.

""I think the No. 1 thing is, and I've watched her play a lot of matches where it's been very close, and she's not won those matches, and I think what she has lost a little bit during the time off was the belief, the belief on the big points, the belief in the big games when it's 5-all,"" Evert said. ""Those shots, those golden shots were there for her taking when she was winning Slams for those couple of years, but that is missing. She can get it back. She can definitely get it back, but she'll need to win some more matches. She'll need to really break through and win these tight, tight matches that she seems to be losing now.""

Mouratoglou doesn't disagree. He sees just how good and consistent Osaka can be in practice. and their priority is getting what he sees every single day on the practice court to translate in a match. He believes they are close.

While Osaka has gotten tough first-round opponents in several of her recent Slam appearances due to her lack of seeding, she has a relatively favorable matchup against Gibson, a 21-year-old from Australia playing in her first major main draw outside of her home country. If Osaka wins Monday, she would likely play No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen, the reigning Olympic gold medalist in singles, in the second round. Zheng has won two of their three previous meetings, with both wins coming since Osaka's return, but grass is also Zheng's weakest surface. The winner of their match would not have to face another player seeded inside the top 20 until the quarterfinals.

In four career showings, Osaka has reached the Round of 32 twice (in 2017 and 2018). Last year, in her first time playing the tournament in five years, she reached the second round. But prior to the draw announcement, former world No. 1 and 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick said there was ""no reason why she can't play well on grass"" and sounded optimistic about her chances during a spot on the Tennis Channel.

Those around Osaka believe that as well. Although they don't mind the naysayers about her game on the surface. In fact, they believe the low expectations and her under-the-radar status entering the tournament can only benefit her.

And because of that, perhaps Wimbledon -- however unlikely that might sound -- might actually be the perfect place for everything to finally come together again for Osaka.

""We know there's less pressure for her to play well on grass,"" Mouratoglou said. ""It's an opportunity to go there and play with less pressure and be able again to show what she's capable of and what she does in practice. We'll use that as motivation closer to [her first match] to make her feel lighter and be able to just focus on her game.

Prior to arriving in London for Wimbledon, the last time Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka shared a court was in the 2025 Roland Garros final. That ended with Gauff winning a three-set thriller to claim her second major singles title. Following the match, Sabalenka‘s press conference comments picked up a lot of traction, as fans believe she was downplaying Gauff's victory over her.

The world No. 1, Sabalenka, repeatedly expressed her disappointment for playing so poorly in a final, and not handling the windy conditions well. She even went on to argue that if Iga Swiatek had beaten her in the semifinals, Swiatek would've certainly defeated Gauff in the championship match. Sabalenka apologized, but her comments were immediately characterized as distasteful and dismissive of Gauff, the world No. 2 player, who has three straight wins over Swiatek.

While everyone was criticizing Sabalenka, calling her a sore loser, it was Gauff who was extending her grace. The 21-year-old sensation obviously disagreed with the comments, but she made it clear she didn't take them personally. She gave her frequent opponent the benefit of the doubt, understanding how emotional one can be after a devastating loss.

On Friday, Gauff showed how she didn't take the comments personally at all, collaborating with Sabalenka for a couple of TikToks as they shared the court with each other while preparing for Wimbledon.

Making two separate videos, Sabalenka shared one of the two doing a choreographed dance, with the caption, “TikTok dances always had a way of bringing people together.” The video Gauff shared was of the two lip syncing a Kim Kardashian audio saying, “Ok guys, we're back. Did you miss us? Cause we missed you.”

Gauff shared that video with a caption that read, “The olive branch was extended and accepted! We're good, so you guys should be too,” making it clear there's no beef between the two tennis stars.

While there isn't a beef, fans would love to see them meet in the Wimbledon final, as they are still the two best women's tennis players in the world. That's evident when they are on the court together, having a head-to-head record of 6-5 in Gauff's favor.

Both of Gauff's majors came with wins against Sabalenka in the final, and they could be on pace to meet in another final with Wimbledon starting on Monday. But for now, TikToks.

LONDON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Serbian legend Novak Djokovic agreed that Wimbledon could offer his best chance to claim a record-extending 25th Grand Slam title.

While attending the pre-Championships press conference on Saturday, the 38-year-old was asked if he believed this year's Wimbledon could be his best chance to win the 25th Grand Slam title and could it be his last dance at the grass-court Grand Slam this year.

""Whether it could be my last dance, I'm not sure, as I'm not sure about Roland Garros or any other Slam that I play next,"" said Djokovic prior to his 20th appearance at Wimbledon.

""My wish is to play for several more years. I would love to be healthy physically and also mentally motivated to keep on playing at the highest level. That's the goal, but you never know at this stage.""

""And yes, I would probably agree that Wimbledon could be the best chance because of the results I had, because of how I feel, how I play in Wimbledon, just getting that extra push mentally and motivation to perform the best tennis at the highest level,"" the seven-time Wimbledon champion continued.

Djokovic ranked Wimbledon ""maybe the most consistently successful Grand Slam for me in the last 10 years"", as he reached six finals in the last six editions of the tournament. He won four titles consecutively before being beaten by Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz in the last two years.

""I don't chase the rankings anymore. I'm trying to play the best tennis in Grand Slams and trying to win Grand Slams. That hasn't changed,"" he said.

Djokovic reached the semifinals at both Australian Open and US Open this year. ""I think I still played a decent level of tennis that showed me that I can still play on a very high level at the later stages.""

""That's what is also giving me an extra motivation to keep going. Obviously clay court probably slightly less chances to win comparing to grass,"" he added.

The sixth-seeded veteran will face Frenchman Alexandre Muller in the opening round. If he reaches the semifinals, he could meet world No. 1 Jannik Sinner who defeated him in the French Open semifinals earlier this year.  ■","{'href': 'https://english.news.cn', 'title': 'Xinhua'}","tennis"

The Italian did not play a warm-up event after suffering a leg injury in the semis at Roland-Garros

Lorenzo Musetti is hoping that less proves to be more as he returns from injury at Wimbledon this fortnight.

The Italian has not played competitively since he was forced to retire in the fourth set of his semi-final with Carlos Alcaraz at Roland-Garros with a leg issue, but says he is ready to begin his campaign.

“I didn't play much, honestly,” he told reporters at Wimbledon on Sunday. “It's been tough, of course, after French Open to don't play any tournament before Wimbledon, to prepare the grass season. But the important thing is to stay healthy and to be healthy enough to play, so here we are.

“Basically I stayed without touching any racquet two full weeks, but the important thing was doing therapies and rehabilitation every day. Let's say I didn't take as a vacation the two weeks. 

“I worked hard as I could to be ready and to be fast enough to recover for be ready to be playing here. I arrived here on Monday, so let's say one week of training, which was a little bit not really one week because I was sick a little bit two days…but at least we are here. We finally are here and close enough to start and to debut.”

Having established himself in the top 10, Musetti is looking to take the next step at the majors by reaching his first final. And even if he doesn't have the miles of practice in his legs, he seems mentally refreshed.

“I wanted to be, let's say, more prepared for Wimbledon this year,” he said. “I have semi-final to defend. It's an important stage of the season, which I wanted to do great and to continue the great form that I showed in the last months.

“But I think also the positive thing is I spend some time with my family. So if I have to see the positive and the negative things, I will go more with the positive ones and try to spend time with the family, spend time with my closest friends, and enjoy a little bit of Italy, which was a long time since I was not going there.

“Hopefully this kind of time that I spend home, it's gave me an extra motivation to do well and to try to defend my semi-final here in Wimbledon.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","When does Wimbledon start? Tennis' third Grand Slam set to begin in London","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/wimb/2025/06/29/wimbledon-2025-dates-seeds-history-tennis/84407312007/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 16:06:18 GMT","

The third Grand Slam event of the 2025 tennis season is at hand as the best players in the world convene in London for The Championships at Wimbledon.

The 138 edition of the storied grass-court tournament takes place at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.

The top-ranked players automatically qualify for the main draw, which includes 32 seeded players in both the men's and women's pool. A total of 128 players comprise the field in each bracket. Play continues throughout the fortnight, with only one scheduled day off on Sunday, July 6. However, that day is frequently used to make up matches delayed or postponed by rain.

Here are the essentials to get you ready for Wimbledon 2025:

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament will begin on Monday, June 30, 2025 and be played over 14 days before concluding on Sunday, July 13, in London.

The 2025 Wimbledon tournament will be broadcast on ESPN, ABC, and the Tennis Channel. Fans wanting to stream the action can watch matches on ESPN+ or Fubo.

Carlos Alcaraz of Spain is the two-time defending men's singles champion at Wimbledon and just won the French Open men's singles title for the second year in a row on the clay at Roland Garros. A three-peat would cement the 22-year-old Alcaraz with some of the all-time greats at the All England Club. Since the Open era began in 1968, only Roger Federer (2003-07), Pete Sampras (1993-95; 1997-2000) and Bjorn Borg (1976-80) have managed to win Wimbledon three years in a row.

On the women's side, Barbora Krejčíková of the Czech Republic is the defending singles champion after she outlasted Jasmine Paolini in three sets to become the second consecutive Czech winner. Markéta Vondroušová shocked the tennis world by becoming the first unseeded woman to win Wimbledon when she prevailed in 2023.

Italian Jannik Sinner, the reigning Australian Open and U.S. Open champion is this year's top seed on the men's side at Wimbledon. That's despite losing to Alcaraz in an epic French Open final. Alcaraz is seeded second, followed by No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev of Germany, and No. 4 seed – and hometown favorite – Jack Draper of the United Kingdom.

Aryna Sabalenka is the No. 1 women's seed ahead American Coco Gauff, who is the No. 2 seed despite beating Sabalenka in the 2025 French Open final. American Jessica Pegula is the No. 3 seed in the bracket.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","After a tough French Open, Naomi Osaka is optimistic about Wimbledon","https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/45598793/naomi-osaka-wimbledon-2025","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 15:33:00 GMT","

There was no hiding Naomi Osaka's frustration after her first-round loss to Paula Badosa at the French Open last month.

She had won the first set in a thrilling tiebreaker and battled for two hours and 21 minutes in front of an enthralled crowd at Court Philippe Chatrier. But ultimately she couldn't close out the match.

The 27-year-old struggled to speak in her news conference soon after.

""I feel like I should be doing better,"" she said with emotion in her voice. ""I hate disappointing people. So, like, even with [coach] Patrick [Mouratoglou], I was thinking this just now, he goes from working with, like, the greatest player ever [Serena Williams] to, like, 'What the f--- this is? You know what I mean?""

She quickly apologized for cursing before sitting back in her chair, and looked on the verge of tears. The moderator asked if she needed a minute to regain her composure. She agreed and left the room.

It would have been understandable if she didn't come back, maybe even expected during an earlier stage of her career, but Osaka returned soon after. When asked how the match would make her stronger, she wasn't sure, but she found a silver lining as she spoke.

""I feel like I learn little things from each match,"" Osaka said. ""I think I lost the tiebreaker in Rome, and I didn't lose the tiebreaker here. So, I mean, I am conscious of things when I'm playing, so maybe the next match I play I'll learn little things from today.""

According to Mouratoglou, who has been working with Osaka since September, she's done just that, and he is more encouraged than ever by what he's seeing as Wimbledon gets underway. Osaka has moved on fully from what happened in Paris. And despite having never advanced past the third round at the All England Club, Mouratoglou said Osaka is optimistic, and is ready for her first-round match against qualifier Talia Gibson on Monday.

As a former world No. 1 and a four-time major champion, the external expectations and attention remain high. It comes with the territory. But Osaka, Mouratoglou and the rest of the team aren't thinking about winning titles, although they do believe they will come again.

""For the last two years she hasn't won as much as she has in the past, and it can be difficult to deal with,"" Mouratoglou told ESPN on Thursday. ""So I think at this point it's much better to not expect anything and focus again on what she can control and what she wants to achieve rather than on the outcome ... I'm not focused too much on the results, but more on the game and what she produces in terms of game. And that's important, and I really believe it because in the end, if you think about it, the result is just the reward for having done the job well. The results will come if the focus is on the right place.""

After the match against the tenth-seeded Badosa, Mouratoglou said they sat down and discussed what happened -- what went wrong, why her level dipped in the second set, and why she made some of the decisions on court that she made. He believed the more they understood about the loss, the more it could benefit her in the long run.

He also understood that she desperately needed a few days away from tennis. It had been a long clay-court season, during which she played four tournaments and won her first title (at the 125K Saint-Malo event) since returning from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season. Osaka went home to Los Angeles and spent time with her almost-2-year-old daughter, Shai.

""I think that probably having [her daughter] will help her to get over her losses, being a mother,"" Chris Evert, the 18-time major champion and ESPN analyst, said last week. ""I think that's a wonderful thing to have that in her life, and I think that [gives her] perspective.""

That perspective is something Osaka has spoken openly about since returning to the tour. While she had struggled with her mental health prior to her pregnancy and had taken multiple breaks from competition previously, Shai has provided her with something else to focus her energy on, no matter how she has performed on the tennis court.

""Giving birth to my daughter changed my mindset a lot,"" Osaka told ESPN ahead of her comeback. ""And it's also made me realize that my world doesn't have to revolve around me -- which might also be a little selfish too. I guess I've just found outer happiness and inner peace.""

According to Mouratoglou, that attitude was on full display when a refreshed and reenergized Osaka came back to Europe to prepare for the ever-so-short grass-court season.

""This part of the season is so important and you really have to be fully focused,"" Mouratoglou, also the author of the just-released ""Champion Mindset"" self-help book, said. ""If you're thinking about the tournament before, you're not really there. But I think she's really moved on. She's not thinking about Roland Garros at all.""

Three weeks after her disappointment in Paris, Osaka was back on the court and playing at the Berlin Open. She lost to eventual semifinalist Liudmila Samsonova in another three-set thriller, but the team was encouraged by what it saw. Wanting to get more match experience on the surface before heading to London, Osaka then accepted a wild card for the Bad Homburg Open. In a tightly contested battle headlined by strong serving by both players, Osaka defeated Olga Danilovic 7-6 (6), 7-6 (4) for her first grass-court victory of the season.

""I hope so,"" Osaka said after the match when asked if she was becoming a good grass-court player. ""I mean, I think I have potential, but I don't know. Everyone is also really good, so I can never, I guess, take the wins for granted and [I'm] just super excited that I won today.""

Mouratoglou was impressed by her ability to raise her level throughout, hold her serve and handle the break points. She lost 6-4, 6-4 in her match the next day against fifth-seeded Emma Navarro, but the team still deemed the week a success.

And most importantly, Osaka did too.

""She was very positive,"" Mouratoglou said. ""And not fakely positive, because she's not. When she doesn't feel it, she doesn't say it or she would say something negative if she feels negative. So she's not someone who would fake it. But she said to me that she is really happy with how she is playing and that she feels that it's all going to click soon.""

Mouratoglou admitted that it's been difficult at times for Osaka. Having been at tennis' peak earlier in her career, she has struggled over the years with her results and knows the expectations others have placed on her. She hasn't advanced past the third round at a major since she won the Australian Open in 2021, nor has she claimed a tour-level title in that span. She is currently ranked No. 53 in the world.

But there have been bright spots -- she reached her first WTA final in almost three years in Auckland this season before having to retire with injury, and she made the fourth round at the 1000-level events in Miami and Rome this year. And Mouratoglou believes Osaka has started to appreciate the journey and her own efforts.

""She's been No. 1 in the world, so to be No. 50 and having to be patient doing everything right, that's what she feels is difficult,"" Mouratoglou said. ""But to be at the top of the game is very difficult, so this is just a [new] difficulty that she needs to accept, but I feel she does. I feel maybe she was not in the past month, but now she says to me, 'It's going to click, I just have to be patient.' And she is sure about it now.""

Others have noticed her hard work and have seen flashes of her previous brilliance. After their match in Paris, Badosa praised Osaka's level and said, ""Very, very soon she's going to be where she wants to be, for sure.""

Evert believes she remains one of the best ball strikers on tour and lauded her hard work and fitness, but she thinks it's simply confidence that Osaka needs most to return to her previous glory.

The treatment of female sportspeople is particularly troubling, and the reasons behind it – including gambling – are rightly under fresh scrutiny

With temperatures forecast to be as high as 34C, spectators as well as players must arrive at the All England Lawn Tennis Club on Monday prepared to deal with conditions more familiar at grand slams in Australia and the US. But as Wimbledon opens its doors, three weeks after a French Open men's singles final that some regard as the best tennis match ever (Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner over five and a half hours), other warnings besides heat are known to be troubling some of the players.

Emma Raducanu has said she feels “comfortable” and “safe”, thanks to tighter security arrangements introduced after an unnamed man, who previously signed an agreement to stay away from her, was blocked from buying tickets. Earlier this year she became visibly distressed by his presence at a match in Dubai, after he approached her in person. But while this particular situation appears to have been dealt with, the wider picture regarding female players' experiences remains troubling – as does the wider problem of online abuse in sports, including that aimed at referees.

Earlier this month the British No 2, Katie Boulter, gave an interview highlighting the toll this behaviour takes. Other players have also described the impact of stalkers and fixated male fans. Three years ago, a different man from the one in Dubai was sentenced to 200 hours community service after repeatedly turning up at Raducanu's house.

Stalkers are not a new problem for celebrities, including sportspeople. In 1993, Monica Seles was stabbed in Hamburg by a man obsessed with her rival, Steffi Graf. But the darker side of fame has been magnified by digital media – which has changed the rules of social engagement for athletes as well as everyone else.

Since sport, for most people, is an enjoyable leisure activity, its stars are widely regarded as lucky, talented people – not obvious objects of concern. But the disproportionate harassment of female players should bother spectators and society at large, as well as those with a professional interest in their wellbeing.

To some degree such attacks are in line with women's negative experiences in other areas of public life, including politics, and part of a wider problem of escalating, technologically enabled sexism. But the role of online gambling in fomenting aggression is an element specific to sports that is rightly attracting attention. A newly released report from the Women's Tennis Association and International Tennis Federation found that 77% of abuse directed at players' personal accounts came from “frustrated gamblers”, with a handful of top female players facing a disproportionate share of hostility.

Unsurprisingly, given their well documented opposition to stronger regulation in general, gambling companies have been slow to act. But players and those tasked with safeguarding them are pushing back. The two-times Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur – who plays her first-round match on Monday – is among those who have called for betting companies to ban abusers from their platforms for life. She deserves praise for speaking out.

Sir Andy Murray, and others who have voiced concern, recognise that regulating online speech is complex. That does not mean that the status quo is acceptable. Fatalistic attitudes to the growing problem of sexualised online abuse are part of the problem that policymakers need to grip.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"

If you want to keep tabs on all the British players at Wimbledon this year, it may need to be a multi-screen experience.

There are 23 Britons competing in the men's and women's singles at the All England Club - the most since 1984.

The home ranks exceed 50 when we add the doubles, wheelchair events and juniors.

With the grass-court Grand Slam tournament starting on Monday, here are British names and storylines to keep an eye on.

Seven of the British contingent have qualified directly through their world rankings, with players inside the top 100 guaranteed a spot.

It is only the second time this has happened since 2016.

United States-based college student Oliver Tarvet came through the qualifying tournament, while a further 15 players were handed wildcards.

Former British number one Dan Evans, 35, was notable on that list, while three teenagers - Mika Stojsavljevic, Hannah Klugman and Mimi Xu - were also given opportunities.

Wimbledon's wildcard committee considers a variety of factors - including ranking, form and previous grass-court results - when deciding recipients.

""We discuss what is right for the players and the event,"" British women's team captain Anne Keothavong, who is on the wildcard committee, told BBC Radio 5 Live.

""We're fortunate to have a British Grand Slam and it is in everyone's interests to support British players where we can.

""Where we can give British players opportunities and expose them to the highest level of tennis, we would like to do so.""

Having 14 players inside the world's top 200 - the most since 1984 - shows Britain's growing depth of talent.

Multiple factors have contributed to this improvement.

These include Andy Murray's success inspiring the youngsters, a national tennis centre in Roehampton providing state-of-the-art training facilities, and players - notably Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley - developing in the US college system before turning professional.

British women's number three Sonay Kartal says watching friends and peers enjoy success has also helped.

""I'd say [the higher number of top-200 players] is a mix of things, there's not one specific reason,"" said Kartal.

""We've got a lot of good sparring partners when we're back home and we're all pushing each other. I think there's a healthy rivalry and that adds to it.""

Jack Draper, ranked fourth in the world, leads home men's singles hopes.

The 23-year-old Englishman has become a title contender following a stunning rise over the past 12 months.

No British player has been seeded as high as Draper since world number one and defending champion Andy Murray in 2017.

Draper is one of 13 Britons in the men's singles, with Fearnley, Norrie and Billy Harris also earning direct entry.

Wildcard Evans became emotional on the eve of Wimbledon when he discussed his recent struggles.

How Draper became a genuine Wimbledon contender

The former world number 21 briefly slipped out of the top 200 this year but has justified his wildcard with recent eye-catching victories over top-20 players Frances Tiafoe and Tommy Paul.

""It's not the matches, it's when you feel like you've let people down, that's the tougher thing about it,"" said Evans.

Further wildcards went to Jay Clarke, Oliver Crawford, George Loffhagen, Johannus Monday, Jack Pinnington Jones, Henry Searle and Arthur Fery.

The home contingent increased when Tarvet - who cannot claim full prize money because of US college system rules - became the first British man to come through qualifying in eight years.

Emma Raducanu will capture plenty of attention as she looks to build on last year's run to the last 16.

Raducanu, 22, has regained her position as the British women's number one.

Generally looking happier and more relaxed, the 2021 US Open champion has reached two WTA quarter-finals and returned to the world's top 40 - but she does not ""expect much"" at Wimbledon after a difficult build-up.

Katie Boulter has fallen to 43rd in the rankings.

The 28-year-old remains a threat on grass with her big-striking game but has drawn Spanish ninth seed Paula Badosa in round one.

""I'm very, very excited,"" Boulter said. ""I feel like it's a totally different situation for me coming in this year.

""I'm kind of like a dark horse and I like that feeling. I like the fact I can go out and swing free and I've got nothing to lose.""

Kartal is the third British woman with direct entry, having climbed almost 250 ranking places since her Wimbledon debut last year.

Established players Jodie Burrage, Harriet Dart, Francesca Jones and Heather Watson were also given wildcards.

Queen's champions Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash are bidding to become the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles since 1936

The British doubles scene - particularly the men's side - remains in rude health.

Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have emerged as the standout British pairing this year and the third best in the world.

In their first full season together, Cash and Glasspool have won three ATP titles - including back-to-back at Queen's and Eastbourne.

Such form places them among the favourites for Wimbledon, with men's doubles proving fruitful for home players in recent years.

Reigning champion Henry Patten, who made his breakthrough alongside Cash before the pair split two years ago, will look to defend the trophy alongside Finland's Harri Heliovaara.

Neal Skupski won his first Slam title at the All England Club in 2023 and is looking for another with fellow Briton Joe Salisbury, whose major-winning CV is only lacking his home tournament.

In the women's draw, Olivia Nicholls is the lone British seed after enjoying a fine season with Slovakian partner Tereza Mihalikova.

The pair won their first WTA title by shocking French Open champions Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani in the recent Berlin final.

In the wheelchair events, Alfie Hewett defends the men's singles he won last year to complete a career Grand Slam.

Gordon Reid, champion in 2016, also has direct entry, with Ben Bartram and Dahnon Ward receiving wildcards.

Lucy Shuker and Cornelia Oosthuizen - Britain's leading two women - also received wildcards, as did Greg Slade to join fellow 2024 Paralympic silver medallist Andy Lapthorne in the quad wheelchair draw.

While older tennis fans will cite the days of John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg as the golden era, the sport had another renaissance around the 2010s.

No fan of the sport will ever forget the exhilarating 2008 Wimbledon final where, after rain breaks stopped play, and it got so dark visibility was poor, Spaniard Rafael Nadal beat world number one Roger Federer.

It was almost uncanny that (arguably) the greatest players of all time were active during the same epoch, with the 'big four' - Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Andy Murray - all battling it out at the same time.

After Federer and Nadal retired in the early 2020s, the tennis landscape lost some of  its lustre: how could it ever reach the dizzying heights these respectful rivalries brought to the game?

However, not all is lost: now a young array of Gen Z tennis aces are bringing some sizzle back to the courts again, with their thrilling games and glamorous off-court lifestyles (including a rumoured romance between two players).

The French Open last month saw a nail biting five and a half hour match as Carlos Alcaraz come back from three match points down to beat World No. 1 Jannik Sinner. And that's not the only news swirling around Alcaraz: he is rumoured to be in a relationship with fellow player Emma Raducanu - best known for winning the US Open in 2021, at the tender age of just 18.

So it seems tennis is back with a bang, and here are some the players making it sexy again, ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on June 30 and will run through to July 13.

Coco Gauff 

US tennis champ Coco Gauff, 21, was named one of Time's Women Of The Year for 2024.

The young tennis sensation won her first slam - the US Open - in September 2023, making her the highest-paid female athlete in the world at the time, according to Sportico.

As a Black woman and tennis player, Coco has said she is especially proud of her success.

'Being a Black woman, in a sport that isn't as diverse as others are, it definitely means a lot to me,' she previously told Time Magazine. 

She added that as she grows older, she's embracing her role in the world, saying: 'There's always going to be change needed in this world. I hope I can play a small part,' she said.

The prestigious list was curated by Time editors, who said they looked to 'extraordinary leaders working toward a more equal world' and 'trailblazers fighting for a more equitable future.'

'The 12 women on our 2024 list are pivotal figures from across the globe who have dedicated themselves to lifting up others as they rise,' the article read.

Emma Raducanu

Emma Raducanu shot to global prominence in 2021 when she won the US Open at just 18-years-old - a victory she has since spoken about as playing a role in causing stress and performance anxiety.

However, she has been playing at a top level, and will no doubt be a big draw for many when it comes to Wimbledon (though she has her work cut out for her, facing some very tough opponents in the early rounds of the prestigious tournament).

As is inevitable when it comes to very famous sports stars, 22-year-old Emma has been at the centre of romance rumours with another player - Carlos Alcaraz. The two are US Open champions - after Raducanu won in 2021, Alcaraz picked up the trophy a year later - and are good friends, growing up together on the tour.  Emma finally addressed the rumours surrounding her off-court connection with Alcaraz very recently. 

The pair are due to partner in doubles at the US Open in August, but speculation about a possible bond beyond the tennis court has grown after Raducanu was seen supporting the Spanish star at the Queen's Club Championships earlier this month. 

Raducanu was seen supporting Alcaraz last Thursday and Saturday, sparking talk around Queen's that there might be ‘something going on between them', as the pair were spotted laughing and joking together and arriving at the venue just minutes apart. 

Their most recent link-up came this week, with Alcaraz being confirmed as the latest global ambassador of Evian ahead of Wimbledon - the tournament's official water supplier since 2008. Raducanu also works with Evian, her collaborative work starting after she became the hottest property in British sport by winning the US Open in 2021, which led to her signing lucrative deals with the likes of Nike and Christian Dior.

During a press conference, Raducanu was inevitably asked about the romance rumours, to which she smiled and said: 'We're just good friends.' 

Carlos Alcaraz  

Alcaraz, 22, will have the eyes of the world on him as he embarks on his Wimbledon campaign on the tail of an 18-match winning streak, including victories at the French Open and on the grass at Queen's.

Having lifted the famous Wimbledon trophy twice, he insists he's not getting distracted by the prospect of becoming only the fifth man to win three Wimbledon titles in a row. The Spaniard could join icons Bjorn Borg, Pete Sampras, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to complete a hat-trick if he can triumph on Centre Court once again. 

‘I really want to win the title, I really want to lift the trophy,' Alcaraz has said. ‘Right now, I'm not thinking about who I could join if I win three Wimbledons in a row. I am just thinking I want to be ready and to prepare myself in the best way. I feel a lot of confidence.'

Meanwhile, off court, the player have been besieged with rumours that he is dating his sometimes doubles partner Emma Raducanu - who has said the two are 'just friends'.

Despite the denials, sports marketing expert Tim Lopez, CEO of TLNT Global, says if the romance was genuine, it would catapult both players into the stratosphere.

'From a brand positioning profile and marketing perspective, it would be an absolute dream. They would be a good example of where one plus one makes three.'

They would be hugely 'complementary', he adds. 'They would join ranks of other famous power couples such as Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, or, outside of tennis, the likes of Becks and Posh.'

Jack Draper

With a current ATP ranking of number four, Draper has everything to play for as he prepares to take part in Wimbledon.

He has a tough draw - should he get through to the quarter final, he will potentially face Novak Djokovic, who has amassed a record-breaking number of slam titles during his career.

Draper was suffering with a hip injury earlier this year, but by March, he revealed he was feeling much better.

He said at the time: 'At the start of the year I was struggling a bit, but my body feels good now. I feel really strong in every area of my game.'

Speaking on Saturday, Draper, who enters Wimbledon as the fourth seeded player, discussed the prospect of filling Andy Murray's shoes as the focus of Brit tennis fans, and the man who will carry with him the hearts and hopes of millions every time he steps on to Centre Court.

‘When Andy retired they said I was next in line,' said Draper, who was 27th in the world when Murray called it quits. ‘I didn't really think about it then but I have improved so much and put myself in this position.

‘Andy has been incredibly successful and has become adored by the nation. They are obviously big shoes to fill, I'm aware of that. At the same time I'm confident in myself that I can inspire people like Andy has done.' 

Taylor Fritz 

Taylor Fritz will start his Wimbledon having won the Stuttgart Open title on June 15 (with a 6-3, 7-6 win against German player Alexander Zverev).

The American athlete will no doubt be hoping to go further in the tournament this year, after admitting he felt 'hurt' after crashing out in the quarter final in 2024.

He lost that match 3-6, 7-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 to Italian Lorenzo Musetti.

Taylor took to Instagram to share his feelings about the tournament, writing: 'All love Wimbledon.

'Tough match yesterday, always hurts to come up just short but that's part of the game. Now all I can do is rest up, get back to work, and have a good flight home,' he added. 

After winning Eastbourne yesterday, with a 7-5 6-1 victory over fellow American Jenson Brooksby, Taylor has now won seven of his eight matches on grass this year.

The world Number 5, who was last year's US Open runner-up, will no doubt now be eying that Wimbledon trophy. 

Commenting on the upcoming slam after his Eastbourne victory, Taylor said: 'I'm going to be ready to go. I'd much rather go into the tournament with confidence and a title.'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Emma Raducanu relishes Wimbledon return despite no great expectations","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/29/emma-raducanu-wimbledon-2025-womens-draw-mimi-xu","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 17:02:00 GMT","

Tough draw, injury and off-court matters mean British No 1 is not looking far beyond first-round match with Mimi Xu

Being Emma Raducanu is not the easiest task. For all the positives that come with achieving fame early, as she did after her stunning US Open triumph as an 18-year-old in 2021, the obligations and attention can be intense. Invariably when she plays her photo is splashed on the back pages and her every move is scrutinised. At Wimbledon the attention grows exponentially and nothing is off limits, as Raducanu discovered when she batted away questions about a possible romance with Carlos Alcaraz, a longtime friend, with whom she will play mixed doubles at the US Open.

As Andy Murray learned over many years, dealing with all that takes experience and patience. No wonder, then, that Raducanu says she is not looking much further than her first-round battle with the 17-year-old Welsh player Mimi Xu on Monday. “Truthfully I don't expect much from myself this year,” she said on the eve of the event.

“I know I've been dealing with certain things. I just want to go out there and embrace the moment. I want to embrace the occasion. I know there's not many opportunities to be playing at Wimbledon. You get it once a year and for a finite amount of time. I'm just looking forward to going out there and feeling the surroundings and the atmosphere.”

Though the 22-year-old has already experienced so much in her career, it is worth remembering that this will be only her fourth Wimbledon. She reached the last 16 on her debut in 2021 and again last year, showing her aptitude for grass and revelling in front of her home crowd. After having surgery on both her wrists and one ankle in 2023, she dropped outside the top 300 but has worked her way back up the rankings to No 40, which also makes her the British No 1 again, a nice rivalry with Katie Boulter developing.

Her grass-court season began with two good wins at the revamped women's event at the Queen's Club, and then in Eastbourne last week she lost in the second round against Maya Joint, the Australian who went on to win the title. There Raducanu said she was dealing with some bad news off the court but she was all smiles this weekend, practising on Sunday with Boulter.

“I had one day off after Eastbourne, which is not much time,” Raducanu said. “Right now I'm just happy to be at Wimbledon. That is a great kind of motivation to just keep going and deal with everything else afterwards.”

Raducanu has also been battling a niggling back problem in recent weeks, with occasional spasms a cause for concern and discomfort but nothing serious. “It's just been managing [it], as I've said the last few weeks,” she said. “I wouldn't say it's 100% but a lot of the time with tennis players nothing is ever 100%. So just taking it as it comes.”

John McEnroe, a three-time Wimbledon singles champion, had back problems early in his career. Reflecting now, he wonders whether they were caused by the stress of the tour. Raducanu has the use of all the best doctors, of course, but stress is an undoubted factor in players' injuries and maybe something she looks at too, in due course.

Providing Raducanu gets past Xu she is likely to play Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 champion, which would be a far from easy proposition. Get through that and the world No 1 and tournament favourite, Aryna Sabalenka, may well be waiting in round three. Having pulled out on the opening day of last year's event with a shoulder injury, the Belarusian cannot wait to get started. “I'm super excited, super happy to be back, to be healthy and to be able to compete at this beautiful tournament,” she said.

Sabalenka and Coco Gauff, who beat her to win the French Open three weeks ago, are seeded to reach the final, but both know there are many threats and dangers lurking in the draw, including Madison Keys, the American who won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, when she defeated Sabalenka in a brilliant final.

The Czech's victory last year made her the eighth different champion in the past eight tournaments on the women's side, and with Elena Rybakina (2022), Vondrousova and Petra Kvitova (2011 and 2014) the only previous champions in the draw, another new winner is a distinct possibility.

Kvitova will be making her last Wimbledon appearance, having announced she will retire after the US Open. The 35-year-old is back after missing the event last year because of the birth of her son and plans to enjoy every moment. The left-hander's performance in the 2014 final against Eugenie Bouchard remains one of the best of any final in Wimbledon history. She will be missed.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Jannik Sinner: Italian only just met US Open mixed doubles partner Emma Navarro at Wimbledon","https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/cwyxwp07gdro","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 14:46:00 GMT","

Jannik Sinner is targeting Carlos Alcaraz's Wimbledon title after losing to the Spaniard in the French Open final

Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro have plenty in common. Both are incredibly successful tennis players in their early 20s, both have had deep runs at Wimbledon but want more, and both have focused almost all their tennis energy so far on singles.

At the US Open in August, they will play doubles together. On Friday, they spoke for the very first time in their lives.

""It was very unexpected to be honest,"" Italian world number one Sinner told reporters at the All England Club, when asked about the partnership. ""I just met her on Friday for the first time. We'd never talked or texted each other.""

This year's US Open mixed doubles is being held as a standalone event on 19-20 August before the hard-court Grand Slam begins on 24 August, a move by the United States Tennis Association which said it hoped would attract more high-profile singles players.

Sinner and Navarro are one of several eye-catching pairings who have been put together for the tournament where British number one Emma Raducanu and Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz are also due to join forces.

The general presumption in doubles is that the better you know a person, the better you play together.

But Sinner and Navarro can take confidence from the examples of unexpected pairings going on to win slams.

For instance Heather Watson and Henri Kontinen won the 2016 Wimbledon mixed doubles title despite never playing together before the tournament and colliding with each other several times during the final.

""The tournament kind of wanted us to play together because certain teams were already set up,"" Sinner explained at Wimbledon, where he faces fellow Italian Luca Nardi in the first round on Tuesday.

""The choice was not big but I'm very happy to play with Emma. I told her already to not get frustrated with me for my not-very-good volleys.""

He then joked: ""I hope [we meet up] before the first time we walk out on court.""

World number 10 Emma Navarro reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals last year

Sinner is a three-time Grand Slam singles champion having won the past two Australian Open titles and last year's US Open, but has never played a doubles match at a slam.

Australian Open and Wimbledon quarter-finalist Navarro, who also reached the US Open semi-finals last year, specialises in singles but has made several Grand Slam doubles appearances.

But she has never won a doubles match at the US Open.

Sinner is the world's number 589 in men's doubles whereas Navarro is ranked at 505 by the WTA.

A host of big names - including Novak Djokovic, Iga Swiatek, Nick Kyrgios and Naomi Osaka - are also on the US Open mixed doubles entry list. Britain's Jack Draper is set to feature alongside Chinese world number six Zheng Qinwen.

Sinner predicted the new tournament will be ""very exciting for the fans"" and ""the best singles players playing doubles is always something fun to watch"".

Jannik Sinner (centre) has parted company with physiotherapist Ulises Badio (left) and trainer Marco Panichi (right)

Sinner is confident his decision to part with two core team members on the eve of Wimbledon will not affect his tournament chances.

He opted to move on from trainer Marco Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio who had been employed by the 23-year-old since September 2024, helping him retain his Australian Open title in January and reach the French Open final in June.

""I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me,"" said Sinner. ""I feel ready to compete. I feel free.

""We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. But I decided to do something different.""

Sinner reached the quarter-finals of last year's Wimbledon where he was beaten in five sets by Russian Daniil Medvedev.

 Contributor. 

With Wimbledon set to begin Monday, John McEnroe believes the American men are closing in on winning a major title.

No American man has won a Grand Slam trophy since Andy Roddick at the 2003 U.S. Open. Pete Sampras was the last American man to win Wimbledon – in 2000.

But the U.S. enters the fortnight with four men ranked in the Top 13 in the world: No. 5 Taylor Fritz, No. 10 Ben Shelton, No. 12 Frances Tiafoe and No. 13 Tommy Paul. They are among 14 American men in the Top 100 in the world.

Fritz is coming off winning his fourth Eastbourne title, one of the warm-ups to Wimbledon played on grass. Fritz defeated fellow American Jenson Brooksby 7-5, 6-1 to extend his record for the most men's singles titles won in Eastbourne.

“I definitely think that we're closer than we've been in quite a while,” McEnroe said this week on an ESPN conference call with reporters. ESPN will broadcast Wimbledon beginning Monday.

“We're closer than we've been in 15 years.”

In recent years, several American men have gone deep into majors.

Last year, Fritz beat Tiafoe in the U.S. Open semifinals to become the first American man in a Slam final since Roddick at Wimbledon in 2009, and the first at the Open since Roddick in 2006.

In the final, Fritz lost to Italian Jannik Sinner in straights sets in a jam-packed Arthur Ashe Stadium where the crowd included Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, Patrick Mahomes, Jon Bon Jovi, Matthew McConaughey and Noah Lyles.

Fritz, who opens Monday against huge-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, has never been past the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.

Shelton reached the Australian Open semifinals this year and the U.S. Open semis in 2023. He lost in Melbourne to Sinner, who improved to 15-0 against Americans in majors.

Shelton had his best finish at Wimbledon last year when he reached the fourth round.

Tiafoe has twice reached the U.S. Open semis, but also has never been past the round of 16 at Wimbledon (2022).

Paul advanced to the Australian Open semis in 2023 and the quarters at Wimbledon a year ago, where he lost in straight sets to Carlos Alcaraz.

The biggest problem for the American men – actually, the two biggest problems – are Alcaraz and Sinner. They have combined to win the last six major titles and show no signs of letting up.

They have apparently picked up where the ""Big 3"" left off. Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer combined to win 66 major titles, depriving many other players, including all the Americans during that era, of winning majors.

“I think that some of it was we just assumed that [American men winning majors] would keep happening in the early 2000s [after Sampras and Andre Agassi], and then when we realized that it wasn't, that all of a sudden legends came in... Federer, and Nadal [and] Djokovic,” McEnroe said. “Then the more countries putting more resources into it. We were sort of falling behind.”

He added: ""In terms of who we have, Tommy Paul, Taylor Fritz, Francis Tiafoe, Reilly Opelka. They're all sort of the same age. I think it's good when you have people pushing each other….

“Now, Shelton has come along. He's an interesting story. He's more like the type that I have been pushing. Don't focus all in it at 10 years old. Maybe play some other sports for a while. Go to college potentially. Mature as an individual. I think that's starting to make an impact in terms of our consistency.”

On the women's side, two Americans have won both majors this year, with Madison Keys capturing her first Slam crown at the Australian Open and Coco Gauff winning an epic battle over world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to become the first American woman since Serena Williams in 2015 to win Roland Garros.

“On the women's side you have the two Grand Slam winners already this year are American, Madison and Coco,” 18-time major champion Chrissie Evert said. “You got Jessica Pegula who reached the finals in the U.S. Open. So American tennis, both men and women joined together, has never looked so good.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","tennis"

Tennis star Danielle Collins has teased Emma Raducanu after she dismissed speculation about a possible romantic relationship with Carlos Alcaraz.

Raducanu and Alcaraz are accustomed to the limelight, but have sparked even more gossip since deciding to team up for mixed doubles at the forthcoming U.S. Open. While Raducanu's immediate attention is on her opening Wimbledon match against British compatriot Mimi Xu this Monday, she was asked about her rapport with Alcaraz during a media briefing.

The 22-year-old quickly quashed suggestions of a budding romance. However, American tennis player Collins couldn't help but share Raducanu's succinct reply on social media and make a joke at the former U.S. Open champion's expense.

In the lead-up to Wimbledon, Raducanu faced the press and was quizzed about the authenticity of rumors connecting her with Alcaraz in a romantic sense. The question came after the two stars were seen together in an Evian ad shoot.

""We're just good friends,"" Raducanu replied. Following her comment, a journalist humorously suggested that it might be the perfect note to end the press conference. ""Way to wrap up,"" laughed Raducanu.

Collins, who is gearing up to take on Colombia's Camila Osorio at Wimbledon this Tuesday, couldn't resist joining in on the fun. She replied to a snippet of Raducanu's press conference on Instagram with mock outrage. ""Brutal! ! @emmaraducanu such a heartbreaker,"" Collins wrote, accompanied by a laughing emoji.

Raducanu and Alcaraz are set to light up the U.S. Open as a formidable pair in a star-studded mixed doubles lineup this August. The young Spanish sensation, fresh off clinching his fifth Grand Slam singles title at Roland Garros, is all geared up to join forces with Raducanu on the iconic courts of Flushing Meadows.

""She's gonna be the boss,"" Alcaraz joked. ""Yeah, I've known Emma since a really long time ago, so we know each other. I have really good relationship with her.

""So it's just gonna be interesting. You know, obviously both, you know, we are gonna enjoy, for sure. I will try, you know, to put my doubles skill on it. We will try to win. But obviously it's going to be really, really fun.""

Alcaraz revealed he had made a ""special request"" to team up with Raducanu and admitted that she initially left him hanging before giving an answer. However, Raducanu has since explained the reason behind her delay.

""Gotta keep them on their toes!"" she quipped. ""I mean, of course, I had to ask my team if they wanted me to play. But for me, when he asked me, I was going to say yes, I just had to kind of go through the formality of asking my coach, so I didn't just make the decision.""

Through their collaboration, Raducanu will aim to capture another major victory at Flushing Meadows, building on her stunning teenage success story from the 2021 U.S. Open singles championship. As a result, Raducanu is on high alert for the challenge posed by 17-year-old wildcard Xu at Wimbledon.

The British star and former U.S. Open champ is no stranger to Xu's playing style, having shared the court with her in practice sessions before their upcoming first-round showdown at the All England Club. ""I think it's a very dangerous match, very difficult. Mimi is a really, really good player. I've practised with her a few times,"" Raducanu said in a press conference.

""She has a lot of weapons. She also moves really well. It's going to be a really different match. For her, it's one where there's nothing to lose. I remember when I had my first Wimbledon here and I was 18. It's a great feeling. You just feel, like, completely fearless.""

Among other things, the tennis world is also keeping a close eye on  Carlos Alcaraz  and  Emma Raducanu , for many believe the two youngsters are dating. They have known each other since 2021 and Alcaraz approached her to pair up with him when the US Open decided to hold the mixed doubles during the qualifying week.

Wimbledon starts on June 30. Raducanu will kick-start her campaign against compatriot Mingge Xu, whom she will be facing for the first time. In the pre-tournament press conference, when Raducanu was asked about the dating rumors with Alcaraz, she said: “We're just good friends.” That was the end of her press conference and Raducanu joked: “Way to wrap up (laughs).“

Alcaraz will be entering Wimbledon to defend his title for the second time. In the previous two finals, he upset 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. The Spaniard is also aiming to complete the Channel Slam for two consecutive seasons as before Wimbledon, he defended his French Open title by beating Jannik Sinner.

Raducanu, however, has never progressed beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon, reaching the stage in 2021 and 2024. Last year, Lulu Sun ended her campaign.

The Brit is still searching for her first title since her fairytale run at the 2021 US Open. Since that victory, the only time Raducanu was successful in winning four consecutive matches in a tournament was in this year's Miami Open, where she lost to eventual runner-up Jessica Pegula in the quarterfinals.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have ensured that tennis is in good hands after the Big 3. They have won the last six Majors, with Novak Djokovic being the last player other than them to emerge as a winner in a Grand Slam event (2023 US Open).

At Wimbledon, apart from Sinner and Alcaraz, Jack Draper too will be playing as one of the contenders. He has won one grass-court title (2024 Stuttgart Open) and this year, he lifted the Indian Wells Masters as well as reached the Madrid Open final (lost to Casper Ruud). During The Rennae Stubbs Tennis Podcast, Draper shared what changes he thinks Sinner and Alcaraz brought to the men's tour.

They've really set the bar for the next group of players who are kind of following in their footsteps. Tennis has become like a really aggressive power sport, and so the margins are getting smaller and smaller.

Draper is projected to square off against Djokovic in the quarterfinal, Sinner in the semifinal, and Alcaraz in the final. He has lost his only match against the Serb, while against the World No.1, the Brit holds a 1-1 head-to-head record. Draper has met the five-time Grand Slam champion six times, winning two of these matches.

But those guys are definitely stepped up after Rafa [Nadal], Roger [Federer], Novak, and, yeah, it's nice to be chasing them out like I have chased those other top ones. 100%, there's a pack of really, really good young players coming up who want to dominate like the ones before.

At Wimbledon, Alcaraz will kick-start his campaign against Fabio Fognini, while Sinner will play compatriot Luca Nardi. Draper will be facing Sebastian Baez.

Sinner has never played in the Wimbledon final, reaching the semifinal in 2023 (lost to Djokovic), while last year, Daniil Medvedev eliminated him in the quarterfinal. If Alcaraz and Sinner reach the final, they could set up a clash in a Grand Slam final for the second time.

Draper has never progressed beyond the second round of the grass-court Major, reaching the stage twice, in 2021 and 2024. Last year, compatriot Cameron Norrie ended his run.

Madison Keys has voiced her concerns about the current political climate under U.S. President Donald Trump, suggesting it has had a negative impact on global kindness.The American tennis star, who won the Australian Open this year, is set to face Romanian player Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the first round of Wimbledon on June 30. However, before she attempts to break through the quarter-final barrier, she expressed her struggle to remain optimistic during Trump's second term in the White House.

""It's definitely a tough time, and it's hard to balance where you want to be informed and know what's going on, but at the same time, it's crazy,"" she said. These comments were made during a discussion about her non-profit organisation, Kindness Wins. The foundation, launched in 2020, aims to promote access to tennis courts and positive character development among young athletes. Keys acknowledged the challenge of staying informed about national issues without letting the turmoil distract her mental focus as a top-level athlete. ""Sometimes it's hard to shut it off enough that you don't pull your hair out,"" she admitted.

""But also not being oblivious to what's going on and the realities of everything. It's definitely difficult at the moment.""

Trump has come under fire for a series of controversial policies, from his stern stance on Iran to stringent immigration controls that have sparked nationwide protests. Over 17,200 individuals were deported in April alone, as per the latest statistics from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The US President is also facing intense scrutiny over his dealings with Canada, in addition to his proposed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' – a move potentially slashing various social programmes whilst carving out new tax reliefs. Meanwhile, Keys' philanthropic efforts are making waves. Her foundation has been busy refurbishing facilities like the JV Morris Tennis Center, reflecting its ever-growing influence in both digital realms and grassroots communities.

In a bid to foster youth development, her #KindnessWinsDay campaign in 2024 granted a £3,600 to the Denton Johnson Tennis Program in Central Florida – just one of many ventures her foundation arms are extending to uplift the nation's children.

""Tennis has always given me a safe space to grow and find who I am,"" declared Keys. ""I want to make sure that's available for more kids who might not have that opportunity otherwise.""

On the tennis court, Keys' talent continues to shine brightly. She is ranked sixth in the world heading into Wimbledon. Keys has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals twice, first in 2015 and then in 2023, when she was beaten by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

But it was 2025 that marked a turning point in Keys' career when she triumphed at the Australian Open in January. Toppling giants like Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, Keys clinched her much-deserved maiden Grand Slam title. That victory occurred just weeks after Trump resumed office in January. Regardless of how far she progresses in Wimbledon, Keys remains dedicated to her mission both on and off the court.

            With the Wimbledon Championships only a few days away, Aryna Sabalenka took some time to answer some questions with GQ fashion magazine, one of which involved the very visible tiger tattoo on her left forearm and left thigh.    


            The World No.1 will be the top seed at Wimbledon next week, where she kicks off her campaign against Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine. The big-hitting Belarusian's best performance at SW19 have been two semifinal appearances, in 2021 and 2023. Sabalenka did not compete at last year's edition due to injury.    


            During her interview with GQ magazine, Sabalenka was asked to list the ten things she could not live without. The two-time Australian Open champion mentioned her Wilson tennis bag, which came with a Tiger zipper. After playing coy, Sabalenka finally revealed the meaning behind her prominent Tiger tattoo.    


            ""They're not doing this with every player,"" said Sabalenka with a laugh. ""So it means like you achieve something and having these things on my bag, it's just a dream, you know? ""So pretty with this little cat situation. I was born Year of Tiger and I always felt like a fighter on court. That's the truth, you have to fight every single point. So I felt like it's a good reminder to have on my arm that I have to keep fighting no matter what. So it's just a little inspiration for myself.""    


            Sabalenka was born in 1998, which equates to The Year of The Tiger in the Chinse Zodiac. The Belarusian powerhouse would state she got the tattoo to help remind her stay fierce and competitive on the court.

ATPTour.com highlights five players from the ATP Challenger Tour to watch during Wimbledon.

Shintaro Mochizuki
The 22-year-old's ability to take the ball early, hit flat groundstrokes and finish points at net makes him a tricky opponent on grass, a surface on which Mochizuki has plenty of experience. In 2019, Mochizuki won the Wimbledon boys' singles event as a 16-year-old, becoming the first Japanese male player in history to win a junior Slam.

Mochizuki advanced through qualifying and will now look to improve upon his 10-2 grass-court record (across all levels) this season. He finished runner-up at the grass Nottingham Challenger, where former Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic beat Mochizuki to lift the trophy. Mochizuki also made the semi-finals in Ilkley.

Jack Pinnington Jones
One of the home hopes in the draw, Pinnington Jones showed his grass-court prowess and heavy firepower earlier this month by reaching the Ilkley Challenger final in just his fourth event at that level this season. The 22-year-old recently completed his junior season at Texas Christian University, following in the footsteps of countrymen Cameron Norrie and Jacob Fearnley, who both played for TCU and are now inside the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings.

Pinnington Jones is turning pro and will look to seize a memorable moment in his first major main-draw appearance. A two-time ITA All-American, Pinnington Jones is a repeat qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which focuses on increasing the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system.

Henry Searle
The #NextGenATP British lefty will look to lean on home support while returning to the All England Club, where he is competing as a wild card for the second consecutive year. Flashback to 2023 and Searle was crowned champion at the Wimbledon boys' singles event, doing so without dropping a set. Searle, then 17, became the first British male since 1962 to win that junior tournament.
At 18th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, Searle is trying to push for a qualifying spot for the 20-and-under the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Earlier this season, the Wolverhampton native reached his maiden Challenger final on indoor hard courts in Nottingham. Searle starts against American Ethan Quinn, who made the third round of Roland Garros as a qualifier and is at a career-high No. 89.
Leandro Riedi
The Swiss was overcome with emotion on Thursday when he advanced through qualifying to secure his first major main-draw appearance. Riedi's tears meant more than playing in the field of 128, but rather they were reflective of how difficult the past year has been for him. In 2024, Riedi let slip a two-sets-to-love lead in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying and even held a match point, but Australian Alex Bolt spoiled the party and claimed a dramatic five-set win.
Riedi then dealt with knee pain throughout the North American hard-court swing and opted for surgery in September, and needed another surgery in January. Riedi did not compete for nine months. This year's Wimbledon marks just the third tournament in his comeback. Riedi opens against Oliver Tarvet, with a potential showdown against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz looming in the second round.
Filip Misolic
The Austrian has recently been enjoying some of his best form. Since May, Misolic is 20-2 across all levels, including a third-round run at Roland Garros as a qualifier, only falling to 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic. The 23-year-old has also lifted Challenger trophies on clay in Prague and Poznan during that period.Misolic made a fine transition to grass to advance through qualifying for the second consecutive major. He began the season at No. 315 in the PIF ATP Rankings and this month hit a career-high No. 110.Did You Know?Former No. 3 Cilic became the oldest grass-court champion in ATP Challenger Tour history earlier this month. At 36 years and eight months, the Croatian broke Andy Murray's record for oldest grass-court Challenger titlist (36 years and one month, two years ago in Nottingham). Following his Nottingham triumph, Cilic returned to the Top 100 for the first time since August 2023.

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Antonelli knocks Verstappen out of the race on Lap 1

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Piastri locks up to just avoid hitting team mate Norris

Kimi Antonelli collided with Max Verstappen on the opening lap of the Austrian Grand Prix, marking the end of a wholly underwhelming weekend for the Dutchman.

Max Verstappen had a weekend to forget at the Red Bull Ring as his race came to an end on the opening lap due to a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, leading to the Dutchman labelling himself “unlucky”.

While McLaren have consistently appeared to be the strongest team throughout the season, Verstappen has kept himself firmly in the battle in the Drivers' Standings, but his Championship ambitions took a major knock at the Austrian Grand Prix.

After showing good signs of pace in practice, he was unable to set a final flying lap in Qualifying as Pierre Gasly's spin brought out the yellow flags, preventing the Red Bull driver from cutting down his lap time.

This led to him starting the race from P7, two spots ahead of Antonelli. In the expected first lap chaos, the Italian locked the rear wheels of his car and struggled to make the corner, tagging Verstappen and taking them both out of the race.

Asked to explain his perspective of the incident, Verstappen said: “Unlucky, I guess. It is what it is. I spoke quickly to Kimi, he came with me to the hospitality.

“I think every driver has made a mistake like that. No one does that on purpose as well so for me, that's not a big deal.

“It was not the weekend that I guess we hoped for pace wise. Then of course we were a little bit unlucky in Qualifying with that yellow flag, otherwise you start a bit further ahead.

""Then the race was unlucky again. Sometimes you have those weekends.”

The result marked Verstappen's first DNF since the 2024 Australian Grand Prix and meant that Red Bull scored no points at the circuit, with Yuki Tsunoda finishing last in the order – he was embroiled in a number of incidents with Franco Colapinto, earning him a 10-second time penalty when he tagged the Alpine driver into a spin.

Meanwhile, it was Antonelli's third DNF of the season, and he was immediately regretful following the collision when speaking to media afterwards, with the Italian hit with a three-place grid drop for Silverstone as a result.

“I think I had a normal start, then going up to T3 I was just trying to maintain the position,” he said. “I didn't want to do anything because I knew there was no space in front, but then when I hit the brake I locked the rear and I got caught by that.

“When I locked the rear, I lost the car and then I had to first avoid the Racing Bull [of Liam Lawson], but then I just couldn't stop the car. Unfortunately I hit Max and I just feel very sorry towards the team, and him of course.

“I just apologised straight away. I recognise it's all on me and I just feel sorry because I ended my race, but I ended his as well.”

Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria

‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli

It was a fight between the McLaren drivers during Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring, with Lando Norris beating Oscar Piastri to the win.

Lando Norris returned to winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix after getting the better of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a head-to-head scrap for victory – title rival Max Verstappen having been eliminated in a first-lap incident.

Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed.

After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race.

While Piastri lit up the timesheets in phases across the second and third stints, Norris had just enough pace in hand to hold onto P1 and take the chequered flag – marking his third win of the season and first victory since last month's Monaco Grand Prix.

Race results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton.

George Russell was the sole Mercedes finisher in fifth, with rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli dramatically running into Verstappen under braking for Turn 3 on the opening lap – eliminating both drivers from the action. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race.

Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber's Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion.

A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas.

Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine.

Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line.

Colapinto came close to contact with Piastri in the closing stages of the race when the McLaren man was putting a lap on him, an incident that earned the F1 returnee a five-second penalty but did not impact his finishing position.

Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid.

Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying.

Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh.

As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs.

There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. “The car is stuck in first gear,” the Spaniard said over the radio, before he eventually drove off while Race Control abandoned the start.

Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”.

When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris.

As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen's car – putting both drivers out of the race.

“I got hit like crazy,” a sweary Verstappen rued over the radio, as Antonelli admitted he simply “lost the rear”. With the Dutchman and Italian debriefing at the side of the track, the Safety Car was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track.

On Lap 3 of 70, Bernd Maylander peeled back into the pits and released the remaining 17 drivers – Norris handling the situation well to hold the lead over Piastri, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell and Gasly, with a fast-starting Albon up to seventh.

“Lewis just closed the door under braking,” argued Russell over the radio after a failed move on the seven-time World Champion for fourth at Turn 4, with several drivers engaging in battle but no more incidents occurring for the time being.

Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. “Your call on the racing situation,” came a follow-up message from the Australian's race engineer.

With Gasly's soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. The Frenchman would soon come under pressure from Bortoleto, Lawson and Alonso in the remaining top 10 spots.

On Lap 11, the lead battle kicked off again when Piastri used DRS to grab the lead from Norris into Turn 3. A lock-up at the apex left the door ajar, though, and Norris duly reclaimed P1 with a switchback on the run to Turn 4, where Piastri snatched a brake once more.

As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris' gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate?

Elsewhere, Bearman, Gasly, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Colapinto were all early stoppers as tyre strategies began to play out, while Williams' day went from bad to worse when Albon was called back to the pits to retire amid apparent technical trouble.

Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way.

“Let's see your pace in free air now,” was the message to Piastri, who opted to continue on his way rather than immediately respond to Norris – albeit with a sizeable flat spot. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed.

Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions.

As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri's engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. “The manoeuvre in Turn 4 with the front lock-up was too marginal,” he warned.

Splitting the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton, fourth-placed Lawson and fifth-placed Alonso were now the only drivers yet to pit. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6.

Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. That forced the Japanese driver back to the pits for a new front wing, while Colapinto tumbled down the order.

It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. “I have no grip... I'm about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure.

Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach.

With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Leclerc sat around 14 seconds further back in third, from Hamilton, Russell and squabbling Kick Sauber pair Bortoleto and Hulkenberg (who had charged forward with that early stop and some undercutting). Haas duo Ocon and Bearman were eighth and ninth, with Gasly – who was losing ground amid ongoing issues – circulating in 10th.

Lawson and Alonso sat just outside the points following their stops, but with the prospect of making up some places as rivals pitted for a second time, while Hadjar, Colapinto, Stroll and the penalised Tsunoda brought up the rear.

Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate's advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He's mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic.

Norris gained a bit of breathing space a few laps later when Piastri ran wide at Turn 1 and clattered the kerbs, while Hamilton's hopes of cutting the gap to team mate Leclerc and challenging for a podium were dented by a similar mistake at Turn 3.

With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don't want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least.

Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at 3.5 seconds, with a potential grandstand finish in store.

However, Piastri's efforts to cut Norris' lead were hampered by traffic. With Colapinto and Tsunoda battling for position at Turn 3, the Argentinian wildly cut back across the track and forced Piastri onto the grass – earning him a five-second penalty.

From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto's feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate's championship advantage to 15 points.

Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian's maiden F1 points finish.

Hulkenberg and Ocon were the final points scorers in ninth and 10th, from Bearman, Hadjar, Gasly and Stroll, with the penalised Colapinto and Tsunoda the final classified drivers at the end of their bruising afternoons behind the wheel.

As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz's double elimination.

“It was a tough race, pushing the whole way through – tricky, hot, tiring – but a perfect result for us a team,” said Norris. “A 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I'm very happy. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that's for sure. It was a lot of fun – for me a lot of stress, but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar. Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. He was still quick, so it was good fun.”

F1 will travel directly from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix over the weekend of July 4-6. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

F1 Hall of Fame journalist David Tremayne looks back at the first Grand Prix victory for 1980 F1 champion Alan Jones, on a day in Austria when nobody expected him to win.

It had rained, hard, that morning at the Osterreichring. An Austrian crowd that had celebrated sunshine the previous day was now clad in more suitable wet weather attire, some nursing brutal hangovers on a weekend when groups of unruly spectators had run amok.

As local hero Niki Lauda, the 1975 champion and current points leader, sat on pole position in his Ferrari, fractions ahead of friend and rival 1976 champion James Hunt's McLaren, a great race was in prospect, even if many of the local papers carried stories of fights, damage to cars and even, unbelievably, the stabbing of police dogs.

The dilemma for many was which tyres to choose: wets for the obvious patches of water that remained all round the super-fast circuit, with its daunting high-speed sweeps, or dries for when – if – conditions began to improve over the course of the scheduled 54 laps.

Kick Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto qualified in the top 10 for the first time in his F1 career at the Red Bull Ring in Austria.

Kick Sauber rookie Gabriel Bortoleto progressed into the final segment of Qualifying for the first time this season at the Red Bull Ring, earning the P8 slot on the grid for the Austrian Grand Prix.

The Brazilian, who won last year's F2 Championship, had experienced success at the circuit in his junior career. In 2023, he claimed second place in the F3 Feature Race, and followed that up with an F2 race win the following year – his first of the season.

Bortoleto is one of two drivers (the other being fellow F2 graduate Franco Colapinto) without a point this year, but this round offers his greatest opportunity yet to cross the line in the top 10.

He has achieved this feat in every session of the weekend so far, finding his rhythm quickly at a track that has produced so much success for him in recent years as he also finished each practice hour in sixth, eighth and 10th respectively.

Speaking after Qualifying, he said: “I'm very pleased – first Q3 of my career in such a special place like the Red Bull Ring. It's always been a track I loved.

“In F3 I finished in second I think, fighting for the win. In F2, winning – not only in the series but also in other series, it's always been a special place. Making it to Q3 at this track is a very special thing for me.”

Outqualifying his Kick Sauber team mate Nico Hulkenberg, who is set to start the race from P20, Bortoleto will face the challenge of lining up alongside an out of position Max Verstappen at lights out.

With Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli just behind him in ninth place, he was asked about the prospect of taking the fight to the more traditional frontrunners in a car that has thus far failed to finish higher than P12.

The 20-year-old said: “I think it will be difficult with Max, you know? I think he got the yellow flag on his lap and he should be in the top three, top four where he always is, making miracles sometimes with the car he has.

“He has more potential than the result he got today but only because he got unlucky. Kimi, I think he's also doing a very good job and I don't know, let's see tomorrow how the race pace is.

“I think I can maybe fight with him for sure. I think the whole weekend I have been strong and compared to him as well, I don't remember exactly the positions but I know we were very close to each other the whole weekend.”

In the last practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris set the pace from his team mate Oscar Piastri in a frenetic session.

Lando Norris set the pace ahead of Oscar Piastri and Max Verstappen in the final practice hour of the Austrian Grand Prix, setting the scene for an unpredictable Qualifying session as many struggled to stick to the track limits.

After Friday's running, which saw McLaren establish themselves as the team to beat with their latest upgrades, the drivers returned to the track with the ambition of fine-tuning their cars ahead of Qualifying later today.

Red Bull's Verstappen, who is working with a different race engineer this weekend, was among the first to head out for a fast lap – bolting on a set of hard compound tyres, he clocked a 1m 6.131s on his initial effort, substantially slower than Norris' benchmark time of 1m 4.580s from FP2.

The Dutchman momentarily went wide at the final corner, subsequently reporting over the radio that “the car is a bit nervous getting back on throttle”, adding that the Red Bull felt “a bit snappy” as he attempted to cut down his times.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

More and more cars gradually joined Verstappen on the circuit and Norris bettered his rival's lap by 0.156s, albeit on the soft tyres. Elsewhere, Turn 1 produced a series of overcorrections as the Briton, Franco Colapinto and both Ferraris were forced to take to the run-off area and abort their flying laps after driving wide.

Approaching the halfway point, everyone had made an appearance on the timesheets, but it was Norris who remained firmly at the top with a gap of around four-tenths back to his compatriots in Lewis Hamilton and George Russell.

In an attempt to close the deficit to his papaya team mate, Piastri pushed a little too hard and rattled over the gravel at Turn 9, narrowly hanging on to avoid a more damaging incident. He quickly advised his side of the garage to check the floor and remained over 0.5s behind Norris with 20 minutes to go.

Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar suffered another near-miss at the following corner as he similarly dropped a wheel into the gravel, which sent him into a spin and brought out the yellow flags momentarily. It was one of the more satisfying errors of the session – he ended up facing the right way on the track and uttered a sheepish “sorry!” to his engineer.

Norris abandoned a lap despite setting the fastest first sector of the hour as he drifted wide over a kerb, but he nevertheless finished the session on top with a time of 1m 4.324s, leading a McLaren 1-2 with Piastri just over a tenth behind.

Verstappen replicated Hadjar's spin late on but slotted into third place, beating the Ferrari duo of Leclerc and Hamilton. The two Mercedes were separated by just 0.035s with Russell marginally ahead, while an in-form Lance Stroll, Yuki Tsunoda and Gabriel Bortoleto rounded out the top 10.

The second Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso was 12th, just behind Liam Lawson, who managed to set a time identical to Bortoleto's. Nico Hulkenberg took P13 ahead of the Williams pair of Alex Albon and Sainz, with Haas' Ollie Bearman settling for P16.

At the tail end of the order, Pierre Gasly, Esteban Ocon, Hadjar and Colapinto will all be hoping to reset and better their times ahead of the Qualifying hour at 1600 local time.

Watch the opening lap of the Austrian Grand Prix as McLaren's Lando Norris led the race while drama unfolded further behind.

Amid scorching temperatures, Lando Norris clung onto the lead at the start of the Austrian Grand Prix in a chaotic race start that saw multiple position changes and retirements for Max Verstappen and Kimi Antonelli.

The start was initially aborted as Carlos Sainz – who reported issues with his Williams when he exited Q1 on Saturday – found himself stuck on the grid at the beginning of the formation lap. While he eventually got going, his return to the pits prompted a fairly intense fire around his rear brakes and he was forced to retire straight away.

At lights out, Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc both got a good launch, but the lead McLaren was able to fend off the Monegasque's challenge heading into the first corner. This allowed Oscar Piastri, who started from P3, to charge past Leclerc and claim second place on track.

Further back, Kimi Antonelli locked up and drove straight forward into Verstappen, resulting in both being stranded on the circuit and retiring from the race as the Safety Car appeared while their their cars were recovered.

Lando Norris was the class of the field during Qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix with a charging run to pole position.

Lando Norris expressed his satisfaction after an emphatic return to pole position at the Austrian Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver bouncing back from a dramatic weekend in Canada and some “tough moments” in Qualifying sessions through 2025.

Norris is firmly in the mix for the world title this season, splitting team mate Oscar Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen in the Drivers' Championship after 10 rounds, but he has come under the spotlight for making mistakes at crunch moments.

That includes several compromised Q3 performances, the most notable being a heavy crash in Saudi Arabia, while he ran into the back of Piastri's car on race day last time out in Montreal, which eliminated the Briton from the race and cost him valuable points.

However, Norris appears to have put that latest disappointment firmly behind him during the break between races – dominating practice at the Red Bull Ring and then charging his way to a comfortable pole despite missing FP1.

Asked after Qualifying where that performance came from, having last been on pole in Monaco three races ago, Norris smiled: “It was a good lap, that's for sure. I guess just little bit by little bit.

“I feel even like my Q3 run one was good, but I knew there were a few places where if I just got it right I could get still quite a bit more time – and I did exactly that. I did what I planned to do, and when I plan to do something and it goes right, it normally goes very, very well.

“I'm very happy, [it's been] a good day, and it's been a good weekend for me so far, so hopefully we can keep it up.”

Put to him that he was not showing a huge amount of emotion over the result, and instead appears to have adopted a “steely focus” this weekend, Norris replied: “I don't know. I'm still very happy. It's just that it's a long season.

“I still savour this moment, especially because some of my tougher moments have been in Quali. To put in a lap like today, to have the performance throughout this weekend like I've had, is pleasing for myself.

“I'm excited. It's a long race tomorrow. It's more that it's just a long season. I'm very happy with today, but I want to prove it to myself over and over again, and hopefully this is just the beginning of it.”

Norris will head into Sunday's race 22 points behind Piastri, who lines up third, and 21 points ahead of Verstappen, who lines up seventh – his title rivals compromised by yellow flags in the decisive Q3 phase.

McLaren's Lando Norris drove a mighty lap to claim pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, beating Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and his papaya team mate Oscar Piastri to the top spot.

Lando Norris continued his magnificent form so far in Austria as he beat Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri to claim his third pole position of the season.

After taking provisional pole with his first effort in Q3, he blew his own time out of the water to end the session with a 1m 03.971s, half a second clear of his nearest rivals. His Australian team mate was unable to improve his lap due to a spin by Pierre Gasly, which brought out the yellow flags.

Although Max Verstappen was expected to be in the fight for pole, he similarly backed out of his final flying lap and was forced to settle for P7 behind fourth-placed Lewis Hamilton – who secured his joint best start with Ferrari so far – with George Russell and Liam Lawson taking fifth and sixth.

It was an impressive Qualifying for Kick Sauber's rookie Gabriel Bortoleto, who progressed to Q3 for the first time in his F1 career and took P8 ahead of Kimi Antonelli and Alpine driver Gasly.

Elsewhere, Carlos Sainz and Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda were knocked out in Q1, with the former complaining that the car was “undriveable” while the Japanese racer reported that he had “no grip”.

Carlos Sainz was knocked out in the first Qualifying phase at the Red Bull Ring, having posted the second-slowest time.

Williams driver Carlos Sainz has explained how floor damage and brake problems contributed to his surprise Q1 exit during Qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix.

Sainz, who also fell at the first Qualifying hurdle in Spain and Canada, struggled to make an impact when Saturday's grid-deciding session got under way at the Red Bull Ring.

Having wound up 19th, ahead of only Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg, the Spaniard expressed major concerns to his engineer over the radio as he returned to the pit lane.

“There's damage in the car, for sure,” Sainz reported. “The car is undriveable. When I say undriveable, it's pulling under braking, no load in high-speed. Undriveable.”

When he arrived in the media pen to speak to the world's television broadcasters, Sainz confirmed that Williams had subsequently spotted car damage – as well as other costly issues.

“We've just seen that we had quite a bit of damage on the floor, so we were lacking quite a lot of downforce,” he said. “We also had an issue with the brakes from the start of Quali, so too many things going to on to actually push around a high-confidence track like this.”

Asked about what might be possible in the race, Sainz added: “[It's been] a very weird weekend. We've been very quick in the long runs with the harder tyres, and then on soft tyres we never seem to be competitive. We'll have to have a look why.”

It was a more encouraging session for Sainz's team mate, Alex Albon, who caught the eye in Q1 and went on to qualify 12th – albeit with car damage also impacting his efforts.

“Honestly, I'm really happy,” he said, despite just missing out on Q3. “We damaged the floor in Q1 in the middle of my quick lap.

""I ran wide through Turn 7 and we were fixing the rear with tape. Then we had that red flag, which was maybe the worst-timed red flag that could be there.

“We ended up doing our last Q2 lap on used tyres and a damaged floor and we managed 12th, so I'm really happy.”

Previewing Sunday's action, the Thai-British racer commented: “We actually had good race pace [in practice]. I think, honestly, most probably in line with where we qualified, maybe a little bit faster than that still.

“We've got some good tyre options, I think we saved a couple more mediums than other teams, so let's see how it goes.”

Williams head into the race holding a comfortable fifth position in the Teams' Championship standings on 55 points, 27 clear of Haas and Racing Bulls.

Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria

‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli

The drivers and teams report back on all Qualifying at the Red Bull Ring for the Austrian Grand Prix.

Norris topped FP3 on Saturday, and then continued his fine form by topping Q1 and Q2 as well. That left just pole to go, and he grabbed that in style too – fastest on both runs in Q3, and winding up top by over half a second. That time might have flattered him slightly, as a few drivers – his team mate included – did not get their second laps in during Q3 due to yellow flags. But Piastri admitted that even if he had got that lap in, he likely did not have the pace to challenge his team mate today.

Oscar Piastri, 3rd, 1:04.554

“A frustrating end to what was otherwise a positive session. Gasly spun in front of me at the last corner and brought out the Yellow Flags, which meant I didn't get to open my second lap in Q3. I think we easily had the pace to be on the front row, especially as Lando was so quick, but we can have a good race from P3. I think there will be opportunities tomorrow and I'm not planning on finishing third.”

Lando Norris, 1st, 1:03.971

“I'm really pleased with that. My first lap in Q3 was good, but I knew there were still a few places where I could find a little bit more, and that's exactly what I did. It's been a good weekend for me so far, the performance throughout the sessions has been great, and hopefully we can keep it up. It's a long race tomorrow but I am looking forward to it.”

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

""Overall, a very positive Qualifying result this afternoon in Austria. We are encouraged by the performance of the MCL39 on a circuit we know we are able to extract its capabilities, and to see our upgrade package performing well thanks to the work of the team here, and back in Woking.

“Lando showed the incredible speed he has throughout the session to secure a dominant Pole position with a very impressive lap. It's a shame that we were unable to witness Oscar express his speed and contend for Pole on his final lap due to the Yellow Flag obstructing him from getting a clean attempt.

“We now turn our focus to tomorrow's race where we are in contention to challenge for strong Championship points with both drivers. We're looking forward to another exciting Austrian Grand Prix.""

Ferrari improved hugely overnight, with both drivers seemingly much happier with the set-up of their car on Saturday. Leclerc did spin in FP3, but apart from that it looked smooth sailing for Ferrari as they got both drivers through Q1 and Q2 using just the one set of tyres in each segment. That left them two goes on fresh rubber in Q3, with Leclerc doing a sterling job to split the two Mclaren cars, while Hamilton bagged his joint-best Qualifying of the season with fourth after being unable to complete his last run thanks to yellow flags.

Charles Leclerc, 2nd, 1:04.492

""I'm pleased with today's result. The whole team has been pushing and we brought some upgrades here, so this result is also thanks to everyone's collective effort.

""Congratulations to Lando (Norris) for his lap, he deserves it. It has been a while since we started on the front row, so hopefully, we can use the pace we have in race trim to put some pressure on the McLaren ahead of us.""

Lewis Hamilton, 4th, 1:04.582

""The car felt much better today after the changes we made overnight. We've done a really good job as a team to improve the package, so a big thank you to everyone at the track and back at the factory for their continued hard work. Our pace was encouraging yesterday, and with the step forward we've made today, I'm feeling positive about what's possible tomorrow.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""Qualifying went well for us, everything went smoothly. Right from FP3 and then from the beginning of Q1 we were on the pace and were able to put a good lap on the board. That is very important, because if you don't get a good first lap in the first part, you have to use another set of tyres and that puts you on the back foot for the rest of your qualifying. We did the same in Q2, so we arrived in Q3 with two sets of new Softs.  As I said before, the key is to have a clean weekend. It's true that our upgrade helped today, even if it should be measured in hundredths of a second rather than tenths, but I believe it's more about our execution. Still, Lando was on another planet today.

""As for the race, we always knew it would get much hotter on Sunday, which means the race will be all about tyre management. On the other hand, you can overtake here so you don't have to be too worried about when to make your pit stops, as it is possible to gain back position. Yesterday, our long stint pace was good, so tomorrow, with DRS being very effective here it will be important to be able to use it well.""

As the temperatures heated up on Saturday, Mercedes began to struggle. Russell only just escaped Q1, needing a last gasp effort to make it through. Antonelli was then fortunate to make it into Q2. They had to run used tyres on their opening laps in Q3, and then Russell managed to bag P5 on his second run – which he thought was a fair reflection of where the car is this weekend. Antonelli was held up by Bortoleto in the pits and came out late for his last run, and then had to yield to faster cars coming through and yellow flags, those factors combining to leave him short of the line and missing the opportunity to run again.

George Russell, 5th, 1:04.763

""We knew this track was going to be a challenging one for us. We know our strengths and weaknesses and with a circuit that features high-speed corners and an abrasive tarmac like here, it was always going to be tough to put together a good single lap. P5 is probably the maximum we could have done today in these conditions.

""The gap between Lando (Norris) and us is not really surprising. The McLarens have been doing a great job so far and I don't think we will be able to challenge them tomorrow. However, I think we do have a chance to fight with both Ferraris ahead and this is what we will be aiming for. Let's see what we can do but fingers crossed we are in the battle for the podium.""

Kimi Antonelli, 9th, 1:05.276

""I am really disappointed in how things went in Qualifying today. The potential was there and I was improving lap after lap. Not being able to complete my last single lap is therefore a real shame. I know I had the potential to fight for the top five, similarly to George, so this is one that got away from us. Traffic is always a challenge around such a short circuit but nevertheless, it is frustrating not to get the chance to show what we could do.

""I am positive going into tomorrow's race though. The overall balance of the car is good and the learnings I made throughout the weekend have helped me improve massively. Tomorrow is going to be challenging with high track temperatures and tyre management won't be easy, but I do feel confident we can make up positions.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""The car that we had today was not quite on the pace at the front. That left us in a battle for the positions behind; P5 and P9 is not something we aspire to but is likely where we expected to be after FP3.

""Kimi was very unlucky today. After being squeezed by Gabriel (Bortoleto) in the pitlane, he lost a lot of time queuing and was not able to complete his last single lap. It is really a shame because he showed improvements throughout the weekend, and he could have aimed for a better start position. For George, he likely maximised the car and that left us P5.

""Tomorrow will be a long Grand Prix, and we know that this event biases towards race pace. Hopefully we have a better race car than a qualifying car and both George and Kimi can be focused on gaining positions ahead.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""Today was not our strongest day and we are disappointed with the outcome. Kimi missing the flag at the end of the final session is a real shame and putting him in this position is not what the team wanted. He finished today's qualifying P9 as he was not able to set a time on his final new set of Soft tyres. There was definitely more than that in there for him.

""Getting through to Q3 was tight for both drivers and that left us with only one set of new soft tyres to set a good single lap. George had a reasonably clean run through and P5 looks like the maximum position we could have hoped for.

""We've got some work to do to understand why we are struggling on the single lap, but our focus now needs to shift to the race tomorrow. Race day looks to be hotter than what we experienced in the last two days and managing the tyres will be challenging. However, we had a reasonable pace on Friday so hopefully both George and Kimi can fight with those ahead.""

It was a slightly mixed bag at Racing Bulls. They looked to have the pace for Q3 with both cars, but Hadjar was forced to abandon his last lap in Q2. Lawson did make it to the top 10 shootout and opted to run just the once. He managed to get his lap in just as the yellow flags cleared, and bagged sixth on the grid – ahead of both Red Bulls. That is his best Qualifying result of the season, and sets him up nicely for a tilt at some points tomorrow.

Isack Hadjar, 13th, 1:05.226

""It was a disappointing Saturday. Yesterday we were not in a good position, but overnight, we turned things around thanks to some right changes to the car setup. They paid off in Q1 and I felt another Q3 was possible. Sadly though, during my lap in Q2 I had a different feeling with the car; I just had understeer in high-speed and I felt like the tyres were not ready for Turn 1. It's a shame because my Q1 lap could have been good enough for Q3. I don't know what happened and how we could have gone backwards from there, as we nailed the traffic and usually we make progress besides being very consistent in tyre warm-up. We'll review everything with the team tonight, but looking at tomorrow, we're not really far off and as positives we have new tyres left, so with a good strategy I think we can aim for points.”

Liam Lawson, 6th, 1:04.926

""I'm really pleased to have made it through to Q3, it's a great result and I'm very happy with how everything came together. I've never seen such a close Qualifying before, so it's nice to be on the right side of it this time. We've had the pace over the last few races, but today it finally clicked and we managed to put it all together. The Team has done a fantastic job, especially everyone on my side of the garage who've been working incredibly hard. Tomorrow is when it really counts. It's going to be a tough race with the field so tightly packed, and we'll do our best to keep the competition behind us. The strategy remains quite open, we will work hard over night to put the plan together. My focus will be on getting a clean start and making the right decisions in the car.”

Tim Goss, Chief Technical Officer

“A really good day for VCARB today in Austria. Following the Friday practice sessions we knew that the car was competitive, but at the same time, the lap times were so close we would need a little more to maximise our qualifying position. The setup was evolved overnight to reduce some of the high speed understeer in T7 and T10 whilst ensuring we didn't affect the low speed detrimentally. We also changed to our new specification rear wing with a slightly higher downforce level and efficiency. Practice 3 gave us the confidence the changes had worked and this proved to be the case as both drivers progressed comfortably through Q1. Unfortunately the car felt less consistent for Isack in Q2 and we didn't manage to get the expected improvement from Q1 to Q2 track evolution that would have taken him through into Q3. We are currently looking into the reasons why. Liam's day however just went better and better as he progressed into Q3, ultimately delivering his best qualifying position of the season in sixth place. Congratulations to Liam. We look forward to an exciting race tomorrow.”

Both Verstappen and Tsunoda spun late on in FP3, the Red Bull proving a bit of a handful out there. That proved the case in Q1 for Tsunoda, who could not extract enough pace and exited at the first time of asking for the third time in the last five race weekends. Verstappen made it to Q3, but used plenty of tyres in doing so – and thus had to set his first lap time on used rubber. It was only enough for P7 but worse was to follow, as he had to abort his second effort due to yellow flags. Seventh is not what he was chasing at his team's home race.

Max Verstappen, 7th, 1:04.929

“So far this weekend it has not been the easiest, FP3 earlier today was more positive than qualifying but we were still off the pace and the hotter weather conditions didn't help. Our balance was off and there isn't much that you can do about it once you feel it out on track, that was similar to the situation with our grip, it was difficult to know whether to push the car or not. Pierre spun out which caused a yellow flag and that certainly didn't help us as I had to abort the lap. Even if I had completed it, it still would have only put me around P3 or P4 which would still have been five or six tenths off pole. I don't think that it will be easy out there tomorrow but we will analyse everything post quali to give us the best chance in the race tomorrow.”

Yuki Tsunoda, 18th, 1:05.369

“I am feeling bad, especially because the pace has been good throughout the week and then it was about putting it all together today. So, it is really frustrating that Qualifying has not gone the way I wanted. I am tired of it not going the way we want. We need to be able to put it all together and there was too much difference from lap one to lap two. I struggled with the balance quite a lot, it felt very different from my first push to my second. Something happened between those runs and we need to figure out what was different about the car, it could have been to do with a flap adjustment between the runs. I know there is something good to come from us, the first push actually felt pretty good, and it had consistently felt good with the car but I didn't have that comfortable feeling in the car when it counted, on the last push. The gap to Max was small in Q1 and especially in these tight qualifying sessions we need to work to get the car in a more consistent window, that feels more reliable lap to lap. Tomorrow will be difficult, but I will do my best to make it up.""

Christian Horner, Team Principal

""Tough and unlucky quali for Max. Gasly spun and Max reacted to the yellow which was the right thing to do but it's a great shame. That lap was going to be a 4.4 which could have put Max in 3rd or 4th. Yuki had a good first run in Q1 and was strong, he was in the top 10 and lookIng reasonably competitive. Unfortunately, he couldn't find it and with such fine margins for Q2, he couldn't make it. But this track can throw anything at you, you have to survive turns 1&3 and of course we have seen safety cars play a role here in the past. It's frustrating for today but there is plenty of opportunity to bounce back tomorrow.”

Bortoleto looked quick yesterday, and he continued that form on Saturday in Austria. Hulkenberg had matched him in FP3, but the German couldn't hook up a lap in Qualifying at all and exited in P20. Bortoleto, however, made it all the way to Q3 for the first time in his career, and grabbed a brilliant eighth on the grid. It was a very impressive result for the rookie, as he goes hunting his first F1 points of the season tomorrow.

Nico Hulkenberg, 20th, 1:05.606

“Definitely not the qualifying result I was expecting. Unfortunately, I made a mistake into Turn Four – I locked up the front right and ran wide, missing the apex. It was costly in terms of lap time, and obviously frustrating, especially knowing the potential we had in the car today. It's disappointing, no doubt, but the recent progress we've made has been encouraging. Starting from the back tomorrow won't be easy – traffic is guaranteed – but we know our car has decent race pace. We'll go through all strategic options tonight and aim to fight our way back. Tomorrow is about maximising every opportunity and pushing hard to recover. Congrats to Gabi on his first Q3 appearance and P8 on the grid!”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 8th, 1:05.132

""I am delighted to have made it into Q3 for the first time today. It's been a great weekend so far, where everything came together just right. As a team, we have worked tirelessly, testing different setups, learning from both the successes and the setbacks, and consistently staying competitive. From the beginning of the season, I have believed in the potential of this team and our ability to keep improving, even when we were starting from a difficult position. Reaching Q3 for the first time - especially at a track that holds special meaning for me - is a fantastic milestone. It is a clear sign that all the effort, patience, and teamwork are paying off. I am proud of the progress we have made, but I also know the job is only halfway done: we must stay focused ahead of tomorrow, in order to keep up with the momentum and hopefully convert this qualifying result into my first points finish.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""Our best qualifying result since Las Vegas 2023. Gabi put in a storming performance all through qualifying and built on that over and over to claim eighth on the grid for the race tomorrow. Nico looked good on the first run but ran wide at Turn Four and that's the difference between Q1and Q2 in this incredibly tight season. I want to thank everyone back at the factory for getting the upgrades to the track in time. It's encouraging to see everyone in the team working hard and improving our performance.”

Alpine managed to get both cars out of Q1, but Colapinto could go no further. Still, P14 was a decent display considering he spun in FP3 and was struggling in the first two practice sessions. As for Gasly, he looked like making a deep run into the top 10. But on his second flying lap in Q3, he spun coming out of the final corner, his car doing far more than 360 degrees as he turned around and around. That brought out the yellow flags, and hampered a fair few of his rivals who had to lift off as a result.

Pierre Gasly, 10th, 1:05.649

“While I am pleased to be in Q3, I am not too happy with my mistake at the final corner when I was on a decent lap. I was pushing the absolute limit, too much in the end, and had the spin, fortunately avoiding any damage. Up until then, I was really pushing the car a lot in Q1 and Q2 to put ourselves in contention for the top ten. It is fine margins sometimes and the positive is that clearly the performance and potential was there in the car today. We worked hard to find those improvements after Practice and we need to take these learnings forward at every race. Tomorrow, we start in tenth place and we need a good start and see what we can do from there. It is exciting that we are in the mix, better than we anticipated, and now we need to aim to stay there and score some points.”

Franco Colapinto, 14th, 1:05.288

“Generally, we made a good step from where we were yesterday, but I feel like there was more out there today. When you see how small the margins are it's very close, so without the little mistake at Turn 3 which cost us a tenth and a half, it probably cost us the chance of progressing to the next session. The wind picked up in the afternoon, which made the car a bit unpredictable but was the same for everyone. The car felt better, especially in the low speed, however, I was struggling with confidence in the high speed compared to previous sessions, so there's still a bit of work to do there. I feel like I'm still finding my feet through certain corners and understanding which direction to go with the car. The focus is now on tomorrow and we will give it our all to try and move forward in the race.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“The team did a good job to find some performance after a couple of difficult Practice sessions. Pierre was on course for a better result but made a mistake and spun at the last corner on his final push lap. It's a pity as, without that, we would have been starting the race in sixth or seventh place tomorrow. Clearly the car was good enough for Q3, but we are still lacking having two cars up where they should be. Franco was through Q1 but too far away to reach Q3, which we need to improve if we are to put ourselves in a more competitive position with both cars. We will see what tomorrow brings. It will be hot, strategy and managing the tyres will be important and it is becoming more and more vital for us to score points given our current position.”

Aston Martin could not quite get a car into Q3 on a day where the gaps narrowed considerably. Alonso got closest, making it to Q2 and winding up just less than a tenth of a second shy of making it to the top 10. Stroll exited in Q1, unable to extract enough pace in the hot conditions. The team could still challenge for points, as Alonso hunts a third top-10 finish in a row.

Fernando Alonso, 11th, 1:05.128

""I am quite happy with P11 today. We were very close to making Q3 and it gives us a good opportunity to score points tomorrow. It has been a tricky few sessions here so far and I haven't been completely comfortable behind the wheel. Tomorrow will be a tough race for everyone, especially with the hot conditions, so we will need to be clever and flexible with our strategy. If we get everything right, there is definitely a chance to move forward and fight for some points.""

Lance Stroll, 16th, 1:05.329

""I was obviously hoping for more after we showed some early signs of decent pace in the practice sessions, but the conditions changed ahead of Qualifying and we weren't as competitive. I think the hotter temperatures impacted us and the car was not coming alive as much in these conditions. I was struggling with grip and car balance, and I suspect it was due to the heat, but we will need to look at it in more detail. It's going to be challenging tomorrow, but we will see what we can do.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""On this short lap we saw the entire field covered by less than a second. Both Fernando and Lance said the car was not easy to drive, with low grip, and the higher track temperatures appeared to impact our competitiveness.

""Fernando progressed to Q2 and was just a fraction away from making the top ten. We saw similar small margins for Lance who missed out on Q2 by five hundredths. Let's see what we can do tomorrow to try and compete for points. It's a track that usually delivers interesting racing, with good overtaking opportunities, and there are several strategy options to consider.""

Williams still lacked pace in FP3, their car just not working well at this track. Once Qualifying began, things did not improve. Sainz had no pace whatsoever in Q1, and remained convinced the car must be damaged as he exited in Q1 for the third straight race weekend. Albon put in a great effort to make Q2, but once there got caught out by red flags. That left him with only used tyres for his last run, and he could only manage P12 on a tricky day for the team.

Alex Albon, 12th, 1:05.205

""We collected some damage on the floor during Q1, and the mechanics did a fantastic job to tape up as much as we could to go back out. Our Q2 run on fresh tyres had to be aborted due to the red flag, and despite using old tyres on a damaged car, we still qualified P12 so I'm pretty happy with that. There were some glimpses of pace in Q1 but we couldn't replicate the same lap times while carrying damage. I'm still really happy with the execution of Q2 and, without damage, we had a car capable of reaching Q3. Tomorrow I hope there will be some good racing and we can try to have a good result; I'm optimistic we can go and get some points.""

Carlos Sainz, 19th, 1:05.582

""A frustrating Qualifying. We had a brake issue from the start of the session which was making the car pull massively to one side and I ended up picking up floor damage which made the car undriveable. Overall, we need to pull together as a team and review what's causing this run of form in Qualifying and on the Soft tyre. For tomorrow, we seemed to have good race pace yesterday so I will give it all to recover and get into the points.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""We found floor damage on both Carlos and Alex's cars during the session. The kerbs here are aggressive and we need to use every millimetre of the track in order to be competitive in what is a very tight field, but that cost both drivers performance today. We will be able to repair that overnight and we'll come back tomorrow fighting. The race car on Friday was good and I still expect us to have a quick car come tomorrow, but we have a lot of ground to cover.""

Haas struggled for pace yesterday, and it did not look like they had found anything overnight. Ocon exited in Q1 in Qualifying, and Bearman could only manage P15 on the grid. The good news is that their race pace is often better than their one-lap pace, and Austria is a track where overtaking is very possible. But from so far back, they will be hoping for a chaotic race filled with Safety Cars if they want to make it near the points.

Esteban Ocon, 17th, 1:05.364

“I don't think we've optimised today, I definitely think we have more pace than we've shown. We lacked two tenths in the first two corners, and there was no improvement through the runs, plus the grip didn't feel good. That was enough to put me out in Q1, as we were missing one tenth. Tomorrow, there's opportunity to come back as there's going to be lots of stops and a bit more degradation than normal, so it's going to be an interesting race.”

Oliver Bearman, 15th, 1:05.312

“In Q1 the feeling was much better, despite not having the best lap from my side, we still managed to get through. In Q2, I definitely felt more dialled in but the wind seemed to pick up and I think we struggled a bit more compared to others with those conditions. We have two new sets of hard tyres for tomorrow, which lots of others don't have, and although we lost a set of softs in quali and expected to have a difficult session, I'm glad to be where we are. I think we could've been a few more positions up, but I'm optimistic about the race tomorrow.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“It's so tight in the midfield, only a couple of tenths is the difference of getting into Q2 or not, and the difference between P12 and P15 is one tenth – so everything has to be perfect. When you have slightly less than ideal conditions, you simply don't make it – and we knew that. We couldn't quite get it for Esteban with the tyre conditions and in Q2 the wind picked up, and it made life a lot more difficult for Ollie. We know from Friday that our race pace is good, so our focus is coming from our current positions to score points tomorrow.”

“On what is such a short track in terms of lap time, one usually sees very small gaps separating the cars and that was the case in Q1, with all 20 drivers covered by less than one second. That only serves to make Lando's final Q3 lap all the more impressive. Tomorrow, we can expect a closely contested race, even if McLaren clearly start as favourites. As for strategy, we believe that a two-stop is the quickest choice, running the Medium and Hard. A one-stop is doable, given that tyre degradation is quite low, in fact probably even lower than expected, but on paper it is still significantly slower, by around seven seconds. On top of that, overtaking is definitely possible at this track as there are three DRS zones.

“It's worth nothing that drivers from three teams – Aston Martin, Racing Bulls and Alpine - will have a set of Hard and one of Medium available, while the Haas pair will have two of Hard and one of Medium.”

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Antonelli knocks Verstappen out of the race on Lap 1

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Piastri locks up to just avoid hitting team mate Norris

Have a look at some of the best facts and stats from a thrilling Qualifying session in Austria.

Lando Norris secured his third pole position of the season in phenomenal fashion as he beat Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri by over half a second on his final lap in Austria.

He has dominated the weekend's proceedings so far, but plenty of other talking points emerged from the crucial session. Here are the best facts and stats from Qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix...

After sitting out of FP1 to make way for F2's Alex Dunnee, Norris has led every session he has participated in, as well as every segment of Qualifying.

He took pole by the largest margin of the season so far, with a lap 0.521s faster than Leclerc's effort.

Combining the pole margins of the Qualifying sessions from the first 10 Grands Prix of 2025 totals 0.933s.

This marks Norris' 12th career pole position and bodes well for him – his last three starts from P1 resulted in a race win.

It also takes him to fifth place in McLaren's all-time pole sitters, surpassing Kimi Raikkonen who secured 11 pole positions for the team.

Leclerc claimed his third front row start of the season, and his fourth at the Red Bull Ring.

Despite being disappointed with P3, Piastri extended his streak of being the only driver to start in the top four at every Grand Prix this season.

However, he has only won once when starting off the front row – this happened at the 2025 Miami Grand Prix, where he qualified in P4.

Lewis Hamilton secured P4, which is his highest race start since he joined Ferrari.

After winning last year's Austrian Grand Prix from third on the grid, and taking victory in Canada last time out, George Russell was 0.792s adrift of Norris.

Liam Lawson took just his second top-eight start of his F1 career, becoming the fastest Red Bull-backed car on the grid as he outqualified Max Verstappen for the first time this season.

The Dutchman equalled his lowest start of the season in P7, which he last achieved in Bahrain.

Just behind him in P8, Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto claimed his first career top-10 start.

Kimi Antonelli will be less pleased as he has now been outqualified by Russell 10-1 in 2025.

With Pierre Gasly starting in P10, the Grand Prix will be the 1,000th Championship race to include a French driver.

Fernando Alonso was narrowly knocked out in Q2, ending his four-race streak of Q3 appearances. On the bright side, he has now outqualified his Aston Martin team mate at 23 consecutive Grands Prix.

With Alex Albon taking P12, this marks his second lowest race start of the season – his worst was P15 in Saudi Arabia.

Like Alonso, Isack Hadjar also cut his four-race streak of Q3 appearances short.

Franco Colapinto qualified in P14, which will be Alpine's lowest start at the Red Bull Ring since 2022.

Fellow rookie Ollie Bearman outqualified his Haas team mate Esteban Ocon for the fifth time this season.

Although Lance Stroll looked strong throughout practice, finishing FP2 in P4 and FP3 in P8, he was ultimately knocked out in Q1 for the seventh time.

Nearly matching the Canadian, Ocon netted his sixth Q1 elimination of the season and will start from P17 on the grid.

Yuki Tsunoda was another whose pace fell away after practice – he had been firmly in the top 10 in FP2 and FP3, but qualified P18.

For the first time in his F1 career, Carlos Sainz has failed to progress to Q2 in three consecutive rounds.

Nico Hulkenberg took P20, becoming the slowest qualifier for the first time since the 2023 Belgian Grand Prix.

Nikola Tsolov claimed a lights-to-flag victory in Sunday's Feature Race at the Red Bull Ring.

Nikola Tsolov was at his brilliant best in Spielberg, dominating from start to finish as the Campos Racing driver claimed a lights-to-flag victory in Sunday's Feature Race.

The Red Bull Junior made a strong start from pole, before driving off into the distance, as his rivals squabbled over the podium places to finish 6.6s clear of the rest of the field.

This victory puts Tsolov to within one point of Championship leader Rafael Camara heading to Round 7 in Spielberg, the TRIDENT driver having finished in P6.

Hitech TGR's Martinius Stenshorne and MP Motorsport's Tim Tramnitz produced stunning fightback performances, having started in P15 and P17, to finish in second and third, respectively.

Newly announced member of the Aston Martin Academy Mari Boya was another to charge through the field, the Campos Racing driver going from P14 to P4.

PREMA Racing's Ugo Ugochukwu recovered from his post-race penalty in the Sprint, which dropped him out of the podium places, to finish fifth ahead of Camara.

TRIDENT had all three cars in the top 10 with Charlie Wurz seventh ahead of Mercedes-backed Noah Stromsted in P8.

ART Grand Prix driver Laurens van Hoepen finished ninth, as Rodin Motorsport's Callum Voisin rounded out the top 10.

The Austrian Grand Prix will remain on the F1 calendar through to 2041 following a long-term extension to its contract.

The iconic Austrian Grand Prix will remain on the F1 calendar through 2041 inclusive, following the long-term extension of Formula 1's contract with promoter Projekt Spielberg GmbH & Co KG.

The Austrian Grand Prix boasts a long and prestigious history in Formula 1, having appeared on the calendar 37 times, with the first race taking place in 1964.

The Red Bull Ring, situated in the Styrian mountains, first hosted the event in 1970 and offers one of the most picturesque settings for a Formula 1 race, with drivers navigating the 4.3 km circuit known for its elevation changes and mix of high- and low-speed corners that encourage wheel-to-wheel battles.

The circuit dropped off the calendar in 2004, but in 2010 the late Dietrich Mateschitz invested in the Red Bull Ring, funding renovations that revitalised the facility and led to its return in 2014.

Since then, the race has become a favourite among fans and drivers alike.
A roll call of greats from Formula 1's 75-year history have taken the top step in Austria, including Alain Prost, Niki Lauda, Michael Schumacher and Alan Jones.

Four drivers from the current grid have also claimed victory in Austria. Max Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Charles Leclerc and George Russell have all triumphed at the Red Bull Ring, with Verstappen holding the record for the most wins on five (four under its guise as the Austrian Grand Prix and once when it featured as the Styrian Grand Prix in 2021).

Stefano Domenicali, President and CEO of Formula 1, said: ""Austria has long been an incredibly special race for Formula 1 so it's fantastic we have secured the long-term future of a Grand Prix so deeply rooted in the sport's history.

""The vision and passion of Dietrich Mateschitz gave the race the investment and attention that allowed it to return as an incredible event on the Formula 1 calendar.

""Each year, returning to the stunning Styrian mountains is a highlight – an experience that evokes incredible emotion among our drivers, teams, and fans alike, creating an atmosphere unlike any other.

""I want to extend my sincere thanks to Mark Mateschitz and Thomas Überall and his team for their unwavering dedication to excellence, and to our incredible Austrian fanbase, whose enthusiasm and loyalty continue to elevate this iconic race.""

Mark Mateschitz added: “I am delighted that Formula 1 will remain at the Red Bull Ring for many years to come. I am proud to continue my father's legacy and to preserve the rich history of motor racing in Styria and at the Red Bull Ring – with and, above all, for the people of the region.

""Austria's close ties to Formula 1 are an excellent foundation for our long-term partnership. Working together, we intend to continue this success story for many years to come.”

Thomas Überall, General Manager of the Red Bull Ring, said: “This long-term commitment to us by Formula 1 is a great honour and a wonderful challenge that we are happy to undertake on behalf of the fans and the Murtal region.

""The new contract is of inestimable importance for the future. The long-term security of the Austrian Grand Prix will trigger further investment in infrastructure and means tremendous added value for the Murtal region, for Styria and for Austria.""

Lando Norris, Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri chat to the press after Qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix.

1. Lando Norris (McLaren), 2. Charles Leclerc (Ferrari), 3. Oscar Piastri (McLaren)

PARC FERMÉ INTERVIEWS

(Conducted by David Coulthard)

Q: Lando Norris, what a lap on a circuit where we expect it to be super tight. Half a second! Put us in the cockpit – where did that come from?

Lando NORRIS: Oh, it was a good lap, that's for sure. I guess just little bit by little bit. I feel even like my Q3 run one was good, but I knew there's a few places where if I just got it right, I could get still quite a bit more time. And I did exactly that. So, I did what I planned to do. And when I plan to do something and it goes right, it normally goes very, very well. So yeah, very happy. A good day. It's been a good weekend for me so far, so hopefully we can keep it up.

Q: So, you didn't do the first practice session, you've been top of the times every time you've done a lap around this track. I feel that I'm a little bit more impressed and excited by that lap than you are. Is this just a new, steely focus for this weekend?

LN: I don't know. I mean, I'm still very happy. It's just a long season. I still savour with this moment, especially because this has been some of my tougher moments in qualifying. So, to put in a lap like today, to have the performance throughout this weekend like I had, was pleasing for myself. But I'm excited. It's a long race tomorrow. I'm very happy with today, but I want to prove it to myself over and over again, and hopefully this is just the beginning of it.

Q: Okay. Well, congratulations. I think that was an awesome lap.

LN: Thank you so much. Cheers, everyone. Thank you.

Q: Charles, after what was an average qualifying in Canada, here we are right there, front row, second place. You must be very happy.

Charles LECLERC: Yeah, I'm very pleased. I mean, it's been a long time since… I think it was Monaco the last time we started on the front row, and it's been a difficult season overall, but the team have kept pushing. We brought some new parts this weekend, which for sure made a difference because if you look at the gaps, everybody's super close. So, it's also thanks to the team, but I'm very happy with the lap. Overall, yeah, it's a good start to the weekend. We know that we have a better car normally in the race than we do in qualifying, so I hope that we can put a bit more pressure on McLaren tomorrow.

Q: Well, you're obviously happy with that performance. You're right there with all your other competitors, but a half a second gap to Lando. Can you imagine that lap?

CL: I mean, not with our car yet, but we are going to work towards that. But it's not to minimise Lando's job, obviously. I mean, he must have done an incredible lap. I haven't seen it because I just got out the car, but I'll definitely look at it. Congrats to him. He deserves it. And tomorrow we'll try and bring him a tough time.

Q: Congratulations on second place.

CL: Thank you.

Q: Now, Oscar, you're a man that doesn't really show his emotions. But when I saw you get out of the car, I sensed a sort of disappointment in your walk. Was there something on that lap that you didn't manage to pull together, or is it just the size of the gap to Lando that's a disappointment?

Oscar PIASTRI: It was the fact I didn't get to start it. That was the problem. I had Gasly spin at the last corner, so I didn't even open my second lap. And Lando's been very quick all weekend, so it would have been a tough challenge, but I think we easily had enough pace in the car this weekend to be on the front row. So always a shame when you don't even get the chance, but we can still have a good race from there. Sometimes it's just not your day.

Q: Well, long game of course, the race, that's where the points are. Good position to start. DRS is very effective here as we've seen in the other formulas, so still an opportunity tomorrow.

OP: Yeah, definitely. I think our pace this weekend has looked very strong. I think the Ferrari pace looked good as well, which was a bit of a surprise, but I think we still got some opportunities tomorrow. So, I'm not planning on finishing third, that's for sure.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: What a session, Lando. Great job by you. Just how close to a perfect lap of the Red Bull Ring was that last lap of Q3?

LN: Always impossible to say, but as close as I would probably ask for. You know, in all the places I could be close to being in the gravel or over the limit, I feel like I was. So, it was a very good lap. I think I improved in every corner and, especially around here, with the high speed in Turn 6, Turn 7, 9, and 10, especially in quali, you've got to commit, and it's exciting and nerve-racking at the same time. So, yeah, again, rewarding when things go right like they did today. And to put the laps in that I did today, I was very happy with. So, yeah, it was a fun qualifying.

Q: And after going fastest on your first run in Q3, were you able to approach that final lap slightly differently? A bit more relaxed maybe.

LN: Not really. No. I mean, the others were not far behind. Even the Ferraris and Charles was a bit closer. I think all the way through quali, actually, the gap to some of the others was bigger than I was expecting. They were not miles away in FP3. But then as soon as we went out for quali, we seemed like a good step ahead. So, I wasn't too worried, but there's this guy here on the left, he's also pretty quick, and the expectation is for him to go out and put some good laps in too, especially in Q3s normally. So, yeah, I think the pressure was still there, and I still knew there were places to improve. So, again, just try to do Turn 1, 3, 4 correctly and then push it a little bit more in the high speed, and that's what I did.

Q: Lando, you've had a couple of tricky qualifying sessions in recent races. Just how satisfying is this pole given what's gone before?

LN: I mean, it's very satisfying, but, again, it's about consistency. Everyone can be a hero in one weekend. It's progress. It's steps forward. I'm very happy with today, but it's still a long journey. It's a long season. The job I needed to do today, I did. And it doesn't make up for the last few weekends or anything, but I did it today, and that's what mattered. So, yeah, very satisfied and happy for putting it together when I needed to.

Q: And you've been quick throughout practice. Just how much confidence does that give you ahead of the race?

LN: I think a good amount. I'm starting in the best position. But we've been good since the first laps I did in FP2. We've been competitive, and I've been feeling confident and comfortable in the car. We've had some upgrades on the car this weekend, which is our first proper set of upgrades for the whole season. So, we've waited a good amount of time to apply them, and from what I see today, it looks like it's definitely moved us in the right direction – especially on a circuit where there's only eight corners really. So, yeah, I'm confident we can still have a good race tomorrow, but it's a long one and plenty of things can happen.

Q: Charles, let's come to you now. Great job as well. You're on the front row. What does this one mean?

CL: It's nice. It's been a long time. I think this year overall, we've been quite weak in qualifying and then pretty strong in the race, but it's good to be at least this time starting from the front row. At least we have a little bit less road to make before fighting with the guys in front. We're there. However, obviously, the gap is pretty big to Lando's lap, which must have been very special for sure. But I don't know if we've got the tools to fight for a victory tomorrow. However, as I said, we are normally very strong on Sunday compared to the qualifying pace, and this gives me hope.

Q: You're running some upgrades here. What difference have they made over one lap?

CL: Well, enough to be P2 because the gaps are very tight around here if you take off Lando. So it definitely helped us. I felt like there were some steps forward. How much, we need to see it in different characteristics of tracks. It's not only on this track that we've got to judge that, but over multiple tracks. However, the numbers that we expected, we had them, which is a good start. That means that we are working in the right direction.

Q: Still a long way to go, but do you think you can challenge for the win tomorrow? Is that realistic?

CL: I'll do everything to put more pressure than usual on those two guys. We have Oscar behind with a little bit of luck today, but tomorrow, try and look forward and see what's possible.

Q: Oscar, let's come to you now. A case of what might have been for you?

OP: Yeah, to an extent. I think through all of qualifying, I was missing that last tenth, but not getting the chance to do my final Q3 run was quite frustrating. Sometimes those things are going to happen. I was quite happy that I didn't lose more spots by not doing that. So, third's still an okay place to start around here. You can race around this track, so try and make some progress.

Q: I mean, Lando's clearly been very hooked up from the moment he drove in FP2. How comfortable have you been in the McLaren?

OP: Pretty comfortable. FP1 was a little bit of a messy start, but then I felt pretty good through the rest of practice. And qualifying again felt quite good. It's very difficult around here to get that perfect lap because there's a lot of corners that have gravel on the exit, and you've got to be pretty careful there. But there's also a lot of corners that you miss an apex by five centimetres one way or the other, and you've lost a couple of tenths easily. So it's not the easiest track to hook up even though it's short, and I just kind of felt like I didn't quite do that today. So, a bit of a shame.

Q: Can we also get your thoughts on the upgraded parts that you're running here? Do you feel the team has taken a step forward with them?

OP: It doesn't feel that different in the car, but on the timing sheets, it looks good. So that's all we ask for. I think the pace this weekend has looked very strong. So, hopefully, that translates to tomorrow as well.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Scott Mitchell-Malm – The Race) Lando, you said on Thursday if you're going to go to any circuit and see if you've got the feel for a car, it would be here. Is this the best you felt in the '25 McLaren this season? And how much did that help going into Q3, because that's where it's gone wrong a couple of times this year.

LN: I think it's been clear-ish from the outside, and I think the feelings have correlated to inside, in terms of the car has just felt very strong. It clearly is very strong here, and very quick. I think where we expect it to be a little bit weak, or not as strong as some of the others in the high speed, seems to have been our strength all weekend so far. It's still trickier in some places, but on the whole, it was easily my best qualifying of the year from a delivery point of view from every single lap I did. I still made a couple of mistakes here and there, but none that cost me a lap or anything, just maybe a tenth here or half a tenth there. So, I think on deliveries, consistency and of course putting it in when it counts in Q3 was easily the best lap I've done for this whole season, probably even better than Monaco, honestly. Maybe not as exciting a lap as Monaco, but definitely a better put together lap than I did there. Some of that is small things that have allowed me to get that out of the car from the changes within the car. Whether that's the upgrades or not, it's always very difficult to tell still, but it was definitely, like you said, the most confident and comfortable I've been in terms of getting lap time out of the car and understanding that. I think it showed today that when I have those feelings, well, it's still not all there, but more there than before, I can have a day like today. So it shows that the feelings I've been requiring, the feelings that I've not been getting as easily, when they are more my way and more where I want them to be, I can put in better performances and have days like today. So, I think that's reassuring for myself, which is a very nice feeling. But it's still about consistency. This is one weekend, I've got to do it for another, what, 12 or 13 or something.

Q: (Christian Menath – Motorsport-magazin.com) Question for you, Oscar. You touched on it earlier that only FP1 was a bit messy for you, the rest was okay. But do you see a pattern where you lose time against Lando? Is it just a matter of Lando being exceptionally good here?

OP: I mean, it was changing a little bit throughout practice and qualifying, to be honest. I think some of my weaker corners at the start of the weekend became a bit stronger, some of the better ones became a bit weaker, so it wasn't a clear thing that was different every single time. I think it's been, like I said before, it's a difficult track to get everything together every lap, and maybe that was slightly the difference today. I felt like I was in the game and there. Just first lap of Q3 was a little bit messy, and then, of course, I didn't get to do the second one. So, yeah, I think there was a lot more potential out there today, just it didn't show.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com). It's another one to Lando, following up on the feelings that you just mentioned. How much of that do you feel is down to your own process where you talked about some weeks ago of constantly improving qualifying and working on those weaknesses, and how much is the car and more specifically the team working on the front end of the car and giving you the feeling that you want from it?

LN: I mean, it's a bit of both. Hard to put a percentage on it. But I said at the beginning of the weekend when we all sat down, like, I still expect more from myself at times. No matter what car I get given, I still expect to do a good job in whatever car that is, whether I struggle with some of the feelings or not. But, you know, when you're fighting against the best, you want everything to feel the best possible. This weekend, I feel like I've had a little bit more of that. It could also be a bit track-specific rather than just car-specific, because there have been some tracks this season I felt more comfortable than others. But it is a small element from the team, and it's also down to myself quite often. I was quick in Canada for the most part and made mistakes there and misjudged many things there, and didn't put the laps together when I needed to. But the pace was there, and that wasn't through a lack of feeling. That was through not doing a good enough job for myself. So, I'm never going to just blame the car, and I'm never going to say I blame anything, but there are reasons for different things. What's most reassuring for me is when I've got some other feelings that I need, I do do a better job. That's the best news that comes out of some of these things.

Q: (Luc Domenjoz – Le Matin) Charles, you have new parts here which allow you to be on first row again. But where do you think you lose out to the McLarens? And will the new parts you will bring at Silverstone allow you to catch up with the McLarens?

CL: There's nothing been confirmed yet for Silverstone, so I won't comment on that. Of course, there are upgrades in the waiting, but I don't exactly know when they will be ready. However, I think we are losing mostly on the high speed this weekend, which was expected. We expected to lose a little bit compared to McLaren in the high speed, but probably we expected to lose even more in the low speed, which was a little bit less the case. So, we'll analyse that. Obviously, we've brought an upgrade as well, and we are still in the learning process of understanding exactly what it does to the car. However, it seems to be working as expected. To reply to your question, very happy to be second. It's been a very difficult season for us qualifying-wise. We've always been fighting for P5, P6 in best cases apart from Monaco. That was a one-off. So, it's good to be starting a little bit further up, and to be straight away with the fast guys, straight from the start.

Q: (Ronald Vording – Motorsport.com) It's one for both McLaren drivers. I guess the two of you said yesterday that you can never rule out Max Verstappen, especially not on a track like this, given his qualifying record. So are you surprised to see Red Bull struggling as much as they did today? And also, even though Charles is up there, does it make you believe that this championship is looking more and more like a fight between just the two of you?

LN: I mean, Max has been our main contender for every race this season. I think just because he's had a slightly worse qualifying today, definitely not going to count him out of the race tomorrow and definitely not going to count him out for the rest of the season. They brought upgrades. Maybe they've not worked as well as they wanted or maybe they have. I don't know. But I think we expected them to be quicker here this weekend. They've still looked pretty good for the most part this weekend, but I don't know what happened to Max in Q3. So, no. I think, of course, we as team-mates are probably the main rivals of each other at the minute. But at the same time, I don't think we're ever – until he's out of the race – I don't think we're ever going to take Max out of the equation. It's still a very long season. So, I think people just need to chill out a little bit. And we'll see tomorrow.

OP: I don't have that much to add, but I think at this point of the year, it's still too early to rule out Max. I agree. I think we expected more from him this weekend, or in qualifying, because he looked very close in a lot of the practice sessions. So, I don't know if he also got caught out by the yellow flag. It's too early at the moment.

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg.

McLaren's Lando Norris blitzed Qualifying in Austria to claim pole, but that doesn't automatically mean he'll have things his own way when the lights go out on Sunday, especially with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc alongside him on the front row.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri will also be very keen to make up places from P3, yellow flags having put paid to his second Q3 run. And don't dismiss Lewis Hamilton in the run to Turn 1, as he lines up next to the McLaren for Ferrari.

Canada winner George Russell starts fifth for Mercedes, joined on row three by a rejuvenated Liam Lawson in the Racing Bulls. Behind them are Red Bull's World Champion Max Verstappen and his sim-racing buddy Gabriel Bortoleto, the Kick Sauber rookie a career-best eighth.

Completing the top 10 we have the second Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, and Pierre Gasly, whose dramatic spin in the final corner was responsible for bringing out the aforementioned yellow at the end of Qualifying.

Lando Norris and McLaren set the pace in final practice at the Red Bull Ring as drivers began to test the limits before Qualifying.

Lando Norris remained at the top of the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, fronting a McLaren 1-2 over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Norris worked his way down to a best time of 1m 04.324s on soft tyres to edge out Piastri by 0.118s, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

Several drivers had wide moments and brushes with the gravel traps, including championship leader Piastri, who spent a few minutes in the garage midway through the session while mechanics checked for damage to his floor.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and World Champion Verstappen experienced slightly bigger scares, going for full 360 spins at the final corner but avoiding any barriers, while Yuki Tsunoda dropped his Red Bull exiting Turn 1.

Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria

‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli

Previous

Red Bull endured a wholly challenging Qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix as Max Verstappen was forced to settle for P7, while Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in Q1.

Max Verstappen's previously impressive Qualifying record at the Red Bull Ring was cut short as he ended the session down in seventh position, with neither he nor his team mate Yuki Tsunoda showing any signs of optimism for the upcoming Austrian Grand Prix.

Although he wasn't quite able to take the top spot across practice, the Dutchman was firmly in the top three heading into Qualifying, and any error by McLaren could have seen him claim his fifth pole position at the circuit.

This failed to materialise, but instead of remaining in the usual top three behind the papaya frontrunners, Verstappen dropped back in the order to P7 as his final flying lap had to be aborted due to yellow flags brought out for a spin by Pierre Gasly.

The result is his joint worst Qualifying of the season and leaves polesitter Lando Norris and third-placed Oscar Piastri with the perfect opportunity to further extend their lead over Verstappen in the Drivers' Standings.

He earlier described the Red Bull as “nervous” and “snappy” in FP3, but these problems seemed to worsen as Qualifying went on.

“Everything fell apart a bit,” he said afterwards. “Every corner was a bit of a struggle to be honest. No balance, no front, no rear in different places of the corner, so that made it very difficult to get in a rhythm and a bit of a benchmark.

“Even with the final lap, of course I had a yellow so I had to abort. It was still not even close to pole so that was quite a painful Qualifying for us.”

Asked whether the car's race pace indicated any room for improvement in the Grand Prix, he responded: “Yeah but tomorrow's probably going to be even warmer than today.

""It seems like as soon as it got warmer, it made our struggles even worse. That doesn't look great, but we'll see tomorrow. Maybe [there will be] some surprises in the race.”

Overall, it was a session to quickly forget for Red Bull as Tsunoda experienced a similar phenomenon to his team mate. After claiming P7 and P9 in FP2 and FP3 respectively, he was knocked out in Q1 despite being just over two-tenths adrift of Verstappen up in P7.

With remarkably close margins separating the entire field, the Japanese driver ended up in P18, later reporting issues with the balance just like Verstappen.

Prompted to explain exactly what went wrong, Tsunoda replied: “I don't know, I'll have to check but the balance was completely off on the last lap. I felt quite good on the first push but the second push was somehow completely off.

“I don't think I've done anything wrong with the warm up or anything. To be honest, the balance was completely different so it's hard to explain that.

“Even if the pace is good, ending up like this is so frustrating. The balance in the end just meant I couldn't put together a time. I have to talk with the engineers.”

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

Good things come in small packages, an aphorism of which you are constantly reminded staring out across the Red Bull Ring and down into the valley below.

This Mighty Mouse of a circuit never fails to deliver drama, and thanks to a Q3 spin for Pierre Gasly and consequent yellow flag, we have a grid for the Austrian Grand Prix that – other than perhaps Lando Norris on pole – isn't quite that which may have been predicted.

Oscar Piastri starts third behind Charles Leclerc, and the progress made by Ferrari's Austria upgrade was further underlined by Lewis Hamilton, starting fourth. Liam Lawson is carrying the flag on Red Bull's home turf, starting P6, one place above Max Verstappen.

Chris Medland picks out five key things to keep an eye on when the lights go out for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

From Lando Norris in dominant form to Ferrari showing signs of progress, and from a rookie chasing his first points to track limits being a major talking point, here are a five things to keep an eye on when the lights go out on race day at the Red Bull Ring…

Lando Norris arrived in Austria in a slightly tough spot, having collided with team mate Oscar Piastri last time out in Canada and losing further ground in the drivers' championship.

But it was only slightly tough because the Red Bull Ring is a track where Norris has been particularly strong in the past, securing his first podium in F1 here back in 2020.

The Formula One racing pic starring Brad Pitt is the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films and had no trouble topping the chart as the 'M3GAN' sequel went up in flames.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


Apple Original Films‘ critically acclaimed F1: The Movie is off to the races. 


	The Formula One movie — directed by Joseph Kosinski of Top Gun: Maverick fame and starring Brad Pitt zoomed to an impressive $55.6 million domestic opening and an estimated $144 million globally, well ahead of expectations in the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films. Friday's haul alone was in the $55 million-$57 million range, well ahead of expectations and including a hefty $10 million in previews.




	Warner Bros. is distributing and helping Apple to market the big-budget summer tentpole, whose worldwide start includes a foreign opening of $88.4 million. Its global bow supplanted World War Z's $112 million to mark the biggest worldwide launch of Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation. F1 has a huge advantage in having a lock on Imax screens until Superman opens July 11. (On Friday, 58 percent of ticket sales were for premium auditoriums). One major caveat: the movie sports a hefty production budget of at least $200 million before marketing, so it will need to keep the pedal to the metal in the weeks ahead if it is to make its money back.

					How 'M3GAN 2.0' Star Violet McGraw Kicked Off a Wave of Good Fortune for Blumhouse		
			









F1, starring Pitt opposite Damson Idris, is a seminal moment for Apple as it tries to jump-start its theatrical ambitions after getting driven off the road with big-budget misses Killers of the Flower Moon, from Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. Kosinski's pic boasts near-perfect exit poll stats from the audience, an A CinemaScore score and strong reviews.


	In the film, Pitt plays an injured former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to team up with a younger driver, played by Idris. Javier Bardem stars as the F1 team owner who orchestrates the scheme. Composer Hans Zimmer wrote the score for the movie after working with Kosinski on Top Gun: Maverick. Veteran producer Jerry Bruckheimer also worked on the big-budget pic alongside Pitt's team at Plan B. 

	











Taking on Formula One is a bold move since it has never been the marquee sport in the U.S. that it is overseas (top Apple exec Eddy Cue is a lifelong fan and sits on the board of Ferrari NV). In 2013, the wheels flew off of Ron Howard's F1 movie Rush, which topped out at $26.9 million domestically and $97 million globally. F1‘s is also pacing well ahead of the racing pic Ford v. Ferrari, a biographical action drama set against the backdrop of Europe's famous Le Mans endurance contest. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that film opened to a decent $31.5 million.


	Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton was brought aboard to produce FI alongside Hollywood vet Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, Pitt and Pitt's partners at Plan B, including Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. 


	Elsewhere, Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's horror pic M3GAN 2.0 flamed out with an estimated domestic opening of $10.2 million, only good enough for a fourth-place finish. The pic limped to $3.4 million on Friday from 3,112 cinemas in North America, including $1.5 million in previews. The Universal release had been forecasting a $20 million debut, which would still have been $10 million less than the first film's record $30.4 million record launch in January 2023, on its way to earning $117.7 million domestically and $226.3 million globally.


	The pic's global start was an equally disappointing $17.2 million. The sequel cost a modest $25 million to produce before marketing, but that's still more than double M3GAN‘s miniscule $12 million budget. 

	











Jason Blum‘s Blumhouse — which has suffered a string of misses this year — and James Wan's Atomic Monster reteamed to make the follow-up. They had hoped the movie would serve as counter-programming for younger women who have to interest in F1. While M3GAN 2.0 skewed 53 percent female, simply not enough of the target audience showed up. (Some have groused that the character has turned too Terminator-like, while the story overall is more sci-fi than horror.) In an ironic twist, the sequel earned a B+ CinemaScore, compared to a B for the first pic.


	Universal puts up the money for Blumhouse titles, in addition to marketing and distributing, but leaves creative decisions up to horror maestro Blum, the studio's longtime partner.


M3GAN 2.0 is set two years after the AI doll went on a murder spree to protect her young human charge (Violet McGraw) and was subsequently shelved. Her creator (Allison Williams), the aunt of the young girl, is now a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of AI. But when another AI creature emerges that is even more dangerous, M3GAN is resurrected and mayhem ensues. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returned to direct the sequel from a story he wrote alongside Akela Cooper, and based on characters created by Cooper and Wan.


	Actors Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return alongside McGraw and Williams, while franchise newcomers include Aristotle Athari, Timm Sharp and Grammy winner and 11-time Emmy nominee Jemaine Clement.

	











	Not all is lost for Universal as the live-action How to Train Your Dragon as it cleared the $200 million mark domestically. Now in its third weekend, the DreamWorks Animation-produced pic came in second place with an estimated $19.4 million for a North American tally of $200 million and $454.4 million globally.


	Pixar and Disney's troubled summer event pic Elio tumbled as much as 49 percent to 50 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $10.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $42.2 million. The animated title added another $11.4 million overseas for a foreign cume of $30.1 million and $72.3 million against a net budget of $150 million.


Elio came in third domestically, followed by M3GAN 2.0 and Sony's 28 Years Later, which likewise fell off sharply in its second weekend to an estimated $9.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $50.3 million. Globally, the dystopian zombie pic cleared the $100 million mark, something 28 Days didn't achieve, although the first movie was much more of an indie film.


	Like Universal, Disney wasn't entirely bereft as summer live-action hit Lilo & Stitch crossed the $400 million mark domestically and $946 million globally in a massive feat. It's only the second movie of the year so far to cross the $400 million mark domestically behind A Minecraft Movie.


Lilo, the live-action update of the beloved Disney animated film, opened over Memorial Day weekend opposite Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, which finished Sunday with a global haul of $562 million for Cruise, Paramount and Skydance.

Denis Villeneuve was named the next director of the beloved franchise earlier this week.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



	For Henry Golding, taking on the famed role of James Bond may be more of a nightmare than a dream. 


	“I think that's every actor's kind of nightmare,” The Old Guard 2 actor told People at the film's Los Angeles premiere this week. His comments on the famed movie character came after Denis Villeneuve was named the next director of the franchise, the first from Amazon MGM Studios.




	“But at the same time, [you're] also wanting to kind of add something new to a franchise,” Golding added. “Why can't they bring out more agents or more OO's? I think that would be so much more fun, because there just isn't the restraints and the expectation.”

	The Crazy Rich Asians star added, “Maybe I'm just a pussy. I don't know. But I think I would love it so much more if there wasn't that overhanging cultural pressure.” 


	Following the news of Villeneuve being named the next James Bond director, there's been speculation about which actor will take on the titular role. As for now, it's merely known that Tanya Lapointe, Villeneuve's artistic partner and wife, will serve as an executive producer alongside Amy Pascal and David Heyman.


	“Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr. No with Sean Connery. I'm a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he's sacred territory. I intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come,” Villeneuve said in a statement Wednesday. “This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.”

Simon's back pain became ""unmanageable,"" says a statement released Saturday (June 28).


													By
												

	Ashley Iasimone



Paul Simon has canceled two concerts this weekend, according to a statement released just hours before a performance scheduled for Saturday night (June 28) at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Simon was set to play the venue both Saturday and Sunday night.


	“Regretfully, Paul Simon must cancel two shows tonight June 28 and tomorrow night June 29 — at Philadelphia's Academy of Music,” read the statement, which can be found on Simon's Instagram account. “Paul has been struggling with chronic and intense back pain. Today it became unmanageable and demands immediate attention. Unfortunately we have to cancel these shows at this time, as we don't have the ability to reschedule them.”

	











	“We are hopeful after this minor surgical procedure which has been scheduled in the next few days, Paul will be able to complete the tour as well as look into returning to make up these dates,” the memo said.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The message instructed ticketholders for Simon's June 28-29 concerts, which were a part of his A Quiet Celebration Tour, to “please go to your point of purchase or local ticket provider for a full refund.”


	Though Simon, 83, had indicated his tour back in 2018 was a farewell tour — at the time, he'd said he was suffering from significant hearing loss — in February 2025, he announced a spring/summer tour after making an appearance on the televised SNL50 celebration (singing “Homeward Bound” with Sabrina Carpenter).

	











	Simon's 2025 tour, which made it to New York City just before Philadelphia, began in April and has dates scheduled through early August. At press time, his next tour date is in Long Beach, California, on July 7, followed by stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and Seattle.

Olivia Rodrigo welcomed Ed Sheeran to her stage for a surprise duet of “The A Team” in London on Friday night (June 27). Together the two pop hitmakers, guitars in hand, strummed and sang Sheeran's debut single for the U.K. crowd at Hyde Park's BST (British Summer Time) concert series, where Rodrigo was performing ahead of a headlining slot at Glastonbury later this weekend.

	Post-show, Sheeran shared footage of the moment on Instagram. The performance video shows the two musicians harmonizing on the chorus of “The A Team.”

	











	“Been a fan of Olivia's since Drivers License blew my mind back at the start of 2021,” he wrote. “Both albums are no skips for me, I'm a proper fan. We first met at the rock and roll hall of fame back in 2022, sat next to each other with her mum and my dad and went on to hang and keep in touch from there.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Of his Friday night plans, Sheeran said, “Was gonna go watch the show anyway but she hit me and asked to sing The A Team with her, which was such a buzz. That song turns 15 this year, and I remember playing it to rooms with no one in it in 2010, so to still be playing it to new fans with one of the brightest stars of the next generation is an honour and a privilege. Rock Glasto headline Sunday @oliviarodrigo , UK loves you x.”

	











	“you are the best ever ed!!! appreciate you so much. last night was a blast,” Rodrigo commented on the post Saturday morning.


	Also spotted at Rodrigo's Friday gig was a smiling Sabrina Carpenter who enjoyed the show from the balcony, as seen in photos published by the Daily Mail.


	“The A Team,” first released in 2011, was Sheeran's first song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 16 in 2012.


	Following Rodrigo's concert, on Saturday Sheeran posted another treat for fans on TikTok: a short mashup of his “Perfect” with Rodrigo's “Happier,” sung together.


	Sheeran previously praised Rodrigo's 2021 breakthrough hit, “Drivers License,” as a flawless debut single, and noted both her debut and sophomore full-length albums, Sour and Guts, are “unskippable… it's just, as a record, just a great record.”

	As the search for the next James Bond reaches the final stretch, Henry Golding shared his thoughts on the seemingly coveted role.


	The British actor recently explained why the 007 lead character is “every actor's kind of nightmare” following news that Denis Villeneuve will helm the next installment in the 50-year franchise.


	“But at the same time, [you're] also wanting to kind of add something new to a franchise,” he told People. “Why can't they bring out more agents or more 00's? I think that would be so much more fun, because there just isn't the restraints and the expectation.”

	Golding added, “Maybe I'm just a p***y. I don't know. But I think I would love it so much more if there wasn't that overhanging cultural pressure.”


Daniel Craig played the iconic role in Casino Royale (2006), Quantum of Solace (2008), Skyfall (2012), Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die (2021). Following previous Bond stars Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan, Craig's successor has not yet been chosen.


	This week, Amazon MGM Studios officially tapped Villeneuve to direct the next installment amid the studio's new 007 partnership with returning producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. Tanya Lapointe will executive produce.


	After announcing that Amy Pascal and David Heyman will produce the next film in the franchise, Amazon MGM's Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll said at CinemaCon in April that the pair of “filmmaking legends” is currently in London working on the film.

	











	“We are committed to honoring the legacy of this iconic character, while bringing a fresh, exhilarating new chapter to audiences around the world alongside Amy and David,” said Valenti, head of Film, Streaming and Theatrical. “They are both in London getting started and couldn't be here tonight, but we wanted to thank them for what we know will be an incredible partnership. Thank you, Amy and David!”

Aaron Pierre.

I would think every actor's nightmare would be not getting any work, but what do I know.

“Why can't they bring out more agents or more 00's? I think that would be so much more fun”

They have already done that. It is called Mission Impossible. I am talking about the original series.

One of the main appeal of Bond is that he acts alone in most of the movie. Stick to acting bro and leave writing to the writers.

Bond is dead.
Superman is dead.TV series,
Multiple 007's was done in the first movie version of Casino Royale (admittedly a farce of Bond).
I say this as an Ian Fleming fan . Get Over It
And yes I  was disappointed Bond died but he did.

And considering the U.S. has been taken over by a fascist Putin-controlled felon and his criminal henchmen, there's no pioint in pretending Bond even matters anymore.

Bro, don't worry, you ain't never gonna get it.

Bro, don't worry, he never said he wanted it.  You ain't never gonna get it either.

Executive Managing Editor


Vin Diesel surprised a crowd on Saturday at FuelFest in Southern California, saying that the final film in the Fast & Furious franchise will hit theaters in April 2027.


	Diesel, who has starred in all but one installment since 2001's original, broke more news during his remarks onstage, confirming the film will be set in Los Angeles and that it will reunite Diesel's Dominic Toretto character with Brian O'Conner, the character played by Paul Walker.


	Walker starred with Diesel in the original and appeared in five installments before he was killed in a car crash in November 2013 at age 40.

	











	Diesel previously had taken to his social media channels to urge Universal Pictures to date Fast X 2, the follow-up to 2013's Fast X which grossed $700 million-plus at the global box office. The sequel has been billed as the final film in the franchise.




			Watch on Deadline		







	He had previously touted that the film should be set in Los Angeles, like in the the original film. Earlier this year, in the aftermath of the devastating L.A. wildfires, he said keeping the production in town was vital.


	“Los Angeles needs it now more than ever… Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago… and now Fast will finally return home,” he wrote. “All love…”


	There are currently no major films on the April 2027 release-date calendar. Notably, the most successful film in the franchise, 2015's Furious 7, was the only pic in the franchise to open in that month; it was the biggest opening frame for any F&F film with $147.2 million, on its way to a global gross of more than $1.5 billion.

	More than 30 years after he'd last played the role, Mark Hamill had a much darker idea for Luke Skywalker's life in Star Wars: Episode VIII — The Last Jedi (2017).


	The Emmy winner recalled his pitch for writer/director Rian Johnson about where Luke's life had taken him in the years since Episode VI — Return of the Jedi (1983) that would make him turn his back on the Force before returning in Episode VII — The Force Awakens (2015).


	“I thought, what could make someone give up a devotion to what is basically a religious entity, to give up being a Jedi,” he explained on the Bullseye podcast. 

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“Well, the love of a woman,” Hamill continued. “So, he falls in love with a woman. He gives up being a Jedi. They have a child together. At some point the child, as a toddler, picks up an unattended lightsaber, pushes the button, and is killed instantly. The wife is so full of grief, she kills herself.”


	Hamill's latest interview comes after he shot down any hopes of Luke returning for another installment in the Disney and Lucasfilm franchise, after the character died during a pivotal moment in The Last Jedi, becoming one with the Force.


	“I am so grateful to George [Lucas] for letting me be a part of that back in the days, the humble days when George called Star Wars ‘the most expensive low-budget movie ever made,'” he told ComicBook.com. “We never expected it to become a permanent franchise and a part of pop culture like that. But my view is, I had my time. I'm appreciative of that, but I really think they should focus on the future and all the new characters.”

	











	Hamill jokingly added, “And by the way, when I disappeared in [The Last Jedi], I left my robes behind. And there's no way I'm gonna appear as a naked Force ghost. I'm just letting you know that right now.”

That is such a better idea than what we got from (RY)an Johnson. Hammil knows the character. Why the hell did they not go with that idea!!!

Good thing Mark Hammill just showed up on set and spoke lines.  The guy has absolutely NO talent for anything else.

Sounds so depressing. What a terrible idea.

A reason why most writers, directors & producers hate the moment they hear “hey, actor wants to discuss story & character ideas”….

Yikes. Actors are not writers. That's clear here!

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


Prime Video's decision in early June to ditch Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino's classical ballet themed dramady Étoile after just one season sent shockwaves through the high-end drama community.


	Cast members Yanic Truesdale, Taïs Vinolo and Ivan du Pontavice put on a brave face as they touched down at the SCAD Lacoste Film Festival in France's Provence region this past week for a screening and Q&A, which was arranged prior to news of the non-renewal.


	“Of course it's a bummer, but at the same time, we're here to celebrate the fact that it existed,” said Franco-Anglo actor Pontavice.

	He plays hot-headed French dancer Gabin Roux in the drama about two world-renowned New York and Paris ballet companies that decide to collaborate and share dancers to save their financially-struggling institutions.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We're just celebrating the experience. We like to tell tales about how it happened, our experience, it still feels very fresh. It just came out and we're still very excited about being a part of it,” he added.


	Canadian actor Truesdale, who plays ballet instructor Raphaël Marchand and right-hand man to Le Ballet National director Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), echoed these sentiments.


	“I'm taking it as a last celebration of the show,” he said of the SCAD screening. “One of the things I said in many interviews is that this was the one job in 36 years on which I made the most friends. At a human level, the fact that we won't be able to hang out on set anymore is a big disappointment.”

	











	Truesdale. who is a long-time Palladino collaborator through his role as Michel Gerard in Gilmore Girls, expressed regret that the show had not been renewed for a second season. 


	“I was very excited to see the second season because knowing Amy and Dan's writing, they set things in the first season, and then the second season, once everything is established, is really, when they start to fly with the material,” he said.


	He joked wryly that he had considered launching a GoFundMe, when asked whether he thought there might be potential partners out there who could salvage the show.


	Per Deadline's exclusive break on the non-renewal, the writing was on the wall for Étoile, after it failed to make it into Nielsen's weekly Top 10 for Originals on its release April 24, and also only briefly topped Prime Video's own top 10.


	Vinolo, who plays Mishi Duplessis, a U.S.-trained French ballerina who is sent back to Paris against her will, suggested the cancellation was indicative of the challenges facing the real classical ballet world, which were explored in the short-lived show.


	“It's all about the money and no longer about the art. It's like in the ballet world too. Ballet has been here for so long, but a lot of ballet companies that have potential cannot show that potential because of the financial aspect. It's very sad. This show did such a good job at showing that,” she said. 


	Pontavice also suggested that contemporary audiences were no longer prepared to persevere with a show if it does not engage them immediately.


	“Even myself, if I watch a something, and I'm not invested after a couple of episodes, I quit watching it,” he said, adding that audiences would have been prepared to invest more time in getting to know a show a decade ago. 


	Quizzed on what the legacy of the show, Truesdale pointed to its message around how the arts are under attack.


	“I always reluctant to make predictions about anything,” he said. “I never thought Gilmore would be still alive 25 years later but for me, this show is a love letter to art. I was hoping that love letter would be received on the other end, because I feel like art is under attack in America, and without art, we lose the essence of being human. For me, that's a very important message, and hopefully that's the legacy.”


	Vinolo highlighted the show's representation of the ballet community, even if the characters will not get a longer story arc.


	“All the characters are so different, with different sensibilities… even if there is no second season, the show achieved a lot in terms of representation and identity,” she said.


	Portavice believes the first season will have a long tail: “Despite the disappointment and cancellation, judging by the positive reactions I've seen online in a very short amount of time, it's had a huge impact in certain communities already.


	“So even if we don't get that season two, I actually think that in a couple years people will look back to the show, and enjoy a lot of the things in it. It might take time, it might be slow for people to really get into it, but I think it's there to stay and to grow.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","James Cameron calls Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer ""a bit of a moral cop out""","https://www.avclub.com/james-cameron-criticizes-christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-cop-out","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 00:52:00 GMT","

Of the very small number of currently working Hollywood directors who could be said to be at, or even above, the level of Christopher Nolan in terms of both producing power and name recognition, James Cameron is almost certainly the one most willing to talk a little shit. Cameron has many laudable traits as both a filmmaker and an interview subject, but holding his tongue isn't one of them—something that became obvious in a recent conversation he had with Deadline, about a new film centered on the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and where Nolan came in for some genuine critique over his blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer.

Cameron was speaking at length about Ghosts Of Hiroshima, his planned film adaptation of the book of the same name, soon to arrive from his old buddy (and fellow Titanic and nuclear war obsessive) Charles R. Pellegrino. As with underwater travel, the intricate hair-bonding rituals of the Na'vi, and basically everything else he sets his moviemaking mind to, Cameron has thought and researched about this topic a lot, it is very clear, and he sounds really excited/horrified to tell the story of the bombs dropping. And that includes doing his damnedest to center the conversation in the viewpoint of the people the bombs were actually dropped on, something he (as Spike Lee did a few years back) criticizes Nolan's movie for flinching away from. “It's interesting what he stayed away from,” Cameron noted of Nolan's film, after being reminded of the implausibility of turning Robert Oppenheimer's life story into a massive box office property.

“Look, I love the filmmaking,” Cameron acknowledges. “But I did feel that it was a bit of a moral cop out. Because it's not like Oppenheimer didn't know the effects. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see—and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film–but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. But I felt that it dodged the subject. I don't know whether the studio or Chris felt that that was a third rail that they didn't want to touch, but I want to go straight at the third rail. I'm just stupid that way.” (When told that Nolan felt it wasn't the place of his particular film to tackle the effects of the bombs from the perspective of the people they were dropped on, Cameron quipped, “Okay, I'll put up my hand. I'll do it, Chris. No problem. You come to my premiere and say nice things.”)

Cameron has been on this particular topic for multiple decades at this point—this is the man who filmed that sequence from Terminator 2, so take it as read that he thinks about nuclear bombs more than most people—including traveling to Japan with Pellegrino to meet with Tsutomo Yamaguchi, one of the only people to have survived both bombings. (And who ultimately died of stomach cancer in his 90s.) Cameron is, among other things, un-shy about admitting he has limits on the story he wants to tell, too, saying he has no interest in using the film to discus the politics that led to the dropping of the bomb, and simply wants to capture its effects on the people who were at literal ground zero:

I don't want to get into the politics of, should it have been dropped, should they have done it, and all the bad things Japan did to warrant it, or any of that kind of moralizing and politicizing. I just want to deal in a sense with what happened, almost as if you could somehow be there and survive and see it… I just think it's so important right now for people to remember what these weapons do. This is the only case where they've been used against a human target. Setting aside all the politics and the fact that I'm going to make a film about Japanese people…I don't even speak Japanese, although I have a lot of friends there. I've been there a million times, and I may need to work with a Japanese writer, a Japanese producer, so that I am not a complete outsider to their cultural perspective. I want to keep it as a kind of neutral witness to an event that actually happened to human beings, so that we can keep that flame alive, that memory. They've only died in vain if we forget what that was like and we incur that a thousand fold upon ourselves and future generations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Only Squid Game could have a breather episode with this kind of body count","https://www.avclub.com/squid-game-recap-season-3-episode-3-its-not-your-fault","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode four publishes June 30.]   

What does the face of evil look like?

It's not a wholly academic question, as far as Squid Game is concerned. There's a reason that almost all of the show's antagonists, from the Pink Guards all the way up to the VIPs running the contest, wear masks: Yes, it's to adopt the iconography of a cold and unfeelingly “fair” system. But it's also for the simple reason that evil is easier when your face is out of view. Geum-ja could have told us, when Geum-ja was still around to tell anyone anything. (And I'll get to that tragic conclusion in a minute.) But part of the unceasing, massively pain-in-the-ass work of being a good person is looking yourself in the face every morning, staring soberly at the ways your actions affect others, and judging—usually too harshly—how much negative impact you've had on the people around you. Evil is, in some ways, the basic rejection of that process of accountability, and it's much easier to do it in the safe and enclosing dark.

This little meditation is brought to you by “It's Not Your Fault,” an episode that's very concerned with who is—and isn't—hiding their faces. For example: We get our first glimpse at the actual mugs of the aforementioned VIPs, returning from the first season to bet on the death games, trade (badly dubbed) banter with each other, and briefly don the uniforms of guards so they can enjoy the cheap thrill of killing off some of the losers left over from Hide And Seek. We'll end up spending a fair amount of time with these assholes throughout this hour, so it's worth noting that they're not much changed from when we last saw them back in the original Squid Game: They're unrepentant monsters, to a woman and man—and the show's broadest characters by far and by design. The worst of our players have some measure of internal lives; the guards are people doing a job and indoctrinated to think of the players as trash; even Hwang In-ho is following his nihilistic philosophies to their purest and darkest expressions. The VIPs, though, are simply pigs, bored dilettantes with no capacity to see their victims as human beings. Whining and joking about their failed bets in English, they're part stand-ins for the show's murder-craving audience, part symbols of the global elite. Their existence is so blithely awful that it would stretch Squid Game‘s plausibility past the breaking point and into the realm of pure satire—if not for the fact that there's a part of me that suspects the mega-rich might genuinely be this callous and full of contempt for people “beneath them.”

What they're watching, from their luxurious viewing rooms, is a reset in the aftermath of the hell that was “The Starry Night.” Squid Game zooms back out for this rebuilding effort by necessity, checking in with all the various plotlines it eschewed last episode in favor of that horrifying focus: Choi's investigation into Captain Park back on the mainland, Jun-ho's ongoing search on the boat, and No-eul's efforts to smuggle (the still-gutshot) Player 246 off the island. None of it has the sheer vitality of the material actually taking place inside the player rooms, which has always been the issue with these wider looks at Squid Game‘s world. That being said, the knowledge that the show only has three episodes left to go after this does tighten up each of these plotlines in turn, so they feel terse and quick-moving for once, instead of like simple filler. By episode's end, we've seen No-eul being set up for a possible trap, Choi getting arrested after finding irrefutable evidence that Park is a former Pink Guard, and Jun-ho discovering the spot where his brother shot him at the climax of the previous game. All of these plotlines are moving toward a climax; the only question now is how much impact they'll end up having on the action proper, which remains, as always, with the players.

And it's with that main event that Squid Game takes time to give full (and final) focus to the best supporting character to have emerged over the course of its second and third seasons: Jang Geum-ja. We watch her at her best here, the older woman attending to new mother Jun-hee, throwing herself into (unsuccessful) pleas for humanity from the O voters, and trying to inspire Gi-hun to pick his head back up and find something worth giving a shit about instead of just laying down to die. Kang Ae-shim gives a beautiful performance throughout, never letting the despair eating away at Geum-ja over the death of her son leave her eyes—but also embodying incredible warmth. (Her last monologue to Gi-hun, about the basic unfairness of life, is especially affecting.) This character could have gone too broad at about 100 different points in Squid Game‘s second and third seasons, but Kang has found her humanity throughout. It's what makes the heartbreak of her suicide hit all the harder.

Credit to writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk: He absolutely fucking got me with this one. I didn't know why the Pink Guards were walking in with a coffin after another miserable night in the player room, matching Gi-hun's just-waking confusion—until his eyes alight on Geum-ja's body, which is hanging with a sheet around her neck from a distant bunk. Hwang shoots the reveal in a far shot, letting the reality of what you're seeing sink in; the sudden dump of a few meager stacks of won into the piggy bank a few seconds later underscores the near-casual horror of the moment. It's easy to see, in hindsight; half of what Geum-ja says in this episode is a plea for mothers to live for their kids that alludes to her own feelings of failure toward Yong-sik. But the reveal is still a shock—both for viewers and Gi-hun. The last thing Geum-ja did on this Earth was ask him to give enough of a shit to keep Jun-hee and her baby safe; her final act knocks him straight out of his self-pitying funk, just in time for the next game.

Which is, as a moaning VIP who drunkenly bet on her notes, one that feels especially unfair to a brand-new mother carting around both a baby and a shattered ankle. Riffing on the first season's glass bridge, we've once again got a trap-filled span for 24 remaining contestants to cross. But instead of a sacrifice-encouraging guessing game, the gimmick this time is simpler, if also more brutal: a “jump rope”—in actuality, a metal bar, moved with deadly speed by the Red Rover robot and her new friend from last season's stinger—that sweeps a narrow bridge about once every four seconds. Cross to the other side (and over a major gap in the middle) in 20 minutes, and you live. Hesitate for the whole time limit, you get shot. Get tagged by the bar…well, hey, Nam-gyu, what happens if you get tagged by the bar, bud?

After the “one game, one episode” focus of “The Starry Night,” “It's Not Your Fault” returns to the “see the start of the game to set the stakes, then get the conclusion in the next episode” approach most of the show's games have taken, with Nam-gyu as our “oh fuck, that would suck” sacrificial dickhead du jour. Suffering pretty nasty withdrawal after losing Thanos' cross o' pills last episode, he's manipulated by a vindictive Nam-su into going first on the jump-rope bridge. And he almost makes it halfway, retrieving the thrown cross—only to freeze up when he finds out the guy he bullied so mercilessly has tricked him, swapping out the final pill for bupkus. One sweep later, and he's gone, into the pit: one more named character down.

Which leaves Gi-hun to restore himself to his position as the show's hero, racing across the bridge with Jun-hee's newborn in hand to get the babe to safety. (In a moment that feels implausibly cruel even by this show's extremely brutal standards, the baby has been declared a player at the whims of the VIPs, idiotically hoping to turn Jun-hee into “Wonder Woman” to keep her kid alive.) Turning back to try to help the young mother across, though, Gi-hun is blocked by more players crossing. That's all well and good…until the first guy who makes it turns around to “congratulate” the guy behind him by wrestling him straight into the pit. And for all my talk of masks up top, maybe I'm ultimately off-base: It would be hard to describe the true face of evil better than the look of this guy, a pure expression of the O Voter philosophy, turning to Gi-hun with shameless glee in his eyes, and declaring—right before we cut to black—”I'm playing the game!”

It's a bleak end to an episode that counts as “breathing room” only thanks to the extreme contrast of the previous hour. (That is, we only lose two named characters here, instead of four, and there are at least some moments that aren't drenched in existential horror.) Squid Game has always been a dark show, and it's only gotten darker since the voting plotline was introduced last season, transforming players from victims into active participants in their own destruction. The series is trying desperately to reforge some hope here, mostly with the emphasis on the baby, a true innocent amidst the madness. But it really feels in danger of burning the whole thing down with misery and pessimism, especially now that we have the VIPs pouring the fuel of their awfulness onto the fire. This is a strong episode, anchored by a visually interesting game, and a great (farewell) performance from one of the show's best actors. But it remains to be seen if this series can land its ending without straining our credulity or souls past their breaking points.

When “American Idol” season 23 winner Jamal Roberts performed in Atmore, Alabama, on June 14, 2025, he shared on social media how touched he was when the mayor presented him with a key to the city — an honor that many cities bestow on visiting celebrities and dignitaries. 

But when Roberts performs at the Blac & Noir Event in Laurel, Mississippi, in early August, he won't be accepting the same honor. On June 27, the R&B singer spoke to fans via Facebook Live to address a firestorm of controversy that had erupted over plans to present him with a key to the city during his concert. 

A post shared by Jamal Roberts (@officialjamalroberts)

During his Facebook Live, Roberts said that his upcoming show in Laurel, located minutes away from his hometown of Meridian, has been “booked forever.” Roberts said he'd heard nothing about being given a key to the city until June 27, when local event organizer Drake Paige posted on Facebook that Mayor Magee had approved the special honor.  

But his announcement was met with swift opposition from some in Laurel who took issue with Roberts receiving a key to the city, arguing that residents who have given back to the community in various ways have not received similar honors. The comment section quickly grew heated, many more people have posted, and Roberts said he'd been notified of death threats made against him. 

“You have people sharing the post, making threats, talking about they'll have guns at the event,” the former P.E. teacher said, adding, “I worked with kids before ‘American Idol' and it's crazy that … kids can comprehend (how to behave) more than grown folk. It's a sad world we live in.” 

In the comment section of Paige's post, Roberts wrote, “Although I am appreciative, I did not ask for it, but I am thankful.”

“I don't want it, respectfully,” Roberts further clarified in his video. “You can have it. Tell them I'm appreciative, but I politely decline.”



The tradition of civic leaders handing out “keys to the city” to esteemed visitors dates back to medieval times, when cities surrounded by walls with giant gates, according to Brown University. In modern times, a non-functioning key is given to symbolize that a trusted, 

Many people have shared encouragement for Roberts on social media amid the controversy, and disappointment over all the negativity, including one person who wrote, “Some of you all are about to break a record, THE MOST HATERS, UNDER ONE POST!!!”

Another wrote, “Omg. People just can't find anything else to worry about in their life. This is ridiculous. Like you say a key is not going to stop your journey. Keep reaching for the top. God got you.”

Laurel has a population of less than 17,000 but is well known as the locale of HGTV's hit show “Home Town” starring Erin and Ben Napier. It is also the real-life hometown of multiple celebrities including actress Parker Posey, NSync member Lance Bass, opera singer Leontyne Price, blues singer Sam Myers, and Olympic Gold Medal track star Ralph Boston. 

Toward the end of Roberts' June 27 Facebook Live, he said he'd been in Los Angeles working on new music all week. Despite the bump in the road with Laurel, he said the first single from his upcoming album would be a song that serves as his ode to his home state of Mississippi. 

“I'm (gonna) dedicate a song back to the state,” Roberts said. “That's gonna be my first record. My first record I'm gonna drop is gonna be a song back to the to the state. Tell them how appreciative I am. You know, people just don't expect good things to come out of Mississippi no more, and when they do, they don't know how to handle it.”

Lauren Sánchez's walk down the aisle wasn't just a bridal entrance. It was a moment filled with love, family, and deep emotion. 

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

With her sons Nikko and Evan by her side, Lauren Sánchez walked toward Jeff Bezos, her heart full of gratitude and her eyes brimming with tears—a moment that carried deep meaning and love.

The couple tied the knot in a black-tie ceremony on Friday, June 27, on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy. 

A post shared by Lauren Sánchez Bezos (@laurensanchezbezos)

In an interview with Vogue published the same day, Sánchez revealed she was already tearing up thinking about the moment: “Her two sons will walk her down the aisle,” wrote Vogue's Chloe Malle. “She tells me, apologizing that she can't help tearing up as she envisions it.”

Sánchez shares 24-year-old Nikko with former NFL player Tony Gonzalez, and 19-year-old Evan with her ex-husband, Patrick Whitesell. She also shares a daughter, Ella, born in 2008.

Bezos, 61, has four children of his own—three sons and one daughter—with his ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, though their names and lives have remained largely private.

The couple's multi-day wedding celebration welcomed an A-list guest list including Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Orlando Bloom, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Leonardo DiCaprio, Usher, and Tom Brady.

A post shared by Vogue (@voguemagazine)

Also in attendance were Queen Rania of Jordan, Bill Gates and his partner Paula Hurd, François-Henri Pinault, and designers Diane von Fürstenberg, Domenico Dolce, and Tommy Hilfiger.

The ceremony began with a touching performance of “Can't Help Falling in Love” by Matteo Bocelli, according to a source, to warm cheers from the guests.

The bride wore a corseted, mermaid-style gown by Dolce & Gabbana, featuring hand-appliquéd Italian lace and sheer long sleeves. Her “something blue” was a sentimental token from her Blue Origin space flight.

Dolce & Gabbana also provided borrowed earrings, completing the refined and timeless look. Her gown made its debut on the cover of Vogue, accompanied by an intimate interview.

Shortly after the ceremony, Sánchez shared the first photo from the wedding on Instagram—now updated to her married name: Lauren Sánchez Bezos.In the photo, the newlyweds are seen holding hands and smiling in a sunlit garden, surrounded by their guests. She captioned the post simply: “06/27/2025 ❤️.”

Bezos and Sánchez have been planning their wedding for nearly two years.The Amazon founder proposed in May 2023 while on vacation in Europe. Sánchez recalled the moment in a Vogue interview later that year: “I blacked out a bit,” she said, referring to the moment he presented the 30-carat ring.

Vivienne Jolie is stepping into the spotlight. The 16-year-old daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt stepped out in New York City. She turned heads during a rare solo outing. Vivienne, whom Jolie shares with ex-husband Brad Pitt, typically resides in Los Angeles but has spent significant time in NYC over the past year. As per photos published by Hola, Vivienne dressed casually yet in an effortlessly chic manner. 

She wore a white oversized t-shirt paired with off-white pants and matching sneakers. She carried bottles of water and seltzer during the outing, braving the summer heat alone as she made a quick trip to the supermarket.

Vivienne isn't just in New York for a getaway — she's been making serious moves behind the scenes. In 2024, the 16-year-old worked alongside her mom, Angelina Jolie, on The Outsiders Broadway musical, a stage adaptation of the iconic novel.

As per People, Vivienne served as a volunteer assistant on the production, and Jolie described her daughter as a “really tough assistant.”

She told People that Vivienne takes the job “very, very seriously.” The mother-daughter duo also attended the 2024 Tony Awards together in coordinating teal outfits, where The Outsiders took home four awards, including Best Musical.

“My daughter Viv loves theater,” Angelina Jolie told Deadline in June 2024. “She appreciates all theater, but she certainly knows what she feels close to and what she responds to.”

Jolie shared that Vivienne had seen “The Outsiders” at La Jolla about five times and kept encouraging her to explore the show. “She was telling me about it, and I had read the book, and I'd seen the film years ago,” Jolie added.

Moved by her daughter's enthusiasm, Jolie gave the story another look. 

A post shared by Lis Lopes 👑 (@lislopees)

“I started really watching the effect it was having on my young daughter and what she was telling me about herself,” she explained. “I was learning what about it was important to her and why it connected so deeply to her.”

While Vivienne remains close to her mother, her relationship with Brad Pitt appears to be strained. Following Jolie and Pitt's high-profile divorce, several of their children—including Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne—have reportedly dropped “Pitt” from their last names. 

A source told Us Weekly that Brad Pitt has shared with friends how “deeply emotional” the estrangement has been. “He has made several efforts to reconnect with his kids,” the source said, adding that he sees his twins, Vivienne and Knox, “periodically.” However, “the rest of the relationships are strained. It's caused him a lot of heartbreak.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Channing Tatum Shares Pics of His Romantic Getaway With Girlfriend Inka Williams","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/channing-tatum-inka-williams-vacation-pics/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 03:14:28 GMT","

The romance between Channing Tatum and his girlfriend Inka Williams seems to be heating up. The actor shared a series of pics and videos of he and Williams on a romantic seaside vacation via his Instagram story on June 27. 

The story featured various snaps from the couple's getaway, including searching for shells, exploring a cave, and relaxing on a boat. Tatum, 45, also posted a video of Williams petting a cat and another pic of her lounging on a raft in a teeny bikini. 

Tatum and his model girlfriend were spotted together on various occasions beginning with a pre-Oscars party in February 2025. Williams made their relationship Instagram official on April 26.

Williams wished her man a happy birthday on her Instagram story, which included a series of pics of the actor accompanied by the message, “Happy life to the handsomest, kindest, funniest, stoopidest most gorgeous human ever!!!” She added, “Merci for making life beautiful and fun.”

A post shared by INKA (@inkawilliams)

While it looks as though Tatum and Williams are getting cozier, a source shared with Us Weekly that the couple's relationship is “low-key.” The source also told the outlet, “Channing just got out of a long-term relationship and is not looking to settle down right now.” 

The “Magic Mike” actor and his ex Zoё Kravitz called off their engagement in October of 2024 after three years together. Prior to dating Kravitz, Tatum had an on-and-off again relationship with singer Jessie J from 2018 until 2020. Tatum was married to dancer Jenna Dewan from 2009 until 2018 and they share an 11-year-old daughter, Everly.

While Tatum's love life seems very eventful, at the end of the day his daddy duties take priority. He and Williams' sunny getaway may have kicked off the season, but Tatum plans to spend the rest of the summer with his daughter, Everly, according to Us Weekly. 

Tatum and Everly appear to have a super cute father-daughter relationship, and it seems one thing they have in common is music. In March, Tatum and Everly were spotted at a Kelsea Ballerini concert, and the daddy-daughter duo also took in several Taylor Swift performances during the singer's Eras Tour. 

The “Blink Twice” star gushed about hanging with his daughter during an appearance on “Late NIght With Seth Myers” last summer. “Seeing it with your daughter is very different because you know, you gotta like go in,” Tatum said. “I was dancing like I'd never danced before.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Walter Scott Jr., Founding Member of ‘The Whispers' Dead at 81","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/walter-scott-dead-at-81/","Sun, 29 Jun 2025 04:27:59 GMT","

Walter Scott Jr. has passed away at the age of 81. 

His death comes six months after he was diagnosed with cancer. 

According to the Los Angeles Sentinel, on June 26, Scott passed away in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, surrounded by family and friends.

The singer fought a short, six-month battle with cancer before succumbing to the disease on Thursday. 

Desirae Lee Benson-Brockington, a publicist who worked with The Whispers, posted a message on Facebook in honor of Scott, writing:

“Walter was more than a performer — he was part of a movement that brought soul, harmony, and timeless love songs to generations. His legacy will continue to live on through every note, every lyric, and every fan he touched.”

He is survived by his wife Jan, his brother, two sons, and three grandchildren. 

Scott and his twin brother Wallace, were founding members of the legendary R&B/Soul group The Whispers. 

In 1963, they formed the group with Marcus Hutson, Gordy Harmon, and Nicholas Caldwell. 

According to Billboard, the group had a slate of hits including “Lady”, “It's A Love Thing”, and “The Beat Goes On”. Their song “Rock Steady” hit No. 7 on the Hot 100, and the group has eight top 10 R&B albums.

Scott was born in Texas and later moved to Los Angeles with his family. 

After forming The Whispers with his brother in 1963, Scott took a break from the group after he was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, but later rejoined in 1969. 

In an interview with The Indie Post Magazine, the singer talked about discovering his passion for music, saying:

“When we were about five years old, my dad bought Scotty a set of drums for Christmas, and he bought me a saxophone. And from then on, we knew we wanted to be in music. We couldn't play then, but Scotty later learned to play the drums.  

I was never that active on the saxophone, but because of my dad, we knew we would be involved in entertainment. My dad's goal was to ensure the world knew he had twin boys (Scotty and I) who would one day set the world on fire. I remember my father walking up to a guy when we were around three or five, tapping him on the shoulder, and saying, “You see those guys?” You're going to remember them. Believe me when I tell you, they're talented. From that point on, it was clear that we would be in the music business. This was before “The Whispers” or anything. ” 

According to People, Scott's love for music kept him performing with The Whispers throughout the 2000s, and the group was inducted into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 2014.

“Hey, I'm gonna be a star.” That was almost Sam Rockwell‘s line in “Lean on Me.” The 1989 film which starred Morgan Freeman as the real-life educator Joe Louis Clark. Rockwell was cast in the film, but — as he revealed during a recent appearance on the podcast “Happy Sad Confused” — that one line ended up going to Michael Imperioli.

“They never got to my scene,” Rockwell explained to host Josh Horowitz (via Entertainment Weekly). “So they had to let me go because they didn't want to pay me for a week. So they got to pay for a day player or pay for a week. So they… let me go. They fired me… And because they were like, ‘Ah, we can't pay them a week for one line.' And then they hired Michael, and Michael [Imperioli] got it. Michael's in the movie, but I still got residuals… I still get residual checks for that, even though I'm not in it.”

Ironically, Imperioli had joined Rockwell and Kevin Corrigan on a drive to New Jersey, where the trio auditioned for the film. But Rockwell might have dodged a bullet. Imperioli told The New Yorker in 2024 that director John G. Avildsen was “not very nice.”

 










“But I'd never been in front of a camera,” Imperiolo said. “This was the '80s. There were giant Panavision cameras, and I didn't know where to look. I really didn't know what I was doing. I mumbled the line thinking maybe they won't notice me or something. And then [Avildsen] comes and starts giving direction. He goes, ‘And you with that “Gonna be a star,” you'd better give me something or you're out of here!' I was horrified. I think, I'm horrible, I suck.”

Several years later, Rockwell found himself once again pitted against Imperioli — or at least compared to him, this time in the 1998 Woody Allen flick “Celebrity.”

“I was a part of [Leonardo] DiCaprio's entourage. And I had a few lines and they said, ‘Woody wants you to dye your hair bleach blonde,” he recalled. Rockwell countered that he would not dye his hair for five lines, but the team was insistent, “Woody wants you to do it.” Rockwell refused.

“And they're like, ‘Well, Michael Imperioli was gonna do it.' Cause he had dropped out. And I was replacing Michael — because Michael was going to do a little pilot called ‘Sopranos,' that I heard didn't go anywhere.” Rockwell said. “And so I said, “All right, I'll dye my hair.”

Rockwell is currently riding high on the major critical acclaim received by the third installment of “The White Lotus,” for which he's a frontrunner in the Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series category at the Emmys.

I
've been dreaming about the Badlands again. It's a scorching July day in 2002, and Nicole and I are hauling ass in my VW Beetle across South Dakota. I'm driving; she's riding shotgun, eating a Slim Jim. We're blasting The Eminem Show with the windows down, our hair whipping in the hot desert air, when Nicole sees a sign and tells me we need to pull over.


	We've hiked a mile or so into the moonscape of the park when we come across a pink boulder with a deep split down its center, like a giant earth vulva. Nicole grins at me, strips off her clothes, and springs onto the rock. “Take a picture,” she says, arching her nakedness into a bridge over the dark cleft. I snap a photo. She shakes her curls at me upside-down and says, “Now you.” I get undressed, climb up, and thrust my hips to the sky. She takes my picture. We're getting dressed when a couple of hikers come around the bend, and we cackle all the way back to the car.


	In the summer of 2024, I began retracing our journey on a cross-country road trip, visiting people who could help me put the pieces together, trying to remember who Nicole was before everything went wrong, since a chance encounter with seven kids blew our lives apart, with a bullet ending one life and shattering countless others. Murder doesn't only happen to the person who dies.

	It's been two decades since the media took an incredulous phrase that fell out of Nicole's mouth — “What are you going to do, shoot us?” — and blamed her for her own death while capitalizing on it: The Village Voice called it “A Murder Made for the Front Page.” The New York Post covered the killer's trial gavel to gavel, while glossy magazines wrote about how not to let this happen to you.

	











	Things have been fucked up ever since the night when I sat in a Manhattan police station trying to comprehend that Nicole was dead, and I was not. But after 20 years, I felt like I could finally revisit her story. With a therapist guiding me, I went back to the night Nicole died over and over until something shifted. It was like a foreign object had been extracted from a wound. It still exists, but it's outside me, and I can examine it without pain. Now, I want to know how the others who loved her have coped with losing her. That's what I'm on this trip to find out.

	Nicole DuFresne was born on Jan. 5, 1977, in Wayzata, Minnesota, a wealthy suburb west of Minneapolis. Her father, Tom, was a forceful, charismatic man who worked as a commercial real-estate developer. Her mother, Linda, a knockout with turquoise eyes, was a gentle, creative woman. Nicole and her younger brother, Zach, both inherited their mother's looks, but Nicole took after her father when it came to temperament; she was a passionate, moody kid who would dominate on the soccer pitch and then write poetry in her bedroom. “I think she always felt like a little bit of an outsider, even in our family,” Zach DuFresne tells me when I visit him at his quiet suburban home in Colorado, “but she was totally unafraid to be herself.”


	Tom DuFresne wanted his kids to have the best of everything, but from a young age, Nicole bucked his attempts to insulate her with money. She hated the preppy private school her parents sent her to, and insisted on attending public school for junior high before transferring to an arts high school. When she moved to Boston to study theater at Emerson College, her father rented her a brownstone apartment in a tony neighborhood, but Nicole chafed at feeling like a rich kid. She started to work odd jobs that didn't conflict with her schooling.

	In her junior year of college, Nicole was raped in the parking lot of a bar. When she told her parents about the assault, they begged her to come home, but she refused; she'd been cast in a show that she didn't want to drop out of. She received counseling and later used the traumatic experience as inspiration for a two-woman play, Matter.


	I have a copy of the play with me on my cross-country travels. I keep returning to one line that articulates a familiar feeling: “In my dreams someone is waiting to eat me.”

	











	Nicole and I met in Seattle at Theater Schmeater in August 2001, on the first day of rehearsal for Our Country's Good, a play set in a penal colony in 1780s Australia. The director wanted everyone to be as disgusting as possible: lice, syphilis, scabies, goiters, rotten teeth. Nicole was good at getting ugly; her performance was frightening, “almost unbearably tragic,” one reviewer wrote. I played a convict named Shitty Meg and pushed the gross-out factor as far as I could. We bonded over the freedom we found in being filthy; our playacting felt like an antidote to what the world expected of us.


	She loved that I'd worked on an Alaskan salmon boat. I was mesmerized by her witchy hippie energy, lean kinetic body, and throaty laugh. After the show closed, she asked me if I would create a show with her. We wrote a two-hander inspired by a book about CIA brainwashing experiments and hit the fringe-festival circuit in the summer of 2002.


Burning Cage was an intense play. A reviewer at Minneapolis Fringe called us “feminists with an axe to grind.” We scrawled “Come see the axe-grinding feminists!” in chalk outside of every venue after that. We did better at other festivals — one critic said our show was “precisely the kind of art and passion that fringe theatre should be about.” Another called us “balls-out brave.”


	By the time we won Artistic Pick at the Seattle Fringe that fall, we'd been on the road together for most of the summer, and we weren't sick of each other, which felt monumental to me. I'd always been reserved in my friendships, but Nicole refused to allow it. She told me I needed to trust her; I told her I had a weird feeling that things with us wouldn't last. “It's going to last,” she said. I chalked up my anxiety to existential dread, and we started to plan our next collaboration.


	A couple of months later, Nicole and her fiancé, Jeffrey Sparks, were moving to New York, and she stopped by my place with a farewell gift — a little glass vase holding a paper scroll. She said it was a message for whenever I couldn't reach her and needed to hear from her. I promised her I'd be right behind her; we had things to do.


	Nicole was thrilled by the energy of New York. She started developing a pilot with Jeffrey to pitch to the Food Channel (Nikki's New York), and launched herself into the downtown theater scene, painting sets at LAByrinth Theater Company while concentrating on her own undertakings with a group she'd co-founded with Emerson classmates. She worked at a nonprofit serving seniors on the Upper West Side to pay the bills. “I feel that I can be my absolute self [in New York] since there are so many different souls here,” she wrote in her journal. “They all work like a puzzle. I suppose there are many hardships I will have here, but I am excited for all the gold I could find.”

	











	A year later, I made the trek from Seattle with my boyfriend, Scott Nath. We moved into a fifth-floor walk-up at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge, and I loved the aching feeling of climbing into the sky. We survived off cheap burgers and egg sandwiches from Mom's Diner, and $2 PBRs from Welcome to the Johnsons; we'd peer into the window of wd~50, the city's hottest new molecular gastronomy dining establishment, knowing we couldn't afford to even walk inside. The grime was exhilarating, and the glamorous boutiques opening between old-world vestiges — hat stores, bridal shops — gave the neighborhood a sense of urgency. We'd wander home at sunrise past commuters making their way to the train as we crawled into bed.


	Nicole and Jeffrey had us over for a welcome dinner, and she gave us a bag of weed mixed with lavender. “You'll need it,” she said with a laugh. She told me I should get new headshots; she'd just had hers done, and was insistent that we both had to step up our game. The following months were a glorious whirlwind of auditioning, acting, and writing. Nicole was producing new work with her theater company; I was making a living as an actor. We met up to write whenever we could, ginning each other up as we brainstormed ideas and to-do lists. We laughed so much: I can still hear her bellowing “I have to pee like a horse!” as she charged into Cafe Mogador after being stuck on the L train for an hour.


	Reading through our notebooks, I'm struck by how relentlessly confident we were in ourselves, and each other. By the time we rang in 2005 at a warehouse party in a dilapidated former church — the kind of sweaty all-night revelry I'd always dreamed of going to — I felt like we could take over the world.


	Rudy Fleming was born on June 23, 1985. His family lived in the West New Brighton housing projects in a bleak part of Staten Island where more than 15 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. Violence was a grim reality in the Fleming household; his father was shot and killed when he was a child; an older brother was given a five-year sentence for assault; another was sentenced to eight years in prison for beating a man with a baseball bat; and a third was shot and killed with his own gun during a botched robbery.

	











	Fleming struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age, according to court documents; he was diagnosed with a learning disability at the age of eight and enrolled in an individualized program by the Department of Education, but there's nothing on the record to indicate that he received any psychiatric help. In 2001, when he was 16, Fleming pulled a gun on truancy officers who picked him up for loitering. According to the police report, which designated him an emotionally disturbed person, he told arresting officers, “You should have shot me. I want you to kill me. I want to die.” He received a three-year prison sentence on a weapons charge and was sent to an upstate correctional facility more than 200 miles away.


	At an April 2004 parole hearing, he said prison had taught him to learn from his mistakes. That June, three days before his 19th birthday, Fleming was released on parole.


	In January 2005, Fleming moved into the apartment of his godfather, Servino Simmon, in the Baruch Houses on the Lower East Side, a sea of tan high-rises overlooking some of the most expensive real estate in the country. Fleming had grown up close with Simmon's kids — Servisio, who was 21 years old, and Servano, who was 17 — and they were living there, too. Fleming's 18-year-old girlfriend, Ashley Evans, a well-liked high school cheerleader, also moved into the apartment.


	On the night of Jan. 26, 2005, Fleming, Evans, Servisio, and Servano, along with their 18-year-old cousin David Simmon, David's friend Kayshawn Boyd, 15, and Boyd's 14-year-old girlfriend, Tatianna McDonald, were hanging out at the apartment, smoking weed, drinking, and playing with Fleming's gun, which had been stolen from its legal owner in South Carolina in 2002. It's unclear who Fleming got it from or how long he'd had it, but he liked showing off the heavy silver six-shot .357 Magnum revolver, spinning the chamber, loading and unloading it. Servano thought the gun was cool, too; at one point, he and his brother played a mock round of Russian roulette without pulling the trigger.


	That same night, Nicole was working her first bartending shift at Rockwood Music Hall, a new venue on the Lower East Side. Scott and I met up with Jeffrey at the bar to celebrate her new gig; Nicole served us a couple of rounds, and when she finished her shift, the four of us went to a raucous hipster joint called Max Fish, where we ordered rum and cokes and played pinball.


	After a few hours at the apartment, Fleming and his friends were bored, so they went out to “start trouble,” McDonald later said. They were walking toward the Delancey-Essex subway station when they passed 22-year-old security guard Adam Chavez coming home from work. Chavez was wearing a white leather jacket that caught Fleming's eye. He chased after Chavez with David Simmon and Boyd, who punched him and demanded he give up the jacket, but after Fleming whacked him twice with his gun, Chavez managed to pull away and run into the street in front of a passing taxi. He called 911, but by the time cops showed up, the friends were on a train to Brooklyn. Chavez declined to file a police report and headed home.

	











	The friends took the J train through the rooftops of Brooklyn and got off at Broadway Junction, deep in the borough. They hung out on the subway platform, where the boys tried to goad Evans and McDonald into fighting a couple of other girls waiting for the train. When they refused, the guys made fun of them for chickening out, so when they caught a train back to Manhattan, the girls said they would fight anyone they pointed out. They got off back at the Delancey-Essex stop around 3 a.m. A surveillance camera outside Schiller's Liquor Bar captured the group walking east on Rivington toward Clinton.


	We had left Max Fish a few minutes earlier. We were buzzed, goofing around, pushing one another into snowbanks — oblivious gentrifiers on the home turf of seven friends out looking for a fight. When Evans heard us laughing as we crossed onto Clinton Street, her resentment flamed. “They were ex­tremely happy, so that made me even angrier,” she later told the police. Pissed off, she pointed us out to Fleming as the ones they should fight. Then everything happened fast.

By the time we rang in 2005 together at a warehouse party, I felt like we could take over the world. 


	I remember being stopp­ed. Shoved against a wall with a gun. My purse is yanked away. A loud bang. Scott running, screaming, “Murderer! Murderer!” Nicole on her back in the street. My bare knees on cold grit as I kneel next to her. She's looking up at Jeffrey as he leans over her, telling her to stay with him. The headlights of cars coming toward us off the Williamsburg Bridge. Then I'm in the back of a cop car, looking at Scott's crumpled face in alternating red and blue light.


	According to witnesses who later testified in court, Fleming stepped in front of us, pulled out his gun, and told us to give him our money. Scott said we didn't have any because we'd spent it all at the bar. When Jeffrey tried to push past him, Fleming smashed him in the face with the gun, opening up a gash over his eye. Then, as Nicole went to check on Jeffrey, Fleming slammed me against a security gate with the gun. He yanked my bag away and threw it to Evans and McDonald as Nicole approached him and pushed him, saying, “You got what you wanted.” Then, according to testimony from McDonald and Servano Simmon, she asked him, “What are you going to do, shoot us?” Fleming lifted the gun, pointed it at her chest, and fired. Nicole stumbled and fell into the street as they ran. The bullet had pierced her heart.


	Cops took us to the 7th Precinct station, where Scott and I waited in an interview room under buzzing fluorescents for what felt like hours until Jeffrey came back from the hospital and told us Nicole was dead. He went into another room to call her father. I remember hearing him howling.

	











	When we left the station on the morning of Jan. 27, I couldn't believe the sun was shining; it was like the world had changed shape, and no one had noticed. Scott and I went home, pulled the blinds, and lay beside each other in the darkness, not talking. At some point, I remembered her message in a bottle. I got it down from my bookshelf and unfurled the scroll. It said:


Believe in yourself like I believe in you.Sending you lots of groovey love vibes.Have faith.Listen to yourself.With love,xo Nicole


	“She died in my arms.” That was Jeffrey's heartbreaking statement to a reporter who tracked him down after a police bulletin about the shooting went out that day. The story electrified the media; the New York Post ran a cover story with Nicole's headshot under the headline “Beauty Slain.” A photo of Jeffrey, bloody from being pistol-whipped, accompanied the accounts of her murder.


	Reporters were waiting at LaGuardia Airport for Tom and Linda DuFresne when they flew in from Minnesota to identify their daughter's body; members of the media camped out on our doorstep to snag a photo of Scott and me looking pale and shell-shocked. It was surreal to read tabloid accounts that the gun had been aimed at me too, that Scott thought he had heard it go off. My reality was fracturing.


	Before internet ubiquity as we know it existed, the story of her death went viral; Nicole's face was on newsstands across the country, and every major media outlet showed up at her memorial. The Village Voice noted that “DuFresne is on her way to becoming one of New York's super-victims.”


	Surveillance videos and tips led to the seven friends being apprehended within days. The tabloids made hay in the wake of their arrests, branding them “thugs” and “fiends.” The report that our laughter had angered them was shocking; “Nicole Died for Smiling — ‘Slay' Creeps Picked on Happy Victim,” one article blared. A photo of Fleming sobbing in the back of a police car after his arrest ran under the headline “He Cries for Himself.”


	I hadn't heard Nicole say anything to Fleming, but police told reporters that bystanders had heard her say something to the effect of “What are you going to do, shoot us next?” When Evans was arrested, she said Nicole had been the aggressor, claiming that Fleming shot her only because he'd slipped after she pushed him. Evans was accused of taking the murder weapon back to the Simmon apartment, where police had found it hidden under a bed.

	











	After Evans' allegation was reported, the media narrative shifted — now Nicole's death was her fault because she'd “dared” Fleming. Safety advocates said that Nicole's “defiant” stand had prompted Fleming to shoot her, and the National Crime Prevention Council circulated a memo on how to survive a mugging, advising potential victims to “stay cool and comply with robbers.”


The Stranger, a Seattle alt-weekly, ran an anonymous letter addressing Nicole that read, in part, “It seems you misplayed your role as mugging victim. This was not street theater you were involved in. It was real-life drama, which you helped turn into a tragedy.… Your last words suggest you did not understand the material. I'm sad that you will not get another audition.”


Cosmopolitan published a feature titled “How Not to Let Your Fearlessness Go Too Far” with tips on what not to do when held at gunpoint, next to a list of mistakes that Nicole had supposedly made.


	Richard Price wrote an acclaimed novel, Lush Life, in which he echoed her purported last words; after a long night of drinking, a would-be writer is gunned down when he makes the dumb decision to tell a mugger “Not tonight, my man.” An episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent ripped the story from the headlines. In that version, it was the friends who'd set her up.


	Even after all of these years, the story has stuck. I'm listening to one of my favorite podcasts on my road trip when they bring up Nicole's murder. “She got in their faces,” one of the co-hosts says. “Like, just give them your purse … don't start an altercation.” Tears fill my eyes; I have to pull over. Nicole was fiercely protective; she was upset; her death wasn't her fault. Fleming was an angry kid with a gun that he wanted to use. Maybe Nicole would be alive if our laughter hadn't filled Evans with rage, if Fleming had gotten the help he needed at school, if the gun had gone off when he pushed me instead. Her murder was a senseless act of violence. Speculating about a different outcome only intensified the pain.


	Fleming did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him for this article; neither did any of the other six friends, who would now all be in their thirties or early forties. I want to ask them how their lives have been since the night our paths crossed; what details have stayed with them; how their age and maturity have shaped the way they think about the events of that night. But the only update I get is from Detective George Taylor, the lead investigator on the case, who tells me that he saw Servano Simmon a few years later; the only one not charged, he'd straightened his life out and was attending college.

	











	Fleming was charged with first-degree murder. He'd exhibited bizarre behavior when he was arrested, mumbling, stuffing paper towels in his mouth, and going limp in the interview room. He was admitted to Belle­vue Hospital and held under observation for several months. In a pretrial hearing, Fleming's attorney, Anthony Ricco, told the judge that Fleming was mentally incompetent; evidently, he was hearing voices telling him not to eat and hallucinating a giant marshmallow man. However, a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist testified that Fleming had gained eight pounds while under observation and that his symptoms only appeared when he knew he was being watched. Although Fleming had “fewer resources than most individuals” to cope with the stress he was under, including a lack of family support, they believed he was feigning his symptoms. He was found competent to stand trial.


	Fleming never appeared in the courtroom at his trial; he was removed before jury selection after an outburst that required several officers to restrain him. Assistant District Attorney Robert Hettleman called it a “well-timed action” for someone trying to avoid trial, and the judge agreed, ordering a CCTV video feed to be set up so Fleming could watch the proceedings from his holding cell.


	McDonald testified that Nicole's shooting was intentional: It had nothing to do with Fleming being pushed, she said. Scott and Servano Simmon also testified that Fleming had shot Nicole from an arm's length away. Jeffrey testified that, although the shock of being pistol-whipped had dazed him, his memory of holding Nicole as she lay dying in the street was crystal clear. When I was called to the stand, I could only share my scattershot version of the encounter. It didn't matter; witnesses confirmed that Nicole had been executed at point-blank range.


	On Oct. 12, 2006, the jury found Fleming guilty on nine counts, including first-degree murder, robbery, and criminal possession of a weapon. No family or friends had ever come to support him. At his sentencing, his attorney asked the court for mercy. “People rehabilitate themselves, and that's my hope for Rudy Fleming, who's in the back, cowering in his cell,” Ricco said. “He's a young person who cannot come to grips.” The judge deemed Fleming a “cold-blooded, thoroughly amoral killer” and gave him life without parole. The Post got in one last dig when Jeffrey told a reporter outside the court that he was relieved Fleming hadn't received the death penalty. The headline read “Fiancé's Pity Is Misplaced for This Vermin.”

	











	Evans and four of the others took plea deals. Servisio Simmon received a sentence of 10 years for first-degree robbery; David Simmon was sentenced to six years for first-degree attempted robbery; Boyd was referred to family court; McDonald was adjudicated a youthful offender and received a sentence of one to three years for first-degree robbery. At her sentencing, when Evans entered a guilty plea to first-degree robbery, she apologized to the DuFresne family. “If I could take it all back, I most sincerely would,” she said. Linda DuFresne replied, “Ours is a sentence of life without Nicole.” Evans got six years. Fleming appealed his sentence in 2010. It was denied.


	I went back to my restaurant job a couple of weeks after the murder. A co-worker asked me what Nicole had said to make the kid shoot her. There was a faraway ringing in my ears as someone else said, “Leave her alone, man.” I was refilling the owner's coffee when he grasped my wrist and said quietly, “Survivor guilt is a real thing.” I knew that his parents were Holocaust survivors, so I nodded at him mutely and went to the bathroom to scream into my latte-stained apron. A few weeks later, I terrorized an elderly Weight Watchers leader after our weekly meeting by telling her what had happened and that I wasn't OK. She patted my hand and told me I shouldn't come back until I felt better.


	When I went to collect my wallet from One Police Plaza, they handed it to me in a plastic bag labeled “Homicide Evidence.” A letter arrived from the New York State Office of Victim Services offering me funds for therapy. I thought it was pretty funny that I was a state-sanctioned victim. Nothing felt real. I couldn't sleep. I started drinking to anesthetize myself, making it most of the way through two bottles of wine before stumbling into bed around dawn. When I did sleep, I had nightmares. My relationship with Scott started to suffer. But I kept telling myself I was OK; I wasn't the one who died.


	For years, I tried to articulate how I felt, but I couldn't find the words. At one point, I took a solo-performance class, thinking I'd write a one-woman show about — murder? Gun violence? Grief? I can't remember, but the teacher told me I wasn't ready to address my experience. At the time, I was furious, but years later, I'm thankful for her candor. She was right; I needed time.

	











	My first stop on the road trip is in Denver, where I spend a sunny afternoon with Zach, his wife, and their two kids at a neighborhood swimming pool. As we listen to the splashing of happy children, Zach and I reminisce about the Thanksgiving dinner we had with Nicole in 2004, when the siblings walked home across the snowy Williamsburg Bridge after dinner at our place. They stopped to call Linda and sing “New York, New York” to her from the middle of the East River. It was the last weekend he had with his sister.


	After the trial and sentencings, a noose of grief tightened around the DuFresne family. Although Linda continued to set a place for her daughter at the table at holiday gatherings, Zach says that no one spoke her name: “My mom never recovered, and part of my dad died when Nicole died.” Tom has been in a care facility since suffering a debilitating stroke several years ago; Linda has Alzheimer's-related dementia, and lives in a nursing home not far from Zach.

“I remember trying to see if that sadness was still there, and I was like, ‘I don't need to dig in. It doesn't help me move forward.'” 


	Linda meets me in the lobby when I pull up for our visit. She's frail, wearing a back brace, and her face is stamped with pain, but her eyes are bright. We go to a restaurant, where we order wine and sit on the breezy patio. She asks me what I'm working on. I take a deep breath, and tell her I'm writing about Nicole. “She'd be happy that you are,” Linda says. Then she puts a hand on my arm and asks me to tell her about the night her daughter died. I tell her what I remember, and we hold hands in silence for a long time.


	Later, over dinner, Zach tells me that substance abuse dominated his life for years after Nicole was killed. One night, when he was drinking with friends, one of them said something about her that set him off; Zach got into his car in a rage and drove into the side of a mountain near Aspen. “I was fucking annihilated,” he says. “I should have died.” He credits marriage and fatherhood with averting him from his path of self-destruction. Now, his family celebrates his sister's birthday every January. “We bake a cake and tell stories about Nicole,” he says. “I'm trying to give my children some sense of their auntie.”


	Next, I visit Jeffrey in his Midwest home. Over coffee in his backyard, he tells me about proposing to Nicole. They were on a road trip to Joshua Tree. “I had this overwhelming feeling that I wanted to spend the rest of my life listening to her,” he recalls. “She was sitting next to the fire. I got down on my knee, and she starts throwing all these ‘What ifs?' at me, like, ‘What if I get a terrible disease and lose my hair?'” His answers came easily. “There wasn't anything I felt we couldn't handle.” She said she would marry him on one condition: that they move to New York.


	After she was killed, Jeffrey's grief coalesced into anger under relentless scrutiny from the media: “I was a pressure cooker of rage, trying to keep the lid on.” He went to the Middle East to work on a documentary about war widows, where he was held at gunpoint more than once. Danger felt comforting to him; at one point, he was riding in a car that narrowly missed hitting an oncoming truck. “I remember this distinct feeling of water washing over me,” Jeffrey recalls. “Like, ‘Here it comes.' And I felt myself smiling.” Now, he aspires to be a good father to his 13-year-old son in Nicole's memory. “I channel my love into being the person that she envisioned me to be,” he says. “I liked her vision of me.”

	











	A few weeks later, I meet Scott for dinner in Brooklyn; it's the first time we've seen each other in years. We stayed together until 2013, and had plenty of good times, but we had stared at each other through hell and couldn't make it work for the long haul. We order pizza and cocktails, even though Scott doesn't drink much anymore. He tells me that he didn't feel the need to self-destruct like the rest of us because his testimony helped secure Fleming's conviction — and because he entered therapy right away. “I remember trying to see if that sadness was still there,” he says, “and I was like, ‘I don't need to dig in. It doesn't help me move forward.'” Nonetheless, Nicole's murder changed his trajectory; he gave up on his dream of being an actor, and took a corporate job. Since the night Nicole died, he often thinks about how limited his time is. “There's nothing more precious than that.”


	I can see how my PTSD has played out through guilt, dissociation, and self-annihilation, but I didn't have clarity until recently. After Scott and I split up, I moved on to bad relationships with men who gave me the affection I felt I deserved, which was none. For years, happiness felt like a harbinger of bad things to come; feeling anxious and miserable was familiar. But when my last relationship flamed out, a friend recommended a form of trauma therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR. After several sessions, I felt I could finally write about Nicole, as I've wanted to do for so long. It feels good to revisit our work, to read her journals, and to drive for days, thinking about my gorgeous, funny, wild friend without feeling suffocated. Instead of dwelling on how she died, I'm remembering how brightly she lived. I can see Nicole standing in the doorway of my apartment on the night she came to pick me up for a Halloween party wearing a slinky champagne-colored dress, smoky glitter outlining her blue eyes under a cascade of curls. I asked her what her costume was. She winked at me, and said, “I'm a dream.”

Donald Trump threatened to force journalists to reveal sources who leaked a Pentagon intelligence assessment that concluded the U.S. air strikes on Iran only set the nation's nuclear program back “months,” contradicting administration claims that the facilities were “obliterated.”


	“You tweeted the Democrats leaked an intelligence [report],” Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo said to Trump in an interview.


	“They should be prosecuted,” the president responded.


	When Bartiromo asked “who, specifically” should be prosecuted, Trump did not name any names but said his administration would demand reporters reveal the sources of their reporting.


	“We can find out. If they want to, we can find out easily. You go up and tell the reporter, ‘National security, who gave it [to you]?' You have to do that, and I suspect we'll be doing things like that,” he said.

	Demanding reporters reveal confidential sources is a dangerous path that could quickly escalate to prosecuting reporters who refuse to disclose them. 

	











	Both CNN and The New York Times ran stories that undermined the administration's narrative, citing an assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon's intelligence arm, that found the bombings sealed off entrances to two targeted facilities but left the underground buildings intact. Prior to the attacks, the DIA believed Iran was potentially three months away from making a nuclear bomb. After the attacks, it estimated the program had been set back less than six months. The report additionally stated that Iran had relocated a significant portion of its enriched uranium to classified locations before the U.S. attacks. Iranian officials have publicly stated that the uranium was moved before the strikes.

	











	Trump and the White House, however, have publicly claimed the mission was a “spectacular military success” that “completely and totally obliterated” key nuclear enrichment facilities and uranium supplies.

	On Fox News, Trump said that Iran couldn't have moved its uranium because it would be “very hard to do” and the uranium was “very, very heavy.”


	“I think, first of all, it's very hard to do. It's very dangerous to do,” Trump said. “It's very heavy, very, very heavy. It's a very hard thing to do. Plus, we didn't give much notice because they didn't know we were coming until just, you know, then.”

BARTIROMO: Do you think the Iranian regime hid some of the enriched uranium before the strikes?TRUMP: No


	Since the leak of the DIA report's conclusions, Trump has doubled down on his claims Iran's nuclear capabilities were destroyed and vented his increasing frustration that not everyone is buying his narrative. He has called the reports “fake news,” accusing the media outlets of having “[made] up a phony story to get some hits.”


	“The bomb went through [the nuclear facility] like it was butter, like it was absolute butter,” Trump said.


	Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that the Department of Defense has launched “a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes, battle damage assessments.”


	“They did obliterate it, it turned out,” Trump told Bartiromo, insisting Iran's nuclear capabilities were destroyed. “We had to suffer the fake news with the fake news of CNN and The New York Times, [which were] saying, well, maybe it wasn't as good as Trump said. Maybe it wasn't totally obliterated.”


	“It turned out, no, it was obliterated like nobody's ever seen before,” he continued. “And that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.”

	Since the strikes, Trump has called for Israel and Iran to make peace. “We basically have two countries that are fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” he said last week, frustrated that the two sides have not brokered a deal to stop the escalation.


	Trump is eager to claim victory in Iran and end the fighting, perhaps because he has his eye on snagging himself a Nobel Peace Prize, a longtime obsession.

	Vice President J.D. Vance, who previously spread conspiracy theories about the Black Lives Matter movement, said Saturday that its leaders and supporters should celebrate President Donald Trump because he's “done more to save Black lives than any leader in our country.” 


	Trump has called Black Lives Matter a “symbol of hate” and called its supporters “thugs.” In 2020, Trump deployed the National Guard on people in Washington, D.C. protesting the police murder of George Floyd. He also allegedly said of the protesters, “Can't you just shoot them?”


	Vance's idea came up in the context of the peace agreement between Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo, which was brokered by the U.S. and Qatar on Friday. “The peace treaty signing yesterday between the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Rwanda was truly historic,” he wrote on Bluesky, where he is the most blocked account. “That war has killed more than any since World War 2, almost all of them black.” (He seems to be thinking of the death toll of the Second Congo War, which ended in 2003. )

	He continued: “I'm sure the leaders and supporters of the black lives matter movement will join me in celebrating President Trump today, who has done more to save black lives than any leader in our country.”


	He then tagged New York Times opinion columnist Jamelle Bouie. Bouie became a target of Trump and Vance when he wrote about Vance's “blood and soil nationalism,” a Nazi slogan. 

	











	The Trump administration helped facilitate the peace deal in order to gain access to minerals in the region. Congo is estimated to have minerals worth up to $24 trillion. 


	“They were going at it for many years, and with machetes — it is one of the worst, one of the worst wars that anyone has ever seen. And I just happened to have somebody that was able to get it settled,” Trump said Friday. 


	“We're getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it. They're so honored to be here. They never thought they'd be coming.”

	Congo is a source of key minerals including cobalt, copper, and coltan, as well as diamonds and gold. Last year, Congo filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium, accusing subsidiaries of Apple of using “blood minerals” in its products. 


	“These activities have fuelled a cycle of violence and conflict by financing militias and terrorist groups and have contributed to forced child labour and environmental devastation,” Congo's lawyers said in a statement. 


	The Trump administration has significantly harmed Africa by shuttering the U.S. Agency for International Development and cutting more than 90 percent of its foreign aid contracts. 


	In response to USAID cuts to efforts in Congo, anti-poverty organization Oxfam said in a statement, “The health of up to 1 million people could be at risk due to the impact of this decision on the work of humanitarian agencies in the DRC. We will be forced to cut vital clean water and sanitation services, increasing the risk of the spread of cholera, measles, and mpox.” 


	Trump's foreign aid cuts have gutted the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), which has saved tens of millions of lives. According to a recent study, millions are expected to die as a result of these cuts in countries supported by PEPFAR, which include Congo.   


	Vance previously peddled the conspiracy theory that insurance companies and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos supported Black Lives Matter because that enriched their businesses. In a 2021 piece in The American Mind called “Fighting Woke Capital,” he explained that “woke capital is when companies and businesses are more invested in a movement like BLM than they are in traditional American principles, and they are.”

	“Now who benefits most when small businesses on Main Street are destroyed?” he asked. “Who wants to see their competitors unable to deliver goods and services to people so they get it delivered in the Amazon box? Jeff Bezos. There is a direct connection between woke capital and the plunder that's happening in our society today. The people who are invested in destroying America via our corporate class are also getting rich from it. This is an important piece of the puzzle to understand.” 


	In 2020, Amazon gave $10 million to social justice organizations, including Black Lives Matter. But Vance's supposed reason for those donations and his depiction of the protests as a campaign to destroy property has no basis in reality.

Glastonbury bosses have said they are “appalled” by comments made by rap duo Bob Vylan during their performance at the festival yesterday.


	Rapper Bobby Vylan of the group led crowds on the West Holts Stage in chants of “Free, free Palestine” and: “Death, death to the IDF [Israel Defence League]”.


	Responding in a statement shared to social media by festival boss Emily Eavis, organizers said they were “appalled” by the comments.


	“Glastonbury Festival was created in 1970 as a place for people to come together and rejoice in music, the arts and the best of human endeavour. As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism. We will always believe in – and actively campaign for – hope, unity, peace and love,” a statement read.

A post shared by Glastonbury Festival (@glastofest)


	“With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer's presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs.

	











	“However, we are appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan yesterday. Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.”


	A similar statement was issued by the BBC as they confirmed that the set will not be available to watch on demand.

	











	“Some of the comments made during Bob Vylan's set were deeply offensive,” they said. “During this live stream on iPlayer, which reflected what was happening on stage, a warning was issued on screen about the very strong and discriminatory language. We have no plans to make the performance available on demand.”


	Police are also assessing the footage of their set to see if any offences have been committed, while The Independent reports that Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has spoken to BBC Director General Tim Davie “to seek an urgent explanation about what due diligence it carried out ahead of the Bob Vylan performance”.


	Bob Vylan were performing shortly before Kneecap, who delivered one of the most anticipated sets of the weekend. The festival had faced pressure from figures including Keir Starmer to cancel the performance after the band's Liam O hAnnaidh was charged with a terror offence after it was alleged that he unfurled a Hezbollah flag and said “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” at a gig at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town late last year.

Beyoncé's hometown Houston gig hit a brief detour Saturday as the flying red car she rides on during “16 Carriages” malfunctioned above the crowd.


	One of the major set pieces during the Cowboy Carter Tour features the singer cruising over the audience as she delivers the concert's penultimate track in the suspended vehicle. During Saturday's show at NGR Stadium, however, the car stalled, tilted and swayed, causing Beyoncé to pause mid-song and alert the crew.


	“Stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop,” she calmly requested as the music went silent.


	After hovering for another minute, the car was slowly lowered into an aisle way on the floor, where Beyoncé disembarked. After a brief delay, she made her way back to the stage and performed the remainder of “16 Carriages.” She then closed out the concert with “Amen.”

	The United States is not where it should be when it comes to the transition to renewable energy. Ask any climate scientist or reputable energy expert, and they'll tell you we're significantly behind schedule if we're hoping to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which Joe Biden's administration got passed in 2022, was meant to help speed up that transition and get the country on the right track. Now, it's under attack.


	President Donald Trump's administration has been working to undo any policies that would help the world avoid a climate catastrophe, and it is now trying to use the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” to repeal most of the climate-focused initiatives contained in the IRA. Trump's signature legislation is caught up in the Senate after the House passed it last month, so it's not entirely clear what the final draft will contain, but experts agree that these climate provisions are clearly on the chopping block. 

	











	The latest version of the bill would be particularly catastrophic for wind and solar. Republicans not only want to significantly cut tax credits for these clean energy projects, they wants impose new taxes on them for the first time. Wind and solar projects completed after 2027, for instance, will be taxed unless they can prove no Chinese components were used.


	“They're proposing an outright massacre with punishing new taxes on these industries that happen to be the cheapest and easiest ways to get new energy on the grid,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote in a statement Saturday. “If this becomes law, it will be a shocking act of economic self-sabotage.” 

	











	Republicans also stand to cut the $7,500 tax credit for consumers who purchase a new electric vehicle, and the $4,000 credit for consumers who buy a used one.


	“It is clear that many of the grant and loan programs that were established by the IRA are at especially high risk,” Romany Webb, deputy director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, tells Rolling Stone. “The tax credits are a little more uncertain, but we should expect changes to at least some of the tax credit programs and the elimination of some of them.”

	It appears some tax credits, like those for nuclear and geothermal energy companies, might remain until at least 2034. Trump recently made it known that he doesn't like tax credits going to clean energy projects, but he didn't specify what he was talking about. 


	“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS' IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM,” Trump posted last week on Truth Social. “I would much prefer that this money be used somewhere else, including reductions.”


	The latest version of the bill slashes tax credits for wind and solar projects, while offering them for coal production. “Utterly insane and destructive,” Elon Musk wrote of the bill on Saturday. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.”


	Daniel Kammen, a distinguished professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, says he doesn't think anything is off the table when it comes to cuts to the IRA, and that Republicans will have to make individual decisions about what might help or hurt them when the midterms come around next year.


	“There are Republicans who voted against the IRA who then campaigned for reelection on its merits,” Kammen says. “[The bill is] even targeting measures popular with Republicans.”


	Nearly 80 percent of renewable energy project funding in the IRA went to Republican congressional districts. Many hoped Republicans wouldn't eliminate provisions that benefited their constituents. However, with Donald Trump leading the charge, much of this funding might be cut, regardless of whether it is helping Republicans.

	“The fact that many of the incentives were provided to red states means that even Republican governors and legislators will probably be averse to abandoning them,” says Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of Earth and environmental science at the University of Pennsylvania. “So there is some hope there.”

	











	It's unclear what will become of projects that were started due to the passage of the IRA or were helped along by it. Kammen says these cuts will likely have a “big effect,” and that they may suddenly find it difficult to obtain more capital for “project expansion and grid connection,” for example. “The amount of damage that is going to be done is high,” he says.


	There is also concern about Trump administration efforts to claw back funds that were already guaranteed to certain projects, which are being challenged in the courts. If the courts rule against the Trump administration, then that funding would remain intact.


	“These recent efforts by the Trump administration to cancel validly executed contracts are ridiculous,” Webb says. “It's up to Congress to determine what gets funded, and Congress sets the priorities in a statute like the IRA.”


	While many industrialized nations, from Europe to China, are preparing for the future and investing in renewable energy, the U.S. appears determined to double down on antiquated and withering energy sources. Some of the efforts to transition away from fossil fuels in America will continue on, such as those at the state or local level, but the Trump administration is doing everything it can to kill green energy at the federal level and even trying to block many of the local initiatives to move away from fossil fuels.

	Kammen says we're “hitting pause” on renewable energy development at exactly the wrong moment, with Webb adding that America is “looking backwards” while other nations are focusing on what's ahead of us. 


	“For U.S. competitiveness, it's really important,” Webb says. “This will have huge economic impacts. Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuel energy. Any consumer who has an energy bill should care about this.”

PEMBROKE:  A Massachusetts woman experienced a surprising event when she came across a mysterious viral object in the sky and recorded the situation on video. 

Colleen McCormack, resident of Pembroke, was having a relaxed time in her outdoor hot tub around 9 pm on Wednesday when she observed an unusual sight above her. “I was in the hot tub, looked up at the sky, and saw something small floating. I thought, ‘What is that?'” Colleen McCormack said in an interview with WHDH-TV. She promptly recorded the scene on her phone.



The footage exposes what appears to be a glowing object descending rapidly. “It looked as though it was on fire or something, and it was just coming down very quickly,” she described in an interview with WFXT-TV. “I have no idea what it could have been.”

Despite the spectacular visuals, the event was notably silent. “It was quiet. You couldn't hear anything, which only added to my confusion,” McCormack remarked. “Typically, when objects fly overhead, you can hear them.”

The unidentified viral object remains a mystery, as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that there were no reports of debris or incidents involving aircraft in the vicinity and refrained from commenting on the video evidence.

Local police and fire departments also indicated they had received no related calls or sightings.

McCormack, still feeling unsettled by the incident, stated, “My heart was racing because I just looked up and thought, ‘Oh my God, what is about to happen?'”

This UFO sighting in Massachusetts has generated considerable interest online, with various theories ranging from meteor fragments to experimental aircraft. However, in the absence of official clarification, the nature of the mystery object remains an unresolved mystery

Jensen Ackles has spoken out on what exactly is getting in the way of Supernatural season 16. Every season of Supernatural brought a new twist to the dark fantasy series, expanding on its central relationship. Guided by creator Eric Kripke, Jensen Ackles played Dean Winchester alongside Jared Padalecki as his brother, Sam, for fifteen years. From 2005 to 2020, these brothers were the emotional core of a show that often seemed like it would never end. That's why so many fans, along with cast and crew, still contemplate another season, although it may not come for a while.

There is one standout reason why a follow-up to Supernatural season 16 may still be a long way off, according to Ackles. The Supernatural actor spoke to Collider, confirming that his schedule is being totally dominated by Amazon and the TV series he is currently filming for it. This is getting in the way of him being able to film another season of Supernatural, and Supernatural season 16 wouldn't be the same without Dean. Currently working on The Boys, Vought Rising, Gen V, and Countdown, Ackles commented on Amazon's current control over Supernatural's continuation:

Well, it sounds like Amazon's going to have to come up with an idea on that one, because they're controlling my schedule right now.

Jensen Ackles is one busy actor, which seriously limits his availability going forward, directly impacting the possibility of another season of Supernatural. Although Ackles is grateful for having hit his peak relatively late in his career, he acknowledges the disruption this causes to the show that made him. Ackles spoke about his concern about turning up to the set of The Boys as ""one of"" Kripke's guys and not being taken seriously, whereas his affection and loyalty to both the showrunner and Supernatural are clear. Ackles would clearly love to create another season.

The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural.

Ackles explicitly commented that ""We continue to talk about it,"" while confirming that ""If it happens, then let's go."" This means that, like many fans and cast members, Ackles would be more than happy to commit a lot more time to the Winchesters in Supernatural. But Ackles would have to work with Amazon to negotiate this time between filming his other Amazon shows. The implication of Ackles' words is that Amazon may allow him to film Supernatural during breaks from Vought Rising, The Boys, Gen V, and Countdown.

 It seems apparent that Ackles will be swamped with Amazon Prime Video work for a long time, but that he could be able to find time for everyone's favorite brothers at some point. Even if The Boys' Supernatural reunion is the only time Padalecki, Ackles, and Misha Collins get on set together in the next two years, Amazon may find it easy to schedule in some time for Ackles to film Supernatural soon after. Vought Rising is only just beginning, and Countdown is also in its early days, but The Boys is coming to an end in its next season.

Supernatural could always come back for season 16, but there is another way that the popular show could continue with far fewer difficulties.

To get around Ackles' busy schedule, Jared Padalecki's Sam Winchester could lead a Supernatural season 16 with Bobby and Castiel, but this would require narrative gymnastics. Of course, Eric Kripke, Sera Gamble, Jeremy Carver, and Supernatural's other core team may not be keen to run a show that doesn't center on its two focal siblings, and fans would almost certainly be upset if that were the case. But, luckily, Ackles may not be too many years away from Supernatural season 16 anyway.

The early seasons of Supernatural were known for pitting Sam and Dean Winchester against ghosts, vampires, wendigos, and all things that go bump in the night. Eventually, demons and angels were introduced, upping the ante of the series as the Winchesters fought bigger and badder enemies. Some episodes, like Season 1, Episode 5, ""Bloody Mary,"" were inspired by terrifying urban legends, while others elaborate on creatures from mythology.

Most fans can agree that Supernatural lost its ""horror"" edge after the first couple seasons. Season One through Season Four feature plenty of terrifying episodes that will keep fans up at night, but Supernatural lost some of that magic when it started focusing on bigger and more ambitious overarching plots. That said, Supernatural contains some exceptionally dark episodes that fans need to mentally prepare for before watching.

At the end of Season 5, Sam Winchester sacrifices himself to stop the apocalypse. He does this by allowing Lucifier to possess him and then jumping back into ""the pit,"" a cage built specifically to house Lucifer. The Season 5 finale suggests Sam will be lost to Hell forever, but surprisingly, Sam returns from the pit almost immediately thanks to Castiel's help. Castiel, however, was not able to retrieve his soul. The first half of Season 6 focuses on Soulless Sam and his older brother, Dean, trying to figure out what's wrong with Sam.

Once Dean finally realizes that Sam is missing his soul, he makes a deal with Death, one of the Four Horsemen, to retrieve Sam's soul from Hell. This episode is dark because Adam, Sam and Dean's younger brother, is also trapped in the pit, but Dean saves Sam over Adam. Dean also agrees to Death's deal, where Dean has to become Death for a day. Dean spares a dying child, which results in several deaths that were never supposed to happen. This concept made a lot of viewers face the idea of fate and that they truly have no control over their lives and how they ultimately end.

The first few episodes of Season 10 focus on a continued plot from Season 9 where Dean possessed the Mark of Cain. With the mark still on him, the angel Metatron killed him, which resulted in Dean becoming a demon. Sam spends the first few episodes of Season 10 plotting a way to capture Dean and cure him of being a demon. In ""Soul Survivor,"" Sam and Demon Dean stand-off, and some fans have compared the episode to Stephen King's The Shining, with Demon Dean taking the part of a possessed Jack Torrance.

Dean Winchester is one of Supernatural's most beloved characters, and there are more than a few reasons that prove why.

In this episode, Sam attempts to cure Dean, while Dean throws every insult he can at his little brother. He even tries to gaslight Sam into believing he's killing Dean instead of saving him, and points out that Sam is also a monster because of the things he's done trying to save his brother. Things escalate when Dean inevitably breaks free of his restraints and the Devil's Trap. Dean hunts Sam through the bunker, much like Jack hunts his wife in The Shining. Sam, injured and no match for Dean's strength, is forced to move strategically through the bunker, now prey for his older brother to hunt.

Sam and Dean investigate a string of bodies that follow a creepy old painting of a family. According to the stories about the painting, the father killed his entire family and himself. This was so heavily believed that the father was even buried away from the rest of the family. Sam and Dean catch onto the haunted painting as various owners of said painting drop dead in a pool of their own blood. Because of the stories of the family, the brothers believe the ghost of the father is haunting the painting and killing anyone who displays it in their home.

In reality, it turns out that the father in the painting occasionally moves because he's trying to warn people that his youngest daughter is actually responsible for the murders. As a ghost, the killer child is terrifying, but it's even more unsettling to know that, prior to the young girl's death, she slaughtered her entire family. In the Supernatural universe, ghosts will eventually turn vengeful, often doing things they wouldn't normally do in life, but this ghost was a killer prior to her death. This episode proves that evil comes in all shapes and sizes, and even children are capable of horrible things.

""The Benders"" is one of the most disturbing episodes in Supernatural because it's one of the first episodes in the series that ""breaks"" its formula. Up until Season 1, Episode 15, most of the episodes focus on Sam and Dean hunting supernatural creatures, but ""The Benders"" tells the story of a family of killers. The Benders abduct people a couple of times a year, hold them hostage, and then hunt them for sport. Even the youngest member of the family, a little girl who can't be more than 9 years old, is in on it.

From Sam and Dean Winchester's hilarious quips to Castiel's iconic lines, Supernatural is full of great dialogue.

Sam and Dean are in town to search for the source that causes people to go missing in the local town. They don't find anything supernatural, but Sam is jumped and kidnapped by the Benders. Dean, with the help of a local officer whose brother went missing, tracks Sam to the Benders' where he uncovers the truth about the sadistic family. Real monsters are just ordinary people. That's a lesson Scooby-Doo taught children, and it's a theme that even Supernatural stuck with.

""Skin"" is the first time Supernatural introduced the concept of the shapeshifter. According to Supernatural lore, ""shifters"" are mostly human, but they possess the ability to shed their skin and assume the identity of anyone they come in contact with. In ""Skin,"" Sam and Dean hunt a shapeshifter who has been posing as the significant other of various women. While pretending to be their partner, he slaughters the women brutally, and leaves the real man to take the fall for the crime. The shifter eventually steals Dean's face, but that's not all he gets.

When a shifter takes someone else's skin, the shifter learns everything about that person. So this serial killer shifter essentially becomes Dean Winchester. It's the ultimate form of identity thief and, since most ordinary people don't know that monsters exist, law enforcement has no idea that the killer responsible for so many deaths isn't Dean. ""Skin"" is the first time one of the Winchesters ends up wanted by the police, but it isn't the last. Between the fear of someone pretending to be someone they aren't, Dean being framed for crimes he didn't commit, and the gnarly way the shifter sheds its skin, this episode is sure to make anyone's skin crawl.

""Family Remains"" is another episode that sends Sam and Dean after what they believe to be a monster, but the truth is actually so much worse. Sam and Dean try to stop a family from moving into what they believe to be a haunted house. When the family refuses to listen, they have no choice but to try and protect the family from the vengeful spirit of a young girl. Only, their normal methods of dealing with ghosts, like putting salt circles down, do nothing to stop the ghost in her tracks.

When it comes to hunting things with a tinge of comedy, there's no one better than the Winchester brothers in some of Supernatural's funniest episodes

Sam and Dean eventually uncover that the ghost girl is actually a real, feral girl who has been living within the walls of the house. She was hidden there, never allowed to see the light of day, to cover up her family's horrible, incestuous secret. What Sam and Dean don't know is that the little girl isn't alone. She lives with her older, stronger brother. Together, the siblings kill anyone who enters the house to protect themselves and even potentially eat their victims. The siblings are so hostile and feral, there is no hope to save them, once again proving that humanity is the greatest evil of them all. It's not even that the siblings themselves are monsters, but the family that raised them in such a brutish way surely was.

After Sam and Dean stop the apocalypse by trapping the archangel Michael in the pit with Lucifier, civil war breaks out in Heaven. Castiel and his followers oppose Raphael, who wants to restart the apocalypse. Raphael, however, is an archangel, so he is much more powerful than Castiel. To win the war, Castiel turns to nefarious means, which leads him to partner with Crowley, the King of Hell, to collect as many souls as possible. Both Castiel and Crowley turn their eyes to Purgatory, where millions of souls of untapped potential reside.

Sam and, more importantly, Dean disagree with Castiel's plan to open Purgatory and potentially unleash the monsters that live there. To keep the Winchesters in check, Castiel purposefully breaks the wall in Sam's head put there by Death. After Death retrieved Sam's soul from the pit, he put a wall up in Sam's mind to keep him from remembering his time in Hell or his year without a soul, therefore protecting him from memories that would otherwise destroy him. Castiel breaking Sam's mental wall puts Sam in a catatonic state and has devastating repercussions throughout the next season. This betrayal of one of the Winchesters' closest friends and allies was heartbreaking to watch.

""Hell House"" is the first episode where Sam and Dean cross paths with the Ghostfacers, an in-universe Ghost Hunters parody. Sam and Dean are investigating what they believe to be a typical haunted house, but as they investigate, they find the ghost is constantly changing its patterns. Spirits don't typically do that. They're very rigid with where they haunt, how they haunt, and how they kill, so a ghost that changes its methods with every encounter leaves the brothers stumped.

Supernatural's ""Swan Song"" is hailed as Eric Kripke's perfect finale to the series, but his ending is actually much darker and unsatisfying.

Eventually, they discover they aren't dealing with a ghost, but with a Tulpa. Tulpas are entities that are created purely based on the power of belief. The more people that believe in the Tulpa, the more real the Tulpa becomes. As the story about Hell House's spirit changes and people believe in a new version of the story, the Tulpa's behavior and patterns also shift to match that story. Sam makes a comment about wondering how many monsters they fought existed just because someone believed in them, which is an absolutely terrifying prospect. An idea is powerful enough to create a serial killing ghost, and it doesn't get much darker than that.

Sam and Dean learn that they're the true vessels for Lucifer and Michael, two archangels that are destined to battle and bring on the apocalypse. For most of Season 5, they remain determined to refuse the angels access to their bodies, but eventually, they realize that Lucifer and Michael will destroy the world with or without them. Sam says yes to Lucifer, believing that he can keep control long enough to throw himself into the pit, therefore locking himself and Lucifer in the cage deep within the pits of Hell.

Sam's plan succeeds, and the Winchesters stop the apocalypse, but it forces Dean to live with the reality that his baby brother will be trapped in Hell with the devil for eternity. With the apocalypse subverted and Sam trapped in Hell to suffer forever, it seemed like there was little left for Supernatural to explore. Instead of leaving Sam in Hell, however, the series pulled Sam out of Hell without his soul, which turned him into an incredible hunter, but a ruthless one who would sacrifice people without a second thought.

After Sam's first death at the end of Season 2, Dean makes a deal with a crossroads demon to bring Sam back to life. Most crossroads deals are 10 years. The person who makes the deal gets whatever they want and then, in 10 years' time, the demon comes to collect their soul. Because the Winchesters are a huge problem for demons, the crossroads demon refuses Dean's deal, but eventually agrees, promising to only give Dean one year of life with his brother.

For most of Season 3, Sam is trying to figure out how to save Dean from his deal, while Dean pretends he's made peace with dying. Everyone thought the Winchesters would get Dean out of his deal, but the Season 3 finale actually committed to slaughtering Dean. Dean was sent to Hell, where he was strung up on the rack to be tortured for all eternity. Dean screams for Sam, afraid and desperate, but in Hell, Sam can't reach him. This was one of the most horrifying moments of Supernatural. Many fans wondered if Dean's fate was sealed forever, but fortunately, Castiel makes his series debut by saving Dean from Hell in Season 4.

Netflix subscribers are recommending a 'criminally overlooked' TV series with a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score.

First releasing in 2021, the two-part series managed to garner 96.7 million hours in just two years, as per figures from Flixpatrol.

With so many new titles joining Netflix, it can be a little overwhelming to chose your next binge-watch.

Advert

And even if something's previously pulled in big numbers, it may still have slipped under your radar.

If you enjoyed all 14 seasons of adult animation Archer, too, then this TV series should be next on your watch-list.

The animated sci-fi is set in the US - Washington D.C, to be exact.

It centers on Cognito, Inc., a clandestine 'Deep State' organization that employs a team of misfit specialists to manage and conceal real-world conspiracy theories - from reptilian shapeshifters to the Moon landing cover-up.

Advert

While delving into the world of the weird and wonderful, they must also balance their own personal issues as well as the never-ending slog of corporate politics.

Former Gravity Falls writer Shion Takeuchi is the brains behind the show, while Bojack Horseman's Mike Hollingsworth and Gravity Falls' Alex Hirsch serve as executive co-producers.

Lizzy Caplan, Christian Slater, Clark Duke, Tisha Campbell and Andy Daly all lend their voices for the 'binge-worthy' series.

Advert

The show in question is called Inside Job, if you hadn't already guessed.

Racking up an impressive 91 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from fans, the series premiered in two halves; Part 1 landed in October 2021, while Part 2 concluded the season in November 2022.

Fans on the site hailed the show 'binge-worthy,' as one described it 'hands down one of the greatest cartoons Netflix has released.

Over on Reddit, one subscriber was after 'hidden gem' series to get stuck into.

Advert

Among the suggestions was Inside Job, with the first person to recommend it describing it as an 'animated show that basically roasts every conspiracy theory while somehow building a heartwarming ensemble.'

""Criminally overlooked,"" they added - and others were quick to agree.

""Sucks that it wasn't renewed,"" one person said, ""Theme song was a banger too.""

Advert

""For people that loved Archer, this is indeed a gem,"" a second agreed.

""This show is hilarious and includes every single conspiracy theory,"" a third said.

A fourth gave their verdict: ""This, OP. It became a sleeping comfort show for me after the 2nd watch-through. Ticks all the boxes.""

Both parts of Inside Job are available to stream now on Netflix.

President Vladimir Putin has expanded the range of information covered by Russia's state secrecy law, further tightening his grip on society as his war in Ukraine continues.

Details of Russia's foreign policy, international trade and economic policy, scientific developments and preparations for possible military mobilization may all now be classified as secret if disclosure is considered to harm national security, according to a decree published on the government's legal website.

President Donald Trump said that Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has ""to do the right thing"" if he is elected mayor of New York City, or he could see federal funding dry up.

""Let's say this, if he does get in, I'm going to be president and he's going to have to do the right thing, or they're not getting any money,"" Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo during an interview that aired Sunday.

""He's got to do the right thing,"" Trump said.

It's not the first time that Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding for local politicians, particularly those in blue states, whose positions he opposes.

He's previously threatened to strip federal funding from California over Gov. Gavin Newsom's policies towards transgender athletes participating in women's sports.

While Trump took particular aim at Mamdani, the 33-year-old who defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the first round of the city's Democratic mayoral primary last week, he also made a wider funding threat to all New York City mayoral candidates.

""I can tell you this, whoever's mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves, or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

Trump has repeatedly called Mamdani — who is a Democratic socialist — a communist, as he did during the interview on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures.

Mamdani has rejected that label.

""I am not and I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am,"" Mamdani told NBC News' Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press.""

President Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines, a step that follows the Baltic nations and Poland's move to boost their defense as the war rages on in Ukraine. 

The 1997 treaty, joined by over 160 countries, bans the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of anti-personnel landmines in efforts to protect civilians from the scattered explosives that could still injure them long after the conflict is over. 

""Russia has never been a party to this convention and uses anti-personnel mines extremely cynically,"" Zelensky said in justifying the decision. ""And not only now, in the war against Ukraine. This is the signature style of Russian killers — to destroy life by all methods at their disposal.

Earlier in March, the Baltic states and Poland announced their intention to withdraw from the Ottawa Convention, a significant shift in defense policy that shows how countries near Ukraine are preparing for a potential war in Europe.

Anti-personnel mines are scattered across the battlefield in Ukraine, with soldiers and civilians often losing their feet or limbs due to detonations. Territories liberated by Ukraine since 2022 have been heavily covered with mines, making it extremely difficult and dangerous to clear them. Russia has used more than a dozen variants of anti-personnel mines since it launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to Human Rights Watch's June report. 

In a surprise move that angered Moscow, the Biden administration in 2024 approved the provision of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine. Then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said it was to help Ukraine stall the Russian advances in the east as the front-line situation deteriorated.

""This is a step that the reality of war has long demanded,"" lawmaker Roman Kostenko, secretary of the parliament's defense committee, said in the Facebook post announcing a significant move forward in withdrawing from the major mine treaty. 

Now that Zelensky signed the decree enacting the decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, it will land on the parliament's table, Kostenko said. The dates when the decision will take effect are still unclear.
