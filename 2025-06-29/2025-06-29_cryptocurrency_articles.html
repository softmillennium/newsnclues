                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I'm your AI market decoder—cutting through the chaos to show you what trends really matter (and which ones to ignore). SoFi Technologies (NASDAQ: SOFI) is making a bold return to crypto—and it could be the move that finally unlocks its full potential as a financial powerhouse. After exiting the crypto space in late 2023 due to regulatory hurdles, SoFi's relaunch of crypto trading and its push into blockchain-based remittances in 2025 position the company to capitalize on two of fintech's fastest-growing trends. With a $49 billion global blockchain fintech market projected by 2030, SoFi's strategic pivot could transform it from a niche player in digital banking to a leader in the next era of financial services. These features align with a growing demand for crypto integration into everyday financial tools. For context, SoFi's stock jumped over 2% on June 25, 2025, after announcing these plans, signaling investor optimism. But the real opportunity lies in user growth. This demographic is also more likely to engage with multiple financial services—lending, savings, and insurance—thereby boosting cross-selling opportunities. By leveraging blockchain for near-instant transfers with transparent fees, SoFi aims to undercut legacy players like Western Union (WU) and MoneyGram (MGI). The U.S. alone sends $93 billion annually in remittances, primarily to Latin America and Asia, with global remittances exceeding $800 billion (per 2023 World Bank data). This service isn't just cost-effective; it's a gateway to deeper customer relationships. Users who send remittances via SoFi may also adopt its savings accounts, loans, or investment products, creating a self-reinforcing ecosystem. This aligns with a broader trend under the Trump administration to foster innovation in financial services. Furthermore, SoFi's Galileo platform—its API-driven banking-as-a-service infrastructure—is now being opened to third-party developers. This could turn SoFi into a behind-the-scenes provider of blockchain infrastructure, akin to how Twilio (TWLO) dominates communications APIs. CEO Anthony Noto aims to integrate blockchain into every facet of its offerings, from crypto-collateralized loans to blockchain-backed insurance products. This holistic approach could make SoFi the “Swiss Army knife” of digital finance, reducing customer churn and boosting lifetime value. Adding crypto and remittance fees to its revenue streams could accelerate growth. Volatility in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices could deter risk-averse users. Competitors like Block (SQ) and Coinbase (COIN) are also vying for crypto dominance. However, SoFi's existing user base of 2.5 million+ and its vertically integrated banking model give it a leg up. Investment Thesis: A Stock Poised for Multiples ExpansionSoFi's moves address two critical pain points: stagnant user growth and reliance on fee-based banking. For investors, SOFI's stock represents a bet on two trends: the mainstreaming of crypto and the dominance of all-in-one fintech platforms. The near-term catalysts—crypto trading relaunch and remittance rollout—make 2025 a pivotal year. While risks exist, the upside for a company primed to lead the next wave of financial innovation is compelling. Investors who believe in a future where crypto and blockchain are mainstream should consider SoFi as a core holding in their tech portfolios.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, despite the current position, many investors still see it as undervalued. This is due to its growing utility in real-world payments, especially the possibility that it could serve as a bridge currency for central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs. Amid the growing momentum behind CBDC development, there is a rise in demand for a fast, neutral asset that can connect different currencies across borders. For context, more than 130 countries, representing 98% of global GDP, are actively researching or testing CBDCs. As a result, several industry commentators have pointed to XRP, with its speed and low transaction cost, as a possible candidate to bridge these CBDCs when they launch. To explore what XRP could be worth if it took on the role of a global CBDC bridge, we asked ChatGPT for an estimate based on market data and reasonable assumptions. In its evaluation, ChatGPT presented three factors: transaction volume, liquidity needs, and XRP's supply. Today, the foreign exchange market sees more than $7.5 trillion move every day. If each XRP moves five times daily, and the volume reaches $100 billion, the system would need $20 billion worth of XRP available at any given time. According to ChatGPT, that figure does not reflect market dynamics like speculation, holding, or growing scarcity. Taking those into account, ChatGPT projected a range of potential prices. Specifically, with basic adoption as a bridge currency, XRP could rise to somewhere between $10 and $20. If global usage expands and demand for liquidity rises, the price might reach $50 to $100. Nonetheless, ChatGPT stressed that all of this depends on factors such as regulatory approval, large-scale adoption, and real-world use working together. Several national banks and global financial bodies already use the XRP Ledger in pilot programs. Ripple has teamed up with countries like Palau, Bhutan, Georgia, and Montenegro. While these projects do not rely on XRP itself, their use of a private ledger similar to the XRPL indicates the network's appeal for CBDCs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We're living in a digital world that's constantly changing, and it looks like Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are becoming a big part of how companies recognize their employees. Imagine if every time you did something great at work, you got a unique digital token that actually had value and could be verified. This article takes a deep dive into how NFTs are shaking up the way we think about employee recognition, boosting morale, and even transforming payroll in the crypto age. They're unique digital assets that show you own something on-chain. Usually, we think of them as art or collectibles, but now they're spilling into the workplace. Using NFTs as a way to recognize employees means companies can give out personalized rewards that are real and can't be faked. This kind of recognition does wonders for morale and can make employees feel more connected to the company. These systems let employees get paid in Bitcoin or stablecoins, which is pretty much what a lot of tech-savvy folks want. It's not just about being trendy, though; these systems can help keep employees around and give companies a good reputation. Companies are starting to do just that, using NFTs as small bonuses or rewards for achievements. It's a fun way to recognize hard work, and it gives employees a tangible way to show off what they've accomplished. They don't fluctuate like Bitcoin does, so they make it easier for companies and employees to manage expectations when it comes to salary. This is especially true when you're dealing with employees from different countries, where currency value can swing wildly. Legal and compliance issues are major hurdles for any fintech startups looking to dive into this world. Plus, trying to mesh NFT payroll with old-school systems can feel like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. They offer a way to give out personalized rewards that are real and transparent, making employees feel valued. As the digital economy keeps shifting, companies that adapt will likely have a leg up in attracting and keeping good talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While blockchain technology promises transparency and decentralization, practical issues such as slow transaction speeds and high fees have made it challenging to meet the needs of everyday users. Whether you're trading tokens, minting NFTs or engaging with decentralized apps, the experience often falls short of the seamless and efficient interactions people expect from modern digital platforms. On public blockchains such as Ethereum, periods of heavy demand still push transaction fees into the dollars and delay settlement for minutes—an experience that certainly falls short of mainstream expectations. To close that gap, developers have turned to Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions: purpose-built networks that execute transactions off the main Ethereum chain, compress the results into cryptographic proofs, and post those proofs back to Layer 1 for immutable finality. Most L2s fall into two camps: rollups (Optimistic or Zero-Knowledge) and state channels/validium hybrids. Other recognized Layer 2 solutions include nested blockchains and sidechains. While all L2s aim to enhance scalability, their methods for inheriting Layer 1 security and managing data availability vary, and some, like Validiums, introduce additional trust assumptions regarding data availability. All share the same north star: compress data, cut fees and leave heavy-duty security to Ethereum's battle-tested consensus. An L2 batches hundreds, or even thousands of user transactions, creates a cryptographic proof of the new state, and submits that lightweight proof to Layer 1. Optimistic rollups (e.g., Optimism and Arbitrum) assume the batch is valid unless challenged within a dispute window. ZK-rollups (e.g., zkSync Era or Polygon zkEVM) generate succinct validity proofs up-front, so withdrawals finalize in minutes rather than days. Transaction fees also show a stark contrast; Layer 1 fees typically range from $0.25 to $0.50 on average but can spike to $20-$60 in times of high network congestion. Lower fees are the headline benefit of L2s, but several second-order benefits matter just as much: Ethereum's March 2024 Dencun upgrade introduced blob space (EIP-4844), a cheap data lane expressly for rollups. Blobs lowered average L2 transaction fees by roughly 90%, catalyzing the migration of everyday payments and micro-trades off-chain. By shifting order-routing, AMM swaps, and NFT orders to L2 while anchoring security to L1, Ethereum keeps its decentralization ethos intact yet gains Visa-scale throughput—a feat that pure L1 scaling alone couldn't handle. Although L2 networks provide a number of benefits over L1 in terms of cost and speed, there's no such thing as a free lunch in crypto security: Users should generally be looking for L2s with open-sourced node software, decentralized proposers and permissionless fraud-proof systems scheduled on the roadmap. Wallet standards like EIP-4337 (account abstraction) and gas-sponsored transactions help, but widespread education is needed. Regulators also eye cross-chain bridges as potential money-laundering chokepoints, which may impose compliance overhead on sequencer operators in 2026 and beyond. Optimism's Superchain will soon enable atomic cross-rollup calls, and ZK-proof hardware acceleration promises sub-cent fees. Whether one mega-rollup dominates or a mesh of specialized L2s persists, the direction is clear: scale out, not up. Layer 2 scaling solutions have moved from academic whitepapers to production rails powering millions of daily transactions. Expect L2s—not yet another monolithic Layer 1—to carry Web3 toward mass adoption. Layer 2 is a secondary network that processes transactions off the main blockchain while anchoring final settlement back to it for security. Can I Use My Ethereum Wallet On Layer 2 Networks? Most L2s are EVM-compatible, so Metamask and hardware wallets work once you add the network RPC or connect via WalletConnect. “Best” depends on priorities: Base leads in TVL, Optimism's Superchain dominates transaction share, and ZK-rollups like zkSync offer near-instant finality with strong cryptographic guarantees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NFT projects lost roughly $1 million in crypto over the past week when hackers posed as IT staff and struck at the heart of minting systems. According to onchain investigator and cybersecurity analyst ZackXBT, the attackers pushed out mass batches of NFTs, drove floor prices to zero, then cashed in their haul before teams could react. Based on reports, the group quietly joined development squads under false identities. Then they minted thousands of tokens and NFTs in moments. It all unfolded in under a week, and about $1 million vanished from these projects' treasuries. 1/ Multiple projects tied to Pepe creator Matt Furie & ChainSaw as well as another project Favrr were exploited in the past week which resulted in ~$1M stolen My analysis links both attacks to the same cluster of DPRK IT workers who were likely accidentally hired as developers. At Replicandy, floor values hit zero almost instantly. ChainSaw's stolen crypto still sits inactive in wallets, waiting for launderers to stir it back into exchanges. ZackXBT pointed out that nested services then further obscured the money trail. 4/ In total I estimate $310K+ from their projects was stolen and transferred primarily between the three address below. Onchain transfers moved funds through multiple exchanges and wallets. Analysts say tracing mixed outputs can take weeks. That slows or even blocks law enforcement from locking down accounts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some crypto startups are raising concerns over Kenya's proposed virtual asset service providers (VASP) Bill, warning it could hand outsized influence to a Binance-linked lobby group, potentially undermining fair competition in the country's digital asset industry. Some crypto stakeholders in Kenya claim that VAC has run Binance-sponsored regulatory talks, lacks independence and acts as a proxy for the exchange. How is this constitutional?” one stakeholder told The Kenyan Wall Street. Related: Binance's CZ suggests ‘will function' to distribute crypto in case of death The report claimed that Binance pays VAC $6,000 per country each month for policy advocacy, citing a confidential agreement. This raises fears that the lobby group could skew Kenya's crypto rules to benefit Binance and sideline local players. Critics also reportedly noted similarities with VAC's reported attempts to insert itself into Rwanda's regulatory process. “If an entity of poor international reputation or one with clear conflict of interest becomes our crypto regulator, Kenya shall never leave FATF and EU greylists,” warned another stakeholder. In a comment to The Kenyan Wall Street, VAC's director Basil Ogolla defended VAC's role, pointing out its two-year campaign of consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and Parliament. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment but had not received a response by publication.

According to coverage on BitKE, Momint initially drew attention for helping African creators monetize digital content through NFTs.

Here's a clear summary of Momint's key activities as documented by BitKE over the years: May 2021 – Momint officially launched as South Africa's first NFT marketplace supporting ZAR payments. Early successes included sales of high-profile NFTs like Bryan Habana's rugby turntable for over $20,000. Feb 2023 – Partnered with Sun Exchange to launch SunCash, a solar crowdfunding initiative. Users could buy solar cells starting at R150 ($8.33) to fund installations across Limpopo, Western Cape, and Mpumalanga. Investors received ~12% annual returns paid quarterly in USDC, with Delmas High School serving as the flagship site. July 2024 – Received a $50,000 grant from DFINITY's ICP hub (Mzansi Web3), after reaching ~$1.95 million in marketplace volume and 53,000+ users. The grant supports Momint's integration with ICP blockchain to improve real-world asset tracking, reduce transaction costs, and enable smart-meter data linking.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More than a quarter of South Koreans in their 20s to 50s now own digital assets, with their crypto investments making up 14% of their total financial portfolios, according to a new report from the Hana Institute of Finance released Sunday. The study, titled 2050 Generation's Virtual Asset Investment Trends, shows that interest in crypto cuts across age groups. 78% of respondents in their 50s said they use crypto as a way to amass funds, while 53% said they were preparing for retirement through crypto investments. More respondents now cite growth potential, diversification, and structured savings plans as key motivations for investing. 42% said they would invest more if traditional financial institutions took a larger role in crypto markets, while 35% cited stronger legal protections as a key factor in boosting confidence. The proportion of investors making regular purchases rose from 10% to 34%, and mid-term trading increased from 26% to 47%, while short-term trading fell slightly. As experience grows, however, many diversify into altcoins or stablecoins. A major pain point highlighted was the restriction preventing linking multiple bank accounts with crypto exchanges. Seven in ten investors said they would favor their primary bank if this rule were relaxed. Concerns about market volatility remain widespread (56%), while worries over exchange or fraud risks were more pronounced among those hesitant to invest further. Last week, Eli Ilha Yune, chief product officer at Anzaetek, said the surge in crypto South Korea's crypto adoption isn't driven by optimism about blockchain technology. Speaking at German Blockchain Week, Yune argued that many young Koreans are turning to crypto out of financial desperation, seeking quick profits rather than supporting Web3 ideals. Youth unemployment in South Korea is a key factor, standing at 6.6%, more than double the national average. Yune explained that South Korea's once high-growth economy has stalled, leaving many young people jobless and unable to afford real estate or see meaningful returns from traditional investments like stocks. Amid this economic pressure, crypto has become the only viable investment option for Korea's younger generation, according to Yune. He noted that while some young investors understand crypto's technology, many are unaware of its infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain analysis suggests that more than half were probably foreign investors who had collectively poured millions into the token. “What's happening tonight at Trump's golf course … is in effect putting a ‘for sale' sign on the White House,” said Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal﻿ to reporters before the event, who called it “corruption”. On his wrist was a $100,000 watch made of 18-carat gold. He had already poured a separate $75m into the Trump family's crypto ﻿company World Liberty Financial (WLF). In February, five weeks after ﻿Trump became president, the US securities regulator shelved a 2023 civil fraud case against Sun that could have cost him millions in fines and repayments. Since February, Sun's business ties with the Trumps have deepened, even as questions surrounding his crypto empire remain unanswered. But instead of facing greater scrutiny, it appears Sun now finds himself closer than ever to the seat of American power. And ﻿reports recently emerged that Sun was taking Tron public in the US through a merger with the Nasdaq-listed company SRM Entertainment. The Financial Times reported that Eric Trump was expected to take up a role at the new company – Tron Inc – though he later said on social media that he had no “public involvement” in the project. The White House has repeatedly denied any conflict of interest. Sources, including former colleagues of Sun's, as well as financial and legal experts, paint a complicated picture of the crypto mogul. They call him a brilliant but money-obsessed opportunist﻿ who has made his fortune by always being in the right place at the right time. He has sought to do so again with the Trump administration. Sun's infatuation with Donald Trump began when he was in secondary school. The reality show, ﻿hosted by Trump for 14 seasons, which saw contestants battle through business challenges, left a lasting impression on him. As China embraced market reforms and a new wave of consumerism in the early ﻿00s, The Apprentice offered a seductive model of ambition, self-branding and western capitalist success. There he discovered bitcoin, spending night and day on crypto forums and becoming excited by the concept of digital currency as “money for the future”. His growing expertise led to a position at the crypto company Ripple Labs (now Ripple), advising on its expansion into China. Around the same time, in 2013, Sun founded the dating app Peiwo, a cross between Tinder and a chatroom, where users could send each other voice notes. The app drew millions of people, but faced scrutiny from Chinese authorities when they began uploading sexually explicit audio. Peiwo was eventually shut down by regulators for hosting content that “disrupts socialist values”, but by that point Sun had already made his millions. He walked around the office in squeaky-clean Gucci trainers and, according to a report from the Verge website, employees were baffled to see piles of cash pile up on the desk in his glass-walled office. ‘The government that should be regulating crypto is being led by a president with financial ties to it' “ He's not a very technical person,” said one former colleague. He built his crypto empire mostly by imitating the business strategies of other first movers and presenting them as innovative. Sun blamed poor translation from Chinese.At Tron and BitTorrent, employees faced demanding conditions. In 2020, two former Tron employees filed a civil lawsuit against Sun, with allegations ranging from fraud to verbal and physical harassment. The following year, Sun stepped down as chief executive of Tron to become ambassador and permanent representative of Grenada to the World Trade Organization. The details of his ambassadorship have not been made public; reports speculate that Sun paid to become a permanent citizen of the Caribbean nation. According to legal documents seen by The Observer, Sun tried to get out of at least one lawsuit by claiming diplomatic immunity. The cases were heard in private and eventually settled. No filings followed and, in April of this year, the Trump administration ordered prosecutors to limit their pursuit of cryptocurrency crimes. The civil lawsuit alleged they had sold crypto tokens as unregistered securities, manipulated their markets through wash trading﻿ and paid celebrities – including Lindsay Lohan, Soulja Boy and Jake Paul – to promote tokens without disclosure. Sources say he still demands that people refer to him as “his excellency”. If the lawsuits and investigations knocked Sun, he did﻿ not let it show. In November, before the SEC case was shelved, the billionaire went viral when he purchased a banana duct‑taped to a wall for $6.2m﻿ and later ate it. In the past year he has attended galas and graced the cover of Forbes, and is due to travel to space ﻿with Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin company next month. In 2024, Tron hosted 58% of all illicit crypto activity – more than any other blockchain. Sun has previously said “criminals are drawn to the same features that make blockchain revolutionary – speed, efficiency, and borderless transactions”, and that Tron's “transparency actually makes it harder, not easier, to launder money”. Fischer, a former employee of the regulator, is doubtful that it will. “I am almost at a loss for words,” Fischer added.
