                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flamengo topped their group ahead of Chelsea, ES Tunis and LAFC, while Bayern Munich were runners-up to Benfica as Boca Juniors and Auckland City were eliminated from the group. PSG scored all four goals in the first half. Joao Neves got the first two, heading home unmarked in the sixth minute before finishing off a lovely team move a half hour later. Flamengo come into today's last-16 on an 11-game unbeaten streak in all competitions. Their last defeat was a domestic one, losing 2-1 against Cruzeiro on May 4. If they avoid defeat today in 90 minutes, their unbeaten run will stretch beyond two months. Vincent Kompany restores the Kimmich-Goretzka axis in midfield, and picks a fluid-looking three behind Harry Kane, in Michael Olise, Kingsley Coman, and Serge Gnabry. It's a talented group of players, but in combination they don't always function and sometimes their individual impact has been lost under the weight of all the positional rotations. A host of changes for Bayern Munich from their final group-stage defeat as Vincent Kompany restores his team back to full strength — here is how the Germans line up at Hard Rock Stadium: The all new Club World Cup was designed by FIFA and jewellery brand Tiffany & Co, and unveiled by Infantino alongside U.S. president Donald Trump. These tournaments are all about the shared experience — and we would love to hear from you throughout this Club World Cup. We're already looking forward to reading what you've got for us. Well, it's not an exact art but each day at The Athletic we have compiled our power rankings of each team, taking a look at who's hot, who's not, and how the struggle for global club supremacy is shaking out. Here's a look at how things are shaping up: Club World Cup daily rankings: Manchester City seeks to tighten grip at top The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is a little different with 32 teams competing — when the previous 20 editions never brought together more than eight clubs each. Still, the legacy of those early years will continue and a host of famous names will be looking to add to their previous victories. Here are the most successful clubs in this competition's history: Here's how things looked in the table after all Bayern Munich's group C games... As for Bayern Munich, they came through the group stage but surprisingly did not top it as they lost to Benfica in their final group game. Here's how things looked in the table after all Flamengo's group D games... Flamengo have been something of a surprise package at the Club World Cup so far. They made it through to this stage of the competition after topping their group. Hard Rock Stadium was the site for the 2024 Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia, where Messi won his last international trophy. Argentina prevailed 1-0 in extra time, but the match was marred by a lack of crowd control that led to a near stampede outside the stadium's gates before kick-off. The Club World Cup is another opportunity for Hard Rock Stadium to prove it can host international football matches safely before the 2026 World Cup. Messi will be the main attraction, but major brands like Real Madrid and Boca Juniors will attract local fan groups and neutrals alike. If you're a soccer fan — and you love a plethora of other sports too — there is no better place to follow all your favourite teams, leagues, and players than with The Athletic.

Our 2025 Club World Cup coverage continues today with a clash of two intercontinental titans: Bayern Munich and Flamengo. The latter has been something of a surprise package in this tournament after topping their group, while Bayern Munich will be disappointed with their second-place group standing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ATLANTA — What we thought would happen between Inter Miami and Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup did happen. Not even Lionel Messi, the greatest to ever play, could help David in this matchup against Goliath. Once upon a time, Messi was bigger than Goliath. He may still be on his best day. Just not on this day, in his first match as a 38-year-old. Paris Saint-Germain 4, Inter Miami 0 on Sunday, June 29, in front of 65,574 fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. PSG's João Neves scored twice (6' and 39'), Inter Miami's Tomás Avilés was credited with an own goal (44') and Achraf Hakimi put the game away before the halftime whistle (45'+3') to eliminate Inter Miami from the round of 16 at the Club World Cup. The fans cheered every moment he touched the ball, patiently waiting for him to deliver the majestic Messi moment he has countless times in his legendary career. Messi nearly did several times, including a free-kick opportunity in the 88th minute with all eyes and cell phone cameras on him. Sadly, he kicked it into a wall of PSG players. Messi kept his emotions in check, but you could see his helplessness every time he looked down after looking up at the scoreboard in the first half. Chants of "Messi, Messi" rang loudly in the 63rd minute, and he nearly answered the call – sprinting his way toward a shot from his left boot that skid right into the PSG goalkeeper's hands. PSG is clearly the world champion for a reason, while Inter Miami is a club whose youth is too inexperienced, and its aging stars on the other side of their primes. PSG players showed a mastery of being able to get the ball from midfield into the goal area with ease, while Inter Miami players were often turned around trying to catch up. But he was mugged by PSG's Fabián Ruiz just outside the goal area midway in the first half. PSG started a three-man weave that would make Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich proud: Bradley Barcola pounced on the steal, dropped it off to Ruiz, and he found Neves with their third pass in the goal area, and PSG's second goal of the match in the 39th minute. Even Messi was a step slow on a give-and-go with Marcelo Weigandt early in the second half. Inter Miami earned at least $21 million for participating, winning a match with two draws in the group stage, and advancing to the Round of 16 in the Club World Cup. They pulled off North America's first win against a club from Europe when they beat FC Porto from Portugal behind an epic free kick goal from Messi just 10 days ago. They were outclassed and outmatched 10 days later.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid face another delay in their transfer push to sign Alvaro Carreras after the FIFA Club World Cup. Xabi Alonso has hit pause on any transfer moves during the tournament as he looks to focus on winning a title in North America. The former Spain international secured deals for Premier League duo Dean Huijsen and Trent Alexander-Arnold before flying out to the USA for a combined total of around £60m. A move for Carreras is expected to form part of a new-look defensive unit under Alonso, with Trent at right back and Huijsen centrally, as Carreras comes in on the left-side. Benfica's decision to include Carreras in their tournament squad, caused some concern over the status of the transfer, but it was ultimately viewed as a power play from Lisbon. Club legend Rui Costa and head coach Bruno La teamed up to fire a message of no deal being done over the 22-year-old. Neither wanted to discuss an exit during the Club World Cup and remained steadfast on what they would request to sanction a sale. Benfica's last 16 exit at the hands of Chelsea on June 28 will be key in Real Madrid's drive for Carreras. Like all players competing in the USA, Carreras will now head off on a summer break, as sanctioned by player unions ahead of the 2025/26 season. That could push the final confirmation of his move to the Spanish capital to late July where he will join up for the final stages of preseason training in Valdebebas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USA came out of the group stage undefeated while Costa Rica finished with two wins and a draw. Before that, the U.S. faces a tough Costa Rican side. Here's everything you need to know about the quarterfinal matchup: The Gold Cup roster with 16 average caps was relatively inexperienced when announced; however, it created an opportunity for players to stake their National Team claim. Several players, namely, Malik Tillman, Diego Luna and Patrick Agyemang are making the most of their moment in Concacaf's premier tournament. Tillman made his first USMNT appearance in 2022 and has made quite the impression heading into next year's FIFA World Cup. Meanwhile, Luna and Agyemang debuted earlier this year and have taken full advantage of the Gold Cup to show their value. Tillman opened the first group match with a brace, netting his first-ever goals, and Luna recorded two assists in a 5-0 dominant win against Trinidad and Tobago. “His career speaks for itself,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “The levels that he's played at, the experience that he has with an even younger group now, I think that they're bringing in a lot of players for a new generation in Costa Rica, he's obviously the leader of that team.” The U.S. has faced Navas several times, including in a 2022 World Cup Qualifying match where Los Ticos won 2-0. With Navas in goal, Costa Rica has beaten the United States three out of five meetings. USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino is uniquely familiar with Navas' abilities. “His mentality and his quality as a keeper, it's going to be a fantastic moment to share tomorrow with him. The Americans scored eight goals and only conceded one. Costa Rica beat Suriname 4-3, the Dominican Republic 2-1 and tied Mexico 0-0. USA midfielder Malik Tillman and Costa Rican forward Manfred Ugalde both have tallied three goals each, which is tied for the most in the tournament among teams yet to compete in the knockout round. However, Ugalde will be unavailable for Sunday's match after drawing a second yellow card against Mexico. In the group stage, several Costa Rica players were shown yellow cards. Ugalde and Mora accounted for four of Costa Rica's six goals in the group stage. Midfielders Diego Luna, Tyler Adams and Sebastian Berhalter were also issued one yellow card each. They're at risk of a semifinal suspension if another is picked up in the quarterfinal. Only Mexico, the USMNT's biggest rival, has been a more common opponent with 76 games. Forward Patrick Agyemang scored his second international career goal in his second cap to lead the United States to a 3-0 win. They've faced off in the Gold Cup six times with a 7-0-1 record, advantage USA. All but one of those came in the group stage.</p>

Resting up to play in a record sixth World Cup was more important to Cristiano Ronaldo than switching teams to play in the Club World Cup.

"I had some offers to play (Club) World Cup but I think it didn't make sense because I prefer to have a good rest, a good preparation, because this season will be very long, because this is the season of the World Cup, at the end of the season," Ronaldo said in an Instagram video posted by his Saudi Arabian club, Al Nassr, after signing a two-year extension. "So I want to be ready not only for Al Nassr but also for the national team."

The 40-year-old Ronaldo helped Portugal to the Nations League trophy with a penalty shootout win over Spain three weeks ago as speculation swirled that he would transfer to another club to play in the Club World Cup currently being contested in the United States.

He and longtime Argentina rival Lionel Messi could be the first players to appear in six World Cups at next year's tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

In Qatar three years ago, Ronaldo became the first male player to score at five World Cups.

The five-time Ballon d'Or winner's extension with Al Nassr means he will play on until at least the age of 42.

U.S. Men's National Soccer Team star Timothy Weah has opened up about what he described as the “weird” experience of standing behind Donald Trump in the Oval Office while the president fielded questions on the Iran-Israel war and attacked the idea of transgender women competing in women's sports.

Weah was at the White House with his Juventus teammates on Wednesday as part of a promotional event for the FIFA Club World Cup, ahead of the Italian side's 5-0 victory over the United Arab Emirates' Al-Ain FC.

Trump invited questions from reporters about the game and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which the U.S. will host alongside Mexico and Canada.

But the Juventus players stood uncomfortably behind POTUS as he instead answered queries about the more pressing political questions of the day.

Weah, the son of former Liberian soccer star-turned-former president George Weah, later told reporters that the players had been made to attend the event.

“They told us that we have to go and I had no choice but to go,” he explained, reported The Athletic.

“I was caught by surprise, honestly. It was a bit weird,” he added. “When he started talking about the politics with Iran and everything, it's kind of like, I just want to play football, man.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo recently penned a new deal with Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr. Ronaldo's current deal was set to expire in June and had been linked with a move away from the Saudi Pro League club for some time. That played a major role in Ronaldo deciding to renew his deal with Al-Nassr. Cristiano Ronaldo has just won the UEFA Nations League with Portugal. He is now aiming to claim the only missing major title from his trophy cabinet, the FIFA World Cup. He boasts a record of 93 goals and 19 assists in 105 appearances for the Saudi Pro League club so far.

It's a blockbuster FIFA Club World Cup clash at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta today as Inter Miami GOAT Lionel Messi faces off against his old club PSG. We'll also explain how to use a VPN if the match isn't available where you are, along with a full match list. Despite his advancing years, the Argentine legend has been in fine form during this tournament, with the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner looking particularly in Miami's 2-1 win over Porto. Today's match against the new European champions looks set to provide a sterner challenge for Miami, however the Parisians shock defeat to Botafogo in their second match should give Messi and co hope of pulling off a major upset.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Published by striking workers at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Like many preteen girls across southwestern Pennsylvania at the time, Meghan Klingenberg had been anxiously anticipating the night of July 10, 1999. Before heading out from their Gibsonia residence to see Justin Timberlake and his bandmates take to the stage at Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre — as it was then known — in Burgettstown, the Klingenberg family had some additional business on their agenda. The United States Women's National Team was set to square off in the 1999 Women's World Cup final against China with more than 90,000 soccer fans in attendance at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., and many more tuned in on televisions across the country. “I think my friend was like, ‘When are we leaving? “My whole family was like, ‘Girl, sorry, we ain't leaving until this is over. We ended up watching Brandi Chastain hit the final [penalty kick], make it, win, and then after that we went to the *NSYNC concert. “We actually ended up making it because *NSYNC came on so late,” she added. It wouldn't be too long before Klingenberg was making history of her own on the world's stage. Once a rabid fan, Klingenberg played every minute for the same U.S. Women's National Team she grew up idolizing on its run to the 2015 Women's World Cup title before becoming a full fledged Portland, Ore., sports icon, winning championships with National Women Soccer League's Thorns in 2017 and '22. The Pine-Richland product — who helped the Rams win a PIAA title in 2005 — wrapped up an illustrious playing career by retiring earlier this month. She made the announcement official in an Instagram post. It was a bittersweet moment for a player who rose to prominence on southwestern Pennsylvania's soccer pitches, who won two NCAA Division I women's soccer championships at North Carolina and got to have the local sports memory of a lifetime when she waved a “Terrible Towel” on the turf at Heinz Field (now Acrisure Stadium) after scoring a goal in an exhibition match with the U.S. Women's National Team in 2015. “Those moments are just so lovely and special but, for me, if I was only playing for those moments I would have quit a long time ago,” Klingenberg said. “There's really not enough of those moments to sustain you. To me, it was about the friendships that I got to make with [former U.S. Women's National Team players] Becky Sauerbrunn and Megan Rapinoe and people like that who have become really great friends. “It's the thing that you never really expect, but it really does become so intertwined in the fabric of your life,” she added of soccer. While soccer would eventually take her around the world, Klingenberg said her love of the game was rooted in humble beginnings. My cousins, they started playing soccer in the backyard, and I was, like, ‘What is this?' “I remember running over to my parents and being like, ‘Is it OK if I just stick with softball?' It became my favorite sport pretty quickly, and I would have just such a blast with my friends playing it.” By the time she got to Pine-Richland High School, then-Rams coach Jodi Chmielewski said Klingenberg had become a force to reckon with on the WPIAL soccer scene. “At the level when I got her, I definitely think everyone knew that she had Division I potential at that point,” said Chmielewski, who won more than 300 games, two WPIAL championships and a PIAA title during her 21-year tenure at Pine-Richland. Chmielewski said her drive to succeed was nearly unparalleled among players she coached. “She was just so dynamic on the field,” Chmielewski said. And that was certainly the case at North Carolina. Klingenberg scored 18 goals, with 24 assists, during her four-year career in Chapel Hill. Although she played several positions under legendary coach Anson Dorrance, Klingenberg eventually settled in as a left back in the Tar Heels defensive unit. Obviously, there are a lot of national team players that ascended because of their extraordinary talent, but Meghan ascended because of her extraordinary will, not because she was blessed with every conceivable quality. She did it by working on her skill set, mastering the ball. “Carolina was such an amazing experience all around,” she said. “School, soccer, socially, everything about it, I loved. “I did finally feel free to be my authentic self,” she said. That environment, it wasn't looked down upon. Klingenberg was part of NCAA championship teams in 2008 and 2009 at North Carolina and won three Atlantic Coast Conference titles. She said getting to build a relationship with Dorrance — who also coached the U.S. Women's National team from 1986 until 1994 and won a World Cup in 1991 — was critical to her development. “One of the best things that he did in the culture was let everyone know how much he cares about you,” Klingenberg said. Dorrance said he is proud of the player and person Klingenberg has become. “I just think she had an absolutely extraordinary ascension but, also, a career. The other thing about Meghan is I just really liked her. Klingenberg said making the U.S. Women's National team was a dream come true. “I don't think that there's ever been another team in the history of soccer or sport that has been so successful over such a long period of time,” said Klingenberg of the U.S. Women's National team. Such success has also brought about ways for members of the U.S. Women's National team to create positive change in their communities. From championing equal play for women in professional sports to creating awareness of LGBTQ issues in American society, U.S. Women's National team players have been at the forefront of activism over the past several decades. For Klingenberg, dealing with mental health issues and the various stressors, which come along with competing a high level have also been critical to her as a professional athlete. “It creates a different kind of bond with somebody because it's not something that most people get to experience in their lifetime.” Klingenberg is also a 10-year veteran of the NWSL, playing two seasons with the Houston Dash, before starring for eight years in Portland. She logged 11,619 minutes with the Thorns and started 135 of her 149 appearances. In addition to Portland's two NWSL championships during her tenure, Klingenberg's teams finished with the league's best regular-season record twice before her final professional contest in 2024. “She's a role model in Portland for all of her years with the Thorns,” Chmielewski said. “I think it's pretty cool for her to have an impact on the game in so many different areas of the country.” There's no doubt, though, the impact Klingenberg has had on soccer in her hometown. She's created fans around the world and with young female players it's been great for our area for her to be the first really female player to achieve that success at that level. Our hope is there's many more to follow her.” Klingenberg said she is going to take the next year to evaluate her next steps and what her future might hold. At just 36, Klingenberg said she has plenty more in store. U.S. Soccer, though, launched a new podcast June 9, which is hosted by David Gass and co-hosted by Klingenberg and Alejandro Bedoya. “If there is anything that people take from my career, I truly hope that being yourself and just being you, you're doing the very best thing that you could possibly do for your performance and your mental health,” she said. Dorrance said he could see Klingenberg succeeding as a broadcaster or in coaching. “Meghan worked hard and then earned absolutely everything she got.” John is a copy editor and page designer at the Post-Gazette, but he's currently on strike.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's clear that Jurgen Klopp did not have anything nice to say about the expanded FIFA Club World Cup. The 2025 Club World Cup, which is being hosted by the United States, started earlier this month and is set to conclude on July 13. Whoever wins it will be the worst winner of all time because they'll have played all summer and then gone straight back into the league,” Klopp said. “There are people who have never been involved in the day-to-day business of football and are now coming up with ideas,” he added. Klopp, who was at the helm for Liverpool from 2015-24, also pointed out that players today do not get enough time to rest, saying that adding another tournament could be dangerous for their health. I fear that next season we will see injuries like never before. If not then, they'll come during or after the Club World Cup,” Klopp said. The 58-year-old added: “There's no real recovery for those involved, neither physically nor mentally.” When asked if he was interested in a potential return to coaching, Klopp shut down the idea, saying that  his new job “fufills” him. “I have a job now that fulfils me and is also intense.</p>
