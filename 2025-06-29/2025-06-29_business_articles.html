GOP Tax Bill:

North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis said he won't seek reelection following a primary threat from President Donald Trump.

“As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven't exactly been excited about running for another term,” the Republican said in a statement Sunday. “It's not a hard choice, and I will not be seeking reelection.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, N.C., will not run for re-election when his term is up, he announced Sunday, hours after he voted against advancing President Donald Trump's tax bill and drew the president's ire. "As many of my colleagues have noticed over the last year, and at times even joked about, I haven't exactly been excited about running for another term," Tillis said in a statement. "That is true since the choice is between spending another six years navigating the political theatre and partisan gridlock in Washington or spending that time with the love of my life Susan, our two children, three beautiful grandchildren, and the rest of our extended family back home," he said. Tillis' announcement is likely to spur a competitive — and costly — election in the key battleground, where Trump had already said he would explore supporting a primary challenger to the two-term senator. Tillis has been an outspoken critic of Trump's megabill, and he voted against advancing the package in a key late Saturday vote, making him one of two Republicans to do so. After Tillis' "no" vote,Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the North Carolina Republican. "Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against "Senator Thom" Tillis," Trump wrote. "I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks, looking for someone who will properly represent the Great People of North Carolina and, so importantly, the United States of America," he continued. Tillis' seat, which he has held since 2014, has also been a target for Democrats in next year's midterms eager for a pick-up opportunity. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Insiders at artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia have dumped more than $1 billion in stock over the last year, according to a report from the Financial Times. About $500 million worth of sales occurred over the last month as the market notched new highs and shook off geopolitical tensions that had rattled investors, according to the report. The stock is up more than 17% this year despite concerns over curbs limiting AI chip sales overseas and 44% over the last three months. Securities filings revealed that the tech titan recently unloaded about $15 million worth of shares as part of his more than $900 million plan announced in March to sell up to 6 million shares through the end of the year. Huang's net worth totals about $138 billion, placing him as 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That helped the chipmaker regain its seat as the most valuable company ahead Microsoft and Apple. Last year, Huang unloaded more than $700 million in Nvidia shares as part of a prearranged plan. A spokesperson for Nvidia declined to comment on the report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said that Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has "to do the right thing" if he is elected mayor of New York City, or he could see federal funding dry up. "Let's say this, if he does get in, I'm going to be president and he's going to have to do the right thing, or they're not getting any money," Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo during an interview that aired Sunday. "He's got to do the right thing," Trump said. It's not the first time that Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding for local politicians, particularly those in blue states, whose positions he opposes. He's previously threatened to strip federal funding from California over Gov. Gavin Newsom's policies towards transgender athletes participating in women's sports. While Trump took particular aim at Mamdani, the 33-year-old who defeated former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the first round of the city's Democratic mayoral primary last week, he also made a wider funding threat to all New York City mayoral candidates. "I can tell you this, whoever's mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves, or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially," Trump told Bartiromo. Trump has repeatedly called Mamdani — who is a Democratic socialist — a communist, as he did during the interview on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Monday, Chinese technology giant Baidu plans to make its Ernie generative AI large language model open source, a move by China's tech sector that could be its biggest in the AI race since the emergence of DeepSeek. That's a question which divides AI experts. One big change is that Baidu wasn't always on the open source bandwagon. "Baidu has always been very supportive of its proprietary business model and was vocal against open-source, but disruptors like DeepSeek have proven that open-source models can be as competitive and reliable as proprietary ones," Lian Jye Su, chief analyst with technology research and advisory group Omdia, previously told CNBC. Now that Baidu has made the decision to open source, even if it isn't a DeepSeek moment, it is an important one for the global AI race. "This isn't just a China story. Every time a major lab open-sources a powerful model, it raises the bar for the entire industry," said Sean Ren, associate professor of computer science at the University of Southern California and Samsung's AI Researcher of the Year. Ren says Baidu's move puts pressure on closed providers like OpenAI and Anthropic to justify gated APIs and premium pricing. "While most consumers don't care whether a model's code is open-sourced, they do care about lower costs, better performance, and support for their language or region. Those benefits often come from open models, which give developers and researchers more freedom to iterate, customize, and deploy faster," Ren said. Other industry experts view an open source Ernie as potentially being even more disruptive to both U.S. and Chinese competitors when it comes to the price equation. "Baidu just threw a Molotov into the AI world," said Alec Strasmore, founder of AI advisory Epic Loot. "OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, all these guys who thought they were selling top-notch champagne are about to realize that Baidu will be giving away something just as powerful," Strasmore said, comparing Baidu's move to Costco creating Kirkland. Baidu said in March that its recent ERNIE X1 model delivers performance on par with DeepSeek's R1 "at only half the price." Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, hinted earlier this year that the roll-out would help developers worldwide in AI development. In the least, it's one more moment in time when investors have to analyze how cost dynamics in AI model access are changing quickly, and what it means that more applications can be built on top of "these dirt cheap models," Strasmore said. "Baidu is going to be seeding the world with Chinese AI models," he added. Making these AI tools more widely available is a notable development from Baidu, but "the news of Baidu going open source probably lands with a big thud," said Cliff Jurkiewicz, vice president of global strategy at Phenom, an applied AI company for the human resources sector. "Most people in the United States don't even know it's a Chinese tech company," he said. But it was almost too much work in the sense that people just wanted the thing to function correctly,"  Jurkiewicz said. "Android, out of the box, is plain and vanilla, so it has to be customized, and that's a real challenge," he added. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, wrote in a January Reddit thread about the issue, and in more recent Senate testimony has said an open source rollout may happen this summer. "While OpenAI has open-sourced models in the past, the company has generally favored a proprietary, closed source development approach," Altman said, acknowledging that may need to change. "[I personally think we need to] figure out a different open source strategy," Altman said. "Not everyone at OpenAI shares this view, and it's also not our current highest priority … We will produce better models [going forward], but we will maintain less of a lead than we did in previous years." In the May Senate appearance, Altman said, "We realize that we open AI can do more to help here. So we're going to release an open source model that we believe will be the leading model this summer because we want people to build on the U.S. stack in terms of closed source models. More recently, Altman posted that the release would be delayed, but still scheduled for summer. One advantage U.S. players maintain, according to Jurkiewicz, is that the Baidu release will encounter skepticism at the enterprise level, with many questions about security. "On the other hand, the big players — OpenAI's ChatGPT and Microsoft's Co-Pilot — are integrated with everything," Jurkiewicz said. Ren said while open source often conveys a sense of transparency, that doesn't necessarily translate into market trust. "Just because a model's weights are public doesn't mean we know what data it was trained on, whether consent was given, or if those data contributors were credited or compensated," Ren said. "If we don't address it now, we risk scaling systems that quietly extract value from millions of people without consent, credit, or compensation," Ren said.

Elon Musk slammed the US Senate's latest version of President Donald Trump's multi-trillion dollar tax bill Saturday, warning that the cuts to electric vehicle and other clean energy credits would be “incredibly destructive” to the country.

Musk, the chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, posted on his social media platform X about the bill, which the Senate advanced in a contentious vote late Saturday. Musk recently left Trump's side after working for several months as the head of Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo In April 2025, China imposed new export controls on seven rare earth elements and the permanent magnets derived from them — materials that form the foundation of modern life and modern warfare. Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones, wind turbines, and even data centers rely on high-performance magnets made from these critical minerals. By restricting their flow, Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it revealed America's and the rest of the world's dangerous vulnerability. Now, the consequences of those failures have grabbed us by the neck and are cascading across our commercial and defense sectors. Following the London talks, Washington and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six months. That leaves major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? And what happens when the six months are up? Ford recently halted production at its Chicago plant due to a magnet shortage — underscoring that even short-term supply interruptions have real consequences. Paper agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back. Dozens of companies in Europe and North America have described China's export license process as highly invasive — requiring firms to submit detailed production data, end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing photographs or documentation of their end users. Executives say the process amounts to "official information extraction." While firms are advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese substitutes. This isn't just licensing — it's competitive surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both disruption and data risk. Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010, China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama administration won a WTO case against China's export restrictions but wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation. The first Trump administration identified rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged. But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally commitments. The second Trump administration has returned with more aggressive measures, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet these measures, like China's six-month reprieve, still fall short of dislodging Beijing's grip. And crucially, the defense sector remains cut off, with no such licensing window available. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of "weaponizing" its control over key materials like rare earths, calling for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan. Brussels is now signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled, so the odds of Chinese retaliation — particularly against the EU — are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South Korea, and India more tightly into Washington's orbit — precisely what Beijing hopes to avoid. It produces 92% of the world's neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets — used in everything from submarines to Teslas. China subsidized processing, focused on global acquisitions across the supply chain, and scales up production much faster than the West can approve and issue permits for a single mine. U.S. sites like MP Materials' Mountain Pass and Round Top remain incomplete without downstream processing. But all this remains dwarfed by China's head start and longtime industrial command-and-control of the sector. In contrast, U.S. efforts and engagement on these sets of issues has been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and governance, important issues indeed, but delivering limited momentum of the critical mineral issues. Even recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain, for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those countries. The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time. But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China's licensing regime remains intact, its data demands unabated. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they gain traction. China is betting that America's internal divisions — between labor, industry, environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions — will prevent the kind of unified, sustained effort needed to compete. Escaping its grip will require more than mine permits and short-term funding. It demands a coherent, long-term strategy to build a complete supply chain that includes not only domestic capabilities but also reliable allies and partners. A successful and sustainable policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures on governance. It reveals whether the U.S. can finally focus and act, or whether it will retreat again into complacency. Beijing is betting it will be the latter. There is still time, but not much.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many of us already know the components of a healthy relationship — things like strong communication, total honesty, and unwavering commitment. But most people don't actually know what these qualities look like in practice. Even worse, they don't recognize it due to unhealthy habits like emotional numbing, suppression, or normalizing issues. If you find yourself answering "no" to all the questions, there's a chance you may be unhappy in your relationship, but not realize it. In relationships, conflict is both inevitable and necessary. Research on conflict resolution shows that when both partners believe a disagreement is solvable, they're more likely to find a way forward. If your answer to this question is "no," ask yourself: "What are we fighting for?" If the answer isn't the relationship itself, sit down together to discuss and reestablish what it really means to be a team. The healthiest relationships give you room to breathe. To laugh loudly, ugly cry, make a mess, and be weird. You deserve to be with someone who doesn't flinch when they're met with your most real, honest self. Great partners see this as a special privilege. It shouldn't feel like something that has to be "tolerated." In the early wooing stages, curiosity comes naturally. You want to know everything about each other — what they're thinking, how they see the world, what makes them tick. But later on, that curiosity can dwindle. Research asserts that curiosity is a fundamental tool for emotional intimacy. If your partner stops asking questions about your thoughts, feelings, or experiences, they'll never get to know the new versions of you that are born each and every day. A "no" to this question could suggest that your relationship is running on autopilot. Or do they dodge responsibility, get defensive, and turn the blame onto you? Research on conflict repair teaches us that even the smallest gestures — acknowledging a mistake, offering a sincere apology, or even using humor — can stop an argument from spiraling. If your partner never takes ownership, or if they consistently make you feel like the "difficult" one for bringing up a concern, it might be time to regroup and reconsider what's keeping you invested.
