                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democratic mayoral candidate denies Trump's accusation that he is communist while reaffirming push to tax wealthy Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to cut New York City off from federal funds if favored mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, “doesn't behave himself” should he be elected. Mamdani, meanwhile, denied that he was – as the president said – a communist. But he reaffirmed his commitment to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers while saying: “I don't think that we should have billionaires.” He's got to do the right thing or they're not getting any money.” “I don't think that we should have billionaires because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality – and ultimately what we need more of is equality across our city and across our state and across our country,” Mamdani said. Mamdani said the proposal reflected “a description of what we see right now”. “It is not to work backwards from a racial assessment of neighborhoods or our city. Rather, it's to ensure that we actually have an equal playing field.” But he has not been endorsed by many other prominent Democratic party figures, including the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, who said coolly after his win: “Obviously, there's areas of difference in our positions, but I also think we need to have those conversations.” Mamdani said on Sunday that he was looking forward to discussions with Hochul, saying: “Ultimately, my policies, my vision, it's driven by an assessment of what's actually happening.” Asked if he thought moderate Democrats were afraid of him, Mamdani said: “I think that people are catching up to this election. Asked about Mamdani's proposals to oppose his administration's immigration crackdown and to arrest Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu if he sets foot in New York, Trump said the mayoral candidate would “be very unsuccessful” on both counts. “And our campaign was for working people, bringing dignity back into those lives,” Mamdani said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Statement condemns comments made by London punk duo while police confirm investigation is under way The organisers of Glastonbury have said they are “appalled” by comments made by Bob Vylan after the punk duo appeared to incite violence, something the festival said went against its ethos of “hope, unity, peace and love”. Describing himself as a “violent punk”, the frontman of the duo, Bobby Vylan, said: “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that's the only language some people speak, unfortunately.” Their set, which was before that of the Irish rap trio Kneecap, was broadcast live on the BBC but has since been removed from its streaming services. A BBC spokesperson previously said some of Bob Vylan's comments were “deeply offensive”. A decision had been made before the Kneecap performance not to screen it live, due to fears it would breach “editorial guidelines” on impartiality. Meanwhile, Avon and Somerset police said the force was investigating both performances to see if any offences had been committed. Emily Eavis, the organiser of Glastonbury, issued a joint statement condemning Bob Vylan's words, writing: “As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism. “With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share, and a performer's presence here should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs. Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech or incitement to violence.” I said that Kneecap should not be given a platform and that goes for any other performers making threats or inciting violence. Wes Streeting earlier described the chanting as “appalling” and said the BBC and Glastonbury had questions to answer, but he also had strong words for Israel. Would I be celebrating or chanting for the death of Russian soldiers? I wish they'd take the violence of their own citizens towards Palestinians more seriously.” CMAT and the Libertines shouted “Free Palestine” during their sets – as did Gary Lineker at the end of his talk – while Joy Crookes, TV on the Radio, Sorry and Paloma Faith all had Palestinian flags or keffiyeh scarves on stage. During her set early Sunday afternoon, the musician Nadine Shah performed in front of a backdrop showing the destruction in Gaza. She told the crowd, many of whom were waving Palestinian flags: “I just don't like seeing people being killed.” Shah read an open letter from Artists for Palestine UK in support of the activist group Palestine Action, whom the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, has planned to proscribe as a terror organisation, if a Commons vote goes her way next week. It read: “Palestine Action is intervening to stop a genocide. But when speech crosses into incitement, hatred, and advocacy of ethnic cleansing, it must be called out – especially when amplified by public figures on prominent platforms.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending tariff discussions because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting Digital Services Tax.ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP/Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to broaden his list of demands on Canada to re-open trade talks, listing his past grievances about Canada's supply management policies that control production and imports of eggs, dairy and poultry. Mr. Trump made the comments in a pre-recorded interview with Fox News Channel host Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday morning. Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mr. Trump agreed earlier this month at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta. to negotiate an economic and security deal within 30 days. However, Mr. Trump abruptly announced on Friday that he was ending those talks because of Canada's plan to go ahead with collecting a Digital Services Tax (DST) from large multinationals such as Netflix and Amazon as of Monday, retroactive to 2022. Mr. Trump's statement on Friday had mentioned supply management, but said he was “terminating” all trade discussions with Canada because of the “egregious” DST. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump was asked about his plan to stop all trade discussions with Canada. “Until such time as they drop certain taxes, yeah,” he answered. “People don't realize, Canada is very nasty to deal with.” He then repeated his past objections with Canada's agricultural policies, which set high tariffs on imports above certain exempted levels. It really should, because Canada relies entirely on the United States. We don't rely on Canada,” he said. Opinion: Sixty years ago, a philosopher said Canada would be absorbed by America. Joel Kaplan, the chief global affairs officer for Meta, praised Mr. Trump on X Friday for calling off trade talks with Canada because of the DST. “Thank you, President Trump, for standing up for American tech companies in the face of unprecedented attacks from other governments,” he wrote. Unifor National President Lana Payne, who is a member of the Prime Minister's Council on Canada-U.S. Relations, responded online by saying the President keeps changing what his issue is with Canada. “First he said it was about fentanyl and the border. Now it's our tax system - which other countries and sovereign nations do,” she wrote on X Friday. “There is no rational consistent objective other than to break us. And as for the tech bros needing protecting from a little tax. The report said that about half of all European countries have either announced, proposed or implemented a DST.

This is a developing story… Please check back for possible updates… Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. The updated bill text was released late Friday. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) voted with Democrats against considering the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which U.S. President Donald Trump wants to sign by July 4, or Independence Day. It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities. This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.” Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) pointed out Saturday that “while Republican senators are securing baubles and trinkets for their political donors, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has confirmed that the Senate bill will cut $930 billion from Medicaid.” That preliminary analysis doesn't account for other attacks on healthcare, including the Affordable Care Act. “Just as before, these cruel cuts to Americans' healthcare will strike a mortal blow to rural healthcare, and threaten the health and safety of kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities, and working families across the country,” Wyden warned. I urge Republican senators not to travel down this dangerous path: there is no band-aid that can heal these dangerous, deadly cuts.” It's 2AM on a Sunday and I'm heading to the Capitol to FORCE a full reading of the Republicans' 940-page bill.This bill will rip health care coverage away from 16 million people and cut food assistance.It's sick. Musk, meanwhile, also took to X to blast the package, criticizing the proposed taxes on wind and solar projects: “The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country! While celebrating the 51-49 procedural vote — and specifically praising Sens. ), and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) for their crucial support — Trump lashed out at both Paul and Tillis on his Truth Social platform Saturday, threatening the latter with a primary challenge. Politico reported that “Vice President JD Vance arrived at the Capitol shortly after 8:00 pm to break a possible tie,” with Johnson, Paul, and Tillis having already voted “no.” Johnson changed his vote after negotiations that involved Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D. Lee had tried to slip a rewritten version of the measure back into the package after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled against it earlier this week.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The bill bars agents from wearing facial coverings during enforcement unless medically necessary or required for safety. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Congresswoman Nydia Velázquez on Saturday held a rally outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in New York City to promote her recently introduced No Masks for ICE Act. “We would never accept it if the NYPD operated in masks without names or badges — and we shouldn't accept it from ICE either,” Velázquez (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, referring to the New York Police Department. “Immigrant communities are left wondering if they're being arrested or kidnapped. As the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) works to deliver on Republican President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations, federal agents, including those with ICE, have taken immigrants into custody while wearing masks and plain clothes — sparking alarm over abuse by anonymous agents and also copycat criminals. Velázquez's bill would bar ICE agents from wearing facial coverings during immigration enforcement, unless medically necessary or required for safety. Immigrant rights advocates, legal experts, and Congressman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) also joined the rally. He noted in a statement that “the past few months we've seen a disturbing pattern: masked, plain-clothes agents ambushing immigrants outside courtrooms and on city streets.” “If their operations are legitimate and above-board, why is there a need for anonymity, and why don't they need warrants to come onto private property?” Nadler asked. “This bill will put an end to those intimidation tactics, restore transparency, and ensure the public knows exactly who is wielding federal power in our communities.” The rally was held at 26 Federal Plaza, a 41-floor building in Lower Manhattan that houses an ICE field office and one of New York City's immigration courts. Earlier this month, NYC Comptroller Brad Lander — then a Democratic mayoral candidate — was arrested by federal agents while escorting a defendant out of immigration court at the building. The Times also noted a letter to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem signed by nine of the state's Democratic members of Congress — Nadler and Velázquez plus Reps. Yvette Clarke, Adriano Espaillat, Dan Goldman, Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Ritchie Torres—who want to conduct oversight of the field office, which they argue is a detention facility. Following the introduction of Velázquez's bill, two Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced the No Secret Police Act, which would require all law enforcement officers and DHS agents to clearly display identification and their official badges when detaining or arresting people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're someone who clicks on an article about political engagement, you're probably a person who likes keeping up with the news. A middle group of 31% has people who say they follow major developments but don't seek them out. Those fault lines are key to understanding American politics. President Donald Trump scored better on immigration among voters who hadn't heard as much about specific, high-profile detentions or deportations. Those at either end of the ideological spectrum are the mostly closely plugged in: Fifty-one percent of those who call themselves very liberal and 47% of those who say they're very conservative fall into this group, compared with 35% of those who call themselves only somewhat liberal, and fewer than 3 in 10 who say they're moderate (29%) or somewhat conservative (22%). Robert Timm, a 75-year-old Democrat from Ukiah, California, has a daily routine: He starts his day reading the latest headlines on Yahoo, frequently talks politics with his wife, and ends the evening watching the news on television, particularly MSNBC. Many of those concerns center on Trump, who Timm says is “obviously trying to do what he wants, regardless of how it affects the people in the country.” Older Americans are notably likelier to fall into this category: Fifty-two percent of those older than 65 say they frequently seek out political news, compared with one-third or fewer among any younger age group. Those with college degrees and in wealthier households are also somewhat more likely than average to seek out the news, as are White Americans and men. Asked about a series of different issues, many have no trouble picking which party better aligns with their views. And a broad majority, 60%, feel that democracy is under attack. Among those paying less attention, nearly 40% say their views don't align with either party's across a majority of the issues they were asked about in the survey. Nearly 3 in 10 see little difference between Democrats and Republicans. “Honestly, I think they're the same,” said Tyler Ruth, a mother from Hilton Head, South Carolina, who participated in the poll. They don't have to worry about, ‘How am I going to make ends meet for a couple of days until I get paid? Nearly half of Americans who spend less time on politics say they don't see either party as capable of getting things done, 10 points higher than among the mostly highly engaged group, and just 37% see democracy as under attack. Americans younger than 45, people of color and those with lower household incomes are all relatively likely to say they follow politics only when necessary or not at all, as are people without college degrees. And although they're not making an effort to seek out political news, most aren't completely cut off from it, either. In the past, Ruth said, politics wasn't a top priority for her — she's juggling raising children with special needs while also attending college for social work. But after hearing about cuts to her children's care this year, she started following the news more closely, including efforts by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Department of Health and Human Services to build a database for tracking autism. Overall, those who did broke in favor of Trump, a finding that dovetails with recently released data highlighting the key role infrequent voters played in securing Trump's victory. And it may reflect Trump's strength last year in winning over voters who typically don't express much trust in the political system. “I'm not a party system fan at all,” said Peter Montes, a poll respondent from Conroe, Texas, who works in the oil and gas industry. “I think that the parties need to be abolished, and we need to reset.” While he doesn't consider himself an outright Trump fan, he sees the president as bringing a business-minded ethos to the political sphere in a way he hasn't seen since Ross Perot, and said he's been paying closer attention to the news since Trump returned to office this year. But looking ahead to future elections, he doesn't see many other politicians with similar appeal. Nor, this far out, is he especially excited for next year's midterms. “I'll see the news, but I'm not going to go and stalk the news out to figure out what's going on. The CNN poll was conducted among 2,539 adults nationwide by SSRS from May 5-26, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources — an address-based sample and a random-digit dial sample of prepaid cell phone numbers — and combined.</p>

CHOLPON-ATA, June 29. /TASS/. The collective West seeks after strategically defeating Russia, using the Kiev regime as a ram, but it will not succeed, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during talks with Kyrgyzstan's Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubayev.

"We see an unprecedented standoff our country against the collective West that decided again to wage a war against us and inflict a strategic defeat to Russia, essentially using the Nazi regime in Kiev as a ram," Lavrov said. "The West has never succeeded in that - they will not work it out this time also," the top Russian diplomat said.

The West "probably, starts figuring that out," Lavrov noted. Considering the current international situation, Russian Foreign Minister pointed to particular importance of close ties with Kyrgyzstan in all the areas.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Six police officers and two civilians were injured as a result of Saturday's violent protests in Belgrade, Serbia's police director Dragan Vailjevic said in an official statement, published by the Interior Ministry's press service. According to the official, violence broke out when one group of protestors tried marched towards another group, holding a separate rally. "Commanders of police units forming a cordon warned participants that they will not be allowed any further. This produced no effect, and an attack on police officers followed," he said. The police acted with a high degree of professionalism. Regrettably, six officers were injured, and reports about their condition are now being verified. They were admitted to a healthcare facility, and details about their wounds are yet unknown," the police director said. Nenad Stefanovic, the head of the Higher Public Prosecutor's Office in Belgrade,said earlier that all those responsible for attacks on police officers and governmental institutions will be identified and brought to justice. The rally in central Belgrade gathered around 36,000 participants, according to Serbia's interior ministry. Protestors clashed with the police, and riot control weapons were used to drive them away from several streets in the city center.</p>
