                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norris aiming to ‘deliver the same again next weekend' after victory in Austria ‘Every driver has made a mistake like that' – Verstappen on being knocked out by Antonelli Lando Norris returned to winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix after getting the better of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a head-to-head scrap for victory – title rival Max Verstappen having been eliminated in a first-lap incident. Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed. After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race. In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race. Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber's Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion. A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas. Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine. Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line. Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid. Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying. Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh. As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs. There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”. When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris. As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen's car – putting both drivers out of the race. Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. With Gasly's soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris' gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate? Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed. Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions. As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri's engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6. Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. I'm about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure. Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach. With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate's advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He's mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic. With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don't want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least. Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. However, Piastri's efforts to cut Norris' lead were hampered by traffic. From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto's feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate's championship advantage to 15 points. Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian's maiden F1 points finish. As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz's double elimination. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that's for sure. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well.</p>

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

Good things come in small packages, an aphorism of which you are constantly reminded staring out across the Red Bull Ring and down into the valley below.

This Mighty Mouse of a circuit never fails to deliver drama, and thanks to a Q3 spin for Pierre Gasly and consequent yellow flag, we have a grid for the Austrian Grand Prix that – other than perhaps Lando Norris on pole – isn't quite that which may have been predicted.

Oscar Piastri starts third behind Charles Leclerc, and the progress made by Ferrari's Austria upgrade was further underlined by Lewis Hamilton, starting fourth. Liam Lawson is carrying the flag on Red Bull's home turf, starting P6, one place above Max Verstappen.

Chris Medland picks out five key things to keep an eye on when the lights go out for the Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring.

From Lando Norris in dominant form to Ferrari showing signs of progress, and from a rookie chasing his first points to track limits being a major talking point, here are a five things to keep an eye on when the lights go out on race day at the Red Bull Ring…

Lando Norris arrived in Austria in a slightly tough spot, having collided with team mate Oscar Piastri last time out in Canada and losing further ground in the drivers' championship.

But it was only slightly tough because the Red Bull Ring is a track where Norris has been particularly strong in the past, securing his first podium in F1 here back in 2020.

Lando Norris and McLaren set the pace in final practice at the Red Bull Ring as drivers began to test the limits before Qualifying.

Lando Norris remained at the top of the timesheets during Saturday's final practice session for the Austrian Grand Prix, fronting a McLaren 1-2 over team mate Oscar Piastri.

Norris worked his way down to a best time of 1m 04.324s on soft tyres to edge out Piastri by 0.118s, followed by Red Bull's Max Verstappen and the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton.

Several drivers had wide moments and brushes with the gravel traps, including championship leader Piastri, who spent a few minutes in the garage midway through the session while mechanics checked for damage to his floor.

Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and World Champion Verstappen experienced slightly bigger scares, going for full 360 spins at the final corner but avoiding any barriers, while Yuki Tsunoda dropped his Red Bull exiting Turn 1.
