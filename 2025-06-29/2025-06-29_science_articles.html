                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They found that most modern-day Indian people's ancestry can be traced back to Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers. The researchers used data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India, Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD) and generated whole-genome sequences from 2,762 individuals in India, including people who spoke a range of different languages. They used these data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of India over the past 50,000 years at fine scale, showing how history impacts adaptation and disease in present-day Indians. They showed that most Indians derive ancestry from populations related to three ancestral groups: Neolithic Iranian farmers, Eurasian Steppe pastoralists, and South Asian hunter-gatherers. "In India, genetic and linguistic variation often go hand in hand, shaped by ancient migrations and social practices," says lead author Elise Kerdoncuff of UC-Berkeley. "Ensuring linguistic variation among the people whose genomes we include helps prevent biased interpretations of genetic patterns and uncover functional variation related to all major communities to inform both evolutionary research and future biomedical surveys." One of the key goals of the study was to understand how India's complex population history has shaped genetic variation related to disease. In India, many subpopulations have an increased risk of recessive genetic disorders, which is due largely to historical isolation and marrying within communities. For example, some of the genes inherited from these archaic groups have an impact on immune functions. "One of the most striking and unexpected findings was that India harbors the highest variation in Neanderthal ancestry among non-Africans," says co-lead author Laurits Skov, also of UC-Berkeley. "This allowed us to reconstruct around 50% of the Neanderthal genome and 20% of the Denisovan genome from Indian individuals, more than any other previous archaic ancestry study." As more ancient genomes become available, the researchers will be able to refine this work and identify the source of Neolithic Iranian farmer and Steppe pastoralist-related ancestry in contemporary Indians.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PTEN Connection to Autism: Up to 25% of those with brain overgrowth and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) carry variations in a gene called PTEN; PTEN-deficient mouse models exhibit ASD-like characteristics Cell-type Specific Model: PTEN loss in specific neurons leads to circuit imbalance and altered behavior Excitation-Inhibition Imbalance: Strengthened excitatory drive and loss of local inhibitory connections in an amygdala circuit Behavioral effects: This circuit imbalance results in increased fear learning and anxiety in mice -- core traits seen in ASD. Researchers at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience have discovered how loss of a gene strongly associated with autism and macrocephaly (large head size) rewires circuits and alters behavior. PTEN has emerged as one of the most significant autism risk genes. To investigate the impact of PTEN misregulation, researchers have turned to animal models, where global reduction of PTEN results in altered sociability, repetitive behaviors, and increased anxiety that are often associated with ASD in humans. But understanding how PTEN dysfunction results in specific circuit and behavioral changes has been difficult in animal models that disrupt PTEN throughout the nervous system. Therefore, MPFI research group leader Dr. McLean Bolton and her team have focused on the changes in the central lateral amygdala driven by loss of PTEN in a critical neuronal population -- somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. Alterations in the function of inhibitory neurons in the development of ASD have been seen through both human tissue studies and genetic mouse models. "Although a cell-type specific disruption does not replicate the genome-wide changes seen in humans, it is essential to examine how genetic risk factors operate within distinct neural circuits," explained Dr. Bolton. "Understanding these mechanisms is a crucial step toward targeted interventions for specific traits such as severe anxiety." The team, led by Dr. Tim Holford, combined a genetic model that disrupted PTEN only in somatostatin-containing inhibitory neurons with a unique circuit mapping approach previously developed in the lab. "This is a powerful method that we can use to determine changes in local neuron connectivity and strength resulting from genetic variations. The results not only confirm that PTEN loss in this specific cell type is sufficient to induce specific ASD-like behaviors, but also provide one of the most detailed maps to date of how local inhibitory networks in the amygdala are affected by genetic variations associated with neurological disorders. Importantly, the altered circuitry did not affect all ASD-relevant behaviors -- social interactions remained largely intact -- suggesting that PTEN-related anxiety and fear behaviors may stem from specific microcircuit changes. As Dr. Holford explains, "By teasing out the local circuitry underlying specific traits, we hope to differentiate the roles of specific microcircuits within the umbrella of neurological disorders, which may one day help in developing targeted therapeutics for specific cognitive and behavioral characteristics. In future studies, we hope to evaluate these circuits in different genetic models to determine if these microcircuit alterations are convergent changes that underlie heightened fear and anxiety expression across diverse genetic profiles."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Simon Fraser University researchers are using a new approach to brain imaging that could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's disease. "Parkinson's is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and it is the most rapidly increasing, in terms of incidence," says Alex Wiesman, assistant professor in biomedical physiology and kinesiology at SFU. "Treating this disease, both in terms of helping people with their symptoms, but also trying to find ways to reverse the effects, is becoming more and more important. "If clinicians can see how levodopa activates certain parts of the brain in a patient, it can help to inform a more personalised approach to treatment." The study was a collaboration with researchers at Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who used MEG to collect data from 17 patients with Parkinson's disease - a relatively small sample size. Researchers mapped participants' brain signals before and after taking the drug, in order to see how and where the drug impacted brain activity. Using this rare brain imaging technology, Wiesman and team developed a new analysis that lets them "search" the brain for off-target drug effects. "With this new way of analyzing brain imaging data, we can track in real time whether or not the drug is affecting the right brain regions and helping patients to manage their symptoms," says Wiesman. "What we found was that there's sometimes 'off target' effects of the drug. "We found that those people who showed 'off target' effects are still being helped by the drug, but not to the same extent as others." Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning parts of the brain become progressively damaged over time. People with Parkinson's disease may experience a range of movement-related symptoms, such as tremors, slow movement, stiffness and balance problems. Wiesman hopes that a better understanding of how levodopa affects an individual's brain signals could improve how drugs are prescribed to treat Parkinson's. And this helps clinicians get at that question of how we prescribe personalized medicine in a way that really helps the patient. This new type of brain imaging analysis is not only for studying Parkinson's disease; any medications that affect brain signaling can be studied using the method developed by Wiesman and colleagues. "We have this really fantastic technology right here at SFU, and combined with the new analysis approaches that we're developing, it gives us a really unprecedented look into what's happening in the brain," says Wiesman. "We can use this technology moving forward to study Parkinson's disease in ways that no one has ever done before worldwide. "Ultimately, we want to make sure this technology is useful for a diverse population and more widely accessible to patients with Parkinson's disease."
