                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vin Diesel surprised a crowd on Saturday at FuelFest in Southern California, saying that the final film in the Fast & Furious franchise will hit theaters in April 2027. Diesel, who has starred in all but one installment since 2001's original, broke more news during his remarks onstage, confirming the film will be set in Los Angeles and that it will reunite Diesel's Dominic Toretto character with Brian O'Conner, the character played by Paul Walker. “Los Angeles needs it now more than ever… Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago… and now Fast will finally return home,” he wrote. There are currently no major films on the April 2027 release-date calendar. Notably, the most successful film in the franchise, 2015's Furious 7, was the only pic in the franchise to open in that month; it was the biggest opening frame for any F&F film with $147.2 million, on its way to a global gross of more than $1.5 billion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When “American Idol” season 23 winner Jamal Roberts performed in Atmore, Alabama, on June 14, 2025, he shared on social media how touched he was when the mayor presented him with a key to the city — an honor that many cities bestow on visiting celebrities and dignitaries. But when Roberts performs at the Blac & Noir Event in Laurel, Mississippi, in early August, he won't be accepting the same honor. During his Facebook Live, Roberts said that his upcoming show in Laurel, located minutes away from his hometown of Meridian, has been “booked forever.” Roberts said he'd heard nothing about being given a key to the city until June 27, when local event organizer Drake Paige posted on Facebook that Mayor Magee had approved the special honor. But his announcement was met with swift opposition from some in Laurel who took issue with Roberts receiving a key to the city, arguing that residents who have given back to the community in various ways have not received similar honors. The comment section quickly grew heated, many more people have posted, and Roberts said he'd been notified of death threats made against him. teacher said, adding, “I worked with kids before ‘American Idol' and it's crazy that … kids can comprehend (how to behave) more than grown folk. “I don't want it, respectfully,” Roberts further clarified in his video. Many people have shared encouragement for Roberts on social media amid the controversy, and disappointment over all the negativity, including one person who wrote, “Some of you all are about to break a record, THE MOST HATERS, UNDER ONE POST!! People just can't find anything else to worry about in their life. Like you say a key is not going to stop your journey. Laurel has a population of less than 17,000 but is well known as the locale of HGTV's hit show “Home Town” starring Erin and Ben Napier. It is also the real-life hometown of multiple celebrities including actress Parker Posey, NSync member Lance Bass, opera singer Leontyne Price, blues singer Sam Myers, and Olympic Gold Medal track star Ralph Boston. Toward the end of Roberts' June 27 Facebook Live, he said he'd been in Los Angeles working on new music all week. Despite the bump in the road with Laurel, he said the first single from his upcoming album would be a song that serves as his ode to his home state of Mississippi. “I'm (gonna) dedicate a song back to the state,” Roberts said. My first record I'm gonna drop is gonna be a song back to the to the state.</p>

[Editor's Note: The following article contains spoilers for “Squid Game” Season 3, Episode 6, “Humans Are…”] Unlike a different show that also happened to premiere this week, “Squid Game” didn't return from its breakout first season with a slew of famous new guest stars. Writer and director Hwang Dong-hyak had ample opportunity to cast just about anyone he wanted in Seasons 2 and 3, considering the seemingly limitless reach of Squid Game's organizers and the hundreds of new contestants brought in for the 34th competition (as well as the off-screen budget increase given to Netflix‘s global smash hit). But, despite enlisting plenty of Korean stars for the final episodes, “Squid Game” never turned into a celebrity-spotting game of its own; it wasn't inviting audiences to point at their televisions every few minutes, like the Leonardo DiCaprio meme from “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” as plenty of other blockbuster sequels do. Related Stories Unpacking That Bleak and Blistering ‘Squid Game' Ending ‘Squid Game' Review: Season 3 Brutally Embraces the Inevitable in a Dour, Damning Conclusion So as the series finale ticked down toward its closing credits, there was no reason for fans to expect a cameo — especially from two-time Academy Award-winning actor, Cate Blanchett. But there she is, playing ddakji in a Los Angeles alley against a dude who's clearly down on his luck, since she's busy slapping the absolute shit out of him. Well, even with proper context, the meaning behind Blanchett's appearance is a matter of minor debate. To set the stage, “Squid Game” Season 3 ends with the Front Man, Hwang In-ho (Lee Byung-hun), traveling to Los Angeles to deliver Seong Gi-hun's (Lee Jung-jae) personal effects to his daughter (including Gi-hun's remaining winnings, which In-ho took from their hotel hiding place and loaded onto a bank card). To fans, it's immediately clear what's happening: The woman is a Squid Game recruiter, and she's got a potential new player on the hook. In-ho finally reacts, but he doesn't give away much. He looks down, either in contemplation, disgust, or a mixture of both. Then the window rolls back up, and he drives off. The camera swings away from his car and back to Blanchett, as she wins another game. One last slap lands right as scene cuts to black. To some viewers, the cameo hints at how Netflix may choose to continue “Squid Game.” Perhaps a new season or spinoff series will focus on an American version of the games, with Blanchett's character playing the part of a pivotal recruiter. So far, the narrative has only acknowledged the South Korean edition, but now we're left to wonder how many there are and who else is running them. But Hwang Dong-hyak (via Netflix) has only spoken about Blanchett's cameo as an ending to the original series. “And as for why Cate Blanchett, she's just the best, with unmatched charisma. So we were very happy to have her appear. We needed someone who could dominate the screen with just one or two words, which is exactly what she did.” Hwang added that Blanchett was “amazing at playing ddakji” and “successfully flipped the ddakji on her first try.” But regarding its meaning beyond the series finale, well, he doesn't go there. “Personally, I interpret it as, despite all of the noble efforts of so many people, the world still continues as it was before,” Hwang said to Tudum, adding it's “truly an ending that fits the [show's] name.” Gi-hun's last words, right before he sacrifices himself to save an innocent baby, include, “We are not horses” — a direct address to the billionaires who've been betting on the Squid Games, demanding they recognize their shared humanity with the players. Even though he can't complete his final sentence — declaring, before he dies, whether humans are good or evil — his death speaks to the hope Gi-hun maintains for the future. But there's no reason to think the games will be different — or that they'll end differently — just because they're being held somewhere else. Until capitalism's oppressive grip on society ends, the Squid Games can't either. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Video's decision in early June to ditch Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino's classical ballet themed dramady Étoile after just one season sent shockwaves through the high-end drama community. Cast members Yanic Truesdale, Taïs Vinolo and Ivan du Pontavice put on a brave face as they touched down at the SCAD Lacoste Film Festival in France's Provence region this past week for a screening and Q&A, which was arranged prior to news of the non-renewal. “Of course it's a bummer, but at the same time, we're here to celebrate the fact that it existed,” said Franco-Anglo actor Pontavice. ‘Étoile' Canceled By Prime Video After Season 1 Of Two-Season Order He plays hot-headed French dancer Gabin Roux in the drama about two world-renowned New York and Paris ballet companies that decide to collaborate and share dancers to save their financially-struggling institutions. Canadian actor Truesdale, who plays ballet instructor Raphaël Marchand and right-hand man to Le Ballet National director Geneviève Lavigne (Charlotte Gainsbourg), echoed these sentiments. At a human level, the fact that we won't be able to hang out on set anymore is a big disappointment.” who is a long-time Palladino collaborator through his role as Michel Gerard in Gilmore Girls, expressed regret that the show had not been renewed for a second season. “I was very excited to see the second season because knowing Amy and Dan's writing, they set things in the first season, and then the second season, once everything is established, is really, when they start to fly with the material,” he said. Per Deadline's exclusive break on the non-renewal, the writing was on the wall for Étoile, after it failed to make it into Nielsen's weekly Top 10 for Originals on its release April 24, and also only briefly topped Prime Video's own top 10. It's like in the ballet world too. Ballet has been here for so long, but a lot of ballet companies that have potential cannot show that potential because of the financial aspect. This show did such a good job at showing that,” she said. Pontavice also suggested that contemporary audiences were no longer prepared to persevere with a show if it does not engage them immediately. “Even myself, if I watch a something, and I'm not invested after a couple of episodes, I quit watching it,” he said, adding that audiences would have been prepared to invest more time in getting to know a show a decade ago. “I always reluctant to make predictions about anything,” he said. “I never thought Gilmore would be still alive 25 years later but for me, this show is a love letter to art. I was hoping that love letter would be received on the other end, because I feel like art is under attack in America, and without art, we lose the essence of being human. “All the characters are so different, with different sensibilities… even if there is no second season, the show achieved a lot in terms of representation and identity,” she said. Portavice believes the first season will have a long tail: “Despite the disappointment and cancellation, judging by the positive reactions I've seen online in a very short amount of time, it's had a huge impact in certain communities already. “So even if we don't get that season two, I actually think that in a couple years people will look back to the show, and enjoy a lot of the things in it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Formula One movie — directed by Joseph Kosinski of Top Gun: Maverick fame and starring Brad Pitt zoomed to an impressive $55.6 million domestic opening and an estimated $144 million globally, well ahead of expectations in the first major theatrical win for Apple Original Films. Warner Bros. is distributing and helping Apple to market the big-budget summer tentpole, whose worldwide start includes a foreign opening of $88.4 million. Its global bow supplanted World War Z's $112 million to mark the biggest worldwide launch of Pitt's career, not adjusted for inflation. (On Friday, 58 percent of ticket sales were for premium auditoriums). How 'M3GAN 2.0' Star Violet McGraw Kicked Off a Wave of Good Fortune for Blumhouse F1, starring Pitt opposite Damson Idris, is a seminal moment for Apple as it tries to jump-start its theatrical ambitions after getting driven off the road with big-budget misses Killers of the Flower Moon, from Martin Scorsese, and Ridley Scott's Napoleon. Kosinski's pic boasts near-perfect exit poll stats from the audience, an A CinemaScore score and strong reviews. In the film, Pitt plays an injured former F1 driver who comes out of retirement to team up with a younger driver, played by Idris. Veteran producer Jerry Bruckheimer also worked on the big-budget pic alongside Pitt's team at Plan B. Taking on Formula One is a bold move since it has never been the marquee sport in the U.S. that it is overseas (top Apple exec Eddy Cue is a lifelong fan and sits on the board of Ferrari NV). F1‘s is also pacing well ahead of the racing pic Ford v. Ferrari, a biographical action drama set against the backdrop of Europe's famous Le Mans endurance contest. Starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale, that film opened to a decent $31.5 million. Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton was brought aboard to produce FI alongside Hollywood vet Jerry Bruckheimer, Kosinski, Pitt and Pitt's partners at Plan B, including Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner. Elsewhere, Blumhouse and Atomic Monster's horror pic M3GAN 2.0 flamed out with an estimated domestic opening of $10.2 million, only good enough for a fourth-place finish. The pic's global start was an equally disappointing $17.2 million. Jason Blum‘s Blumhouse — which has suffered a string of misses this year — and James Wan's Atomic Monster reteamed to make the follow-up. They had hoped the movie would serve as counter-programming for younger women who have to interest in F1. While M3GAN 2.0 skewed 53 percent female, simply not enough of the target audience showed up. Universal puts up the money for Blumhouse titles, in addition to marketing and distributing, but leaves creative decisions up to horror maestro Blum, the studio's longtime partner. M3GAN 2.0 is set two years after the AI doll went on a murder spree to protect her young human charge (Violet McGraw) and was subsequently shelved. Her creator (Allison Williams), the aunt of the young girl, is now a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of AI. Filmmaker Gerard Johnstone returned to direct the sequel from a story he wrote alongside Akela Cooper, and based on characters created by Cooper and Wan. Not all is lost for Universal as the live-action How to Train Your Dragon as it cleared the $200 million mark domestically. Pixar and Disney's troubled summer event pic Elio tumbled as much as 49 percent to 50 percent in its second weekend to an estimated $10.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $42.2 million. Elio came in third domestically, followed by M3GAN 2.0 and Sony's 28 Years Later, which likewise fell off sharply in its second weekend to an estimated $9.7 million for a 10-day domestic total of $50.3 million. Like Universal, Disney wasn't entirely bereft as summer live-action hit Lilo & Stitch crossed the $400 million mark domestically and $946 million globally in a massive feat. Lilo, the live-action update of the beloved Disney animated film, opened over Memorial Day weekend opposite Tom Cruise-starrer Mission: Impossible — The Final Reckoning, which finished Sunday with a global haul of $562 million for Cruise, Paramount and Skydance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump threatened to force journalists to reveal sources who leaked a Pentagon intelligence assessment that concluded the U.S. air strikes on Iran only set the nation's nuclear program back “months,” contradicting administration claims that the facilities were “obliterated.” “You tweeted the Democrats leaked an intelligence [report],” Sunday Morning Futures host Maria Bartiromo said to Trump in an interview. When Bartiromo asked “who, specifically” should be prosecuted, Trump did not name any names but said his administration would demand reporters reveal the sources of their reporting. If they want to, we can find out easily. BARTIROMO: You tweeted that Democrats leaked intelligenceTRUMP: They should be prosecutedBARTIROMO: Who specifically?TRUMP: We can find out. You go up and tell the reporter, 'national security, who gave it?' And I suspect we'll be doing things like that. Demanding reporters reveal confidential sources is a dangerous path that could quickly escalate to prosecuting reporters who refuse to disclose them. The report additionally stated that Iran had relocated a significant portion of its enriched uranium to classified locations before the U.S. attacks. “I think, first of all, it's very hard to do. Plus, we didn't give much notice because they didn't know we were coming until just, you know, then.” He has called the reports “fake news,” accusing the media outlets of having “[made] up a phony story to get some hits.” “The bomb went through [the nuclear facility] like it was butter, like it was absolute butter,” Trump said. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has said that the Department of Defense has launched “a leak investigation with the FBI right now because this information is for internal purposes, battle damage assessments.” “And that meant the end to their nuclear ambitions, at least for a period of time.” Marilyn Manson's U.K. Tour Opener Show Canceled Amid Protests From Officials and Online Senator ‘Misspoke' When She Falsely Claimed Zohran Mamdani Condoned ‘Global Jihad' 'The Bear' Season 4 Finale Leaves Us With Plenty to Chew On Since the strikes, Trump has called for Israel and Iran to make peace. “We basically have two countries that are fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” he said last week, frustrated that the two sides have not brokered a deal to stop the escalation. Trump is eager to claim victory in Iran and end the fighting, perhaps because he has his eye on snagging himself a Nobel Peace Prize, a longtime obsession.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a scorching July day in 2002, and Nicole and I are hauling ass in my VW Beetle across South Dakota. I'm driving; she's riding shotgun, eating a Slim Jim. Nicole grins at me, strips off her clothes, and springs onto the rock. She shakes her curls at me upside-down and says, “Now you.” I get undressed, climb up, and thrust my hips to the sky. In the summer of 2024, I began retracing our journey on a cross-country road trip, visiting people who could help me put the pieces together, trying to remember who Nicole was before everything went wrong, since a chance encounter with seven kids blew our lives apart, with a bullet ending one life and shattering countless others. Murder doesn't only happen to the person who dies. It's been two decades since the media took an incredulous phrase that fell out of Nicole's mouth — “What are you going to do, shoot us?” — and blamed her for her own death while capitalizing on it: The Village Voice called it “A Murder Made for the Front Page.” The New York Post covered the killer's trial gavel to gavel, while glossy magazines wrote about how not to let this happen to you. Things have been fucked up ever since the night when I sat in a Manhattan police station trying to comprehend that Nicole was dead, and I was not. That's what I'm on this trip to find out. Nicole DuFresne was born on Jan. 5, 1977, in Wayzata, Minnesota, a wealthy suburb west of Minneapolis. Nicole and her younger brother, Zach, both inherited their mother's looks, but Nicole took after her father when it came to temperament; she was a passionate, moody kid who would dominate on the soccer pitch and then write poetry in her bedroom. “I think she always felt like a little bit of an outsider, even in our family,” Zach DuFresne tells me when I visit him at his quiet suburban home in Colorado, “but she was totally unafraid to be herself.” Tom DuFresne wanted his kids to have the best of everything, but from a young age, Nicole bucked his attempts to insulate her with money. She started to work odd jobs that didn't conflict with her schooling. Laura Loomer Demands Trump Charge Mamdani Over Made-Up Terrorism Claim Cuomo Concedes to Zohran in New York City Primary: ‘He Deserved It. How the Zohran Mamdani Campaign Is Changing Influencer Culture She received counseling and later used the traumatic experience as inspiration for a two-woman play, Matter. I have a copy of the play with me on my cross-country travels. I keep returning to one line that articulates a familiar feeling: “In my dreams someone is waiting to eat me.” We bonded over the freedom we found in being filthy; our playacting felt like an antidote to what the world expected of us. She loved that I'd worked on an Alaskan salmon boat. I was mesmerized by her witchy hippie energy, lean kinetic body, and throaty laugh. We wrote a two-hander inspired by a book about CIA brainwashing experiments and hit the fringe-festival circuit in the summer of 2002. A reviewer at Minneapolis Fringe called us “feminists with an axe to grind.” We scrawled “Come see the axe-grinding feminists!” in chalk outside of every venue after that. We did better at other festivals — one critic said our show was “precisely the kind of art and passion that fringe theatre should be about.” Another called us “balls-out brave.” I'd always been reserved in my friendships, but Nicole refused to allow it. Nicole was thrilled by the energy of New York. She started developing a pilot with Jeffrey to pitch to the Food Channel (Nikki's New York), and launched herself into the downtown theater scene, painting sets at LAByrinth Theater Company while concentrating on her own undertakings with a group she'd co-founded with Emerson classmates. “I feel that I can be my absolute self [in New York] since there are so many different souls here,” she wrote in her journal. A year later, I made the trek from Seattle with my boyfriend, Scott Nath. We survived off cheap burgers and egg sandwiches from Mom's Diner, and $2 PBRs from Welcome to the Johnsons; we'd peer into the window of wd~50, the city's hottest new molecular gastronomy dining establishment, knowing we couldn't afford to even walk inside. Nicole and Jeffrey had us over for a welcome dinner, and she gave us a bag of weed mixed with lavender. “You'll need it,” she said with a laugh. She told me I should get new headshots; she'd just had hers done, and was insistent that we both had to step up our game. The following months were a glorious whirlwind of auditioning, acting, and writing. We laughed so much: I can still hear her bellowing “I have to pee like a horse!” as she charged into Cafe Mogador after being stuck on the L train for an hour. Reading through our notebooks, I'm struck by how relentlessly confident we were in ourselves, and each other. By the time we rang in 2005 at a warehouse party in a dilapidated former church — the kind of sweaty all-night revelry I'd always dreamed of going to — I felt like we could take over the world. Fleming struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age, according to court documents; he was diagnosed with a learning disability at the age of eight and enrolled in an individualized program by the Department of Education, but there's nothing on the record to indicate that he received any psychiatric help. In 2001, when he was 16, Fleming pulled a gun on truancy officers who picked him up for loitering. According to the police report, which designated him an emotionally disturbed person, he told arresting officers, “You should have shot me. I want to die.” He received a three-year prison sentence on a weapons charge and was sent to an upstate correctional facility more than 200 miles away. At an April 2004 parole hearing, he said prison had taught him to learn from his mistakes. That June, three days before his 19th birthday, Fleming was released on parole. Fleming had grown up close with Simmon's kids — Servisio, who was 21 years old, and Servano, who was 17 — and they were living there, too. Fleming's 18-year-old girlfriend, Ashley Evans, a well-liked high school cheerleader, also moved into the apartment. On the night of Jan. 26, 2005, Fleming, Evans, Servisio, and Servano, along with their 18-year-old cousin David Simmon, David's friend Kayshawn Boyd, 15, and Boyd's 14-year-old girlfriend, Tatianna McDonald, were hanging out at the apartment, smoking weed, drinking, and playing with Fleming's gun, which had been stolen from its legal owner in South Carolina in 2002. Servano thought the gun was cool, too; at one point, he and his brother played a mock round of Russian roulette without pulling the trigger. That same night, Nicole was working her first bartending shift at Rockwood Music Hall, a new venue on the Lower East Side. Scott and I met up with Jeffrey at the bar to celebrate her new gig; Nicole served us a couple of rounds, and when she finished her shift, the four of us went to a raucous hipster joint called Max Fish, where we ordered rum and cokes and played pinball. After a few hours at the apartment, Fleming and his friends were bored, so they went out to “start trouble,” McDonald later said. Chavez was wearing a white leather jacket that caught Fleming's eye. He chased after Chavez with David Simmon and Boyd, who punched him and demanded he give up the jacket, but after Fleming whacked him twice with his gun, Chavez managed to pull away and run into the street in front of a passing taxi. Chavez declined to file a police report and headed home. They got off back at the Delancey-Essex stop around 3 a.m. A surveillance camera outside Schiller's Liquor Bar captured the group walking east on Rivington toward Clinton. We had left Max Fish a few minutes earlier. We were buzzed, goofing around, pushing one another into snowbanks — oblivious gentrifiers on the home turf of seven friends out looking for a fight. When Evans heard us laughing as we crossed onto Clinton Street, her resentment flamed. “They were ex­tremely happy, so that made me even angrier,” she later told the police. Pissed off, she pointed us out to Fleming as the ones they should fight. By the time we rang in 2005 together at a warehouse party, I felt like we could take over the world. Murderer!” Nicole on her back in the street. My bare knees on cold grit as I kneel next to her. Then I'm in the back of a cop car, looking at Scott's crumpled face in alternating red and blue light. According to witnesses who later testified in court, Fleming stepped in front of us, pulled out his gun, and told us to give him our money. When Jeffrey tried to push past him, Fleming smashed him in the face with the gun, opening up a gash over his eye. Then, as Nicole went to check on Jeffrey, Fleming slammed me against a security gate with the gun. Nicole stumbled and fell into the street as they ran. Cops took us to the 7th Precinct station, where Scott and I waited in an interview room under buzzing fluorescents for what felt like hours until Jeffrey came back from the hospital and told us Nicole was dead. He went into another room to call her father. At some point, I remembered her message in a bottle. I got it down from my bookshelf and unfurled the scroll. “She died in my arms.” That was Jeffrey's heartbreaking statement to a reporter who tracked him down after a police bulletin about the shooting went out that day. Reporters were waiting at LaGuardia Airport for Tom and Linda DuFresne when they flew in from Minnesota to identify their daughter's body; members of the media camped out on our doorstep to snag a photo of Scott and me looking pale and shell-shocked. It was surreal to read tabloid accounts that the gun had been aimed at me too, that Scott thought he had heard it go off. Before internet ubiquity as we know it existed, the story of her death went viral; Nicole's face was on newsstands across the country, and every major media outlet showed up at her memorial. The Village Voice noted that “DuFresne is on her way to becoming one of New York's super-victims.” Surveillance videos and tips led to the seven friends being apprehended within days. The tabloids made hay in the wake of their arrests, branding them “thugs” and “fiends.” The report that our laughter had angered them was shocking; “Nicole Died for Smiling — ‘Slay' Creeps Picked on Happy Victim,” one article blared. A photo of Fleming sobbing in the back of a police car after his arrest ran under the headline “He Cries for Himself.” I hadn't heard Nicole say anything to Fleming, but police told reporters that bystanders had heard her say something to the effect of “What are you going to do, shoot us next?” When Evans was arrested, she said Nicole had been the aggressor, claiming that Fleming shot her only because he'd slipped after she pushed him. Evans was accused of taking the murder weapon back to the Simmon apartment, where police had found it hidden under a bed. Safety advocates said that Nicole's “defiant” stand had prompted Fleming to shoot her, and the National Crime Prevention Council circulated a memo on how to survive a mugging, advising potential victims to “stay cool and comply with robbers.” The Stranger, a Seattle alt-weekly, ran an anonymous letter addressing Nicole that read, in part, “It seems you misplayed your role as mugging victim. This was not street theater you were involved in. It was real-life drama, which you helped turn into a tragedy.… Your last words suggest you did not understand the material. I'm sad that you will not get another audition.” Cosmopolitan published a feature titled “How Not to Let Your Fearlessness Go Too Far” with tips on what not to do when held at gunpoint, next to a list of mistakes that Nicole had supposedly made. Richard Price wrote an acclaimed novel, Lush Life, in which he echoed her purported last words; after a long night of drinking, a would-be writer is gunned down when he makes the dumb decision to tell a mugger “Not tonight, my man.” An episode of Law & Order: Criminal Intent ripped the story from the headlines. In that version, it was the friends who'd set her up. Even after all of these years, the story has stuck. “She got in their faces,” one of the co-hosts says. “Like, just give them your purse … don't start an altercation.” Tears fill my eyes; I have to pull over. Fleming was an angry kid with a gun that he wanted to use. Maybe Nicole would be alive if our laughter hadn't filled Evans with rage, if Fleming had gotten the help he needed at school, if the gun had gone off when he pushed me instead. Her murder was a senseless act of violence. Speculating about a different outcome only intensified the pain. Fleming did not respond to multiple attempts to contact him for this article; neither did any of the other six friends, who would now all be in their thirties or early forties. I want to ask them how their lives have been since the night our paths crossed; what details have stayed with them; how their age and maturity have shaped the way they think about the events of that night. He'd exhibited bizarre behavior when he was arrested, mumbling, stuffing paper towels in his mouth, and going limp in the interview room. He was admitted to Belle­vue Hospital and held under observation for several months. In a pretrial hearing, Fleming's attorney, Anthony Ricco, told the judge that Fleming was mentally incompetent; evidently, he was hearing voices telling him not to eat and hallucinating a giant marshmallow man. However, a court-appointed psychologist and psychiatrist testified that Fleming had gained eight pounds while under observation and that his symptoms only appeared when he knew he was being watched. Although Fleming had “fewer resources than most individuals” to cope with the stress he was under, including a lack of family support, they believed he was feigning his symptoms. Fleming never appeared in the courtroom at his trial; he was removed before jury selection after an outburst that required several officers to restrain him. Assistant District Attorney Robert Hettleman called it a “well-timed action” for someone trying to avoid trial, and the judge agreed, ordering a CCTV video feed to be set up so Fleming could watch the proceedings from his holding cell. McDonald testified that Nicole's shooting was intentional: It had nothing to do with Fleming being pushed, she said. Scott and Servano Simmon also testified that Fleming had shot Nicole from an arm's length away. Jeffrey testified that, although the shock of being pistol-whipped had dazed him, his memory of holding Nicole as she lay dying in the street was crystal clear. It didn't matter; witnesses confirmed that Nicole had been executed at point-blank range. No family or friends had ever come to support him. “People rehabilitate themselves, and that's my hope for Rudy Fleming, who's in the back, cowering in his cell,” Ricco said. “He's a young person who cannot come to grips.” The judge deemed Fleming a “cold-blooded, thoroughly amoral killer” and gave him life without parole. The headline read “Fiancé's Pity Is Misplaced for This Vermin.” Evans and four of the others took plea deals. Servisio Simmon received a sentence of 10 years for first-degree robbery; David Simmon was sentenced to six years for first-degree attempted robbery; Boyd was referred to family court; McDonald was adjudicated a youthful offender and received a sentence of one to three years for first-degree robbery. Linda DuFresne replied, “Ours is a sentence of life without Nicole.” Evans got six years. I went back to my restaurant job a couple of weeks after the murder. A co-worker asked me what Nicole had said to make the kid shoot her. There was a faraway ringing in my ears as someone else said, “Leave her alone, man.” I was refilling the owner's coffee when he grasped my wrist and said quietly, “Survivor guilt is a real thing.” I knew that his parents were Holocaust survivors, so I nodded at him mutely and went to the bathroom to scream into my latte-stained apron. When I went to collect my wallet from One Police Plaza, they handed it to me in a plastic bag labeled “Homicide Evidence.” A letter arrived from the New York State Office of Victim Services offering me funds for therapy. I started drinking to anesthetize myself, making it most of the way through two bottles of wine before stumbling into bed around dawn. My first stop on the road trip is in Denver, where I spend a sunny afternoon with Zach, his wife, and their two kids at a neighborhood swimming pool. They stopped to call Linda and sing “New York, New York” to her from the middle of the East River. It was the last weekend he had with his sister. Although Linda continued to set a place for her daughter at the table at holiday gatherings, Zach says that no one spoke her name: “My mom never recovered, and part of my dad died when Nicole died.” Tom has been in a care facility since suffering a debilitating stroke several years ago; Linda has Alzheimer's-related dementia, and lives in a nursing home not far from Zach. Linda meets me in the lobby when I pull up for our visit. “She'd be happy that you are,” Linda says. Then she puts a hand on my arm and asks me to tell her about the night her daughter died. Later, over dinner, Zach tells me that substance abuse dominated his life for years after Nicole was killed. One night, when he was drinking with friends, one of them said something about her that set him off; Zach got into his car in a rage and drove into the side of a mountain near Aspen. “I should have died.” He credits marriage and fatherhood with averting him from his path of self-destruction. “We bake a cake and tell stories about Nicole,” he says. “I'm trying to give my children some sense of their auntie.” Next, I visit Jeffrey in his Midwest home. Over coffee in his backyard, he tells me about proposing to Nicole. They were on a road trip to Joshua Tree. “I had this overwhelming feeling that I wanted to spend the rest of my life listening to her,” he recalls. I got down on my knee, and she starts throwing all these ‘What ifs?' at me, like, ‘What if I get a terrible disease and lose my hair? “There wasn't anything I felt we couldn't handle.” She said she would marry him on one condition: that they move to New York. After she was killed, Jeffrey's grief coalesced into anger under relentless scrutiny from the media: “I was a pressure cooker of rage, trying to keep the lid on.” He went to the Middle East to work on a documentary about war widows, where he was held at gunpoint more than once. Danger felt comforting to him; at one point, he was riding in a car that narrowly missed hitting an oncoming truck. “I remember this distinct feeling of water washing over me,” Jeffrey recalls. “I channel my love into being the person that she envisioned me to be,” he says. A few weeks later, I meet Scott for dinner in Brooklyn; it's the first time we've seen each other in years. We stayed together until 2013, and had plenty of good times, but we had stared at each other through hell and couldn't make it work for the long haul. We order pizza and cocktails, even though Scott doesn't drink much anymore. '” Nonetheless, Nicole's murder changed his trajectory; he gave up on his dream of being an actor, and took a corporate job. Since the night Nicole died, he often thinks about how limited his time is. I can see how my PTSD has played out through guilt, dissociation, and self-annihilation, but I didn't have clarity until recently. For years, happiness felt like a harbinger of bad things to come; feeling anxious and miserable was familiar. But when my last relationship flamed out, a friend recommended a form of trauma therapy called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR. I can see Nicole standing in the doorway of my apartment on the night she came to pick me up for a Halloween party wearing a slinky champagne-colored dress, smoky glitter outlining her blue eyes under a cascade of curls. She winked at me, and said, “I'm a dream.” Supreme Court Hands Trump ‘GIANT WIN' in Birthright Citizenship Case Senator ‘Misspoke' When She Falsely Claimed Zohran Mamdani Condoned ‘Global Jihad' Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 16-year-old daughter of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt stepped out in New York City. She turned heads during a rare solo outing. Vivienne, whom Jolie shares with ex-husband Brad Pitt, typically resides in Los Angeles but has spent significant time in NYC over the past year. As per photos published by Hola, Vivienne dressed casually yet in an effortlessly chic manner. She wore a white oversized t-shirt paired with off-white pants and matching sneakers. Vivienne isn't just in New York for a getaway — she's been making serious moves behind the scenes. “My daughter Viv loves theater,” Angelina Jolie told Deadline in June 2024. Jolie shared that Vivienne had seen “The Outsiders” at La Jolla about five times and kept encouraging her to explore the show. “She was telling me about it, and I had read the book, and I'd seen the film years ago,” Jolie added. Moved by her daughter's enthusiasm, Jolie gave the story another look. “I started really watching the effect it was having on my young daughter and what she was telling me about herself,” she explained. “I was learning what about it was important to her and why it connected so deeply to her.” Following Jolie and Pitt's high-profile divorce, several of their children—including Zahara, Shiloh, and Vivienne—have reportedly dropped “Pitt” from their last names.</p>

Kneecap Shocks as Expected With Raucous Glastonbury Set: "The BBC Editor Is Going to Have Some Job" “Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech, or incitement to violence,” she wrote. Eavis continued: “As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism — we will always believe in — and actively campaign for — hope, unity, peace and love”, adding a performer's comments “should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs… With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share.” They thanked the Eavis family for allowing them to play despite pushback from U.K. politicians, including Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy. “A big thank you to the Eavis family,” Kneecap said. In May, the Met Police said it would investigate after online videos showed the band calling for the death of British parliament ministers, as well as chanting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah.” It is illegal in the U.K. to express support for Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon, as it is considered a terrorist organization in Britain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's note: The recap of episode four publishes June 30.] (And I'll get to that tragic conclusion in a minute.) Evil is, in some ways, the basic rejection of that process of accountability, and it's much easier to do it in the safe and enclosing dark. This little meditation is brought to you by “It's Not Your Fault,” an episode that's very concerned with who is—and isn't—hiding their faces. We'll end up spending a fair amount of time with these assholes throughout this hour, so it's worth noting that they're not much changed from when we last saw them back in the original Squid Game: They're unrepentant monsters, to a woman and man—and the show's broadest characters by far and by design. The worst of our players have some measure of internal lives; the guards are people doing a job and indoctrinated to think of the players as trash; even Hwang In-ho is following his nihilistic philosophies to their purest and darkest expressions. The VIPs, though, are simply pigs, bored dilettantes with no capacity to see their victims as human beings. Whining and joking about their failed bets in English, they're part stand-ins for the show's murder-craving audience, part symbols of the global elite. Their existence is so blithely awful that it would stretch Squid Game‘s plausibility past the breaking point and into the realm of pure satire—if not for the fact that there's a part of me that suspects the mega-rich might genuinely be this callous and full of contempt for people “beneath them.” That being said, the knowledge that the show only has three episodes left to go after this does tighten up each of these plotlines in turn, so they feel terse and quick-moving for once, instead of like simple filler. By episode's end, we've seen No-eul being set up for a possible trap, Choi getting arrested after finding irrefutable evidence that Park is a former Pink Guard, and Jun-ho discovering the spot where his brother shot him at the climax of the previous game. And it's with that main event that Squid Game takes time to give full (and final) focus to the best supporting character to have emerged over the course of its second and third seasons: Jang Geum-ja. We watch her at her best here, the older woman attending to new mother Jun-hee, throwing herself into (unsuccessful) pleas for humanity from the O voters, and trying to inspire Gi-hun to pick his head back up and find something worth giving a shit about instead of just laying down to die. Kang Ae-shim gives a beautiful performance throughout, never letting the despair eating away at Geum-ja over the death of her son leave her eyes—but also embodying incredible warmth. (Her last monologue to Gi-hun, about the basic unfairness of life, is especially affecting.) This character could have gone too broad at about 100 different points in Squid Game‘s second and third seasons, but Kang has found her humanity throughout. Credit to writer-director Hwang Dong-hyuk: He absolutely fucking got me with this one. I didn't know why the Pink Guards were walking in with a coffin after another miserable night in the player room, matching Gi-hun's just-waking confusion—until his eyes alight on Geum-ja's body, which is hanging with a sheet around her neck from a distant bunk. But the reveal is still a shock—both for viewers and Gi-hun. The last thing Geum-ja did on this Earth was ask him to give enough of a shit to keep Jun-hee and her baby safe; her final act knocks him straight out of his self-pitying funk, just in time for the next game. Riffing on the first season's glass bridge, we've once again got a trap-filled span for 24 remaining contestants to cross. Hesitate for the whole time limit, you get shot. Suffering pretty nasty withdrawal after losing Thanos' cross o' pills last episode, he's manipulated by a vindictive Nam-su into going first on the jump-rope bridge. (In a moment that feels implausibly cruel even by this show's extremely brutal standards, the baby has been declared a player at the whims of the VIPs, idiotically hoping to turn Jun-hee into “Wonder Woman” to keep her kid alive.) And for all my talk of masks up top, maybe I'm ultimately off-base: It would be hard to describe the true face of evil better than the look of this guy, a pure expression of the O Voter philosophy, turning to Gi-hun with shameless glee in his eyes, and declaring—right before we cut to black—”I'm playing the game!” It's a bleak end to an episode that counts as “breathing room” only thanks to the extreme contrast of the previous hour. (That is, we only lose two named characters here, instead of four, and there are at least some moments that aren't drenched in existential horror.) Squid Game has always been a dark show, and it's only gotten darker since the voting plotline was introduced last season, transforming players from victims into active participants in their own destruction. But it remains to be seen if this series can land its ending without straining our credulity or souls past their breaking points.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Simon's back pain became "unmanageable," says a statement released Saturday (June 28). Paul Simon has canceled two concerts this weekend, according to a statement released just hours before a performance scheduled for Saturday night (June 28) at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. Simon was set to play the venue both Saturday and Sunday night. “Regretfully, Paul Simon must cancel two shows tonight June 28 and tomorrow night June 29 — at Philadelphia's Academy of Music,” read the statement, which can be found on Simon's Instagram account. “Paul has been struggling with chronic and intense back pain. Though Simon, 83, had indicated his tour back in 2018 was a farewell tour — at the time, he'd said he was suffering from significant hearing loss — in February 2025, he announced a spring/summer tour after making an appearance on the televised SNL50 celebration (singing “Homeward Bound” with Sabrina Carpenter). Simon's 2025 tour, which made it to New York City just before Philadelphia, began in April and has dates scheduled through early August. At press time, his next tour date is in Long Beach, California, on July 7, followed by stops in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Vancouver and Seattle.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameron has many laudable traits as both a filmmaker and an interview subject, but holding his tongue isn't one of them—something that became obvious in a recent conversation he had with Deadline, about a new film centered on the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and where Nolan came in for some genuine critique over his blockbuster biopic Oppenheimer. Cameron was speaking at length about Ghosts Of Hiroshima, his planned film adaptation of the book of the same name, soon to arrive from his old buddy (and fellow Titanic and nuclear war obsessive) Charles R. Pellegrino. Because it's not like Oppenheimer didn't know the effects. He's got one brief scene in the film where we see—and I don't like to criticize another filmmaker's film–but there's only one brief moment where he sees some charred bodies in the audience and then the film goes on to show how it deeply moved him. You come to my premiere and say nice things.”) Cameron has been on this particular topic for multiple decades at this point—this is the man who filmed that sequence from Terminator 2, so take it as read that he thinks about nuclear bombs more than most people—including traveling to Japan with Pellegrino to meet with Tsutomo Yamaguchi, one of the only people to have survived both bombings. I don't want to get into the politics of, should it have been dropped, should they have done it, and all the bad things Japan did to warrant it, or any of that kind of moralizing and politicizing. I just want to deal in a sense with what happened, almost as if you could somehow be there and survive and see it… I just think it's so important right now for people to remember what these weapons do. This is the only case where they've been used against a human target. Setting aside all the politics and the fact that I'm going to make a film about Japanese people…I don't even speak Japanese, although I have a lot of friends there. They've only died in vain if we forget what that was like and we incur that a thousand fold upon ourselves and future generations.

Of his Friday night plans, Sheeran said, “Was gonna go watch the show anyway but she hit me and asked to sing The A Team with her, which was such a buzz. That song turns 15 this year, and I remember playing it to rooms with no one in it in 2010, so to still be playing it to new fans with one of the brightest stars of the next generation is an honour and a privilege. last night was a blast,” Rodrigo commented on the post Saturday morning. Following Rodrigo's concert, on Saturday Sheeran posted another treat for fans on TikTok: a short mashup of his “Perfect” with Rodrigo's “Happier,” sung together. Sheeran previously praised Rodrigo's 2021 breakthrough hit, “Drivers License,” as a flawless debut single, and noted both her debut and sophomore full-length albums, Sour and Guts, are “unskippable… it's just, as a record, just a great record.” Watch the Rodrigo-Sheeran performance clips courtesy of Ed's social media pages below.
