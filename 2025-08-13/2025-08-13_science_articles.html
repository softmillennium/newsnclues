The time interval between about three and two million years ago is a critical period in human evolution—this is when the genera Homo and Paranthropus first appear in the fossil record and a possible ancestor of these genera, Australopithecus afarensis, disappears. In eastern Africa, attempts to test hypotheses about the adaptive contexts that led to these events are limited by a paucity of fossiliferous exposures that capture this interval. Here we describe the age, geologic context and dental morphology of new hominin fossils recovered from the Ledi-Geraru Research Project area, Ethiopia, which includes sediments from this critically underrepresented period. We report the presence of Homo at 2.78 and 2.59 million years ago and Australopithecus at 2.63 million years ago. Although the Australopithecus specimens cannot yet be identified to species level, their morphology differs from A. afarensis and Australopithecus garhi. These specimens suggest that Australopithecus and early Homo co-existed as two non-robust lineages in the Afar Region before 2.5 million years ago, and that the hominin fossil record is more diverse than previously known. Accordingly, there were as many as four hominin lineages living in eastern Africa between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago: early Homo1, Paranthropus2, A. garhi3, and the newly discovered Ledi-Geraru Australopithecus. Over the past few decades, the African hominin fossil record predating 3.0 million years ago (Ma) has expanded to include several potential ancestors for later taxa4,5,6,7. Currently, systematic analyses place A. afarensis as the most likely candidate for the middle Pliocene stem taxon from which multiple later hominin genera (that is, Homo and Paranthropus), and possibly other species of Australopithecus, descended8,9,10. A. afarensis was geographically and temporally widespread, and fossil sites with its remains are known from Tanzania to northern Ethiopia and, potentially, Chad. However, temporally, A. afarensis is not known after 2.95 Ma (ref. Paranthropus and Homo are well-documented in the eastern African fossil record after 2.0 Ma, especially in the Omo-Turkana Basin and at northern Tanzanian localities12,13,14,15, but the hominin fossil record between the last appearance of A. afarensis (around 2.95 Ma) and 2.0 Ma is patchy. For example, no Paranthropus fossils have been recorded from the Afar Region to date, despite its presence in the Omo-Turkana Basin and at Nyayanga, Kenya2 at approximately 2.7 Ma and in the Upper Ndolanya Beds at Laetoli16 at about 2.66 Ma. Additionally, a Homo specimen at Ledi-Geraru, Ethiopia, extends the genus closer in time17 (2.78 Ma) to the last known appearance of A. afarensis1,11. However a simple cladogenic model of A. afarensis, or any other stem taxon, splitting into these daughter genera is complicated by the presence of A. garhi in the Afar3 at approximately 2.5 Ma. The Ledi-Geraru Research Project (LGRP) area is located towards the northern extent of palaeoanthropological sites in the Afar Region, Ethiopia (Extended Data Fig. New discoveries in Ledi-Geraru suggest that early Homo and Australopithecus were both present in the Afar Region before 2.5 Ma, just as early Homo and Paranthropus are sympatric in the Omo-Turkana Basin and sites to the south18,19 after about 2 Ma. Whether the apparent absence of Paranthropus from the Afar Region reflects the spotty nature of the fossil record or a biogeographical signal is yet to be determined. What is clear is that the Afar Region has currently yielded the only definitive evidence for Australopithecus in eastern Africa after 2.95 Ma—A. garhi and the newly discovered specimens from Ledi-Geraru. The LGRP area contains fossiliferous sediments from the critical 3.0–2.0 Ma time period17. The fossil sites in the Lee Adoyta and Asboli regions of the LGRP area are located west of the Awash River in a region incised by the Mille and Geraru River drainages and their tributaries (Extended Data Fig. The 3.0–2.5 Ma fossiliferous sediments are exposed in fault blocks bounded by post-depositional northeast–southwest and nothwest–southeast trending faults (Fig. 1); age control is provided by many dated and correlated tephra deposits and by magnetostratigraphy17. a, Geologic map of the Lee Adoyta basin.

Vertical scale is doubled relative to the horizontal (2×VE). The distribution and stratigraphy of fossiliferous units and tephra deposits provide context for the hominin fossils described here, which were discovered in sediments cropping out in the Lee Adoyta and Asboli regions (Fig. The Gurumaha sedimentary package is present in narrow fault-bounded exposures in the central Lee Adoyta basin and in drag-faulted blocks adjacent to basalt ridges bounding the basin to the east (Fig. The Gurumaha Tuff (GT), a light grey lapilli tuff dated to 2.782 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ; recalculated17,20), provides age control for the unit (Fig. Stratigraphically younger, the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package is widely exposed in the Lee Adoyta basin and is correlated to exposures in Asboli (Fig. The Lee Adoyta Tuffs (LAT) comprise two thin, geochemically distinct tephras: a yellow altered basaltic ash which occurs approximately 10 cm above a white rhyolitic ash dated to 2.631 ± 0.011 Ma (1σ; recalculated17,20). These tuffs, and an underlying olive-green clay, provide an excellent marker sequence (Fig. The Giddi Sands sedimentary package (Tgs; containing the Giddi Sands Tuff (GST)) and the Markaytoli sedimentary package (Tmk; containing the Markaytoli Tuff) crop out in the eastern Lee Adoyta basin (Fig. The base of the Giddi Sands sedimentary package is an erosional unconformity cutting into the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package in the Lee Adoyta Basin (Fig. The GST is a 3- to 8-cm-thick laminated, multicoloured (orange, yellow and white), crystal bentonite tuff. 40Ar/39Ar single-crystal incremental heating (SCIH) yielded a weighted-mean age of 2.593 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ) for the GST sampled in Asboli (Methods and Supplementary Figs. In Asboli, the Giddi Sands sedimentary package containing the AS 100 fossil site unconformably overlies a sequence of mudstones containing the Asboli Tuffs, which in turn overlies the LAT exposed approximately 500 m to the south (Fig. 2) were recovered from the three sedimentary packages described above—the Gurumaha, Lee Adoyta, and Giddi Sands (Table 1). Left, images show the LD 760 assemblage (top, from left: maxillary molar, I2, I1, maxillary canine; bottom, mandibular molars). A mandibular right third premolar, LD 302-23 (Fig. 3), was recovered approximately 22 m to the southwest and 7 m stratigraphically below the LD 350 early Homo mandible locality1, above the Gurumaha Tuff17 (Fig. An enamel fragment is missing from the lingual corner, but the crown is otherwise well preserved. The crown is shorter mesiodistally (MD) than buccolingually (BL) (11.5 mm BL × 10.5 mm MD; Extended Data Fig. 3) and the major crown axis is oriented buccolingually. A relatively small metaconid sits well mesial to the protoconid, creating a tiny, centrally placed anterior fovea that is bounded by a low, but continuous, mesial marginal ridge. Occlusal wear makes it difficult to determine if the metaconid would have been completely distinct from the protoconid at the outer enamel surface. The talonid is mesiodistally short and occupies a relatively small portion of the crown area in occlusal view. LD 302-23 departs strongly in shape and occlusal form from P3s attributed to Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus deyiremeda, and unicuspid specimens of A. afarensis (for example, A.L. 288-1), in which the major axis of an asymmetric crown runs mesiobuccal to distolingual and in having a continuous mesial marginal ridge that creates a ‘closed' anterior fovea7,21,22 (Extended Data Fig. Some A. afarensis specimens (such as A.L. 437-2) resemble the crown outline of LD 302-23 (Extended Data Fig. 3a); however, LD 302-23 also differs from those specimens in having a mesially shifted metaconid, which creates an acute angle between the transverse crest and mesial protoconid crest, and in having a highly reduced anterior fovea relative to crown size23. In crown shape index (MD/BL), LD 302-23 falls in the middle range of the A. afarensis distribution (Extended Data Fig. In area (BL × MD), LD 302-23 falls within the range of the A. afarensis size distribution, at the lower limit of the range of Paranthropus boisei, but within the range of values of Paranthropus robustus (Extended Data Fig. Unlike Paranthropus12, the talonid of LD 302-23 is not expansive. We attribute LD 302-23 to Homo for a number of reasons. Although the sample of P3s attributed to early Homo is morphologically diverse (for example, KNM-ER 5431, OMO 75-14, KNM-ER 1802 and OH 7), LD 302-23 is clearly derived relative to pre-3.0 Ma Australopithecus, lacks the suite of derived nonmetric features characteristic of Paranthropus, and is consistent with the size, crown morphology and mesiodistal compression of the LD 350-1 specimen (the LD 350-1 P3 crown is damaged mesiolingually, with only around 65% of the crown remaining), which was found in the same sedimentary package and shares numerous dental and mandibular apomorphies with Homo. 4), was collected from locality LD 750 at the base of an approximately 8-m-thick fossiliferous exposure of mudstone and sandstone. The LD 750 P4 is unworn, with salient mesial cusps (Extended Data Fig. The roots are broken beneath the crown, but the mesial portion preserves a maximum root height of about 2.0 mm. The tooth may not have been fully erupted, as there are no interproximal contact facets and the occlusal surface is unworn. The protoconid and metaconid are shifted relatively mesially on the crown and tightly compressed BL, giving the tooth a slightly ‘puffy' appearance. The anterior fovea is distinct and deep, but relatively small (reflecting the mesial placement of the cusps), centrally placed and bounded by a narrow mesial marginal ridge. The talonid is relatively large, the distal marginal ridge is low and rounded, and a distinct, but low, distolingual cusp is present, giving the tooth an asymmetric occlusal profile. With dimensions of 12.4 mm BL × 11.4 mm MD, the tooth area is in the upper size range of A. afarensis, exceeded in area only by A.L. Morphologically, however, the LD 750 P4 departs from the typical Hadar A. afarensis appearance. For example, the lingual to mesial face transition is smooth and rounded, whereas in Hadar P4s there is a more distinct corner. The occlusal layout differs from that of Hadar P4s in that the metaconid and protoconid are placed more centrally in relation to buccolingual crown breadth and shifted mesially in relation to crown length. Thus, compared with Hadar A. afarensis teeth, the buccal face is more convex occlusocervically and the anterior fovea more confined. The index of protoconid–metaconid apex distance/BL breadth shows the central placement of the LD 750 mesial cusp apices in relation to crown breadth compared with A. afarensis (Extended Data Fig. Not only is LD 750 large relative to most A. afarensis specimens, it also exceeds the area of all specimens attributed to A. anamensis and all but two specimens of Australopithecus africanus (StW 498 and StW 384). The LD 750 crown area falls within the size distribution of P. robustus and Paranthropus aethiopicus; however, it lacks any of the distinct ‘molarization' seen in Paranthropus P4s (for example, expanded talonid and distal cusps, thick marginal ridges, symmetrically rounded occlusal profile caused by the filling of the crown distobuccally, and surface complexity in unworn specimens12). We note that the known specimen of A. garhi lacks any mandibular remains3, but LD 750 cannot be excluded from that species on the basis of size alone (see randomization analysis in Extended Data Fig. In occlusal form and crown outline, LD 750 does resemble OMO 75-14 (Extended Data Fig. 4a), which has been attributed to aff. Homo by Suwa et al.12 and Hlusko et al.24, and KNM-ER 5431, which is also attributed to Homo by Suwa et al.12. However, these attributions are provisional and based mostly on the nonmetric morphology of their associated molars (for example, presence of C7 on M1 and M2 of both specimens). In fact, P4 morphology poorly distinguishes between early Homo and Australopithecus12,24. Thus, the phenetic resemblance between OMO 75-14, KNM-ER 5431 and LD 750, which are all large but lack features typical of Paranthropus, could be most parsimoniously interpreted as symplesiomorphic retentions. Since LD 750-115670 lacks any clear Homo synapomorphies associated with other specimens of early Homo from Koobi Fora (such as talonid reduction in KNM-ER 99225), we provisionally assign it to aff. An associated set of five mandibular molars, a maxillary molar fragment, and three maxillary anterior teeth (Fig. 2 and Table 1) representing a single individual were collected at locality LD 760, a relatively flat-lying area dominated by fine-grained sand and silts (Supplementary Video 1). The hominin teeth were all found in close association, in a relatively dense cluster among scattered faunal elements (Extended Data Fig. The mandibular molars were found eroding from the surface and the maxillary dentition was sieved from the surface silt (approximately 5–10 cm of loose and eroded surface soil) downslope on a gentle gradient over a 7 × 4 m area to the northwest. The LD 760 collection area lies approximately 10 m below the 2.631 ± 0.011 Ma LAT17 mapped in hillslopes surrounding the site (Fig. Mammalian fossils were also observed eroding from sand units around 3.5 m and 6.5 m above the LAT (Fig. However, on the basis of the slope and distance to these sand units, as well as the abundance and spread of other fossil specimens, the hominin teeth and other fossils on the LD 760 surface represent a distinct fossiliferous unit below the LAT. The LD 760 mandibular molars are moderately worn, with dentine exposure visible at buccal cusp apices in the M1 (Fig. They are relatively wide BL compared to their MD length (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6) and do not taper strongly distally, which gives the crowns, especially M1 and M2, a squarish profile (Fig. The buccal grooves are indistinct, and the buccal profile is convex in occlusal view, in part because a protostylid partially fills in the buccal groove. Further, the buccal crown face slopes occlusocervically, reflecting an internal placement of cusp apices. Left molars from Ledi-Geraru specimen LD 760 (left) and Hadar specimen A.L. Measurements in mm of the LD 760 molars (BL × MD): LM1: 13.3 × 13.4, LM2: 14.5 × 14.6, LM3: 14.0 (estimated) × 15.7, RM1: 13.2 × 13.1, RM2: 14.8 × 15.2 (Supplementary Data 1). Specimens are oriented with their buccal surfaces to the left and mesial surfaces up. Detail of distal taper (orange lines) and bilobate contour (blue lines) seen in A. afarensis M1 specimen A.L. 400-1 (right) contrasted with the overall more equilateral occlusal profile of the LD 760 M1 (left). The M2s also show this pattern (Fig. Specimens are oriented with their buccal surfaces to the left and mesial surfaces up. There is no hint of M3 reduction (as seen, for example, in some early Homo such as LD 350-1 and OMO-75-14); instead, the molars follow the plesiomorphic pattern of relative molar size, M1 < M2 < M3. The M1 and M2 are subequally square (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6), unlike in early Homo which tend to have rectangular crowns that are mesiodistally elongated. Further, the teeth are relatively simple, with few accessory cusps; the M1s show no expression of a C7, unlike LD 350-1 and KNM-ER 1802, and the M2s also lack a C7, which is seen in many specimens attributed to early Homo (for example, OMO-75-14, KNM-ER 5431, KNM-ER 60000 and OH 7). The mesiodistal dimensions of the mandibular molars comfortably fit within the metric variation seen in individual A. afarensis molars (Extended Data Fig. However, the sum of the molar areas for the LD 760 individual (614.3 mm2) exceeds all but one (NFR-VP-1/29; Woranso-Mille, Afar Region, Ethiopia) of the 11 A. afarensis individuals that preserve all 3 molars; yet, among Paranthropus, only 1 individual (DNH 7) is smaller in M1–M3 area than LD 760 (Extended Data Fig. The LD 760 molars depart from the typical feature set of A. afarensis in three ways: (1) the M1s are buccolingually broad relative to their mesiodistsal length (A. afarensis M1s and M2s are buccolingually widest across the mesial cusps, the LD 760 M1 is equally wide at midcrown and the M2 is only slightly narrower at midcrown) (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6); (2) the M1 and M2 do not taper distally to the extent seen in A. afarensis (Figs. 3 and 4); and (3) the LD 760 molars lack the distinct bilobate buccal contour seen in A. afarensis12 (Fig. A fragmentary maxillary molar, LD 760-115911, was recovered at the LD 760 locality (Extended Data Fig. On A. garhi upper molars, the lingual groove is indistinct, but the lingual margin of the crown begins to curve buccally distal to the lingual groove, reflecting the relatively small hypocone and buccolingually narrow distal crown (Extended Data Fig. This reduction in hypocone area produces a triangular form for the Bouri specimen's protocone. The LD 760 upper molar fragment shows no similar curvature of the crown margin distal to the lingual groove. Instead, it appears to have had a fully expressed hypocone. However, in terms of absolute molar area (BL × MD), the ratio of LD 760 lower molars to the A. garhi upper molars does not falsify a single-species hypothesis using modern ape comparative data—see resampling analysis in Extended Data Fig. A right maxillary canine, a complete left maxillary lateral incisor and a left fragmentary maxillary central incisor were also found at the LD 760 locality (Fig. The canine (LD 760-115979) is well preserved, with all but the root apex present (Fig. The crown has mesial and distal interproximal contact facets. A distal interproximal contact facet is also present on the LI2, which indicates bilateral absence of a canine/I2 diastema; a diastema is present on the BOU-VP-12/130 A. garhi maxilla and is variably present in A. afarensis. The canine crown is worn apically and along the mesial and distal crests. Apical wear makes it difficult to examine the relative placement of the crown shoulders, but the mesial shoulder appears to have been placed apically. Despite the wear, the canine is not small (Extended Data Fig. 8a–c), and the ratio of the canine to molar mesiodistal dimensions puts this specimen in the upper range of Australopithecus and well beyond the observed values for Paranthropus (Extended Data Fig. a, Lingual (left) and labial (right) views of the Ledi-Geraru LD 760-115979 canine (left) with Hadar A. afarensis specimens A.L. Note that the LD 760 canine is a right canine, whereas the A. afarensis canines are from the left and are mirrored in these images. b–d, LD 760-115979 (b; shown in lingual view) contrasted with Hadar A. afarensis specimen A.L. 199-1 (c; right canine shown; distal to the upper right) and Bouri A. garhi specimen BOU-VP-12/130 (d; left canine, mirrored; distal is to the right). Note the simple mesial–distal chisel-like wear pattern on the LD 760 canine (b) in contrast to the complex multi-faceted wear pattern of A. afarensis (c) and the broad curved basin on the distal side of the A. garhi upper canine (d; this is seen on both left and right canines). Images are oriented differently to emphasize the distinctive relevant morphology. Photos of BOU-VP-12/130 A. garhi holotype fossil by T. White; use courtesy of the Middle Awash research project. Images in b–d are not to scale. The LD 760 canine departs subtly from the macrowear of A. afarensis (Fig. For example, its wear pattern lacks the characteristic ‘j-pattern' along the distal crest26; instead, apical wear dominates. In basal size (10.4 mm BL × 10.5 mm MD) the tooth resembles A. afarensis and is narrower than the labio-lingually broad canine of A. garhi (Extended Data Fig. The LD 760 canine also departs morphologically from A. garhi. The A. garhi canine, uniquely among hominins, possesses a broad, shallow distal basin reminiscent of a talon (Fig. 5d); this smooth basin is contiguous with a wide wear furrow that characterizes the entire postcanine dental row (Extended Data Fig. The LD 760 individual cannot be attributed to Paranthropus. It lacks the derived reduction of anterior tooth size, which is reflected both in the absolute sizes of the anterior teeth and their size relative to the postcanine dentition (Extended Data Fig. The mandibular molars do not express relatively large C6s12 and they show a buccolingual wear gradient distinct from the planar pattern typical of Paranthropus12. The LD 760 teeth also lack any derived Homo traits (such as steeply walled molars, narrow M1, C7 presence and M3 reduction). We regard the morphology of LD 760 as inconsistent with known eastern African Australopithecus species because: (1) the lack of any of the derived A. garhi traits, notably the reduced hypocone of the maxillary molars and highly distinctive upper canine ‘talon' basin; and (2) a morphology derived relative to A. afarensis (that is, lack of bilobate mandibular molar walls and distal taper, and canine wear pattern). Because of the plesiomorphic resemblance to A. afarensis, we make a generic-level attribution and assign the LD 760 assemblage to Australopithecus sp. A partial left M1 crown with lingual cusps only partially preserved (AS 100-1a) and 2 fragments assembled into a complete left M2 crown (AS 100-1b) were discovered eroded from the approximately 1-m-thick Giddi Sands unit in the Asboli region immediately below the GST (Fig. Subsequent screening produced no additional hominin material. Wear on these teeth is slight, with crown apices salient and no dentine exposed. Interstitial wear is present and the interproximal contact facets are congruent, consistent with identification of AS 100-1a as an M1 and AS 100-1b as an M2 (Fig. The AS 100-1b M2 is rhomboidal in occlusal outline, with the cusps offset such that the buccal pair sits mesial to the lingual pair, the hypocone is relatively large and projects distolingually, and the lingual profile is straight. A. afarensis M2s range in shape from squarish (for example, A.L. 486-1) to more rhomboidal (for example, A.L. 200-1)27, but A. afarensis specimens invariably show more pronounced lingual occlusocervical sloping, indicating a more internally placed cuspal arrangement than is apparent for AS 100-1b. The lingual cusps of the AS 100 molars are relatively steep vertically and lack the ‘puffy' contour seen in relatively unworn specimens of A. afarensis (for example, A.L. The rhomboidal crown outline, relatively large and projecting hypocone, and cuspal placement of AS 100-1b are closely matched by A.L. 666-1, a Homo specimen from the Busidima Formation at Hadar28 from 2.3 Ma, and MLP-1549, a Homo specimen from Mille-Logya29, 2.5–2.4 Ma. This feature set strongly contrasts with the A. garhi M2 in which the hypocone is relatively small and placed transverse to the metacone, the lingual profile is strongly curved, and the cusps are more internally placed (Extended Data Fig. In size, the AS 100-1b M2 (14.2 mm BL × 13.9 mm MD) and Homo specimen A.L. 666-1 are nearly identical and both slightly exceed the Mille-Logya M2 in BL breadth; AS 100-1b is smaller in area than the M2 of A. garhi and eastern African Paranthropus (Extended Data Fig. We attribute AS 100-1 to Homo sp. based on the presence of a derived M2 crown outline (that is, rhomboidal with projecting relatively large hypocone30), a feature shared with other specimens of early Homo. The presence of both early Homo and Australopithecus at Ledi-Geraru has implications for hominin taxonomy and diversity in this region in the 3.0–2.0 million year interval. Despite the relative paucity of fossils discovered in this time interval, evidence for multiple non-robust lineages in eastern and southern Africa indicates that taxonomic diversity had already evolved by 2.5 Ma. Here we examine taxonomic and phylogenetic hypotheses for the newly discovered hominin specimens from Ledi-Geraru. First, although the Asboli sample contains only two molars (Table 1), and they predate Homo specimens A.L. 666-1 and MLP-1549 by more than 150,000 years, we regard the most parsimonious hypothesis to be that these are members of the same species of Homo30. The existence of Homo at Ledi-Geraru by around 2.78 Ma was previously established by the LD 350-1 mandible1; the new dental material from the Asboli area, as well as the LD 302-23 premolar described here from the Gurumaha sedimentary package, provide additional evidence of Homo prior to 2.5 Ma. Second, LD 750 and LD 760 are separated by 24 m of strata and straddle the LAT. We provisionally regard all teeth recovered from the Lee Adoyta sedimentary package as representatives of a single species of Australopithecus, partially premised on our expectation of the low likelihood of two Australopithecus species existing in such close geographic and temporal proximity. The Ledi-Geraru australopith teeth represent a late-surviving population of A. afarensis. The Lee Adoyta sample is approximately 350,000 years younger than the last appearance of A. afarensis, which is documented by specimens from the Kada Hadar 2 Submember at Hadar11. Contradicting this hypothesis, the mandibular M1s and M2s are not bilobate and are squarer in crown shape than the majority of A. afarensis; the P4 and molar sizes fall just at the upper limit of size variation in that species; and the pattern of maxillary canine wear in the LD 760 canine is not seen in A. afarensis. Accordingly, if these teeth do represent A. afarensis, they may capture further evolutionary change within the lineage. The resemblances between the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus specimens and A. afarensis are symplesiomorphic. In addition to A. garhi, this is the only other record of the persistence of this genus in eastern Africa after 2.95 Ma, although it has approximate contemporaneity with A. africanus found in South Africa. The Lee Adoyta Australopithecus teeth represent a population ancestral to later Paranthropus, which is currently undocumented in the Afar Region; this inference could be supported by the large size of the postcanine teeth. However, the appearance of Homo by 2.78 Ma implies a divergence between that clade and Paranthropus by at least that date, and Paranthropus is present as early as 2.66 Ma in the Upper Ndolanya Beds at Laetoli, Tanzania16 and around 2.7 Ma at Nyayanga, Kenya2. Moreover, the Lee Adoyta teeth share no synapomorphies with Paranthropus (such as presence of C6 on the molars, reduced anterior tooth size or planar wear pattern) and megadonty is common in early hominin lineages, including A. garhi, A. africanus and early Homo3. Given these constraints, it is unlikely that the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus is ancestral to Paranthropus. The Lee Adoyta Australopithecus teeth are early representatives of A. garhi. Accepting this hypothesis would require that A. garhi includes very different canine and maxillary molar forms and postcanine wear patterns on their upper and lower dentitions. This alternative is difficult to evaluate as there are only a few overlapping anatomical elements to compare between the current A. garhi fossil material and the Lee Adoyta Australopithecus sample. However, our assessment is that the lack of similar forms on the few shared elements suggests the Lee Adoyta australopith is not A. garhi. The Lee Adoyta teeth are a previously unknown species of Australopithecus from the early Pleistocene. This hypothesis is the only alternative that offers no contradictions with the data presented in the previous three hypotheses. The Ledi-Geraru fossils described here demonstrate that there were at least 3 lineages in the Afar Region between 3.0 and 2.5 Ma: Homo, A. garhi and the newly identified Australopithecus from Ledi-Geraru. The diversity of hominins in the interval around 2.5 Ma demonstrates the ways in which evolution was experimenting with the overall hominin pattern; in addition to these Afar region hominins, A. africanus is present in South Africa and Paranthropus is found in Kenya, Tanzania and southern Ethiopia by this time. The apparent absence of Australopithecus after approximately 2.0 Ma in eastern Africa means that only two hominin genera remained, Homo and Paranthropus, and these were well differentiated in terms of their dietary ecology31. Moreover, the discoveries of Australopithecus and Homo at Ledi-Geraru between 2.78 Ma and 2.59 Ma reveal that a drier, more open habitat was not uniquely associated with the appearance of Homo17,32, raising intriguing questions about niche breadth and landscape use among early hominins—including why Australopithecus was able to survive in the Afar Region alongside Homo until at least 2.5 Ma, and whether Paranthropus was competitively excluded from the Afar Region by late-surviving Australopithecus filling a similar niche. Individual phenocrysts of K-feldspar (sanidine to anorthoclase, ~400–1,000 μm) from tuff sample LG-1048-1 of the Giddi Sands Tuff were analysed at the Berkeley Geochronology Center by the SCIH 40Ar/39Ar dating technique17. The feldspar concentrate was irradiated in the Cd-lined CLICIT position of the Oregon State University TRIGA reactor for four hours (BGC irradiation no. Sanidine phenocrysts from the Alder Creek Rhyolite of California were used as the neutron-fluence monitor mineral, with an orbitally referenced age20 of 1.1848 ± 0.0006 Ma. 33) and decay constants follow ref. In total, 26 individual grains were analysed separately by the SCIH approach. One grain was rejected after the initial step as an old xenocryst (27361-08, ~100 Ma), while all others yielded geologically reasonable eruption ages and were carried to conclusion (Supplementary Table 1). All completed experiments demonstrated apparent-age plateaus, typically across the entirety of the 39Ar release spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 1), indicating an absence of complexity to the internal argon systematics, and that these feldspars show no evidence of alteration or inherited argon. A probability density plot of the plateau ages is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, revealing that the age distribution is symmetrical and gaussian-like. The weighted-mean age of the accepted plateaus is 2.593 ± 0.006 Ma (1σ analytical error). Isochrons (36Ar/40Ar versus 39Ar/40Ar) calculated from the plateau steps yield an indistinguishable weighted-mean age of 2.597 ± 0.006 Ma (Supplementary Fig. 3) but, given the high proportion of radiogenic 40Ar of total 40Ar (typically >90%) in these crystals, we prefer the straightforward plateau weighted mean as the reference age for this sample (2.593 ± 0.006 Ma). Hominin specimens discovered in 2015 and 2018 from the LGRP area are described and evaluated taxonomically, using comparative fossil material from eastern and southern Africa including A. anamensis, A. afarensis, A. africanus, A. deyiremeda, A. garhi, Paranthropus aethiopicus, P. boisei, P. robustus, Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, and Homo sp. (see Extended Data Table 1 for sites, localities and references for these taxa). Resampling data from Pan troglodytes and Gorilla gorilla metrics are also used to evaluate the comparative relative variation within and between samples. Bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) was performed in R v. 4.4.135. For each analysis, distributions of values for extant taxa were derived from 10,000 bootstraps. The ratio of the Ledi-Geraru and A. garhi specimens were compared to the bootstrapped distributions for chimpanzees and gorillas; all statistical tests were two-tailed using α = 0.05. All photographed material (including comparative specimens) were examined directly by the authors. Quantitative data came from a variety of sources, including the authors' and published measurements; both quantitative and qualitative comparative analyses were performed. See Extended Data Table 1 for references and Supplementary Data 1 for all hominin dental metrics. This mandibular premolar was found 6 February 2015 by K.G.T. during palaeontological survey ~22 m to the southwest and ~7 m stratigraphically below the LD 350 early Homo mandible locality1, above the 2.782 ± 0.006 Ma Gurumaha Tuff17 (Fig. The fossil was recorded in the LGRP database with GPS coordinates. Numerous non-hominin fossils were also recovered in the area. This mandibular premolar was found by O.A.O. during palaeontological survey on 14 February 2018 (Supplementary Fig. It was located ~9 m stratigraphically above the 2.63 Ma Lee Adoyta Tuff, on the eastern side of the Lee Adoyta Basin (Extended Data Fig. 2a) The fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates and an in situ photograph. The sequence includes fine sandy silts to very fine sand, tuffaceous silts and brown mudstones. The first molar, LD 760-115329, an M1, was found by O.A.O. on 14 February 2018, followed by the discovery of four more lower molars by A.L.R. These teeth were located ~10 m stratigraphically below the 2.63 Ma Lee Adoyta Tuff on the eastern side of the Lee Adoyta Basin (Extended Data Fig. All fossils surrounding the hominin teeth were flagged and collected during surveying for additional hominin material (Supplementary Video 1). The fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates and in situ photographs. The area was subsequently (19–25 February 2018) screened with 2 mm screen mesh and the maxillary dentition was discovered in the surrounding 4 × 7 m in the upper 5–7 cm of loose surface material. Expanded sieving in 2020 did not produce additional fossils. Fossil survey, collection, and screening are shown in Supplementary Video 1. The sediments below the Lee Adoyta Tuff at the site include fine sands overlain by brown mudstones. On 23 February 2015, one partial hominin molar, AS 100-1a (LM1), was found by B.M.A. and a tooth fragment, AS 100-1b, was subsequently found by E.M.L. during palaeontological survey (Supplementary Fig. Further exploration of the small area revealed a second fragment, found by B.M.A., which fit onto AS 100-1b (completing the LM2). All teeth were found within 0.5 m2. All fossils were recorded in the database with GPS coordinates. The area was subsequently screened with 2 mm screen mesh without recovering more fossils. The sequence includes ~1 m thick sand (Giddi Sands) and thin pebble conglomerate units immediately below the Giddi Sands Tuff (Fig. For all localities, geological data were collected using StraboSpot 2.12.18, Avenza 5.4 and GaiaGPS 2025.2 and integrated in ArcGIS Pro 3.2.2.

The crown of LD 302-23 measures 10.5 mm MD x 11.5 mm BL (est.). Mesial is oriented up and lingual is oriented to the right. b, Bivariate plot of P3 crown dimensions. The LD 302-23 P3 (magenta star) falls near the upper range of Homo and well within Australopithecus. Although LD 302-23 is large for a Homo P3, our interpretation of the occlusal morphology is more consistent with assignment to this genus. LD 302-23 falls in the middle range of Australopithecus and lower in the range of Homo, although these patterns show overlap. LD 302-23 falls in the upper ranges of Australopithecus and Homo but is small compared to P. boisei. a, Comparison of the Ledi-Geraru LD 750-115670 P4 to other pre-2.0 Ma hominin specimens.

This is different from the pattern on upper postcanine teeth in A. afarensis, A. africanus, P. robustus, and P. boisei, in which wear is more even across the breadth of the teeth (typically with a slight lingual-buccal wear gradient), and the cusps are ultimately reduced to the level of the central basin, producing a relatively flat occlusal profile. In A. garhi, the wear in the longitudinal furrow is sufficient to obliterate the central fissure, even in teeth with relatively unworn cusp apices (for example, contrast the P3s in the two specimens). We see no evidence of any wear pattern on the LD 760 assemblage that would indicate similarity to BOU-VP-12/130 (notably on the preserved fragmentary upper molar).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why Glacial Lake Outbursts like the One in Alaska May Happen More Often Meltwater from a glacial lake outburst is flooding Juneau, Alaska. Such events are likely to happen more often as climate change destabilizes ice and glacial lakes fill with more meltwater Meltwater from a glacial outburst near Juneau, Alaska, is flooding nearby neighborhoods, and officials are urging some residents of the city of 30,000 to evacuate. As of 6:00 A.M. local time on Wednesday morning, the Mendenhall River was in a major flood stage. At 16.17 feet (4.93 meters) and rising, the water level had passed the record flood stage of 15.99 feet (4.87 m) that hit during an August 2024 glacial outburst flood, according to the National Weather Service. The river and Mendenhall Lake, both of which are downstream from the glacier's tongue, are under a flood warning.

Glacial outburst floods happen when the ice dams holding back glacial lakes fail, allowing a sudden release of water. And with a warming climate, ice is becoming more unstable, and glacial lakes are growing—a 2020 study based on satellite imagery found that, between 1990 and 2018, the volume of water dammed in glacial lakes had grown by 48 percent. In fact, according to the NWS, the basin has released an outburst flood at least once a year since 2011. It's a threat glaciologists in mountainous areas around the world are trying to better understand, said Fabian Walter, now a senior scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research WSL, in an interview with Scientific American in 2020. “These glaciated mountain faces were more or less stable,” Walter said. “And now, with climate change, the whole stability is changing.” Stephanie Pappas is a freelance science journalist based in Denver, Colo.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Entirely New Species of Human Ancestor Discovered Thirteen fossilized teeth were collected in the Ledi-Geraru Research Area from 2015 to 2018. Brian Villmoare: University of Nevada Las Vegas The fossils, which include teeth that date to between 2.8 million and 2.6 million years ago, belong to a never-before-seen member of the genus Australopithecus—the same genus to which the famous Lucy fossil belongs. They show that this newly identified member of the human family lived alongside early representatives of our own genus, Homo. The findings were published in Nature on August 13. But comparisons of the teeth with other fossils from the same site—Ledi-Geraru in the Afar Region of Ethiopia—as well as with other hominin fossils, revealed that they are distinctive enough to represent a species of Australopithecus that is new to science.

Together with previous finds, the new fossils demonstrate that at least four lineages of hominins (creatures more closely related to us than to our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos) lived in eastern Africa between three million and 2.5 million years ago. How these hominins were able to share the landscape is a question the team is working to answer. One possible explanation is that they preferred different foods. Once upon a time, scholars thought that human evolution was a march of progress in which our forebears evolved in linear fashion from an apelike ancestor to a series of increasingly humanlike forms.

While physical activity is critical to human health, most people do not meet recommended guidelines1,2. Built environments that are more walkable have the potential to increase activity across the population3,4,5,6,7,8. However, previous studies on the built environment and physical activity have led to mixed findings, possibly due to methodological limitations such as small cohorts, over-reliance on self-reported measures and cross-sectional designs5,7,9,10,11. Here we address these limitations by leveraging a large US cohort of smartphone users (N = 2,112,288) to evaluate within-person longitudinal behaviour changes that occurred over 248,266 days of objectively measured physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities. By analysing the results of this natural experiment, which exposed individuals to differing built environments, we find that increases (decreases) in walkability are associated with significant increases (decreases) in physical activity after relocation. For example, moving from a less walkable (25th percentile) city to a more walkable city (75th percentile) increased walking by 1,100 daily steps, on average. These changes hold across different genders, ages and body mass index values, and are sustained over 3 months. The added activity is predominantly composed of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which is linked to an array of associated health benefits1. Evidence against residential self-selection confounding is reported. Our findings provide robust evidence supporting the importance of the built environment in directly improving health-enhancing physical activity and offer potential guidance for public policy activities in this area. A substantial number of people worldwide are physically inactive4,12,13 and therefore at risk for common and deadly non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes13,14,15. Meanwhile, urban environments worldwide have grown rapidly, with current estimates predicting that 6.7 billion people will be living in cities by 2050 (ref. While the evidence base on the impacts of the design of urban environments on physical activity levels has grown, further information is needed on the putative causal impacts of diverse urban environments on key health behaviours such as physical activity5,7,10,11,17,18 and interactions between environmental and individual factors19. Specifically, current evidence has not been able to determine whether physical activity levels are directly influenced by the built environment or are mainly a product of personal preferences10,20. Understanding these factors is critical for developing optimal public policy1,8,21, and for planning cities5,22 and designing behaviour change interventions23,24. Previous studies on the effects of the built environment on physical activity have led to mixed or modest findings and have not been able to reliably distinguish between direct environmental impacts and individual preferences. Common methodological limitations include small cohorts, data from a single location or a limited number of locations, over-reliance on self-reported activity, with its attendant biases25, cross-sectional designs that constrain temporal understanding and causal inference, residential self-selection and other confounding factors5,7,9,20,26,27. Today's mobile phones, including the now globally dominant smartphone, can capture physical activity and geolocation in a continuous fashion, making them a powerful tool for studying large-scale population dynamics and health23, the use of which can reveal the basic patterns of physical activity3, sleep28, human movement29 and mood rhythms30, along with the dynamics of the spread of diseases such as malaria31 and COVID-19 (ref. 32) and linkages with socioeconomic status in low- and middle-income countries33. In this study, we use a large-scale physical activity dataset to disentangle the influences of the built environment from personal proclivities through a natural experiment, and quantify the impact of walkability on changes in physical activity levels at the individual and population scale. We study 248,266 days of minute-by-minute step recordings from 5,424 users of the Azumio Argus smartphone application who relocated at least once within a 3-year observation period. Overall, these participants relocated a total of 7,447 times among 1,609 cities within the USA, forming a countrywide natural experiment (Fig. The dataset includes smartphone-derived accelerometry recordings of physical activity for free-living individuals that were exposed to different built environments, enabling us to compare their objectively measured, longitudinal physical activity for up to 90 days before and after relocation (Fig. The average participant recorded 5,574 steps per day (standard deviation σ = 3,055) over an average span of 14.2 hours. Research has demonstrated that smartphones provide accurate step counts34 and reliable activity estimates in both laboratory and free-living settings35. We ensured that our dataset included a broad range of relocating and non-relocating participants, including across age, gender and weight status (as measured by body mass index (BMI)) (Extended Data Table 1). Previous work further verified that data from the Argus smartphone application used in this study reproduced established relationships between age, gender, weight status and activity, as well as country-level variations in activity and obesity levels3. We also verified that our findings were robust to different relocation definitions, including those aimed at removing business and leisure travel and excluding time periods right before and right after relocation, which are probably impacted by the relocation process itself (Extended Data Fig. 6; Methods: ‘Identifying participant relocation'). a, During the observation period, 5,424 participants relocated 7,447 times between 1,609 US cities. Circle area is proportional to the square root of the number of relocations to and from the city. b, The physical activity levels of participants were tracked through smartphone accelerometry over several months before and after relocation, creating a countrywide study of 7,447 quasi-experiments. c–f, Physical activity of participants moving from less walkable locations to New York City (c,e), in comparison to participants moving in the opposite direction (d,f) (Methods). Activity levels change significantly immediately after relocation and are symmetric but inverted for participants moving in the opposite direction (e,f). All error bars throughout figures correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.

Our large-scale activity measurements enable us to characterize the impact of built environments on physical activity. Consider the 178 participants relocating to New York City (a walkability score of 89 out of 100) coming from various less walkable US locations (Fig. 1c; a Walk Score of at least one standard deviation or 15.4 points lower; mean walkability 48). When exposed to the built environment of New York City after relocating, these participants increased their physical activity by 1,400 steps, their average daily steps increasing from 5,600 to 7,000 (Fig. 1e; P < 10−10; all statistical hypothesis tests throughout refer to two-sided Student's t-tests unless indicated otherwise; Methods: ‘Statistical methods'). Participants relocating in the opposite direction, that is, from New York City to other less walkable US cities (Fig. 1d), exhibited an inverted, symmetric effect of decreasing their physical activity by 1,400 steps, going from 7,000 to 5,600 average daily steps (P < 10−10, Fig. 1f; more examples in Supplementary Fig. To investigate whether moving to more walkable environments generally leads to increased physical activity, we aggregate changes in physical activity across all relocations in the dataset (Fig. 2a; Methods: ‘Aggregating relocation-based quasi-experiments'). We find that relocations to more walkable cities (Walk Score increases of 49 and higher) are associated with increases of about 1,100 daily steps, equivalent to 11 minutes more walking activity every day36. a, Difference in average daily steps aggregated across all relocations. We find that significantly more walkable locations are associated with increases of about 1,100 daily steps, and significantly less walkable locations are associated with similar decreases (for 49–80 point Walk Score increase or decrease). Moving to locations of similar walkability is associated with unchanged physical activity levels. b, Higher walkability is associated with increased daily steps across age, gender, BMI and baseline activity level groups. Bars show the steps gained per day for each point increase in walkability score (assuming linear model; Methods). Positive values across all bars reveal that, with increasing walkability, more steps are taken by every subgroup, which is significant for all the subgroups except women over 50 years of age (Student's t-tests, all P < 0.05; women over 50 years of age, P = 0.14). Notably, we attempt to estimate the impact of substantial built environment changes in-place on physical activity through events of substantial built environment changes resulting from relocation. This approach provides unique advantages, as substantial in-place changes are exceedingly rare and costly, leading to recent calls for quasi-experimental study designs such as ours37. However, this approach could lead to biased estimates due to selection effects, such as participants moving to a new environment being particularly motivated to increase physical activity. Importantly, we find robust evidence that our estimates are unlikely to be significantly influenced by such selection effects. Critical to this argument are (1) that we find no evidence of increases in average physical activity of participants when they are relocating to environments with walkability scores similar to the environment from which they came (bootstrapped 95% confidence interval for walkability differences between −16 and 16 is [−76 to 122]) and (2) that the estimated relationship between walkability differences and physical activity is approximately point symmetric (Fig. If participants that moved were motivated to increase their physical activity after moving, we should have observed this increase also for relocations to environments of similar walkability, but we did not observe any difference. If participants that moved relocated to higher-walkability locations specifically for this quality, a form of residential self-selection, we should have observed higher physical increases relative to physical activity decreases when relocating to a lower-physical-activity location. Instead, we observed point symmetric changes. In addition, we observe that these increases are sustained over 3 months after moving (Supplementary Fig. 3c and Extended Data Fig. Furthermore, we find similar, consistent effects of walkability increases and decreases between cities in similar climates (for example, Ellicott City, MD to New York, NY in Fig. 2a), and more generally across relocations during all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6), and after relocating to cities of higher, similar and lower median household income (Supplementary Fig. In addition, census data suggest that between 77% and 98% of participants that move do not move for walkability reasons, but instead for family, job and housing-related reasons (Methods: ‘Selection effects in relocation and mobile app usage'). We also find that relocating and non-relocating app users are similar in age, gender and weight status, and that those relocating to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5; Methods: ‘Selection effects in relocation and mobile app usage'). Overall, these results suggest that physical activity levels are directly influenced by the built environment and not simply a product of personal preferences or other types of selection effects. We find that higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and baseline activity level groups, which is significant for all the subgroups except women over 50 years of age (Fig. 2b; all P < 0.05; women over 50 years of age, P = 0.14). Previous research has identified additional barriers to physical activity relevant to older women including cultural expectations, norms, societal messages discouraging physical activity, family priorities and safety38,39. The relationship between walkability and activity is strongest for highly active women (gaining 43.7 steps per walkability point increase). Importantly, we find that regardless of BMI status, individuals record more steps after moving to more walkable cities, and that these increases are also shared by individuals who were less active before moving (Fig. These findings suggest that compared with interventions targeting individuals and reaching small numbers of people, changes to the built environment can influence large populations. However, the relatively smaller effect for older women suggests that, for this group in particular, built environment changes may need to be accompanied by additional age- and gender-specific interventions aimed at their specific constraints. Previous work has described person-level factors that impede physical activity participation of older women, such as a greater number of functional impairments that discourage activity, more frequent caregiving demands that interfere with physical activity, more difficulties with outdoor wayfinding and lower driving rates, which can limit their ability to get to local parks to exercise40,41,42,43,44,45. In addition, older women are less well served by public transit in many US cities, which base their routes on commuter patterns46,47. Therefore, multilevel interventions that focus on social environmental factors in addition to built environment factors are recommended, such as encouraging walking groups and advising on how to overcome the above types of personal barriers41,48. Next, we investigate whether the walkability-induced increase in steps reflected an increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), which has been shown to be beneficial for many health outcomes, including lower all-cause mortality risk14,15. Using minute-by-minute step data, we find that extra steps taken after moving to a more walkable location are predominantly composed of MVPA corresponding to brisk walks (Fig. We estimate that large increases in walkability (that is, 49–80 points) are associated with an increase in MVPA of about 1 hour per week (Fig. Further emphasizing the consistency and symmetry of built environment effects, we find that similar amounts of MVPA are lost when relocating to a less walkable location (Fig. 3b), and that the activity intensity distribution remains effectively unchanged when relocating to a similarly walkable location (Fig. US national physical activity guidelines recommend, similar to international guidelines, 150 minutes or more per week of MVPA to obtain optimal health benefits49. For a walkability increase of between 48 and 80 points, we find that the associated increases in MVPA would support 42.5% of participants meeting guidelines for MVPA versus 21.5% before relocation, a 98% relative increase (Fig. 3e; Methods: ‘Physical activity measure' and ‘Simulating the impact of walkability improvements'). Our findings substantively expand on the findings of previous literature, indicating that improving the walkability of built environments can lead to better health outcomes across large populations. a–c, Changes in physical activity stratified by intensity of physical activity (steps per minute) following relocation to more (a; more than 16-point walkability increase), less (b; more than 16-point walkability decrease) and similarly (c; 16-point walkability difference or less) walkable environments. a, We find that walkability-induced additional physical activity (Fig. 2a) predominantly consists of MVPA, which has been shown to be beneficial for many health outcomes14,15. b, Moving to less walkable locations is associated with a symmetric loss of MVPA that is equivalent to the increase in more walkable locations (a). c, Further, moving to similarly walkable locations is associated with an unchanged distribution of intensity levels. This suggests that relocation, in and of itself, is not generally associated with increases in physical activity, for instance, owing to an individual's motivation to increase physical activity. d, Change in MVPA (minutes per week) versus differences in walkability. ΔT(I) is defined as the change in weekly minutes (ΔT) of activity at intensity level I after relocation, in units of steps per minute. ΔTMVPA, that is, change in the time spent in MVPA, is computed by summing ΔT(I) for I ≥ 100 (inset). Large increases in walkability (that is, 49–80 points) are associated with an increase of about 1 hour per week in MVPA. e, The increases in time spent in MVPA lead to twice as many participants meeting national and international aerobic physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes per week or more in MVPA (before 21.5%, after 42.5%). f, A simulation based on these estimates predicts that if all US cities had the walkability of Chicago or Philadelphia (a walkability score of 78), then individuals would increase their average daily step activity by 443 steps and their MVPA per week by 24 minutes, which would mean that 11.2% or 36 million more Americans would then meet national physical activity guidelines for MVPA (Methods). We perform a simulation study to predict how improving walkability would support increasing the fraction of the US population that meets aerobic physical activity guidelines (Methods: ‘Simulating the impact of walkability improvements'). Our dataset covers 1,609 US cities, which are home to more than 41% of the country's population (137 million), and we adjust for age differences between the smartphone user population and the US adult population. According to our smartphone-based objective measurements, about 18% or 58 million Americans met the guidelines for MVPA between 2013 and 2016. Our estimate of 18% meeting aerobic guidelines is within expectations, given well-established differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity50,51. 3f) predicts that bringing all US locations to the level of Chicago or Philadelphia (a walkability score of 78) may lead to 11.2% or 36 million more Americans meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines. Bringing all US locations to the level of New York City (a walkability score of 89) may lead to 14.5% or 47 million more Americans meeting these guidelines. There are limitations to the device-based instrument (that is, people's personal smartphones) we used to collect physical activity data in participants' natural environments. For example, our sample may be biased towards individuals of higher socioeconomic status and people interested in their activity and health. However, we find that walkability improvements led to increased physical activity after relocating to cities of higher, similar and lower median household income (Supplementary Fig. We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city's walkability (for example, climate, availability of transit, or land use mix)52,53. However, we find that walkability differences are associated with physical activity differences in cities of similar climate (Supplementary Fig. 5) and across all seasons (Supplementary Fig. While relocation uniquely enables the quasi-experimental study of behavioural changes in different environments, there may be selection effects driving relocation, referred to as residential self-selection20. However, as previously discussed, we report evidence against such selection effects. Over 90% of adults in the USA already own a smartphone54 and the number of mobile connections worldwide has risen to 8.5 billion55, exhibiting significant year-to-year increases. Therefore, we expect any biases related to smartphone ownership and usage to continue to diminish in the future. This study is restricted to a single country and results may not generalize to other countries. However, previous studies have found, in general, similar types of built environment relationships across countries diverse in climate, demographics, income, culture and activity supportiveness5,56,57,58. As these studies used walkability indices that were based on elements shared with the measure used here (Methods: ‘Walkability measure'), this suggests that our findings may generalize to other countries. We chose a simple, highly used and extensively validated measure of walkability at a city level59,60,61,62,63,64. However, this type of aggregated, non-divisible walkability score precludes the ability to identify which elements of walkability may confer the largest benefits. Location data to assess walkability on a neighbourhood or census tract level was not available, preventing the analysis of within-city variation in walkability. Further research is needed to identify key environmental features on a neighbourhood level and disentangle their individual contributions, building on past cross-sectional research and smaller-scale studies using self-reported physical activity measures, which currently constitute the majority of research in the field65. Future research is also needed to untangle how the built environment may differentially affect physical activity related to leisure, transportation and working. While walking is the most popular aerobic physical activity66, our dataset may fail to capture time spent in activities where it is impractical to carry a phone (for example, football) or for which steps are not a major component of the activity (for example, bicycling), and there may exist systematic differences in wear time because participants in the current dataset had to carry their phone for steps to be recorded. The increasing prevalence of wearable activity trackers in the form of smartwatches and similar devices will continue to enable more convenient methods of capturing daily movement and steps. Further, our smartphone dataset reproduces previously established relationships between activity across geographic locations, gender and age3. We also find that the span of time over which steps were recorded is uncorrelated with relocating to higher- or lower-walkability areas (Extended Data Fig. 7), and thus systematic wear time differences are unlikely to affect our analyses. Together, these findings increase confidence that our dataset is able to identify activity differences between built environments and groups based on gender, age and weight status. Further research is needed to determine which policies, on topics such as land use mix, intersection design and access to public transit, are most effective in increasing city walkability for both new and existing urban areas53. While increasing walkability of all cities to the level of New York City is probably not possible, earlier research has shown promising connections between implemented changes to the built environment, walkability and physical activity67. The results of our analysis will provide researchers and policy-makers with the information to estimate the effects of targeted increases in walkability on physical activity and weigh the cost effectiveness of changes to the built environment against other public health interventions. This countrywide natural experiment presents prospective evidence of built environments affecting physical activity across 7,447 relocations among 1,609 US cities over a 3-year timespan. It reveals the direct behavioural impacts of differing built environments on the physical activity levels of individuals and demonstrates the utility of such massive, digitally enabled, real-world datasets for evidence-based policy. Our findings suggest that designing built environments to be more activity-friendly could have significant effects on the physical activity of large populations, and serve as a powerful complement to interventions that focus on changing behaviour at the individual level. However, changes in built environments may need to be accompanied by additional age- and gender-specific interventions aimed at specific subgroups who could particularly benefit from physical activity increases (that is, women over 50 years old). The quality of the prospective device-collected evidence and consistency of findings across numerous cities, demographic groups and relocation-related walkability differentials highlight the fundamental importance of the urban built environment in improving physical activity and health. We conducted a countrywide, prospective, longitudinal physical activity study of US residents that evaluated their physical activity levels within the context of the walkability of their built environments before and after relocation (‘participants'). We leveraged the naturally occurring physical activity data that was captured by a health app on participants' phones to compare each person's physical activity levels before and after they relocated to a different area within the USA. While similar relocation-based study designs have been used previously to estimate effects of place and built environments26,68,69, the vast majority have been limited by relatively small sample sizes, using only self-report physical activity measurement and the limited diversity with respect to the areas to which they relocated. Objective measures of both urban walkability and physical activity were used and are discussed in more detail throughout the Methods. We analysed anonymized, prospectively collected data from 2,112,288 US smartphone users using the Azumio Argus health app over 3 years (March 2013 to February 2016) to identify 5,424 participants that relocated 7,447 times among 1,609 US cities. These 1,609 cities are home to 137 million Americans, or more than 42% of the US population. We note that relocation is neither purely exogenous nor random, and discuss the important implications of this below. We follow established best practices for analysing large-scale health data from wearables and smartphone apps70. The Azumio Argus app is a free smartphone application for tracking physical activity and other health behaviours. Participants were excluded from a particular analysis if necessary information was unreported (for example, participants with no reported age were excluded from the analysis of Fig. Extended Data Table 1 includes basic statistics on study population demographics and weight status (BMI). Anonymized Azumio Argus app data was obtained through a Data Use Agreement. Data handling and analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Stanford University Institutional Review Board, which deemed this study exempt. For population size statistics, refer to Extended Data Tables 1–3. All error bars throughout this paper correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals. When these bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals do not include the null value (typically 0), they indicate a statistically significant difference at the α = 0.05 level. All statistical hypothesis tests were two-sided Student's t-tests unless indicated otherwise. We defined participant relocation as the action of moving to a new place for a substantial amount of time. We identified participant relocation as follows. Participant location on a given day was assigned to a city based on the weather update in the participant's app activity feed. Weather updates are automatically added to the feed of each participant according to the nearest cell phone tower. We searched for participants that stayed in one location within a 100-km radius for at least 14 days and then moved to a different location that was at least 100 km away. Participants were required to stay within a 100-km radius of this new location for at least another 14 days. The 14-day threshold was chosen to filter out short trips that may be related to business or leisure travel. Using this threshold, we find that most participants do not relocate again and spend a median of 81 days in the new location, effectively excluding the impact of short-term travel on our analyses. Most participants stopped tracking their activity at this time, rather than relocating again. In addition, we repeated our analyses with thresholds of 21 and 30 days and found highly consistent results (Extended Data Fig. We required a substantial move distance (100 km or more) to ensure that relocating participants were exposed to a new built environment. We allowed for up to 5 days of intermediate travel between these two locations and ignored these days during analyses. We applied this method to 2,112,288 users of the Argus smartphone app and identified 31,034 relocations. Among these, we required participants to have used the app to track their physical activity for at least 10 days within the 30 days before and after their relocation (as in previous work3). We further required at least 1 day of tracked physical activity before and after relocation to ensure that, whenever we compare two participant populations, these populations are identical and therefore comparable (that is, we seek to identify within-participant changes in physical activity). We repeated our statistical analyses with alternative data inclusion criteria, such as the number of days with tracked physical activity, and found similar results. Our device-based (historically often called objective) measure of physical activity was the number of steps over time recorded by the participant's smartphone. Steps were determined based on the smartphone accelerometers and the manufacturer's proprietary algorithms for step counting. The Azumio Argus app records step measurements on a minute-by-minute basis. These measurements are collected passively without requiring the smartphone or Azumio Argus app to be in active use. Extended Data Table 2 includes basic statistics on physical activity and tracking in the study population. Data from the Azumio Argus app have been used previously to study physical activity in large populations3,71,72, where the authors showed that this form of data follows well-established trends3. For example, they demonstrated that activity decreased with increasing age12,19,73,74 and BMI19,74,75, and is lower in female individuals than in male individuals12,19,73,74,76, trends that are consistent with national surveillance data in this area. Physical activity estimates were also reasonably well correlated with self-report-based population estimates on a country level3. Several studies have established significant differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity50,51. Self-reports typically overestimate moderate and vigorous activity and underestimate sedentary activity50. In a US study using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2006 data, 59.6% of adults self-reported meeting MVPA guidelines for aerobic physical activity, whereas estimates using accelerometry were much lower at 9.6%51. For our observation period between 2013 and 2016, the US National Health Interview Survey reported that 49.6–52.6% of the US population met MVPA guidelines. Nationally representative accelerometer-based estimates for this time are not available. Our smartphone-accelerometry-based estimate of 18% meeting aerobic guidelines is within expectations, given well-established differences between accelerometer-derived and self-reported physical activity and earlier data (Methods)50,51. In addition, unlike many previous studies mailing accelerometers to study participants to wear for a week, our study focuses on real-world physical activity by free-living individuals that may not be equally affected by their awareness of being observed (that is, the Hawthorne effect). We filtered out days as invalid when less than 500 or more than 50,000 steps had been recorded. We further ignored days immediately preceding and following the relocation itself (5 days before and 5 days after relocation), because the process of relocating, rather than the new built environment itself, could impact physical activity during these days. Physical activity was relatively stable outside this period (Supplementary Fig. We considered physical activity within a window of 30 days before and 30 days after relocation (with the exception of Supplementary Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2 that use 90-day windows to illustrate long-term changes). In total, our dataset included 248,266 days of objectively measured minute-by-minute physical activity surrounding 7,447 relocations (595,803 days for the 180-day period). We used the following measures as primary outcomes in this study: (1) Change in average daily steps following relocation (Figs. (2) Change in average weekly minutes spent in MVPA following relocation, where we considered all minutes spent at intensities greater than or equal to 100 steps per minute as MVPA36: \(\Delta {T}_{{\rm{MVPA}}}={\sum }_{I=100}^{\infty }\Delta T(I)\), where ΔT(I) is defined as the change in weekly minutes of activity at intensity level I, in units of steps per minute, after moving. Figure 3a–c shows changes in average weekly minutes spent at different intensity levels. (3) Change in the fraction of the population that met aerobic physical activity guidelines following relocation, defined as spending at least 150 minutes per week in MVPA1 (Fig. All error bars correspond to bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals77. We considered relocations among 1,609 cities in the USA. Walkability scores for these cities were based on the publicly available and systematically developed Walk Score78. Scores are on a scale of 1 to 100 (where 100 is the most walkable) and are based on amenities (for example, grocery stores, schools, parks, restaurants and retail) within a 0.25-mile to 1.5-mile radius (a decay function penalizes more distant amenities) and measures of friendliness to pedestrians, such as city block length and intersection density. Extended Data Table 3 includes basic statistics on the cities included in our study and their walkability scores. Walk Scores at the city level are computed by weighting the Walk Score of each geographic unit within a city (typically about the size of a city block) by the population density of that unit79. The Walk Score measure is a frequently used measure of walkability that is freely and widely available across the USA and other countries including Canada and Australia78. It is highly correlated62 with other walkability measures80,81,82, and was found to offer the best fit to walking trips in a study conducted in Montréal62. It is widely used in the literature and has been extensively validated59,60,61,62,63,64. Although other measures of walkability exist80,81,82, the Walk Score measure was chosen in light of the pragmatic focus of the investigation and its ease of use and accessibility. More comprehensive walkability indices could provide further granular information related to specific aspects of walkability that might be of prime importance. We determined cut points for Walk Score differences of −16 to +16, 16 to 48 and 49 to 80, as we preferred cut points that were symmetric around 0 (no change in walkability score), equivalent in size (32 Walk Score points difference) and balanced granularity and statistical power, as large Walk Score differences are more rare. Among the 7,447 relocations, 2.4% (2.4%) were associated with 49+ walkability point increases (decreases), 20.7% (21.3%) were associated with 16–48 walkability point increases (decreases) and 53.1% of relocations were to locations of similar walkability (−16 to +16 point difference). We aggregated changes in physical activity following relocation based on the difference in walkability scores between the origin and destination city, Δ. 2a, each circle corresponds to a pair of cities sized by the number of participants moving between those cities. We fit a linear model mΔ + b to these data with slope m = 16.6 (Student's t-test; P < 10−10) and intercept b = 25.0 (Student's t-test; P = 0.462). We considered potential confounders such as differences in climate (using Köppen climate type83) and median income between the origin and destination city. We found that the relationship between walkability and walking behaviour still holds within pairs of cities with similar climate, for instance, moving from Miami, FL to Jacksonville, FL, or from Amarillo, TX to Euless, TX (see annotations in Fig. 2a as well as more generally in Supplementary Fig. Furthermore, we found similar effects across relocations in all seasons (Supplementary Fig. 6) and relocations to cities with higher, lower and similar median household income levels (Supplementary Fig. We considered the effect of walkability differences on change in physical activity across subgroups based on demographics (ages 18–29, 30–49 and 50+ years), weight status (normal, overweight and obese levels of BMI), previous activity level (below 5,000, 5,000–8,500 and above 8,500 average daily steps before relocation) and gender (men and women). Owing to the approximately linear nature of the relationship between walkability changes and physical activity changes (Fig. 2a), we used a linear model for estimation. For each subgroup, we ran independent linear regressions of the difference in daily steps on differences in walkability between cities at the level of individual relocations. The models included an intercept coefficient: m ⋅ Δ + b. We determined the estimated coefficient of walkability (m; that is, the increase in daily steps for each one-point increase in walkability of a city) along with 95% confidence intervals (based on Student's t-distribution) for each subgroup (Fig. We performed Student's t-tests on the regression model coefficients, which establish that relocation to a city of higher walkability is associated with significantly more daily steps across all age, gender, BMI and activity level groups (Student's t-test; all P < 0.05), with the exception of women over 50 years old, for which the positive difference was not statistically significant (Student's t-test, P = 0.14). We found that the effect was diminished in overweight and obese women relative to normal-weight women. Thus, the non-significant effect on women over 50 years of age may be explained, in part, by the larger average BMI of this group (27.4) compared with other women (25.3; P < 10−10). In comparison, men over 50 years of age also had a larger BMI compared with other men, but the difference was smaller than in women (28.2 versus 27.0; P < 10−7). Physical activity is influenced by climate and weather84 and relocations are not equally distributed across seasons (Supplementary Fig. We found that differences in physical activity levels following relocations may be influenced by seasonal variation, especially when considering comparatively long observation periods of about 6 months (Supplementary Fig. For analyses of variation in activity over time (Fig. 1e,f, Extended Data Fig. 1 and 3), we adjusted for these seasonal effects by weighting relocations in each calendar month equally. This was achieved by first estimating physical activity levels separately for each calendar month and then taking the average. This process is repeated 1,000 times in our bootstrap estimates. While relocation uniquely enabled the quasi-experimental study of behavioural changes in different environments, there may be selection effects driving relocation, often referred to as residential self-selection. According to a 2013 US Census Bureau report, 98% of people moved primarily for reasons of housing, family and employment85. Less than 1% of people moved primarily for health reasons. There are some categories that might, in part, include people who want to reduce their dependence on cars. These include ‘health reasons' (0.4%), ‘other housing-related' (14.0%), ‘wanted better neighborhood/less crime' (3.2%) and ‘to be closer to work/easier commute' (5.4%), suggesting that at least 77% of participants moved for reasons completely unrelated to car dependence85. In addition, neighbourhood selection may be influenced by personal preferences such as exercise and walking activities20. With respect to this possibility, note that we found no indication of increases in physical activity after moving to a location of similar walkability (Figs. This suggests that those relocating participants are not simply more motivated to exercise, on average, but that changes in physical activity may be explained by the changing built environment. It is possible that selection effects were absent because participants may not have perceived themselves as being observed, in contrast to previous studies that featured explicit, short periods of monitoring (Hawthorne effect). We further acknowledge that other city characteristics may affect walking and be correlated with the city's walkability (for example, length of work days). We investigated potential selection effects further by comparing the population of relocating mobile app users, first, to the overall US population, and, second, to the overall mobile app user population, including non-relocating app users. We found that the relocating participant population is similar in age (36 versus 37.7 years median age) and gender (49.8% versus 51.0% female, P = 0.132; Student's t-test) to the US population (Extended Data Fig. We adjusted for differences in age for the simulation estimates in Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. Within the app user population, we found that movers and non-movers (that is, relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be close in age (43.8 versus 37.9 and 38.5 versus 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. 4a,b), and weight status (68.1% versus 59.8% and 45.6% versus 44.3% overweight and obese for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 versus 5,825 and 5,279 versus 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively; Extended Data Fig. Furthermore, we found that within movers, those that relocate to higher-, similar- and lower-walkability locations were similar in age, weight status and previous physical activity levels (Extended Data Fig. We simulated the impact of US nationwide walkability improvements on US population physical activity levels. Concretely, we simulated the impact of increasing US city walkability scores to a constant target walkability score between 1 and 100. We also highlight the walkability scores of Chicago and Philadelphia (78) as well as New York City (89) to aid interpretation. As the relocation population was not explicitly drawn to be representative of the US population, we adjusted our estimates through ratio-based post-stratification weights across age-based strata86. We used civilian population estimates from the US Census Bureau for 2016 as the target population distribution. While there were no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female versus 51.0% female, P = 0.132; Extended Data Fig. 3a), we found slight differences in age (36.0 versus 37.7 years median age; Extended Data Fig. 3b), which we corrected for through sampling weights. We acknowledge that other selection effects and heterogeneous treatment effects may exist. Using a bootstrap with 1,000 replications, we estimated the difference in the overall US population that would meet US national aerobic physical activity guidelines for MVPA1 after relocating based on the relocation-induced difference in walkability. We used a linear regression model and data from relocations associated with both walkability increases and decreases. We estimated the total fraction of US population meeting aerobic physical activity guidelines as the sum between the fraction of people already meeting these guidelines before relocating plus the estimated addition based on the regression model.

Observed changes in physical activity levels suggest that built environment influences persist over at least three months and may lead to sustained long-term behavior change. a, While there are no significant differences in the gender distribution (49.8% female vs. 50.4% female, P = 0.423, Z-test), b, We find a slightly lower age in our data for movers compared to the US Census reported movers (36.0 vs 37.7 median age), that we corrected for in the simulation experiment (Fig. Within the study population, we find that movers and non-movers (i.e., relocating and non-relocating participants) tend to be a-b, close in age (43.8 vs 37.9 and 38.5 vs 33.7 average age for men and women, respectively), c-d, and weight status (68.1 vs 59.8 and 45.6 vs 44.3 percent overweight and obese for men and women, respectively). e-f, However, movers were generally more physically active than non-movers (6,284 vs 5,825 and 5,279 vs 4,635 average daily steps for men and women, respectively). Within the study population, we find that movers to higher (greater than 16 walkability points), similar (within 16 walkability points), and lower (less than -16 walkability points) walkability locations tend to be a-b, close in age (44.4 vs 43.7 vs 45.0 and 39.0 vs 38.3 vs 38.3 average age for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively), c-d, weight status (69.3 vs 67.3 vs 66.5 and 46.6 vs 44.9 vs 46.1 percent overweight and obese for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively), e-f, and baseline physical activity levels (6,257 vs 6,229 vs 6,301 and 5,422 vs 5,239 vs 5,405 average daily steps for men and women moving to higher, similar, and lower walkability locations, respectively). After relocation, participants are required to stay in the new location for at least 14, 21, or 30 days. We find that all of these definitions lead to highly consistent results as most relocating participants stay for substantially longer periods of time (median 81 days). In the rest of the paper, we use the 14 day definition (purple). Participants have an average span of 14.2h between the first and last recorded step, our proxy for daily wear time (Methods). a, Wear time estimates before and after relocation are 14.16 hours and 14.18 hours, respectively, with no significant difference (P = 0.807; t-test). b, We find no significant association between relocation-induced difference in walkability and wear time. The line shows the best linear fit using data from all relocations. Its slope is not significantly different from zero (slope 0.0014; P = 0.371; t-test). These results suggest that differences in recorded steps after relocation are due to actual differences in physical activity behavior and are not explained by differences in wear time.

Nature volume 644, pages 362–369 (2025)Cite this article Lightweight nanofabricated structures could photophoretically loft payloads in near-space. Proposed structures range from microscale engineered aerosols1, to centimetre-scale thin disks with variations in surface accommodation coefficients2,3, to sandwich structures with nanoscale thickness4,5 that might be extended to metre-scale width6,7. Quantitative understanding of how structural and surface properties determine photophoretic lofting forces is necessary to develop a practical flying device. Here we focus on thermal transpiration as the most promising photophoretic mechanism for lofting large devices8 and present a hybrid analytical–numerical model of the lofting force on a structure that consists of two perforated membranes spaced a small distance apart. We identify optimal structural parameters, including device size, membrane perforation density and distribution of the vertical ligaments that connect the two membranes, each as a function of atmospheric altitude. Targeting these optimal parameters, we fabricate structures with a heterogeneous ligament distribution, which efficiently compromises between structural rigidity and photophoretic performance. We measure how lofting forces generated by these structures depend on pressure using gases with three different molecular weights. We observed photophoretic levitation of a 1-cm-wide structure at an air pressure of 26.7 Pa when illuminated by 750 W m−2, about 55% the intensity of sunlight. Lastly, we describe the preliminary design of a 3-cm-radius device with 10-mg payload capacity at 75-km altitudes and discuss horizontal motion control, overnight settling, and applications in climate sensing, communications and Martian exploration.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers have found why common cuff-based blood pressure readings are inaccurate and how they might be improved, which could improve health outcomes for patients. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is the top risk factor for premature death, associated with heart disease, strokes and heart attacks. The researchers say that some straightforward changes, which don't necessarily involve replacing standard cuff-based measurement, could lead to more accurate blood pressure readings and better results for patients. Their results are reported in the journal PNAS Nexus. Anyone who has ever had their blood pressure taken will be familiar with the cuff-based method. "The auscultatory method is the gold standard, but it overestimates diastolic pressure, while systolic pressure is underestimated," said co-author Kate Bassil from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. "Pretty much every clinician knows blood pressure readings are sometimes wrong, but no one could explain why they are being underestimated -- there's a real gap in understanding," said co-author Professor Anurag Agarwal, also from Cambridge's Department of Engineering. Previous non-clinical studies into measurement inaccuracy used rubber tubes that did not fully replicate how arteries collapse under cuff pressure, which masked the underestimation effect. When the cuff is inflated and blood flow to the lower arm is cut off, it creates a very low downstream pressure. By reproducing this condition in their experimental rig, they determined this pressure difference causes the artery to stay closed for longer while the cuff deflates, delaying the reopening and leading to an underestimation of blood pressure. "We are currently not adjusting for this error when diagnosing or prescribing treatments, which has been estimated to lead to as many as 30% of cases of systolic hypertension being missed," said Bassil. The researchers say that there is a range of potential solutions to this underestimation, which include raising the arm in advance of measurement, potentially producing a predictable downstream pressure and therefore predictable underestimation. This change doesn't require new devices, just a modified protocol. "You might not even need new devices, just changing how the measurement is done could make it more accurate," said Agarwal. The researchers are hoping to secure funding for clinical trials to test their findings in patients, and are looking for industrial or research partners to help refine their calibration models and validate the effect in diverse populations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A University of Colorado Denver engineer is on the cusp of giving scientists a new tool that can help them turn sci-fi into reality. Imagine a safe gamma ray laser that could eradicate cancer cells without damaging healthy tissue. Advanced Quantum Technologies, one of the most impactful journals in the fields of quantum science, materials, and technologies, recognized Sahai's work and featured his study on the cover of its June issue. "It is very exciting because this technology will open up whole new fields of study and have a direct impact on the world," Sahai said. "In the past, we've had technological breakthroughs that propelled us forward such as the sub-atomic structure leading to lasers, computer chips, and LEDs. These electromagnetic fields -- created when electrons in materials vibrate and bounce at incredibly high speeds -- power everything from computer chips to super particle colliders that search for evidence of dark matter. Until now, creating fields strong enough for advanced experiments has required huge, expensive facilities. For example, scientists chasing evidence of dark matter use machines like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, in Switzerland. Running experiments at that scale demands huge resources, is incredibly expensive, and can be highly volatile. This gives scientists a way to see activity like never before and opens the possibility of shrinking miles-long colliders into a chip. It is about understanding how nature works and using that knowledge to make a positive impact on the world." While real-world, practical applications may be years away, the potential to better understand how the universe works, and to thereby improve lives, is what keeps Sahai and Tirumalasetty motivated to spend long hours in the lab and at SLAC. "Gamma ray lasers could become a reality," Sahai said. That means scientists and doctors would be able to see what's going on at the nuclear level and that could accelerate our understanding of immense forces that dominate at such small scales while also leading to better medical treatments and cures. These possibilities excite Tirumalasetty, who once thought of becoming a physicist. "But engineers give scientists the tools to do more than understand. Next up for the duo is a return to SLAC this summer to keep refining the silicon-chip material and laser technique. Unlike in the movies, developing breakthrough technology can take decades. In fact, some of the foundational work that led to this pivotal moment began in 2018, when Sahai published his first research on antimatter accelerators. Aakash Sahai holds a PhD in plasma physics from Duke University, a master's degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, and a master's degree in physics from Indiana University, Bloomington. Before joining CU Denver in 2018, he worked as a research associate at Imperial College London and held research and development roles in the private sector. Sahai has published more than a dozen articles in peer-reviewed journals and is a frequent speaker at SLAC, CERN, and American Physical Society events. He also serves as a reviewer for several scientific journals. During his master's degree, he worked as a research assistant for Sahai to develop this technological setup at SLAC.

Ask anyone what they dread about aging, and the thought of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia is likely an answer high on the list. The irreversible symptoms of dementia only worsen with time and can become severe enough for the person to struggle remembering the faces of those close to them and even their own identity. There is no cure for dementia (even though treatments that mitigate symptoms do exist). However, answers for prevention may lie in the brains of superagers, individuals over the age of 80 who have memories superior to others in their age group and can recall things as well as people decades younger. A Northwestern University study that spanned 25 years studied the lifestyles and brain activity of superagers both during life and in those who had donated their brains postmortem. What the researchers at the Northwestern Alzheimer's Disease Research Center found were physical differences in brain structures that delayed symptoms of brain aging that often lead to dementia. Superagers would remember at least as many words from a list read to them as neurotypical adults who were 20 to 30 years younger. The average brain usually does not stay so remarkably intact. “During the first 25 years of this program, we established that superagers constitute not only a neuropsychological but also a neurobiological phenotype distinctive from cognitively average age peers,” they said in a study recently published in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Somehow, their cerebral cortex resists thinning that is often a cause of neurodegenerative diseases. This outermost portion of the brain, also known as gray matter, is made of tightly packed neurons and responsible for higher-level processes that include memory, as well as learning, thought, reasoning, intelligence, language, decision-making, emotion, and personality. The cingulate gyrus also processes memory, along with emotion, self-regulation and pain. Their brains also show fewer signs that often indicate the onset of Alzheimer's, such as less plaque buildup. Superagers were discovered to have larger entorhinal neurons, which are found in the entorhinal cortex and involved in memory of times, places and objects. There is also a greater density of von Economo neurons, which speed up information processing, in their brains. Many suffered from stress and were not able to get adequate sleep. The one thing that most superagers did have in common was that they were had active social lives, making extracurricular activities a regular part of their lives. They even reported having more positive relationships with others than people around the same age who were cognitively average. There are some aspects of this phenomenon that have yet to surface: whether superagers are born with larger brains, or with factors that make their brains almost immune to the ravages of time that cause others to experience the effects of brain degeneration. Either way, researchers are going to remember these findings for future studies. “This line of work is helping to revise common misperceptions about the cognitive potential of senescence and has inspired [more] investigations.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.

The discovery of quasicrystals, characterized by unique, non-repeating atomic arrangements and forbidden rotational symmetries, has significantly expanded our understanding of structural order in materials. However, precise control over quasiperiodic length scales remains challenging due to the inherent constraints of atomic arrangements and chemical compositions. In this study, we utilized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a designable platform to generate moiré patterns including dodecagonal quasiperiodic symmetry through the projection of twisted bilayer structures. Through rational ligand design based on isoreticular principles, the characteristic length scales of the resulting patterns can be systematically modulated, as demonstrated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and mathematical analysis. While the observed patterns exhibit characteristics reminiscent of quasicrystals, they result from the incidental stacking of twisted layers rather than intrinsic quasicrystalline order. This work provides a conceptual framework for incorporating quasiperiodicity into reticular chemistry and expands the structural design space for functional moiré materials. Unlike most crystals that have repeating atomic patterns, quasicrystals have unique arrangements that never repeat and feature forbidden rotational symmetries, such as five-, seven-fold, or even higher ones2. These unique arrangements exhibit intriguing properties in lasing2, optics3, magnetism4, electronics5, and heat6, leading to the rapid expansion of the quasicrystal universe, including chalcogenides7,8, mesoporous silica9, dendritic liquid crystals10, binary nanoparticles11, colloids12, and polymers13. Despite the wide range of quasiperiodic length scales from a few to several hundred angstroms (Fig. 1A)14,15, systematic control over these length scales remains a formidable challenge, because changes in chemical composition can alter atomic interactions, leading to structural distortions or destabilization of octagonal, decagonal, and dodecagonal quasiperiodic patterns16. A Lengths for quasicrystalline materials are adapted from a previous study14. Lengths for quasiperiodic moiré materials are defined based on the 3rd inflation of the Stampfli-tiling, as shown in Fig. B Moiré pattern formed by twisted bilayer Zr-MOFs. We explored the potential for tunable quasiperiodic scales by utilizing MOFs as a highly designable materials platform through the judicious selection of metal clusters and organic ligands17. By employing the principles of isoreticular design, MOFs can accommodate organic ligands with varying length scales while maintaining the overall structure, enabling systematic modulation of the characteristic length scales of quasiperiodic patterns18,19. The building blocks possessing particular forbidden rotational symmetries could be used to promote the formation of quasicrystalline MOFs. However, when a pyrrole-based organic ligand with pseudo-five-fold symmetry was employed in MOFs, the desired five-fold symmetry was frustrated upon coordination with metal clusters20. While the number of MOFs with quasicrystal approximants is increasing21,22,23,24 and interest in aperiodic MOFs continues to grow25,26, quasicrystals and MOFs are still regarded as distinct classes of materials27. As an alternative, we envisioned the use of the moiré pattern, an interference pattern arising from the superposition of periodic structures (Fig. In condensed matter physics, the moiré pattern has emerged as a crucial tool for studying topological bands and Berry curvature33. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), for example, exhibits intriguing properties such as superconductivity and electronic correlations at specific twist angles34,35,36. However, only the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern can be formed in TBG when the layers are rotated by 30 degrees, and the fixed carbon-carbon (C–C) bond length limits the ability to adjust the quasiperiodic length scales37,38,39. In this study, we successfully demonstrated the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern using triangular MOFs with three different ligands: 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDC), 4,4'-biphenyldicarboxylic acid (BPDC), and azobenzene-4,4'-dicarboxylic acid (AZDC). Through Stampfli-tiling and mathematical derivation, we revealed that the length of quasiperiodicity can be precisely controlled at the angstrom level depending on the ligand length (Fig. This study bridges the gap between quasiperiodicity and MOFs, highlighting the potential of MOFs as a platform for achieving quasiperiodic structures at various length scales. We expect that various quasiperiodic patterns can be achieved beyond the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern by exploiting the structural diversity of MOFs. An isoreticular series of MOFs was synthesized from Zr-based precursors and linear ligands of different length scales, namely NDC, BPDC, and AZDC (Fig. Zr-BPDC and Zr-AZDC were obtained via conventional solvothermal reactions. In contrast, Zr-NDC required degassing by freeze–pump–thaw cycles to selectively yield the desired crystalline product. The hexagonal Zr-based clusters form a triangular lattice, and when the Zr₁₂ cluster is considered as a vertex, the MOF layer adopts the hxl topology40,41,42,43. The respective MOFs are denoted as Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC. The MOF nanosheets were obtained by exfoliating bulk samples through sonication for several hours, following a method adapted from Foster et al. (see “Methods” section)44. These exfoliated nanosheets were subsequently analyzed by TEM, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) using small, consistent amount of MOF samples (50–150 µL) to ensure reproducibility (Methods section). The TEM imaging revealed well-defined triangular lattices, with inter-cluster distances of 1.7, 1.9, and 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, respectively (Fig. 1), demonstrating precise and systematic control over the lattice size. The Zr-MOFs exhibited hexagonal nanosheets with a thickness ranging from 1.7 to 20 nm, as confirmed by SEM and AFM images (Supplementary Figs. In contrast, bulk samples were used for gas adsorption studies, as larger quantities were required for this measurement. The porosity of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC was examined by N2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K, revealing uptakes of 487, 362, and 226 cm3g−1 with corresponding Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas of 741, 1101, and 762 m2g−1, respectively (Supplementary Figs. A Hexagonal Zr12 cluster (Zr, cyan; O, red; C, gray) and linear NDC, BPDC, and AZDC ligands. B Model structures of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC MOFs. The inter-cluster distances are indicated. H atoms and formate are omitted for clarity. C Fourier-filtered TEM images along the [001] zone axis of Zr-MOFs (scale bar, 5 nm) with inset of the FFT patterns (scale bar, 1 nm−1). D Pawley refinements of synchrotron PXRD patterns for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC. A minor broad feature preceding the (100) reflection was observed for Zr-AZDC, possibly attributed to a small amount of amorphous contribution. However, the sharp Bragg peaks indicate that the overall crystallinity of the material is well preserved. Pawley refinement was performed to accurately determine the unit cell parameters and assess the phase purity of the Zr-MOFs (Fig. The refined patterns showed excellent agreement with the synchrotron PXRD data, yielding cell parameters of a = 17.34(15) Å, c = 23.71(21) Å in P63/m for Zr-NDC (Rp = 1.7%, Rwp = 3.1%), a = 19.50(29) Å, c = 23.97(36) Å in P63/mmc for Zr-BPDC (Rp = 2.5%, Rwp = 6.0%), and a = 21.33(8) Å, c = 24.03(9) Å in P63/m for Zr-AZDC (Rp = 1.0%, Rwp = 1.7%), confirming the triangular lattice structure. The laboratory PXRD patterns of bulk Zr-MOFs also closely matched the simulated hxl structure, with prominent peaks corresponding to the (hk0) planes (Supplementary Fig. The observed peak broadening and asymmetry suggest random stacking of the layers41. The experimental and simulated PXRD patterns were compared by adjusting the simulated patterns to incorporate the preferred orientation of the (100) plane, given that the hxl MOFs adopt nanosheet morphologies. In the PXRD pattern of the as-synthesized samples, l-dependent peaks, such as the (101) and (202) planes, were slightly observed (Supplementary Fig. In particular, Zr-AZDC exhibited sharper peaks, indicating more ordered layer stacking. However, these l-dependent peaks disappeared after sonication, suggesting that sonication disrupts the ordered stacking. The absence of l-dependent peaks, combined with peak broadening, indicates a disordered, layered structure along the c-direction, consistent with the findings reported by C. P. Gray41. It is important to note that the Zr-BPDC system can adopt different polymorphs, including fcu and hcp structures. When comparing the experimental PXRD pattern with the simulated pattern of the fcu Zr-BPDC structure, distinct differences in peak positions were observed, confirming that the synthesized MOF is not fcu structure (Supplementary Fig. In addition, characteristic peaks associated with the hcp polymorph, specifically the (002), (100), (101), and (102) planes, are absent in the PXRD pattern of Zr-BPDC, further confirming that the structure is not the hcp polymorph. Moiré patterns arise either from twisting the same materials at a specific angle or from a lattice mismatch between different materials (Supplementary Fig. In this study, we focused on moiré patterns formed by the former method. Without sonication, the MOF predominantly existed as thick nanosheets rather than well-exfoliated layers, and moiré patterns from overlapping MOF layers were rarely observed. However, after exfoliating the MOF nanosheets through sonication (Methods section), moiré patterns were observed at randomly occurring twist angles in Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, as shown in Fig. We determined the twist angles of the twisted bilayer MOFs using TEM measurements, with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns facilitating the identification of these angles. The moiré patterns observed in the TEM images closely match those in the simulated images created by superimposing two MOF layers. As the twist angle increased, the moiré period decreased (Fig. 3A, B), indicating the repeating pattern became smaller. Due to the higher electron density of Zr clusters compared to the organic components, the FFT spots were primarily influenced by the Zr clusters arranged within the triangular lattice. We also observed satellite peaks in the FFT patterns of the moiré TEM images (Supplementary Fig. This phenomenon has been noted in another moiré material, twisted bilayer graphene, and is attributed to the periodic modulation in the moiré pattern45. Furthermore, we investigated the common angles observed in the Zr-BPDC MOF. Approximately one hundred TEM images were collected from the twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC, revealing a broad range of twist angles. A relatively higher proportion of bilayers exhibiting around 11 degrees (Fig. This result suggests that multiple configurations are accessible, highlighting the structural flexibility of the twisted bilayer MOF rather than a strong preference for a single dominant configuration. Figure 3 presents representative TEM images showing the various moiré patterns observed in the twisted bilayer MOF (see also Supplementary Figs. A Schematic representation of twisted bilayer MOF forming a moiré pattern. θ and λ represent the twist angle and moiré period, respectively. B Relationship between moiré period (λ) and twist angle (θ) for three Zr-MOFs. C FFT patterns (scale bar, 1 nm−1), Fourier-filtered TEM images (scale bar, 10 nm), and model structures for different angles of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF. The representative TEM image corresponds to a twist angle of 11 degrees with a moiré period of approximately 9.9 nm. See also Supplementary Figs. D Histogram of twist angles based on TEM data of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF (the number of samples = 106). Monolayers and multilayers were also inevitably observed, whereas the statistical analysis focused exclusively on the bilayer systems. E Energy profile of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC calculated using LAMMPS. It is noteworthy that TEM images represent the projected interlayer arrangements rather than the intrinsic symmetry of the MOF structure. As a result, although TEM images of structures with twist angles of θ and 60° – θ (where 0° ≤ θ ≤ 60°) appear indistinguishable, the twisted bilayer MOF structures at 0 degrees and 60 degrees are inherently different due to the 3-fold symmetry of the MOF layers (Supplementary Fig. To systematically investigate the effect of this 3-fold symmetry on the energy landscape, we calculated the total energy for twist angles ranging from 0 to 60 degrees (Supplementary Information Section 2). For these calculations, we constructed a superstructure of twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF, where each layer is composed of 37 clusters (Supplementary Fig. Given the exceedingly large number of atoms, performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations was infeasible. Therefore, we employed molecular dynamics (MD) to evaluate the energy at specific twist angles, following a previously established approach31. The bilayer MOF was generated by rotating one layer around the central metal cluster at a given twist angle (Supplementary Fig. Figure 3E presents the total energy of the twisted bilayer Zr-BPDC MOF as a function of the twist angle. The energy profile shows a local minimum between 10 and 15 degrees, indicating that these configurations are energetically favorable. This minimum aligns well with our experimental TEM observations, where bilayers with twist angles around 11 degrees were more frequently observed (Fig. This correlation suggests that while a broad range of twist angles can be experimentally realized, structural and energetic factors may contribute to the higher occurrence of bilayers with angles between 10 and 15 degrees. We further conducted an in-depth mathematical study of moiré patterns to enhance the understanding of the structural properties in triangular lattices. Since moiré patterns arise from the superposition of two MOF layers, the patterns can be decomposed into two periodic triangular lattices (Supplementary Fig. At specific twist angles, the triangular lattices within the twisted bilayer MOF strictly aligned, creating a periodic superlattice referred to as a commensurate superlattice (Supplementary Fig. Through mathematical derivation, we investigated the correlation between twist angle and aperiodicity/periodicity (see Supplementary Information Section 3 for the detailed procedure). The commensuration occurs when twist angle θ satisfies, where m and n are coprime integers and \({|m}-{n|}\) mod 3 ≠ 0 (Supplementary Fig. The mathematical relationship is analogous to that of twisted bilayer graphene38,46,47, despite differences in the lattice structure and symmetry (the triangular lattice with 3-fold symmetry for Zr-MOFs and the hexagonal lattice with 6-fold symmetry for graphene), as the formulation is based on the projected image rather than the intrinsic symmetry of the individual layers (Supplementary Fig. Although the MOF layer intrinsically exhibits 3-fold symmetry, the moiré patterns in TEM images appear to have 6-fold symmetry. This apparent symmetry arises from the projection effects of overlapping triangular lattices, making the moiré patterns appear mirror-symmetric around θ = 30° in TEM observations. The moiré patterns can also be characterized by the moiré period (λ), which represents the distance between successive repetitions of the interference pattern (Fig. Due to the six-fold symmetry of the triangular lattice, the moiré patterns are mirror-symmetric around θ = 30°. In the range of 0 to 30 degrees, the moiré period is determined by where aMOF is the lattice constant of MOFs (corresponding to the inter-cluster distance; 1.7, 1.9, and 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC). Note that the lattice constants of Zr-MOFs differ significantly from that of graphene (0.246 nm), ranging from 85.5 to 88.3% for Zr-NDC to Zr-AZDC. The λ diverges in incommensurate angles. As the twist angle increases, the moiré period decreases, also corroborated by all TEM data of Fig. 19–21 and Supplementary Table 2 present the relationship between commensurate twist angle (θ) and moiré period (λ) for the three MOFs. Consequently, the moiré pattern with a twist angle of 30 degrees corresponds to an aperiodic structure as this angle cannot be expressed by defined criteria involving m and n (Supplementary Figs. Through mathematical derivation, we established that twisted bilayer MOFs with a twist angle of 30 degrees exhibit an aperiodic structure, which lacks translational symmetry but possesses twelve-fold rotational symmetry. The agreement between calculated and observed FFT patterns and TEM images strongly indicated the dodecagonal quasiperiodic structures of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC (Supplementary Figs. To map the quasiperiodic pattern of the MOFs without gaps or overlaps, we employed the Stampfli-tiling, composed of triangles, squares, and rhombuses. The Stampfli tile exhibits a fractal structure with self-similarity, where the same pattern repeats on larger scales with an irrational scaling factor of \(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\) (Fig. Furthermore, the TEM images in Fig. 5D clearly showed triangle, square, and rhombus tiles with increasing edge lengths of 6.13, 6.85, and 7.57 nm within the isoreticular series of MOFs. This observation demonstrates successful control over the length scale of the dodecagonal quasiperiodic pattern. Self-similarity of Stampfli-tiling with an irrational scaling factor of \(\sqrt{2+\sqrt{3}}\)37,48. The length of tiles in 1st inflation (l1) can be approximated as \({a}_{{MOF}}\bullet \cos 15^\circ\), where \({a}_{{MOF}}\) is 1.7, 1.9, 2.1 nm for Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC. A TEM image of Zr-BPDC mapped to Stampfli-tiling with self-similarity (scale bar, 10 nm). B Model structure with a rotational angle of 30 degrees. C Building blocks of the Stampfli tile (3rd inflation). The TEM images were extracted from the TEM image of a representative Zr-BPDC. D TEM images of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC mapped to Stampfli tiles (3rd inflation) of different sizes (scale bar, 10 nm). We demonstrate that quasiperiodic moiré patterns in isoreticular MOFs can be systematically tuned in their characteristic length scales through rational ligand design. Compared to conventional quasicrystals, MOFs offer the advantage of tunable structures, enabling systematic modulation of the length scale in Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC, with edge lengths of 6.13, 6.85, and 7.57 nm, respectively, corresponding to the size of the Stampfli tiles at the 3rd inflation. It is important to note that the observed patterns represent projections of interlayer arrangements rather than intrinsic quasicrystals and are better described as aperiodic composite structures or modulated structures. By employing mathematical derivation, we confirmed the aperiodicity of these patterns, which facilitates systematic investigation of their size-dependent properties and physical behaviors. This study explores the formation of quasiperiodic patterns using highly ordered MOFs. While inspired by graphene studies34,37, chemical tunability and structural diversity of MOFs offer several distinct advantages in the control of quasiperiodic patterns. 1) Length-scale control via ligand design: One fundamental difference is that in our MOF system, the length scale of the quasiperiodic pattern can be systematically controlled by varying the organic ligands, as demonstrated in this study. This tunability provides an additional degree of control that is not inherently available in twisted bilayer graphene with a fixed atomic lattice. 2) Diverse quasiperiodic patterns: Another key distinction is the structural diversity. By utilizing different MOF topologies, it is possible to achieve not only dodecagonal quasiperiodic patterns but also other quasiperiodic tiling, such as octagonal quasiperiodic patterns (Fig. 3) Chemical tunability and interlayer interaction control: The introduction of functional groups into organic ligands can potentially regulate interlayer distance and interactions, thereby influencing the formation and stability of moiré patterns. This level of control is significantly more challenging in graphene, where interlayer interactions are largely dictated by van der Waals forces, rather than by direct chemical modification. The tunability of MOFs in terms of length scale, topology, and chemical functionality differentiates them as a platform for designing quasiperiodic patterns. We believe these distinctions broaden the scope of quasiperiodic material research and create opportunities for functional material design. Dodecagonal and octagonal quasiperiodic patterns demonstrated by twisted bilayer MOFs with hxl, kgd (with a twist angle of 30 degrees), and sql, sql-b topologies (with a twist angle of 45 degrees), respectively. See also Supplementary Figs. We anticipate the development of synthetic strategies for the intentional design of specific twist angles in bilayer MOFs, drawing inspiration from advancements in twisted bilayer graphene, where techniques such as epitaxial growth on SiC49, folding of single layers50, chemical vapor deposition51, and dynamically rotatable monolayers52 have enabled precise angle control. Such progress would allow for a more systematic exploration of structure-property relationships and facilitate fine-tuning of interlayer coupling effects. As demonstrated in twistronics, controlled twist angles in layered materials have led to breakthroughs in electrical, magnetic, and optical properties52,53, highlighting bilayer MOFs as promising candidates for future twistronic applications. Zr-NDC was synthesized by modifying the previously reported synthesis procedure. H2NDC (17.3 mg, 0.08 mmol), ZrOCl2·8H2O (78.0 mg, 0.24 mmol), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 1 mL), and formic acid (250 µL) were combined in a vial. After sonication for 5 min, the solution was transferred in a 10 mL ampule (Diameter: 19 mm, Height: 107 mm). To remove O2 with a Schlenk line, the solution was evacuated and frozen by backfilling with N2 gas to replace the vacuumed air. The cycle was repeated three times to ensure an O2-free atmosphere before sealing the ampule with a flaming torch. The ampule was heated at 120 °C for 48 h and cooled to 30 °C for 12 h. White crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (5 mL) and sonicated for 5 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors. In the synthesis of hxl Zr-NDC, using 250 µL of formic acid sometimes resulted in the presence of both the Zr12-formate cluster and the hxl Zr-NDC MOF, across different synthesis attempts, as confirmed by PXRD pattern (Supplementary Fig. While 250 µL of formic acid was employed for characterization techniques such as TEM, SEM, and AFM, all samples analyzed were confirmed as pure-phase hxl Zr-NDC by PXRD analysis. Upon reducing the formic acid to 190 µL, we consistently synthesized pure-phase hxl Zr-NDC with good reliability (Supplementary Fig. The four samples synthesized with 190 µL of formic acid were used for the adsorption study. Zr-BPDC was synthesized by modifying the previously reported synthesis procedure41. H2BPDC (72.6 mg, 0.3 mmol), ZrCl4 (69.9 mg, 0.3 mmol), DMF (4 mL), formic acid (1 mL), and H2O (200 µL) were combined in a 10 mL vial. The solution was sonicated for 5 min and transferred to a 30 mL PTFE-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 24 h and cooled to 30 °C for 2 h. White crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (5 mL) and sonicated for 5 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors. H2AZDC (40.5 mg, 0.15 mmol), ZrCl4 (35.0 mg, 0.15 mmol), DMF (2 mL), formic acid (0.5 mL), and H2O (30 µL) were combined in a 10 mL vial. The solution was sonicated for 5 min and transferred to a 30 mL PTFE-lined steel autoclave. The autoclave was heated at 150 °C for 24 h and cooled to 30 °C for 2 h. Orange crystals were obtained. The mother liquor was exchanged with fresh DMF (10 mL) and sonicated for 10 min. This process was repeated four times via centrifugation to remove the remaining precursors. Laboratory PXRD patterns were obtained with a Bruker D2 phaser diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54184 Å) using a step size of 0.02° in 2θ and a scan speed of 0.1° s−1. The tube voltage and current were 30 kV and 10 mA. The DMF-washed sample was directly used for PXRD analysis. Detailed DMF washing procedures can be found in Synthesis section. Synchrotron PXRD data were collected at the 6D beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL), Korea. The DMF-washed samples were ground with a mortar for 2 min and then packed into a 0.3 mm capillary. The synchrotron PXRD measurements were performed at 298 K using a Rayonix Ms225-HS detector with an X-ray wavelength of 0.65303 Å (18.986 keV). High-resolution TEM images were acquired on JEM-2100 and JEM-2100F microscopes (JEOL Company) operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV of the UCRF. For sample preparation procedures, see Methods section. TEM imaging and Fourier-filter were performed using Gatan Digital Micrograph software (version 3.5). We applied an array filter to precisely select individual diffraction peaks in the FFT, including both first and higher-order peaks. Simulations of TEM images and electron diffraction pattern were performed with VESTA54 and multi-phase simulation in SingleCrystal 4 software, respectively55,56. The simulated electron diffraction pattern was constructed by superimposing the diffraction pattern of a MOF monolayer along the [001] zone axis. For Zr-NDC, the supernatant was removed from 100 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 5 times) and subsequently sonicated for 4 h. For Zr-BPDC, the supernatant was removed from 50 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 2 h. For Zr-AZDC, the supernatant was removed from 150 µL of the DMF-washed sample through centrifugation. Then, MOF powder was washed with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 4 h. SEM images were obtained on SU8220 Cold FE-SEM (Hitachi High-Technologies) of the UCRF. The accelerating voltage and beam current are 10 kV and 10 µA, respectively. Samples for SEM were prepared by drop-casting a dilute suspension of Zr-MOFs prepared by sonication in EA onto the silicon wafer and Pt-coating using a Hitachi sputter. For SEM analysis, the supernatant was removed from the DMF-washed sample by centrifugation (50 µL for Zr-NDC and Zr-BPDC, 100 µL for Zr-AZDC). The MOF powder was then washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 3 times) and subsequently sonicated for 2 h. AFM images were collected on a Bruker Dimension ICON instrument of the UCRF with ScanAsyst mode. Samples for AFM were prepared by drop-casting a dilute suspension of Zr-MOFs prepared by sonication in EA onto the silicon wafer. For Zr-NDC and Zr-BPDC, 50 µL of the DMF-washed sample was centrifuged to remove the supernatant. The MOF powder was then washed with ethyl acetate (EA, 1 mL X 3 times) and sonicated for 2 h. For Zr-AZDC, the supernatant was removed from 100 µL of the DMF-washed sample by centrifugation. Followed by washing with EA (1 mL X 3 times) and sonication for 4 h. Nitrogen isotherms were obtained at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. For the sorption analysis, several vials (or ampules) of Zr-MOFs were synthesized, washed with DMF (following the procedure mentioned above for each vial), and subsequently washed with EA (total 40 mL X 3 times) by gathering all samples. After sonicating for 2 h, the samples were activated at 120 °C for 12 h under a dynamic vacuum in the sorption instrument. Based on the cell parameters calculated from PXRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. 6), we modeled Zr-BPDC structure with a space group of P63/mmc (a = 18.9140 Å and c = 24.4884 Å) using Materials Studio57. Since peaks corresponding to the (hk0) plane exclusively appeared in the PXRD patterns, the c parameter was adopted from the previously reported Hf-BPDC structure40. The space group changed to P63/m when zigzag ligands were employed (Zr-NDC: a = 16.6970 Å and c = 24.4884 Å, Zr-AZDC: a = 20.7846 Å and c = 24.4884 Å), which is also consistent with structure reported using another zigzag ligand42. To optimize the model structures, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP). The exchange-correlation functional was treated using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) approximation within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The plane-wave basis set was employed with an energy cutoff of 500 eV. Electronic self-consistency was achieved with a convergence criterion of 10−5 eV, while the forces on ions were converged to within 0.03 eV Å−1. To include van der Waals interactions, the DFT-D3 method with Becke-Johnson damping was applied. The final unit cell parameters of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC models were determined by Pawley fitting using the synchrotron PXRD data (see Fig. The authors declare that the data supporting this study are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files. The model structures of Zr-NDC, Zr-BPDC, and Zr-AZDC have been provided in Supplementary Data. Further information is also available from the corresponding authors upon request.

Nature Chemistry (2025)Cite this article The reductive functionalization of inert substrates such as chloroarenes is a critical yet challenging transformation relevant to both environmental remediation and organic synthesis. Combining electricity and light is an emerging strategy to access the deeply reducing potentials required for single electron transfer to chloroarenes, yet this approach is limited by poor stability and mechanistic ambiguity. Here we demonstrate heterogeneous electrophotocatalysis using redox-active rylene diimide polymers for the reduction of chloroarenes. We find that the electrophotocatalytic activity varies dramatically as a function of the rylene diimide and the redox-inactive polymer backbone. In particular, a flexible, non-conjugated perylenediimide polymer outperforms all other tested electrophotocatalysts. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that precomplexation between the doubly reduced perylenediimide and the haloarene substrate is key to productive catalysis. Overall, this work highlights heterogeneous electrophotocatalysis using insoluble redox-active organic materials and provides critical structure–property insights into solid-state electrophotocatalytic activity, informing the development of next-generation materials for sustainable synthesis.
