      If all of this is true, this gives a solid outside-looking-in perspective on how and why we've been seeing such consistently SUS behavior from our gov on this stuff.
    


      I feel it's more confirmatory if anything of the thoughts and suspicions most of us have. But reading it in the form of screenshotted emails with titles that include meeting times for SCIFs (and also EASILY reversible email addresses of key figures in gov that have been shoddily marked LOL) is just on the money.
    


      Read thoroughly line by line, especially the screenshots. Analyze the interactions this whistleblower has been having (with who, about what, when, where, and why) and you'll see what I mean.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In response to the heat and humidity, some Maine communities are opening cooling centers. The house, a 3,100 square foot farmhouse and eight-acre property made famous by the movie series that began in 2013, is open for overnight stays. The owners are Jennifer and Cory Heinzen, paranormal investigators. AUGUSTA, Maine (WGME) -- The real-life Annabelle doll that inspired the horror movie franchise is scheduled to visit Maine in September. This comes after a popular paranormal investigator died suddenly while on tour with the doll. It will feature celebrity guests, panels, eerie vendors, and immersive experiences. The Annabelle exhibit in Maine will be held just weeks after paranormal investigator Dan Rivera died suddenly while on tour with the doll. "His death was nothing suspicious," Adams County Chief Deputy Coroner Scott Pennewill said. No cause of death has been released at this time. The Annabelle doll, a Raggedy Ann doll, was made famous by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who investigated the doll in the 1970s and kept it locked in their occult museum. Elizabeth Stanton and WJAR contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With eyes turned to the skies, stargazers taking in the Perseid meteor shower on Tuesday night witnessed something out of this world. In a publication on Facebook, the Astrolab du parc national du Mont-Mégantic in Quebec's Eastern Townships described it as "a magnificent and luminous spiral streaking across the sky at around 10:40 p.m." Several people in the Montreal area also witnessed the strange phenomenon and reached out to CBC News describing a bright light enveloped by a fuzzy halo and warning of a UFO sighting. While it was certainly unusual, it wasn't really an unidentified flying object, but more likely the result of a rocket launch, according to the Astrolab. "It was in all likelihood the second stage of an Ariane 6 rocket which was igniting its engine in order to de-orbit itself after having released the European satellite Metop-SGA1 in a polar orbit," the Facebook post explained. The European Space Agency confirmed on its website that a weather satellite was launched Tuesday evening at 9:37 p.m. local time, from the European spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana — an overseas department of France located in South America. The new satellite is meant to usher in "a new era of weather and climate monitoring from polar orbit." According to astrophysicist Robert Lamontagne, the rocket's orbit is what allowed for the spectacle to be visible in Quebec. Most of the time rocket launches are on an equatorial orbit and so will be visible near the equator, he said. Annabelle Olivier is a digital journalist at CBC Montreal. She previously worked at Global News as an online producer. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.</p>

As fans eagerly wait for details about The Boys Season 5, Supernatural alum Jared Padalecki has shared a major update about his role in the final installment of the Prime Video series, as well as its release pattern. In a recent discussion, the two-time Teen Choice Awards winner teased some interesting details about his character in The Boys' fifth season, while also revealing when he'll make his debut in the series.

While answering a fan question at the recently conducted Fan Expo in Boston, Jared Padalecki divulged that his character will make their first appearance in The Boys Season 5 Episode 5. Padalecki also mentioned that Prime Video plans to premiere the final season of the superhero series in two batches. (via Collider)

“It's Episode 5 of Season 5,” the 43-year-old actor stated while talking about his Boys debut. He then mentioned a new release pattern for The Boys Season 5, noting, “I think they're putting out the first four episodes and then a little bit of time and then the final four episodes.” This would be a first for the show, as the first season premiered all its episodes in one batch, while following seasons released their episodes on a weekly basis after a three-episode premiere.

Jared Padalecki also disclosed an interesting connection between his character and his Supernatural co-star, Jensen Ackles' Soldier Boy in Season 5, stating, “I'll say this much — my character is very excited to meet Soldier Boy.” He concluded by sharing a disclaimer for his Boys debut, saying, “And for those who are not yet 18, do not watch it.”

With Jared Padalecki and Misha Collins joining The Boys' cast for its final season, fans may be able to witness a significant Supernatural reunion in the show, with Jensen Ackles already playing a pivotal role in the series. While The Boys Season 5 has now wrapped filming, its official release date remains unknown at the time of writing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Leiden University analysed almost 30 years of communication on astrobiology. News articles proved most speculative, especially via quotes from scientists. Especially exoplanet research is often accompanied by high expectations about extraterrestrial life, they write in PLOS One. Astrobiology poses fundamental questions about life in the universe: how did it emerge? Albergaria and his colleagues found that the most frequent speculations were about conditions or ingredients for life beyond Earth, followed by speculations on the existence of life. They also found speculations about the outcomes of the search to be uncommon, while speculative content on potential evidence pointing to life detection is rare. The promise that astrobiology is making progress in the search for life was also quite common, with about 1/5 of press releases and news articles exhibiting this kind of content. In contrast, they found that promises of life detection are very rare. ‘Among news articles, we examined those covering studies published in peer reviewed journals. News articles presented more speculations and promises than press releases and papers but press releases had slightly more speculative content when communicating about the significance of research results. ‘This may reflect pressures for institutional communications to emphasize the impact of a study to grab media attention,' explains Albergaria. The team also mapped how frequently speculations and promises appeared associated with authors of studies, with outside experts or without attribution to researchers. Press releases presented speculations most frequently in quotes of authors of studies, while in news articles speculative content appears more balanced between quoted researchers and without attribution to scientists. The study also found that expectations about the search for life are more associated with exoplanet research than solar system exploration, and much higher than about the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). Albergaria ponders that speculations are not necessarily bad science communication. ‘Speculative imagination helps to develop concepts and hypotheses that guide the search. There are many unknowns about life in the universe and that's why speculations in the communication of astrobiology seem almost inevitable. So, it's still difficult to clearly distinguish unwarranted speculative content and legitimate contextualization,' he explains. In total, 630 articles were subject to a quantitative content analysis. Articles came from six reference newspapers: The New York Times (USA), The Guardian (UK), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal) and El País (Spain). The mission of Top Research School NOVA is to carry out frontline astronomical research in the Netherlands, to train young astronomers at the highest international level, and to share its new discoveries with society.</p>

The detection of viable life is a key objective for both in situ astrobiological experiments on extraterrestrial bodies, and for planetary protection protocols on Earth following sample return. We evaluated the potential for common bacterial and archaeal intact polar lipids (IPLs) to be used as viable life markers owing to their particularly fast rate (hours to days) of post-mortem degradation. We determined the chemical signatures of IPLs using pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (with and without derivatisation), to simulate the results of in situ pyrolytic organic analyses. Monoglycerides, formed as pyrolysis products of typical bacterial IPLs, were the strongest signature for the parent compounds, and were identified in both the pyrolysis of a phospholipid mixture and freeze-dried bacterial culture. Our results demonstrate that relatively rapid and elegant pyrolysis techniques can reveal the presence of IPLs, and therefore evidence of viable life in extraterrestrial samples. Biological lipids serve a variety of cellular functions including their use as structural components of cell membranes. To enable self-assembly, amphiphilic membrane lipids consist of a hydrophilic polar head group and hydrophobic aliphatic side chains, all linked to a connecting backbone – most commonly glycerol. As a result of evolutionary divergence and adaptation, the composition of these membrane lipids varies across biological taxa1, enabling their use as biomarkers for particular organisms2. On the domain scale, the cellular membrane lipids of bacteria and eukarya are generally composed of fatty-acid derived tail groups ester-linked to the glycerol backbone, whereas archaeal lipids exhibit ether-linked branched tail groups derived from isoprenoids3. Despite being susceptible to some degradational processes, lipids or their diagenetic derivatives are relatively well-preserved on geological timescales4. The endurance of lipid-derived molecules during diagenetic processes has made them a particular focus of astrobiological studies seeking biomarkers diagnostic of past life4,5,6,7. Intact polar lipids (IPLs) are the pristine, undegraded membrane lipids found in living cells that provide the most detailed taxonomic information2,8. Many IPLs are rapidly enzymatically degraded upon death of an organism9,10,11. Incubations of natural sediments exhibited 69% degradation of an ester-bound bacterial IPL after 4 days, compared with 4% of an archaeal ether-bound IPL12. For astrobiological studies, we propose the term viable life marker or “VLM” for the diagnostic molecular signatures of living organisms. The rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs has already led to their consideration as molecular evidence for active life10,14, constituting a potential VLM. On Earth, the structure and abundance of IPLs is most commonly investigated by solvent extraction of relevant samples followed by liquid-based chromatography and mass spectrometry14,15,16. However, because of the difficulties associated with transporting solvents and concerns over forward contamination, the solvent extraction and liquid-based chromatography techniques conventionally used for IPL characterisation on Earth are less practical for in situ extra-terrestrial astrobiological experiments17. Moreover, the direct analysis of IPLs using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is problematic as many IPLs, including phospholipids, are not stable in the gas phase10, requiring offline derivatisation or hydrolysis in order to be amenable to GC18. Instead, in extraterrestrial environments, in situ organic analysis is typically performed through analytical pyrolysis, eliminating the requirement for solvents17,19. Pyrolysis is performed by raising the sample material to temperatures above 500 °C followed by transfer of the evolved compounds into a system for characterisation, typically GC-MS20,21,22. These elevated temperatures cause thermochemical decomposition of the organic material in the sample, potentially obscuring diagnostic compounds. However, through experiments using standard organic compounds, combined with an understanding of pyrolysis mechanisms, the characteristic products of biomarkers in analytical pyrolysis can be established, providing a signature for their presence in the pyrolysis of natural samples23,24. In situ extraterrestrial pyrolysis methods have previously been simulated in lab experiments using on-line pyrolysis followed by GC-MS (pyrolysis-GC-MS)25. The potential for pyrolysis-GC-MS to distinguish biotic from abiotic organic assemblages for application in extraterrestrial settings has been well established26, but the characteristic products of IPLs in pyrolysis have not been specifically identified and targeted in such experiments. In this study, we aimed to identify the thermochemical decomposition products of IPLs using pyrolysis-GC-MS to simulate the in situ pyrolysis process, with the motivation that these signature products could constitute a chemical marker to distinguish viable life in extraterrestrial samples. This could have potential applications for in-situ life detection experiments and analysis of returned samples. Techniques for distinguishing viable life, such as detecting VLMs, are of importance for planetary protection protocols aiming to mitigate the risk of the introduction of harmful organisms to Earth from returned terrestrial samples27. Analyses including cultivation, DNA sequencing, microscopic imaging and liquid-based chromatography have been proposed but have various individual limitations, especially regarding sample-size requirements and contamination risk29. We selected lipid standards to exemplify typical microbial IPLs and the products of their post-mortem degradation. We identified products of pyrolysis that were unique to the IPLs, enabling their potential use as a signature of viable life. Then, by pyrolysing natural samples, we were able to determine whether these signatures could be discerned in complex organic mixtures. Further details of the methodology are outlined in the Methods section.” 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) were selected as standards to represent a typical bacterial and archaeal IPL respectively. 9-Octadecenoic (oleic) acid standards and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (archaeol) were selected to represent the geologically stable products of their post-mortem degradation5,12,30 (Fig. Table 1 displays the products resulting from pyrolysis-GC-MS or pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of DOPC and oleic acid standards. Compounds eluting after oleic acid were observed exclusively in the pyrolysis of DOPC (Supplementary Fig. In particular, 9-octadecenoic acid, 2,3-dihydroxypropyl ester (glyceryl monooleate), 2 trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivative and 9-octadecenoic acid, 3-hydroxypropenyl ester (dehydrated glyceryl monooleate) formed during the pyrolysis of DOPC, with and without the derivatisation step respectively. In the experiment without derivatisation, the dehydrated form of glyceryl monooleate was identified by the low intensity peak at m/z = 338 in the mass spectra (Supplementary Fig. This peak was attributed to the molecular ion of the compound, being 18 Da less than the complete monoglyceride, reflecting a loss of H2O during pyrolysis. This process of dehydration during analytical pyrolysis has been previously established for alcohols generally31. The elimination reaction will have produced multiple olefinic positional isomers which are unlikely to be chromatographically separated32. In the experiment with derivatisation, glyceryl monooleate, 2TMS derivative could be confidently identified due to the high intensity peak for the characteristic ion at m/z = 39733 (Supplementary Fig. In experiments where the 1-monoglyceride (α isomer) was observed, the 2-monoglyceride (β isomer) was absent or observed at very low abundance. Therefore, all monoglycerides described in these results are in the structural arrangement of the 1-monoglyceride regioisomer. Table 2 outlines the products arising from the pyrolysis-GC-MS and pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of archaeal lipid standards archaeol and DPPE. Without a derivatisation step, no products were exclusive to DPPE. With the derivatisation step, the formation of glycerol, 3TMS derivative and phosphoric acid, 3TMS derivative was exclusive to the pyrolysis of DPPE (Table 2, Supplementary Fig. To explore the response of IPLs in a natural sample we selected soy lecithin, a natural mixture of phospholipids extracted from soybeans34. Pyrolysis of the lecithin sample resulted in the formation of fatty acids and their corresponding (dehydrated) monoglycerides (Table 3). In the experiment without derivatisation, the response for dehydrated monoglycerides was relatively low (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, in the experiment with derivatisation, all of the derivatised monoglycerides expected (based on the identification of their respective free fatty acids) were detected with significant response (Supplementary Fig. As with the pyrolysis of DOPC, (dehydrated) monoglycerides were significantly easier to discern in the experiment with derivatisation due to the greater intensity of characteristic ions in their mass spectra. Pyrolysis of the freeze-dried bacteria Shewanella frigidimarina resulted in the formation of a wide range of products, similar to those identified in previous studies35. Due to the variety of complex compounds formed, often coeluting from the column, extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) were produced to investigate the presence of the signatures of bacterial IPLs, using target ions established in the soy lecithin experiments. Hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid was identified as the most abundant fatty acid. Hence, EICs were produced at target ions for the corresponding (dehydrated) monoglyceride: glyceryl monopalmitate (m/z = 239 and m/z = 371 for the underivatised and derivatised compound, respectively). In the pyrolysis-GC-MS of the bacterial sample without derivatisation, the EIC at m/z = 239 exhibited a peak at a retention time closely matching (within 0.03 min) the elution of dehydrated glyceryl monopalmitate in the lecithin experiment (Fig. Though the mass spectrum associated with this peak would be inconclusive in isolation, the matching retention time increases confidence in the identification of the compound as dehydrated glyceryl monopalmitate. Owing to the low signal to noise ratio in this EIC, selected ion monitoring (SIM) was employed at three characteristic ions for the compound resulting in a greater signal clarity for the compound at the expected retention time (Fig. A Chromatogram acquired from the pyrolysis-GC-MS of the bacteria in selected ion (SIM) mode. B Spectrum acquired in an identical experiment using full scan mode, at the retention time of the peak labelled with * in A. C Extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) acquired from the pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of the bacteria, showing a peak with a retention time matching the elution of the derivatised monoglyceride in previous experiments. D Spectrum acquired at the peak labelled with * in C. In the results from pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS of the bacterial sample, the EIC at m/z = 371 exhibited a peak at a retention time closely matching that of glyceryl monopalmitate, 2TMS derivative in the lecithin experiment (Fig. In contrast to the experiment without derivatisation, the mass spectrum associated with this peak by itself would likely be sufficient to be confidently attributed to the compound due to the detection of many other characteristic fragment ions. A retention time that matched the compound observed in previous experiments further increased confidence in its identification as the monoglyceride. By identifying products of DOPC pyrolysis that were not observed in the pyrolysis of oleic acid (i.e. its post-mortem degradation product), the distinguishing signatures of bacterial IPLs in pyrolysis can be constrained (Table 1). The observation of (dehydrated) glyceryl monooleate is the most pertinent of these species as its structure retains an intact ester bond from the parent IPL molecule. IPL ester bonds have been shown to be rapidly hydrolysed upon death of an organism9,12, thus their presence in the monoglyceride is indicative of viable life in the pyrolysed sample. While the parent phospholipid would not be stable in the gas phase, the monoglyceride is a relatively volatile product of pyrolysis that is amenable to GC and retains sufficient structural information to act as a VLM. Using the detection of monoglycerides as a VLM can be generalised for any ester-linked IPL with a glycerol backbone, although the composition of the monoglyceride would vary with the composition of the tail groups of the parent IPL. A conceptual summary of these interpretation steps is displayed in Fig. Therefore, for convenience, we will henceforth use the term ‘monoglyceride' to refer to both the dehydrated and derivatised forms of these compounds. Derivatisation likely improves sensitivity and certainty for the detection of the monoglycerides arising from the pyrolysis of bacterial IPLs. Because, compared to its underivatised counterpart, the mass spectrum of the derivatised monoglyceride is more clearly distinguished (Supplementary Fig. The formation of more distinct mass spectra during pyrolysis-GC-MS has already been established as a general advantage of incorporating a silylation derivatisation step into pyrolytic organic analysis21,36,37, and the technique will be employed by future in situ pyrolysis experiments on Mars38. Other pyrolysis products exclusive to the IPL were also observed including N,N-dimethyloleamide and phosphoric acid, 3TMS derivative. However, these products can be formed by secondary reactions39 or do not exhibit sufficient intact bonding to serve as a conclusive signature for the presence of IPLs, precluding their use as a VLM. Table 1 also includes the products resulting from the pyrolysis-GC-MS of both DOPC and oleic acid (e.g. cyclooctene). As these compounds arise from the pyrolysis of both the IPL and the product of its enzymatic hydrolysis, they lack the potential to be used to discern the presence of an IPL. Pyrolysis of naturally derived lecithin demonstrated that monoglycerides can be detected as pyrolysis products from a sample containing a mixture of different IPLs with varying tail groups. In the chromatograms of all experiments, a greater response for a particular fatty acid was associated with a greater response for the corresponding monoglyceride (Supplementary Fig. 4), providing guidance for detecting monoglycerides in natural samples: by identifying the most abundant fatty acid in preliminary pyrolysis experiments, the corresponding monoglyceride will be expected to be at greatest abundance. Hence, its structure and properties can be deduced and then targeted with increased specificity. Results from the pyrolysis of a bacterial culture indicated the potential for monoglycerides to be detected during the pyrolysis of cellular samples. Currently, astrobiological space missions equipped with pyrolysis-GC-MS instrumentation are believed to lack the capability to discriminate between the signatures of viable and deceased life21. The results of these pyrolysis experiments demonstrate the potential for typical bacterial IPLs to be detected by these in situ analyses and, thereby, recognise viable extraterrestrial life. Although no single product of thermochemical decomposition could be used to conclusively support the presence of an entire IPL structure, the ester bond preserved in a monoglyceride has been specifically demonstrated to be labile upon death of the host organism. Further to this, bacterial life is not viable without this bond being intact to enable the formation of a cohesive cell membrane. Therefore, the observation of monoglycerides as a pyrolysis product is sufficient to function as a VLM, especially if observed alongside the other signature pyrolysis products of bacterial IPLs outlined here (free fatty acids, phosphoric acid, etc. Archaeal type ether-linked IPLs have less potential to be distinguished from their post-mortem degradation products. The most significant difference between the pyrolysis products of a typical archaeal IPL and the post-mortem degradation product (archaeol) was the identification of phosphoric acid and glycerol TMS derivatives following pyrolysis-derivatisation of the IPL. The structure of these pyrolysis products can only support the possibility of the presence of an IPL and their observation is insufficient to independently establish the presence of living biomass. However, the characteristic pyrolysis products from archaeal type ether-linked IPLs could still act as independent biosignatures, although not necessarily of viable life, as abiotic synthesis of systematically branched chain compounds such as phytol has not been observed13, and their detection should prompt follow-up investigations by other techniques. One additional use case of the technique is assessing returned extraterrestrial samples for the presence of active or viable life, which is a priority for planetary protection protocols40,41. For instance, the committee on space research (COSPAR) has developed a sample safety assessment framework (SSAF) to analytically exclude the possibility of the presence of life in samples returned from Mars prior to release and distribution29. The SSAF incorporates a test sequence of increasingly involved analyses with the aim of establishing sufficient confidence in the absence of life in a returned sample, while minimising damage and the risk of contamination. Once a Martian sample is returned to Earth, many of the limitations associated with in situ organic analyses will no longer apply42,43. The detection of IPLs could be performed using wet chemistry techniques such as solvent extraction and liquid chromatography. However, the use of the pyrolytic signatures of IPLs as a VLM may constitute a valuable screening step in any sample safety test sequence. Pyrolysis-GC-MS holds significant advantages over liquid-based techniques, even when considering analyses of returned samples. Pyrolysis is a relatively simple procedure, which requires small samples, minimal sample preparation and releases organic material from the sample without the need for multi-stage wet chemical procedures25. Screening by pyrolysis-GC-MS can, therefore, provide valuable data with minimal exposure of the sample to the terrestrial environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of hazardous Martian organisms being released from the sample into the terrestrial biosphere. The detection of dormant microorganisms, such as bacterial endospores, is crucial for planetary protection protocols since these viable forms of life are typically resilient to harsh extraterrestrial environmental conditions and could survive sterilisation procedures44. As phospholipids are considered essential for the formation of a functional spore inner membrane45, we propose that IPL signatures are likely to be detectable in the pyrolysis of viable endospore material. Further experimental investigation should verify this hypothesis. Additionally, future experimentation of the technique on a range of microbial species, especially those considered to be viable in space conditions, will be important to confirm the general application of IPL signatures as a marker of viable life for planetary protection protocols. We have demonstrated that pyrolysis-GC-MS can serve as an elegant and rapid method for producing evidence to support the presence or absence of viable life in a returned Martian sample. Pyrolysis-GC-MS could be incorporated into future sample safety sequences, to provide data that informs decisions on further sample processing. The novel method to distinguish viable and deceased biology in pyrolysis outlined in this study comes with significant considerations and limitations. Firstly, this method relies upon the assumption that IPLs can be used as a VLM due to their rapid degradation upon death of an organism. However, this rate of degradation is dependent on the specific chemical structure of the IPL as well as the environmental conditions it endures following death of the host organism8,9,12. Therefore, the lability of the parent IPL in its particular geochemical setting must be considered if its characteristic products of pyrolysis are to be used as a VLM. Similarly, the rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs is biologically mediated12, raising the possibility of increased preservation potential if enzymatic activity is inhibited. Though these factors may compound the post-mortem stability of IPLs, this is unlikely to entirely preclude their use as VLMs because even the slowest recorded IPL degradation rates are significant when compared with the geological preservation times typically observed for fossil life. Secondly, pyrolysis of extraterrestrial samples will differ from the experiments in this study due to the presence of inorganic materials. For example, the Martian surface exhibits a variety of minerals, such as iron oxides and perchlorates, that have previously been shown to obfuscate the signatures of diagnostic organic compounds in pyrolysis experiments24,46. Further experiments, closely simulating specific extraterrestrial environments, may be important for future applications of the technique. Additionally, the influence of abiotic organic matter, such as that sourced from meteoritic infall47 or hydrothermal processes48, on this IPL detection technique warrants further investigation. Fortunately, our recognition of characteristic fragments and their mass spectrometry responses enables the use of selected ion monitoring to tackle sensitivity limitations. Finally, the structural diversity of IPLs poses a further challenge for their detection using in situ pyrolysis. We have established the pyrolytic signatures of typical bacterial and archaeal IPLs. Yet this is by no means exhaustive of all IPL structures. Variations in the head group, tail group or backbone of an IPL would result in different pyrolytic signatures. Future investigation on a wider variety of IPLs would allow for these signatures to be determined. However, the possibility of any extraterrestrial organisms varying beyond the molecular biology known on Earth makes accounting for all possible IPL signatures impossible. While the compartmentalisation of a cellular membrane is considered an essential component for life49, extraterrestrial organisms could well have evolved to use different membrane chemistries. Nevertheless, the suggestion that phospholipids may have evolved independently in archaeal and bacterial lineages50, promotes the possibility of convergent Darwinian evolution tending towards such biochemistry given suitable conditions. Hence, we argue that using known terrestrial biomarkers of viable life as an “educated guess” represents a present-day and reasonable approach to extraterrestrial life detection until more data become available. As a result of these limitations, the lack of the detection of the VLMs outlined in this study should not be used as definitive evidence against the presence of any viable life in a sample, only as an investigative step to lower the likelihood of “life as we know it” being present. On the other hand, we argue that a clear detection of monoglyceride IPL signatures in pyrolysis experiments constitutes strong evidence towards the presence of viable life. In summary, we have demonstrated the capability of pyrolysis-based organic analyses to detect the signatures of common IPLs. Due to the rapid post-mortem degradation of IPLs, we now have a tool for recognising the chemical signatures of viable life using readily available, highly sensitive analytical techniques. The detection of IPLs may have important applications for in situ life detection experiments that regularly employ pyrolysis as a method for organic analysis. IPL recognition also has utility for planetary protection and sample return missions. Although wet chemistry procedures can be used to identify the presence of IPLs on Earth, we have demonstrated how pyrolysis can reveal similarly useful information. As a result, this technique could also offer a simple and rapid screening method to aid the examination of returned Martian samples for the presence of potentially hazardous viable life. Lipid standards of 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) and 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (archaeol) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. 9-Octadecenoic (oleic) acid was obtained from Merck Sigma-Aldrich. To prepare standard solutions, 2 mg of each lipid standard was dissolved in 2 ml dichloromethane (1 mg/ml) and stored at −20 °C. To prepare the soy lecithin samples, the capsule shell of a commercial supplement (Holland and Barrett, UK) was pierced and then 2 mg of the interior soy lecithin material was dissolved in 2 ml dichloromethane (1 mg/ml). A viable, freeze-dried bacterial culture of the strain Shewanella frigidimarina (a gamma-proteobacteria of the pseudomonadota phylum) was purchased from DSMZ GmbH. Approximately 20 μl of each standard solution, or 0.5 mg of freeze-dried bacterial culture, was deposited individually onto a quartz wool plug in a quartz pyrolysis tube and then left at room temperature for any solvent to evaporate. In the pyroprobe, the sample was heated to 650 °C at a rate of 20 °C ms−1 and then held at this temperature for 15 s in a flow of helium. Following pyrolysis, the interface was raised from 150 °C (100 °C for oleic acid) to 280 °C at a rate of 60 °C min−1. The GC injector operated with a 10:1 split at 270 °C and with a helium constant column flow rate of 1.1 ml min−1. Separation was performed on a DB-5MS ultra inert column (J&W; 30 m length, 0.25 mm internal diameter and 0.25 μm film thickness). After being held for 2 min at 40 °C, the GC oven temperature was ramped to 310 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and then held at this temperature for 9 min. Mass spectra were acquired in electron impact (EI) mode (70 eV) over a scan range from 50 to 550 mass/charge (m/z). To increase sensitivity during the experiments pyrolysing freeze-dried bacteria, selected ion monitoring (SIM) was employed. The monitored ions were m/z = 98.1, 116.1 and 239.3, each with a dwell time of 100 ms. Compounds were identified using the NIST mass spectral database and relevant literature. An additional derivatisation step was performed using hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) to produce trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives. The standard pyrolysis-GC-MS protocol was followed as outlined above but with the additional injection of 5 μl HMDS to the pyrolysis tube immediately prior to pyrolysis and the use of an 8 min solvent delay on the mass spectrometer. For the freeze-dried bacteria, 8 μl HMDS was added to ensure sufficient derivatisation of the sample. For the pyrolysis-derivatisation-GC-MS experiments, to establish the pyrolysis products deriving from HMDS, control samples were analysed by pyrolyzing quartz wool loaded with 5 μl HMDS. Products detected in the analysis of the HMDS control eluted early in the experiment ( < 15 min), and were dominated by organic compounds containing silane and amine moieties resulting from thermal degradation or polymerisation of the HMDS. Contaminants such as phthalates were identified and attributed to procedural exposure to plastic laboratory equipment. Siloxanes from column-bleed were also recognised as contaminants. Occasional minor lipid components were excluded if their presence could only by explained by impurities in the standard. For clarity, all of these compounds were disregarded from the results presented herein and are not annotated in the figures. All experiments were replicated at least once, and up to five times for the most important data, to ensure that any significant signals detected were not the result of contamination or methodological error.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During its 15-season run, Supernatural included many controversial storylines, but there's one particular story that even Jared Padalecki wishes he could go back and change. Even though his brother, Jensen Ackles' Dean Winchester, was Supernatural's “ladies' man,” Jared Padalecki's Sam Winchester had many more substantial romances throughout the entire run of the beloved CW series. One of these relationships is widely regarded to be a mistake, however, and even Padalecki agrees, as he revealed at a FAN EXPO Boston panel this August (via Screen Rant). “Amelia,” Padalecki stated with little hesitation when asked if Sam Winchester would make any decisions differently now, five years after Supernatural came to an end. “I don't think he would've gotten into a romantic relationship after his brother… over a dog, yeah.” Sam dated Liane Balaban's Amelia Richardson while Dean was trapped in Purgatory after defeating the Leviathans at the end of season 7. They started a romance that ultimately ended when Amelia's husband, Don, returned from Afghanistan. Sam's decision to not look for Dean after he was sent to Purgatory and instead shack up with Amelia and seemingly move on very quickly has been a controversial one since Supernatural season 8. In fact, the story involving her husband returning actually provided a grounded, very human subplot for Sam, which was rare for Supernatural – this conflict included no monsters. It didn't make sense that Sam would simply give up on looking for his brother and settle down so soon after Dean's disappearance, especially since this was almost a perfect re-telling of Dean's own relationship with Cindy Sampson's Lisa Braeden only two seasons prior. He was also romantically linked to the kitsune Amy Pond (Jewel Straite), deaf hunter Eileen Leahy (Shoshannah Stern), his season 1 girlfriend Jessica Moore (Adrianne Palicki), and even Scooby-Doo's Velma Dinkley (Kate Micucci). Jared Padalecki and demon Ruby actor Genevieve Cortese even married in the real world, while Sam Winchester ended up with a mysterious woman – who some believe is Eileen – who becomes his wife and the mother of his child, Dean. Sam got his happy ending, long after Amelia was forgotten. What did you think of Sam Winchester's romance with Amelia Richardson in Supernatural?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a technological revolution taking place in the auto care industry, transforming the distribution business and changing consumer behaviours. As this transformation takes place, Alain Primeau, executive vice president of UAP, spoke with Auto Service World Conversations about the needed commitment to technological adaptation, comprehensive training and supporting the evolving needs of service providers and consumers alike. “The new generation of service providers are more tech-oriented,” Primeau explained. The shift goes beyond technological tools, extending to consumer expectations and purchasing behaviours. Primeau, who recently expanded his role to oversee the NAPA, Altom and heavy vehicle divisions, noted that consumers are now more educated, arriving at repair shops with extensive research and understanding of part qualities and warranties. UAP has already launched the NexDrive program, which provides 160 hours of specialized training and has 65 shops participating across Canada. He highlighted the training teams led by Yves Racette. He also highlighted a significant industry challenge: Succession planning for independent repair shops. “We feel that the new generation is not as [entrepreneurial as] maybe their father or grandfather were,” Primeau observed, adding that the company is developing programs to help shop owners plan for retirement and transfer their businesses. “Now it's really changing because people are really looking to put quality parts [on their vehicle] because they know they're going to keep their car for seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 years,” Primeau said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links." USOs are similar to UFOs, but sighted in the world's oceans. The retired rear admiral claims that these USOs could be a threat to maritime security. Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, former Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy, cited a 2019 sighting by a Navy warship as evidence that the phenomena of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified submersible objects (USOs) are linked. Gallaudet argues that the lack of knowledge about the undersea world poses hazards for submarines such as collisions with other submarines—such as the independent crashes of the submarines USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut, both of which were incidents that resulted in severe damage to the ships and one crew fatality—and undetected underwater seamounts. Further study of this realm, he believes, could shed additional light on these UFO/UAP sightings. One incident to which Gallaudet points in particular is a July 19, 2019 encounter between the Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Omaha and a so-called transmedium UAP. The AN/KAX-2 is a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder. The video appears to have been taken with the night vision camera, which uses imaging infrared to record objects in darkness. Meanwhile, one sailor off camera radios the other ships in the area—the guided missile destroyers Pinckney, Kidd, and Rafael Peralta—asking for a MH-60 helicopter to be launched as soon as possible. The video was leaked to UFO investigator Jeremy Corbell Lockyer, and was later verified as genuine by the Navy. Gallaudet also references another sighting from 2013, spotted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel. The sighting—which took place near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico—was filmed using a similar imaging infrared camera. The video, shown here, depicts another spherical object appearing to enter the water and then re-emerge without losing any speed. The retired admiral writes, “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.” Other possible evidence cited by the admiral includes an incident in 2022, in which the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered an unusual series of holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles. The centimeter-sized holes were in an unusually straight line and scientists are apparently at a loss to explain their origin. He assumed command of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in 2014, and served as Oceanographer of the Navy from 2016 until retirement in 2017. After his Navy career, Gallaudet served for two years as acting administrator in charge of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, he sits on the advisory board for Americans for Safe Aerospace, which describes itself as a “nonprofit organization dedicated to aerospace safety and national security with a focus on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).” ASA is led by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. naval aviator who reports having his own UAP sighting on active duty in 2014. Whether this will result in greater research to the same extent as the UFO/UAP issue remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This past Friday, August 8th, Patrick Joseph White allegedly opened fire on the CDC campus in Atlanta, killing a police officer while expending nearly 200 shots that sprayed the office buildings. We do mass shootings and attempted mass shootings better than anyone else in the world, after all. Police identified Patrick Joseph White as the gunman and said he opened fire on the campus following claims that the COVID-19 vaccine made him severely depressed and suicidal, AP reported. Interestingly, NIH has studied psychiatric effects following COVID-19 vaccination and found that the opposite occurs at the macro level: vaccination is actually associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety. He has previously and continues now to engage in blatant vaccine misinformation. It doesn't take tinfoil-levels of dot-connecting to understand how you get from anti-vaxx peddlers like Kennedy to a troubled man blasting up a CDC campus. But he is almost certainly a reason it occurred and that means he has some blood on his hands. The outrageous, profane wielding of pseudo-science by the person now in charge of American healthcare is vulgar all on its own, but it also comes with these sorts of knock-on effects. I have no idea what White was dealing with in his life, but I do know that what comes out of RFK Jr.'s mouth and social media accounts is dangerous. Dangerous because of the health risk it puts upon people who believe him. And the risk of those that take him so seriously that they are willing to commit acts of violence. And leaders are supposed to lead in a crisis. It was something like 13 hours after police in Atlanta gave the all clear on the attempted mass shooting that Kennedy managed to put out a statement about it: I would argue first that the statement is entirely disingenous. I have yet to see anything that looks even remotely like support for the CDC from Kennedy in general. I've seen years and years of attacks and conspiracy theories against the very agency he now leads. And I would also argue that it isn't a great look for this statement to have been delayed by 30 minutes because Kennedy was on his personal ExTwitter account posting some sweet pics of his fishing trip in Alaska: The connection is not lost on those that were targeted by this shooting, it should be noted. After it was all over, they wanted assurances that their collective boss had some understanding of his own culpability in all of this. On Sunday, CNN reported that the CDC held a video conference with approximately 800 staff members to discuss the traumatic event and allow them to ask questions. Staff said they felt like “sitting ducks” as bullets whizzed just over their cubicle walls and they dove for the floor. Stat also got access to the call and reported that another employee asked newly confirmed CDC Director Susan Monarez if she had been in touch with Kennedy directly about the shooting. “Do you expect Secretary Kennedy to make a statement about this, and are you able to speak to the misinformation—the disinformation—that caused this issue, and what your plan forward is to ensure this doesn't happen again?” the employee asked. Monarez did not directly answer the question, saying only that she had been in touch with Kennedy's office. We've been in constant communication with the Office of the Secretary, and more will be coming,” Monarez said. Why any competent scientist would risk their lives to keep working for American health agencies while RFK Jr. is still leading HHS is a mystery to me. RFK Jr may not have found the cause of autism yet, but I'm pretty sure he's now convinced that vaccine if the cause of all mass shooting. So, when I say “crazy nutjob,” you don't really know who I'm referring to here–the one who appointed another one to an important role or the other ones who come out of the woodwork. RFK and his fellow travelers spent years demonizing mRNA vaccines, and now, because some people (MAGAs) are skeptical of them, he is stopping research into mRNA vaccines. This will put the US behind Europe and many countries in vaccine development. The current GOP is a death cult. Your email address will not be published.

They both had the zoomies.

A British man accidentally caught a possible UFO zooming through the sky in a video of his dog playing fetch at a scenic location in England, according to a report.

Andrew Clifton, 40, was tossing a frisbee to Dash, his 5-year-old Labrador, on Malvern Hills, near Worcester, on Aug. 2, when the alleged object flashed in the sky, Gloucestershire Live reported.

Video played at full speed shows a slight flit appear under the cloudy sky, appearing for less than a split-second and barely visible to the naked eye.

But on a slow-motion replay, the alleged object appears tubular and missile-shaped with a blue-looking cap on its rear.

The clip was posted on a UFO Facebook group and on X and has over 7 million views, SWNS reported.

While some were certain the object was alien technology, Clifton shared his opinion that it could be a high-tech military project, SWNS reported.

England's Royal Air Force has a base near the scenic destination in the town of Worcester.
