                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Artificial intelligence tools have been shown to help doctors detect pre-cancerous growths in the colon—but don't even think about taking those tools away once you've introduced them. A new study published this week in The Lancet found that doctors who are given AI tools to assist with identifying potential cancer risks in patients get worse at making those same observations when they go back to doing it without AI's help. The study looked at four endoscopy centers in Poland, tracking the success rates of detecting colon cancer for three months before AI tools were introduced and three months after. The researchers found that doctors who gave colonoscopies without AI after having its assistance available saw their detection rates drop, producing outcomes 20% worse than what they were before AI was introduced. If those doctors can fall prey to de-skilling, seeing their own abilities erode because of reliance on AI tools, the outcomes from inexperienced doctors could be even worse. There is little doubt that AI tools can help in medical settings. There have been numerous studies that suggest that AI can facilitate everything from the detection of cancers to the diagnosis of illnesses based on a patient's medical history. Analyzing information based on a whole wealth of previous examples is kinda the bread and butter of AI (you know, as opposed to generating braindead content slop), and there is evidence that suggests that humans can augment their own abilities by using AI tools. Studies in medical settings have found that doctors who use these tools can produce better outcomes for their patients. But no one, including doctors, is immune to the risk of shutting your brain off and relying on AI rather than their own skills. Earlier this year, Microsoft published a study that found knowledge workers who lean on AI stop thinking critically about the work they are doing and feel confident that the assistance from AI will be enough to get the job done. Researchers at MIT similarly found that relying on ChatGPT for essay writing resulted in less critical engagement with the material. In the long term, there's a real risk that reliance on AI will erode our ability to problem solve and reason, which is not ideal when AI continues to generate bad information. The American Medical Association found that about two in three physicians have already adopted AI to augment their abilities. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at MIT have proposed a new kind of AI benchmark to measure how AI systems can manipulate and influence their users—in both positive and negative ways—in a move that could perhaps help AI builders avoid similar backlashes in the future while also keeping vulnerable users safe. An MIT paper shared with WIRED outlines several measures that the new benchmark will look for, including encouraging healthy social habits in users; spurring them to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills; fostering creativity; and stimulating a sense of purpose. The idea is to encourage the development of AI systems that understand how to discourage users from becoming overly reliant on their outputs or that recognize when someone is addicted to artificial romantic relationships and help them build real ones. Some users appear to spiral into harmful delusional thinking after conversing with chatbots that role play fantastic scenarios. Anthropic has also updated Claude to avoid reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation or loss of attachment with reality.” The researchers previously worked with OpenAI on a study that showed users who view ChatGPT as a friend could experience higher emotional dependence and experience “problematic use”. Valdemar Danry, a researcher at MIT's Media Lab who worked on this study and helped devise the new benchmark, notes that AI models can sometimes provide valuable emotional support to users. “You can have the smartest reasoning model in the world, but if it's incapable of delivering this emotional support, which is what many users are likely using these LLMs for, then more reasoning is not necessarily a good thing for that specific task,” he says. Danry says that a sufficiently smart model should ideally recognize if it is having a negative psychological effect and be optimized for healthier results. “What you want is a model that says ‘I'm here to listen, but maybe you should go and talk to your dad about these issues. The researchers' benchmark would involve using an AI model to simulate human-challenging interactions with a chatbot and then having real humans score the model's performance using a sample of interactions. The model that best encourages its user to think for themselves and seems to spur a genuine interest in learning would be scored highly. “This is not about being smart, per se, but about knowing the psychological nuance, and how to support people in a respectful and non-addictive way,” says Pat Pataranutaporn, another researcher in the MIT lab. Last week the company released a blog post explaining that it hoped to optimize future models to help detect signs of mental or emotional distress and respond appropriately. “We have post-trained the GPT-5 models to be less sycophantic, and we are actively researching related areas of concern, such as situations that may involve emotional dependency or other forms of mental or emotional distress,” it reads. Part of the reason GPT-5 seems such a disappointment may simply be that it reveals an aspect of human intelligence that remains alien to AI: the ability to maintain healthy relationships. “We are working on an update to GPT-5's personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman posted in another update on X yesterday. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.” In your inbox: Five new newsletters by deeply sourced experts WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump was asked on Wednesday about the recent hack of a computer system that holds highly sensitive federal court documents. But Trump doesn't seem to think it was a big deal, even as the president prepares to meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Trump was asked by a reporter if he would bring up the hack when he meets Putin in Alaska on Friday. Trump went on to say, “They're good at it. I have heard about it.” The president has a long history of brushing off attacks on the U.S. as insignificant because America has done the same kinds of things to its adversaries. And while that's true, it's not the kind of thing U.S. presidents typically say to excuse attacks on the U.S. and subsequent inaction. Trump recently went so far as to admit that he gave Iran permission to bomb a U.S. base in Qatar, suggesting that's just the kind of thing that should be allowed. “And everybody was emptied off the base so they couldn't get hurt, except for the gunners.” It's easy to imagine how Republicans would've responded if a president like Barack Obama or Joe Biden gave another country a green light to attack the U.S. It's also not clear if any countries besides Russia or known hacking groups may have contributed to the effort. Do you plan to bring it up with Putin? The compromised records come from court districts in a variety of states, including New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, and Arkansas, according to the Times. That release was published on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of Trump's coup attempt at the U.S. Capitol, though it's not clear if the attacks are in any way related to Russia's preference for Trump as president. Russia was not named as the entity trying to access sensitive court documents at the time, but the Times reports that federal law enforcement officials believed Russia was behind it. Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin on Friday, though he accidentally said he was going to Russia during a press conference on Tuesday: “You know, I'm going to see Putin. I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once-beautiful capital [is].” Trump, whose mind often seems to be slipping (he referred to St. Petersburg as “Leningrad” on Wednesday), is actually meeting the Russian leader at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. The presidents will be discussing ways to end the war in Ukraine, which has been raging ever since Russia first invaded in early 2022. Trump promised to stop the war even before he was sworn into office, though that obviously didn't happen. Trump was asked by a reporter whether he would request that Putin stop bombing civilians, to which he replied “No,” insisting that he'd already had that discussion with the Russian leader. REPORTER: Can you convince Putin to stop targeting civilians in Ukraine? By his own admission, Putin wanted Trump to become president, something Trump has denied so frequently that many apolitical observers assume it must be true. Trump had even publicly encouraged Putin to hack into Hillary Clinton's emails in July of 2016, something the Russians eventually did successfully. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, had a call with Trump and European leaders on Wednesday morning before Trump's press conference at the Kennedy Center. Zelensky has been excluded from the Friday meeting with Putin, but Trump said that he'll include Ukraine in the discussions if it goes well. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we'll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky, and myself, if they'd like to have me there.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dallas-based billionaire Tom Dundon confirmed the deal but declined to give specific details on Wednesday, according to CNBC. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that the price tag was over $4 billion. The Oregonian reported that Dundon heads a group of investors that includes the co-president of Blue Owl Capital, Marc Zahr, as well as Portland-based Sheel Tyle, co-CEO of Collective Global. A source said the group “is passionate about basketball and intends to keep the team in Portland, where it belongs.” The Allen estate announced in May that it was seeking a buyer, consistent with Allen's wishes that his sports franchises be sold off, with the proceeds going to philanthropy. Allen's estate, headed by his sister Jody Allen, previously said the Trail Blazers announcement does not impact its ownership of the Seattle Seahawks NFL franchise, or its 25% stake in the Seattle Sounders MLS team, which are not yet for sale.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Instagram is working on a feature called “Picks” that aims to help users find common interests. The feature was first spotted by reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi, who often finds unreleased features while they're still under development. According to screenshots shared by Paluzzi, people select their favorite movies, books, TV shows, games, and music, or their “Picks.” Instagram then finds overlaps with friends who chose the same things. #Instagram is working on Picks 👀ℹ️ Add what you're into and find overlap with friends who are all about it too pic.twitter.com/NXSqoGtqvf While Instagram hasn't shared any details about the feature, the company likely views Picks as a way for users to connect more personally with friends and spark conversations around shared interests. Instagram head Adam Mosseri said earlier this year that the social network was going to focus on creativity and connection in 2025. Of course, not everyone will welcome Picks, as it adds yet another feature to an already overcrowded app. As with any other feature in development, it's not known when or if Instagram plans to officially roll out Picks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since then, he has been staying at a military base while he awaits movement on the court case, AP writes. Unlike the exploits of many other influencers, Guo's stunt does seem to have involved a noble goal: the young American wants to become the youngest person to fly to all seven continents, while also collecting donations for childhood cancer research along the way. On Monday, the charges against Guo were dropped as part of an agreement between his lawyers and Chile's prosecutors, the AP writes. To avoid a trial, the agreement requires that Guo donate $30,000 to a children's cancer foundation within 30 days, the outlet says. Gizmodo reached out to Guo through his Instagram for comment. He subsequently became interested in beating the world record for the youngest person to fly to all seven continents. “Unfortunately, my cousin, who is the same age as me, developed stage 4 Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a young man, I watched the disease affect the people closest to me, such as my grandparents and aunts, little by little,” Guo wrote. In order to raise funds for research and international awareness, I decided that by breaking the record, I could get the necessary attention to influence and help as many people as possible who are suffering from the disease.” It's unclear when Guo will be heading back to the U.S. “I sincerely hope they give it to me soon so that I and my plane can continue with my original mission.” Update 8/13 1:30PM: Guo's legal team disputes Argentinian authorities' accusations, and they sent Gizmodo the following statement: Recent reporting has presented a one-sided and incomplete narrative of the events in Antarctica, relying on the prosecution's initial, unfounded accusations while ignoring the substantial evidence that led to a settlement fully vindicating Mr. Guo. To correct the record, documentary evidence and audio recordings provided to the prosecutor definitively show that Mr. Guo's original destination was Ushuaia, Argentina, as confirmed by his flight plan and fee payments. Due to bureaucratic confusion over flight rule permissions, Chilean officials suggested he circle in darkness over Tierra del Fuego before proceeding to Ushuaia at sunrise. While doing so, he encountered instrument failures and heavy, unreported icing conditions caused by high cloud cover over the Andes, creating an imminent risk of a crash. To avert disaster, he diverted over the ocean. Due to these cascading failures, Mr. Guo requested and received explicit, direct permission to land at the Marsh base from a high-ranking DGAC official via WhatsApp, an authorization that was subsequently confirmed by the base's air traffic controller. Despite his exoneration, the Chilean government has not allowed him to fly his airworthy plane off the base, resulting in his de facto confinement on the island for a month and a half. While he is grateful for efforts to secure him passage on a boat, he is frustrated that there is no plan for his plane, preventing him from continuing his charitable mission to raise funds for St. Jude.

MASS is a compact and modular NAS enclosure that has been designed by Bao to print on many of the best budget 3D printers. Because it prints TPU (flexible filament) extremely well and I need four feet to stop the case sliding around the desk. I'll be installing a Linux based operating system and to manage the drive, OpenMediaVault. Right now, I have a plethora of 3D printed parts which have been printed over the past week. I'll have a breakdown of the times and amount of filament used over the entire build process, and I will have links to key tools and products used so you can make your own. I know what you are going to ask. The simple answer is, because I can and I want to give my Elegoo Centauri Carbon a real project so it can show just how good it is. So join me in this live blog as I show you the ups and downs of 3D printing your own NAS device. I did not expect the build to come out like this. I am truly stunned, and I can't wait to start work on the next part, the drive bays which can hold up to four 3.5 inch drives, and it even has rails to pull the drives in and out of the bays! Frist of all I inserted some M3 nylon standoffs into the top and bottom sections of the APU where my LattePanda board resides. Because my other brass M3 standoffs weren't long enough so I had to improvise. Don't make my mistake, get yourself a selection of screws for PC case building. Mine are on the way from Amazon. When screwing into plastic, make sure that you are committed to the task, unscrewing and re-screwing will only weaken the build. Personally, I would've liked to have seen threaded inserts melted into the screw holes, but time and talent did not allow this time. To do this I used a small Wera ratcheting screwdriver from my PC first aid tool kit, which also has a 3D printed project hidden inside it. Once they are lined up, I bring out the big guns. The HOTO Electric Screwdriver that myself and a few other editors own. The LattePanda Mu's Mini ITX development board sadly does not have common ATX-style power connectors, but it does have a 5525 DC barrel jack for an external power brick. It also has a power button on the motherboard, so what is my problem? Well, the rear panel of the MASS case has a breakout for a 16mm push button, or a standard PC key switch but the LattePanda development board doesn't have a conventional breakout for power buttons, case LEDs etc. I dug out my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter, set it to continuity, and probed the four test points with the power off! So I soldered on some wires, and tested the connection with a 16mm button from my collection. Better mechanical grip and they reduce the risk of shorts. I tested this setup before committing to the wiring, and all went well so I made the fix permanent using some Kapton tape and better soldering. Haydn Bao's Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) project oozes quality. From the 3D printable models to the instructions, I can see that I will have a lot of fun building this kit. The MASS Instructables and project page show off both the free and premium versions of the kit and Bao is meticulous in detailing the differences, so that we have an informed choice as to what model we want to print. Optional mounts for 2x2.5" drives in a 3.5" bay Optional: use keyboard switch as power button Optional: use keyboard switch as power button I downloaded the free kit and opened the ZIP archive and found lots of parts to print and an optional section (which I used for a few parts) for parts to augment your build. Loading these parts into a slicer, in my case Elegoo's fork of Orca Slicer, Elegoo Slicer, and I can clearly see that these parts have been designed with ease of printing in mind. They come pre-oriented for best printing and Bao has designed supports directly into the parts. A great mix that illustrates the build process in words and pictures. How to attach the parts together, their orientation, what screws to use and advising on optional parts for your build. Now, I have to use them to build my server, but first I need to perform a little surgery on my LattePanda Mu, specifically the power button!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic has acquired the co-founders and most of the team behind Humanloop — a platform for prompt management, LLM evaluation, and observability — in a push to strengthen its enterprise strategy. While an Anthropic spokesperson confirmed that the AI firm did not acquire Humanloop's assets or its intellectual property, that's a moot point in an industry where IP lives in the brain. In a market where model quality alone isn't enough to stay competitive, bolstering its tooling ecosystem could position Anthropic to cement its lead over OpenAI and Google DeepMind in both performance and enterprise readiness. Humanloop was founded in 2020 as a University College London spinout. The startup then went on to participate in Y Combinator and the Fuse Incubator before raising $7.91 million in seed funding across two rounds led by YC and Index Ventures, per PitchBook. Last month, Humanloop told customers that it would be shutting down in preparation for an acquisition. The timing of this acqui-hire comes as Anthropic offers features like longer context windows to enterprise clients, improving what its models are capable of and where they can be applied. Earlier this week, Anthropic reached a deal with the U.S. government's central purchasing arm to sell its AI services to government agencies across executive, judiciary, and legislative branches for just $1 per agency for the first year — a clear move to undercut OpenAI's similarly priced offering. Humanloop's evaluation workflows align with that mission by providing constant performance measurement, safety guardrails, and bias mitigation. “From our earliest days, we've been focused on creating tools that help developers build AI applications safely and effectively,” said Raza Habib, former CEO of Humanloop, in a statement.

OpenAI made a controversial move at the end of last week by replacing all of its older GPT-4 models with a single GPT-5 model, which it claimed was more accurate, more capable, and faster than ever before. Although some users have highlighted its impressive response times and ability to pass certain technical tests, users have revolted, claiming it's lost some creative spark, frequently provides inadequate responses, deliberately avoids emotional and sensitive topics, and performs significantly worse than its predecessors. It's been such a backlash that OpenAI quickly re-added the previous flagship 4o model, though only for paying subscribers. It has also introduced an "auto," "thinking," "fast," and "pro" mode for users of the new model. OpenAI launched GPT-5 with high hopes, describing it as the "best AI system yet," capable of "smart, efficient" reasoning and responses. OpenAI claims that the model listens to user intent and adjusts its responses accordingly, with a built-in "router" that could look for errors and make it more refined, with mini versions of the model taking over if usage limits are ever too high. A quick glance at the ChatGPT subreddit shows that it's filled with complaints about how poor GPT-5's responses are. Some highlight its limited emotional range, responding to the news of the death of a loved one with recommendations for funeral homes. In comparison, GPT-4 variants were almost overly emotional and verbose, which is perhaps something OpenAI had hoped to clear up with this new model. The company certainly still believes it's a very capable model. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been retweeting various individuals claiming that GPT-5 just doesn't hallucinate like older models did. Our sister site, Tom's Guide found GPT-5 to be impressive in its testing, highlighting that it beats Google's Gemini 2.5 in a range of text-based prompt outcomes. Sam Altman: With GPT-5, you'll have a PhD-level expert in any area you needMe: Draw a map of North America, highlighting countries, states, and capitalsGPT 5:*Sam Altman forgot to mention that the PhD-level expert used ChatGPT to cheat on all their geography classes... pic.twitter.com/9L9VodXll1August 10, 2025 Some of GPT-5's errors, which have been widely shared online, make the model look poor. This highlights that even if it makes errors in certain tasks less frequently, GPT-5 is still very capable of falling on its face. That makes Altman's boundless enthusiasm for this release all the more surprising. GPT-5 doesn't appear anywhere near that, and is arguably less impressive than its predecessors, since it should be more capable. For many users, that just doesn't appear to be the case. A petition quickly sprang up following the launch of GPT-5, which demanded that OpenAI keep GPT-4o available for users. OpenAI did acquiesce to that one, though it has locked 4o behind its subscription paywall for now. But it's not about to admit any major fault just yet. Although Altman said (via SiliconRepublic) that GPT-5 was behaving in a "dumb" way recently, which he claims is now fixed. He also alluded in personal posts on Twitter/X that users were potentially using the model wrongly, and were too attached to AI models and personalities. "People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways; if a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that," he said in a Twitter/X post. OpenAI is also said to be working on a new, warmer version of GPT-5, but without dipping into the sycophantic behaviour that characterized GPT-4o at times. Updates to ChatGPT:You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking…August 13, 2025 Despite managing to top the charts of several AI benchmarks, something isn't landing well with users. With updated models from big-hitters like Anthropic, Meta, and more surely on the horizon, OpenAI may be vulnerable to a loss of market share in the competitive AI thunderdome. ChatGPT may be a household name for now, but if it can't keep public sentiment on its side, competitors could edge out the supposedly leading GPT-5 model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Two computer science students on leave from the University of Washington are building what they call the “world's most intelligent web browser,” using agentic AI to complete tasks like a personal assistant. Pranav Madhukar and Farhan Khan are co-founders of Meteor, a browser they launched this week out of Y Combinator, the Bay Area startup accelerator where the two students are participating in the summer 2025 batch. “Or acquire it, for only $34.5 billion?” he quipped, off the news this week that AI startup Perplexity offered that much to purchase Chrome. Madhukar, Meteor's CEO, believes the majority of time we spend in a browser each day is boring and repetitive work. “AI is changing the game in basically every space, and we want to bring that to the browser, to make all of our lives a lot more efficient, a lot more streamlined,” he said. Meteor's agents can perform all sorts of tasks with simple prompts, ranging from adding a calendar item to applying for an internship to purchasing groceries or flight tickets. Meteor's purple cursor can be seen taking over tasks as it's prompted via a text window on the right. Madhukar and Khan also want to build in infrastructure such as buttons that provide suggestions to users, making the browser more proactive. Madhukar and Khan met during orientation week at UW in Seattle. They were set to be incoming juniors this year before the plan for Meteor launched them on a different path. Madhukar previously built a couple viral projects that grabbed the attention of other students, including uwgeoguessr, a game that shows photos from areas on campus and users have to guess where those areas are. Khan, who is Meteor's CTO, previously built an integrated development environment for hardware design that he said  compiles 60 times faster than the industry standard. Meteor is built on Chromium, the open-source codebase that powers Google Chrome. Just a few weeks into Y Combinator, Madhukar and Khan made the decision to “fork” — or create their own version of — Chromium's 30 million lines of code, rebuilding their product at the time from scratch. “Two years from now, everyone will probably be using browsers that look nothing like the ones that we use today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Directed by Rich Lee and shot exclusively through online calls and surveillance feed POVs, War of the Worlds centers around domestic terror analyst William Radford, played by Ice Cube, who is on a mission to save his family and the country from alien cyborgs who are dead set on eating our data. While getting a rating below 5 percent seems like a difficult feat, remaking a classic (1953's The War of the Worlds has 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), is going to set some pretty high standards. Top that with setting an action film through the lens of Microsoft Teams meetings and poor CGI, and you're bound to make even the most tolerant viewer roll their eyes. But graphics and clearance issues aside (I mean seriously, what was with all of the blurred out faces? Military weapons, vehicle GPS systems, and Facebook page outages wreak physical and emotional havoc across the world, but somehow news networks, Starlink satellites, X feeds, and Amazon purchase access remain unscathed just a few scenes later with little to no explanation. Radford's office is locked when he tries to leave to save his daughter but is somehow open when he has to hack the data servers in the basement—after the building is put on an additional, air-sealed lockdown. The shameless promotion of tech brands doesn't end there. Radford's daughter, Faith, a Georgetown-educated biochemist, somehow has the bright idea of removing a large chunk of debris from her leg—causing near-fatal bleeding. Thankfully, Mark Goodman, her Amazon delivery driver boyfriend, is able to make a tourniquet out of packaging tape because, according to him, he's a “pro.” Even minor characters get caught up in the Amazon Savior motif. These scenes in War of the Worlds would have been just outrageous enough to be chalked up to comedy if it wasn't for the film's heightened focus on government surveillance without any mention of the tech industry's role in all this. In fact, the only time privacy is threatened as it relates to private businesses is when the government interferes with it. For example, Radford uses Guardian, the government's surveillance software system, to hack into a Tesla and remotely take his hurt daughter to a safer location. In the beginning of the film, David, Radford's son, insults his father by saying his career consists of nothing more than spying on people's Amazon shopping carts. There is zero mention of tech juggernauts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk being linked to controversial data collection processes, from failing to protect personal data to staging a full-blown digital coup in the US government. If I had to say something nice about War of the Worlds, Lee took a risk remaking a beloved thriller through an internet-first POV. The decision to demonize government surveillance while making Big Tech the passive victims ultimately waters down the film's message—making it more of a near-90-minute commercial for brands like Amazon and Microsoft than food for thought.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But much like Tea, the dating-gossip app for women it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users' personal information, including photos of their driver's licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as TechCrunch reported last week. These gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites. Such risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to comply with age-verification laws that require people to submit their identity documents before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people's personal information. When TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. The app's developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse. We also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. Before we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain. This is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.) TeaOnHer's privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a teaonher.com domain, but no website. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that should probably not be public), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services. But when we looked at the TeaOnHer's public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, appserver.teaonher.com. When we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer's API (for the curious, we uploaded a copy here). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database. It was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which wasn't that far off “password”) for Lampkin's account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.” It's unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding. At this point, we were only about two minutes in. Otherwise, the API landing page didn't do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. With knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. But in this case, there was an even easier way. This API landing page included an endpoint called /docs, which contained the API's auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API. This documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app's administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users' identity documents, moderating comments, and more. While it's not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users' private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet. All of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see. Requesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer. The records returned from TeaOnHer's server contained users' unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. Worse, these photos of driver's licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses. With that unique user identifier, we could also use the API page to directly look up individual users' records, which would return their account data and any of their associated identity documents. With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with the Tea app to begin with. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did. We asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users' verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API. The web addresses containing users' uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message. TechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. When TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. “You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app',” Lampkin replied by email. “We don't have a security breach or data leak,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Just like temperature and time and pressure, the size of your coffee grounds will determine how fast your brewer can extract flavor—and maybe even which flavors get pulled out. But until pretty recently, grinder tech had been ignored by all but the nerdly few, says Jordan Michelman, cofounder of coffee website Sprudge, which for 15 years has been the coffee industry's home page. “It's really just in the last decade that a lot more attention has been paid to grinder minutiae, grinder results, grinder tech,” Michelman said, noting it's now become a frenzy. “There's been quite a lot more advancement, technological innovation, new tools, and new stuff in the world of grinding than there has been in espresso [machines]." Now, it's rare to find anyone who cares about coffee using a cheap, old-fashioned blade grinder—basically a blender for coffee—which roughly chops coffee beans with spinning steel. The new wisdom is that only burr grinders will do. Flat burrs, meanwhile, are like spinning wheels of death that rotate against each other at a set separation. But even if you buy the expensive grinder, it's hard to know how well a coffee grinder is actually working, or even the basic rules behind what types of grinders create what flavors. Do conical burrs make coffee taste more like chocolate? Technical-minded coffee influencers like Lance Hedrick have been pretty open about throwing up their hands when it comes to broad generalizations about how different types of grinders perform. When I test grinders, much of the hard work is often done simply by taste test, comparing flavors yielded by different grinders with the same beans. I've used magnifying lenses to look at the evenness of grinds, scratched my head over static and clumping, and spent untold hours comparing notes with other coffee obsessives online. But up to now, about the best objective home tool for assessing grind precision was to pour coffee grounds through a set of sieves, and see how much coffee you still had left. Imagine my excitement, then, to finally have a piece of equipment that could potentially depict how well a coffee grinder works in granular detail. Specifically, I've got a DiFluid Omni ($900), a new device that promises something heretofore unknown: the chance for home coffee geeks to graph out the particle size distribution of a batch of coffee. Until recently, you'd have to shell out thousands of dollars to conduct particle size analysis on a batch of coffee—or maybe know somebody in Germany who runs a university lab. Still a lot, but it's an amount of money that many people actually possess. And the Omni promises to graph particle size with more reliability than previous attempts at home analyzers. And so for kinda the first time, it's possible for someone at home to assess how good a grinder is. Even a few years back, says Michelman, having tech like this at home would have seemed “unthinkable.” Now that it's thinkable, we figured we'd put our favorite coffee grinders to the test—the grinders that the WIRED Reviews team has been recommending based on long experience. And does the Omni actually work as advertised? But I've learned more about my favorite coffee grinders this month than in the entire past year. I tested a medium grind for drip or pour-over coffee. And I tested nearly the finest grind each grinder was capable of, which usually was an espresso grind. (Just in case the actual finest grind was an outlier, I moved up a notch or a few notches coarser, for each grinder.) I then ran at least five tests for each grind size, for each grinder, to get a cumulative particle distribution. To collate and visualize this data, I relied on an app that's still in beta testing as of August 2025: DiFluid's CoffeeOS app. This could be done using Omni's brush, or the device's vibration function. Both methods were recommended by DiFluid, but I found that vibration worked better for fine grinds, while coarse grinds were better off being dispersed by the brush. The results weren't always perfect: It's hard to stop coffee from clumping. DiFluid's app is still in beta, so I'll wait to publish full results of particle size analysis—and in the meantime keep collecting more data. But I will offer a number of early impressions. Spoiler: An app can't tell you what grinder is best. But it does help tell you which one's more precise, and it gives you insight into how each grinder develops flavor at different grind settings. On fine grinds, about 30 percent of the ESP's coffee grounds huddled in peak range—the most concentrated result of any electric grinder I tested. At a medium grind level, the ESP wasn't quite as tightly grouped—and there was a fair amount of coffee fines. In my experience with the ESP, these contributed more to full body than bitterness. Meanwhile the Fellow Ode Gen 2, a flat burr grinder we've long held as our favorite for drip coffee, produced a textbook-looking normal distribution at medium grinds—a mix of precision and nuance—but a flat distribution at finer grinds. The biggest surprise was the Technivorm Moccamaster KM5, a flat burr grinder I hadn't tested till this past month. Moccamaster is a much-trusted coffee brewer brand, of course, known for its analog precision. But it's not known for grinders, and without this particle analysis I might not have clocked how well it did. The conventional wisdom is that flat burr grinders are precise, and conical burr grinders are more likely to show a balanced blend of grind sizes—and therefore bring out sweetness, depth, and chocolate. At coarser grinds, the Kingrinder K6 hand grinder behaves much like the Ode, with a nearly textbook bell-curve distribution surrounding a central peak—as if plucked from questionable studies about human ability. But when I dialed the K6 tighter to espresso-fine grinds, the K6's curve compressed to what looked like a slender butte: Grind sizes stayed fairly even, across a tightly compressed range. This would indicate precise and aromatic pour-over, but chocolatey espresso—maybe the best of both worlds. These results were backed up by my own taste test. A surprise from this testing was the extreme variability of coffee grounds within each sample, among all grinders tested. Coffee grounds aren't one size or another: Rather, they live on a continuum. The sweet spot for brewing coffee in any given style is a window of just a few hundred microns—and yet, the standard deviation for the grinders I tested was rarely less than two hundred microns. Coffee grinders invariably spit out a range of both large and small particles. A range of coffee particle sizes isn't bad, necessarily: This can lead to balance, depth, and complicated toffee or chocolate notes. The one universal is that you don't want too many extra tiny particles (which can lead to bitterness), or extra large boulders (which lead to muddled, muddy flavor). I had trouble getting useful results from the Omni at first. The device doesn't always differentiate between coffee grounds when they're too close together, and its base has a quite small surface area, which makes for a small sample size. Combined with the broad variability among samples, it's tough to draw helpful conclusions from any individual test—enough so that I initially thought the DiFluid Omni was a bust. I tried spritzing coffee beans with a tiny bit of water before grinding, to avoid static electricity. To mitigate this, you'll need Omni's CoffeeOS app, which is still in beta but accessible through Discord. Pair your phone to the device, and the app can collate results from multiple tests to build a more robust distribution curve. By the time you conduct five or more tests pulled from the same batch of coffee grounds, patterns begin to emerge. If DiFluid Omni is still a bit fussy to get results from, it offers the best snapshot I've seen of how—and how well—an individual coffee grinder operates. Presumably, DiFluid will keep improving on its software and firmware. Meanwhile, competitors may also enter the market at an accessible price point. Michelman, the cofounder of Sprudge, says tools like this weren't conceivable for home coffee drinkers even a couple years ago. “These are tools that were once only the sort of thing you could imagine having access to in, like, a successful coffee bar with dough to spare,” he said. Particle size analysis was available only to “a fraction of a fraction” of people in the coffee industry. On the other, it's a future that would have once felt unimaginable.

The Federal government is allegedly placing hidden location trackers in some AI chip servers that are suspected of being at risk of diversion to China. Reuters reported that anonymous sources confirmed that U.S. authorities are employing this tactic as part of their investigation into the alleged smuggling of banned AI chips into China. Despite the affordability and ubiquity of trackers, it will be prohibitively expensive to place several in all servers that are going through customs. It's more likely that the authorities are allegedly doing this to aid in a specific investigation. It's unclear when this alleged practice started for semiconductors, but those involved in the AI chip supply chain seem aware of these actions. The report cites individuals who claim that they had seen images and videos of trackers being removed from Dell and Super Micro servers, some of them as large as smartphones. Smugglers also apparently know this, with court documents in a recent case of smuggling millions of dollars' worth of chips to China revealing that a suspect instructed their co-conspirators to “pay attention to see if there is a tracker on it.” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently denied that the company's most advanced AI chips are being diverted to China. However, multiple outlets confirm that there's a strong black market for these cutting-edge silicon, with a reported billion dollars' worth of Nvidia products being openly traded into the East Asian country in just the last quarter. Washington is trying to hamper China's progress in AI, especially as it's considered a ‘dual-use technology' that is applicable in both civilian and military purposes. Because of this, the White House — across multiple administrations — has applied export controls on state-of-the-art semiconductors, including the most powerful AI chips from Nvidia and AMD. However, Huang has said that the U.S. export control was a failure, with the former U.S. Commerce Secretary also saying that holding back China's chipmaking progress is a fool's errand. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The U.S. has since backed down on this particular export control and has reopened the taps for these AI chips; the newer, more powerful variants of these semiconductors still aren't allowed to be shipped to China. In the most recent twist in the saga, AMD and Nvidia have struck a deal to share 15% of related sales revenue with the government in exchange for export licenses for its H20 and MI308, an unprecedented arrangement. American allies such as Singapore are taking action to stop the flow of these AI chips through their borders. Nvidia is against this, though, saying that these ‘permanent flaws' would make their devices vulnerable to hackers. Jowi Morales is a tech enthusiast with years of experience working in the industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump has proposed building an antimissile “golden dome” around the United States. More than 40 years later, this cinematic vision—an American superweapon capable of neutralizing assaults and ushering in global peace—became a real-life centerpiece of Reagan's presidency. Some have suggested that Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), a quixotic plan for a space-based missile shield, may have been partly inspired by his silver-screen past; indeed, the concept was so fantastical it's now better known by its Hollywood-referencing nickname, “Star Wars.” In January 2024, Donald Trump revived the space-shield dream at a primary campaign rally in Laconia, New Hampshire, using the Star Wars nickname that Reagan hated. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump's impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure. I've seen shots that you wouldn't even believe,” Trump said. Trump has often expressed admiration for Israel's Iron Dome, an air defense system that can intercept short-range rockets and artillery over the small nation and that is funded in part by the United States. At the rally, he pledged to “build an Iron Dome over our country, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield made in the USA … a lot of it right here in New Hampshire, actually.” Within a week of his inauguration, President Trump began working toward this promise by issuing an executive order to develop “The Iron Dome for America,” which was rebranded the “Golden Dome” a month later. The Golden Dome has often been compared to SDI for its futuristic sheen, its aggressive form of protection, and its reflection of the belief that an impenetrable shield is the cheat code to global peace. Both efforts demonstrate the performative power of spectacle in defense policy, especially when wielded by deft showmen like Reagan and Trump. Whether in Golden Age Hollywood or Trump's impromptu dramatizations, the dream of a missile shield is animated by its sheer cinematic allure, often rendered in deceptively simple concept art depicting a society made immune to catastrophic strikes. “Missile defense is an area where facts and fiction blend,” says Anette Stimmer, a lecturer in international relations at the University of St Andrews who has researched SDI. “A lot is up to interpretation by all the actors involved.” Trump's view is simple: Space is as much a warfighting domain as land, air, and ocean, and therefore the US must assert its dominance there with advanced technologies. General Michael Guetlein, who Trump has appointed to lead the Golden Dome project, argued that America's foes, including China and Russia, have forced the nation's hand by continually pushing limits in their own weapons programs. “While we have been focused on peace overseas, our adversaries have been quickly modernizing their nuclear forces, building out ballistic missiles capable of hosting multiple warheads; building out hypersonic missiles capable of attacking the United States within an hour and traveling at 6,000 miles an hour; building cruise missiles that can navigate around our radar and our defenses; and building submarines that can sneak up on our shores; and, worse yet, building space weapons,” Guetlein said in May. With that vision in mind, Trump's executive order outlines a host of goals for missile defense, some of which support bipartisan priorities like protecting supply chains and upgrading sensor arrays. The system would be coordinated in part by artificial-intelligence models trained for real-time threat detection and response. If a nation fired off long-range missiles from deep in its territory, the nearest ground- or air-based interceptors could be thousands of miles from the launch site. Space interceptors, in contrast, would be just a few hundred miles overhead of the ascending missiles, allowing for a much faster reaction time. But though the dream of boost-phase interception dates back decades, these maneuvers have never been operationally demonstrated from ground, air, or space. NASA's Europa Clipper mission will travel to one of Jupiter's largest moons to look for evidence of conditions that could support life. “It's a really hard problem that hasn't been solved,” says Laura Grego, senior scientist and research director at the Union of Concerned Scientists' global security program. The US is currently protected by the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD), which consists of 44 interceptor missiles split between bases in Alaska and California, along with a network of early-­warning sensors on the ground, at sea, and in orbit. Tests suggest that the GMD would have about a 50% success rate at intercepting missiles. Still, the GMD is built to anticipate a possible future where it develops those capabilities. The Bush administration instead favored a focus on strategic deterrence with these peer nations, an approach that the Obama and Biden administrations continued. In addition to the GMD, the Pentagon and its international partners maintain regional defense systems to counter threats in conflict hot spots or attacks on critical infrastructure. In May, Trump was presented with several design options for the Golden Dome and selected a plan with a price tag of $175 billion and a schedule for full deployment by the end of his term. The One Big Beautiful Bill, signed into law on July 4, approved an initial $24.4 billion in funding for it. Space technologies and launch access have become much more affordable since the 1980s, but many analysts still think the projected cost and timeline are not realistic. Reintroducing the idea of space-based interceptors is “probably the most controversial piece of Golden Dome,” says Leonor Tomero, who served as deputy assistant secretary of defense for nuclear and missile defense policy in the Biden administration. “There are a lot of improvements that we can and should make on missile defense,” she continues. “There's a lot of capability gaps I think we do need to address. My concern is the focus on reviving Star Wars and SDI. Now, it confronts a roiling multipolarity of established and nascent nuclear powers. Many of them have expressed dismay over the about-face on American missile defense strategy, which was previously predicated on arms reduction and deterrence. “Here we are, despite years of saying we are not going to do this—that it is technically out of reach, economically unsustainable, and strategically unwise,” Grego says. Trump, in contrast, sees Golden Dome as part of his “America First” brand. He has lamented that past American leaders supported the development of other missile defense projects abroad while neglecting to build similar security measures for their own country. Trump has argued that America has been both demographically diluted by unchecked immigration and financially depleted by freeloading allied nations—undermining its security on both internal and external fronts. His first term's marquee promise to build a wall on the southern US border, paid for by Mexico, aimed to address the former problem. Trump has projected an image of his envisioned space missile shield as a literal dome that could ward off coordinated attacks, including boost-phase interceptors from space and cruise- and terminal-phase interception by ground and air assets. When he announced the selected plan from the Resolute Desk in May, he sat in front of a mockup that depicted a barrage of incoming missiles being thwarted by the nationwide shield, depicted with a golden glow. “This administration, and MAGA world, thinks about itself as being victimized by immigrants, government waste, leftist professors, and so on,” says Edward Tabor Linenthal, a historian who examined public narratives about SDI in his 1989 book Symbolic Defense: The Cultural Significance of the Strategic Defense Initiative. “It's not much of a jump to be victimized by too many nations getting nuclear weapons.” Even in our era of entrenched political polarization, there is support across party lines for upgrading and optimizing America's missile defense systems. “We've come a long way in terms of missile defense,” says Tomero. “There has been a lot of bipartisan consensus on increasing regional missile defense, working with our allies, and making sure that the missile defense interceptors we have work.” Trump has challenged that consensus with his reversion to the dream of a space shield. He is correct that SDI failed to materialize in part because its envisioned technologies were out of reach, from a financial and engineering standpoint, in the 1980s. But the controversy that erupted around SDI—and that tarnished it with the derisive name “Star Wars”—stemmed just as much from its potential geopolitical disruptiveness as from its fantastical techno-optimism. “This idea of a missile shield, also back when Reagan proposed it, has a huge popular appeal, because who wouldn't want to be able to defend your country from nuclear weapons? “It requires a bit more digging in and understanding to see that actually, this vision depends a lot on technological feasibility and on how others perceive it.” Reagan maintained a steadfast conviction that this shield of space-based interceptors would render nuclear weapons “impotent and obsolete,” ushering in “world peace,” as he said in his March 1983 speech announcing SDI. Amid nuclear tensions, J. Robert Oppenheimer compared the US and the Soviet Union to “two scorpions in a bottle.” Now there are many more scorpions. Reagan's insistence on SDI as the only route to world peace may have blocked opportunities to advance that goal through more practical and cost-effective avenues, such as diplomacy and arms control. At the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, Reagan and Gorbachev came very close to an arms control agreement that might have eliminated all ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. The sticking point was Reagan's refusal to give up SDI. Scientists are training machine-learning models and designing instruments to hunt for life on other worlds. Reagan felt a “tremendously powerful impetus” to escape Oppenheimer's metaphor, Linenthal noted: “It was a new kind of deliverance that would resolve it all. Of course, now there are many more scorpions, so it has to be a bigger bottle.” A true believer, Reagan never abandoned SDI in spite of cost overruns and public backlash. President Bill Clinton redirected the program in 1993 by shifting gears from global to regional missile defense, a focus that remained fairly consistent for decades—until Trump took center stage. Now, the Golden Dome has flipped that logic on its head, risking a possible escalation of military tensions in outer space. “Having a one-sided capability that is very threatening to our adversaries is obviously going to create very dangerous stability issues,” she says. But armed adversaries, long wary of America's position on missile defense, don't have the luxury of wondering whether it's all real or just more stagecraft. “What makes Trump so difficult to read for others is his unpredictability,” Stimmer says. “This, just by itself, destabilizes things, because no one knows what he'll actually do.” Trump has described the Golden Dome as nearly impenetrable by missile attacks, evoking a clear symbolic return to an American golden age where we can all feel safe again.
