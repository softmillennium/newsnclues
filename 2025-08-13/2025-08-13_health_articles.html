                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists at the Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC) have shown that 18FDG-PET, an imaging technique widely used to study other conditions, can also be used to monitor atherosclerosis by measuring cellular metabolism within arterial plaques. Atherosclerosis-the underlying cause of most heart attacks and strokes-is a silent disease that progresses over many years without symptoms. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of fatty deposits, cells, and other materials in the walls of arteries, where they reduce blood flow and can eventually rupture, triggering serious cardiovascular events. While treatments are available to slow disease progression, it is still difficult to determine if a treatment is working in individual patients. 18FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) is a nuclear imaging technique that uses a radioactively labeled glucose analog to detect tissue metabolic activity. To reach this conclusion, the research team developed an experimental model of advanced atherosclerosis in genetically modified animals and was able to partially reverse disease progression using a diet and drug-based intervention similar to strategies used in clinical care. As the disease regressed, the 18FDG-PET signal declined in parallel with the reduced expression of genes linked to glucose metabolism in various plaque cell types, including macrophages, lymphocytes, and smooth muscle cells. This discovery opens the door to using a widely available hospital imaging technique to improve clinical monitoring of atherosclerosis and speed the development of new therapies for this silent but potentially deadly disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clinicians are more likely to indicate doubt or disbelief in the medical records of Black patients than in those of White patients-a pattern that could contribute to ongoing racial disparities in healthcare. That is the conclusion of a new study, analyzing more than 13 million clinical notes, publishing August 13, 2025 in the open-access journal PLOS One by Mary Catherine Beach of Johns Hopkins University, U.S. In the new study, researchers analyzed 13,065,081 EHR notes written between 2016 and 2023 about 1,537,587 patients by 12,027 clinicians at a large health system in the mid-Atlantic United States. Overall, fewer than 1% (n=106,523; 0.82%) of the medical notes contained language undermining patient credibility – about half of which undermined sincerity (n=62,480; 0.48%) and half undermined competence (n=52,243; 0.40%). However, notes written about non-Hispanic Black patients, compared to those written about White patients, had higher odds of containing terms undermining the patients' credibility (aOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.27–1.32), sincerity (aOR 1.16; 95% CI 1.14–1.19) or competence (aOR 1.50; 95% 1.47–1.54). Moreover, notes written about Black patients were less likely to have language supporting credibility (aOR 0.82; 95% CI 0.79–0.85) than those written about White or Asian patients. Additionally, as the utilized NLP models had high, but not perfect, accuracy in detecting credibility-related language, they may have misclassified some notes and thereby under- or overestimated the prevalence of credibility-related language. They say that medical training should help future clinicians become more aware of unconscious biases, and that AI tools used to help write medical notes should be programmed to avoid biased language. By isolating words and phrases suggesting that a patient may not be believed or taken seriously, we hope to raise awareness of this type of credibility bias with the ultimate goal of eliminating it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cells use various signaling molecules to regulate the nervous, immune, and vascular systems. Among these, nitric oxide (NO) and ammonia (NH₃) play important roles, but their chemical instability and gaseous nature make them difficult to generate or control externally. A KAIST research team has developed a platform that generates specific signaling molecules in situ from a single precursor under an applied electrical signal, enabling switch-like, precise spatiotemporal control of cellular responses. This approach could provide a foundation for future medical technologies such as electroceuticals, electrogenetics, and personalized cell therapies. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on August 11 that a research team led by Professor Jimin Park from the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, in collaboration with Professor Jihan Kim's group, has developed a 'Bioelectrosynthesis Platform' capable of producing either nitric oxide or ammonia on demand using only an electrical signal. Inspired by enzymes involved in nitrite reduction, the researchers implemented an electrochemical strategy that selectively produces nitric oxide or ammonia from a single precursor, nitrite (NO₂⁻). Through electrochemical measurements and computer simulations, the team revealed that Fe sites in the FeCuMoS4 catalyst bind nitric oxide intermediates more strongly, shifting product selectivity toward nitric oxide. Specifically, electrochemically produced nitric oxide activated TRPV1 channels (responsive to heat and chemical stimuli), while electrochemically produced ammonia induced intracellular alkalinization and activated OTOP1 proton channels. By tuning the applied voltage and electrolysis duration, the team modulated the onset time, spatial extent, and termination of cellular responses, which effectively turned cellular signaling on and off like a switch. Professor Jimin Park said, "This work is significant because it enables precise cellular control by selectively producing signaling molecules with electricity. We believe it has strong potential for applications in electroceutical technologies targeting the nervous system or metabolic disorders." Myeongeun Lee and Jaewoong Lee, Ph.D. students in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at KAIST, served as the co-first authors. The paper was published online in 'Angewandte Chemie International Edition' on July 8, 2025 (DOI: 10.1002/ange.202508192).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With increasing age, older adults are more likely to encounter health conditions and injuries that require opioid therapy for pain relief. This reality means that opioid overdoses are a concern for older adults as well as for their family members and other caregivers. "Caregivers should take the steps described in this guide if someone has signs and symptoms that indicate an apparent overdose," the report states. "To be prepared for a possible opioid overdose, naloxone should always be in the home if opioids are present or if any family members bring in opioids that were not purchased at a pharmacy."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new tool to understand how people imagine differently when reading could have potential implications for the treatment of mental ill health. This shows the complexity of people's reading minds and what the researchers say is a radical diversity of imagination skills. The researchers add that understanding how different people respond to reading could provide a greater insight into how their imaginations work. The team stressed that this is an early study and that they hope to do more research to develop the ReaderBank Imagination Quiz as a tool that could enhance and supplement mental ill health treatments. This is relevant when we start thinking about mental health, because there are lots of aspects of mental health which are all about thoughts, memories, and ideas coming to us, that we can't control. Lots of psychotherapy methods rely on the imagination, but we never screen people for what kind of imagination they have. Our end goal is thinking how can we use these sorts of tools to inform more precise, more detailed pictures of how psychotherapy is going to work?" The ReaderBank Imagination Quiz stems from ReaderBank – an ambitious attempt to use reading and book festivals to study the imagination and mental health in new ways. Researchers quizzed 867 people on their reading experiences across two Edinburgh International Book Festivals in 2023 and 2024. Participants were 18 or over, had read a fiction book in the last six months, and were fluent in English. They completed questions about reading habits, including how much and how frequently they read books, preferred types of books or e-books, and most read genres. The quiz also looked at how conscious readers were of what they were reading and the impact this had on them. They found a "radical diversity of imagination skills". The researchers say that understanding this range of imagination could be used to refine treatments for similar traits in mental ill health. ReaderBank will be continuing this year at Edinburgh with a new series of studies and a focus on "Repair", the theme of the book festival. Dr Wajid Khan, Head of Research at Southwest Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: "These research findings shine new light on the role the imagination and creativity can play in helping build, maintain and change cognitive schemas and wider psychological processes. "ReaderBank has far-reaching implications for the way we manage recovery and resilience in clinical mental health services." Jenny Niven, Director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said: "We are delighted be a partner on Durham University's ReaderBank project. "The Book Festival is a site for collaboration, innovation and creativity, and working with the ReaderBank team and our audiences over the last couple of years has given us a fascinating insight into our diverse audience of curious readers, and the different ways we engage with fiction. "The team at the Book Festival is so excited to see how this might inform festivals in years to come."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study published in Nature Biotechnology reveals a powerful new use for artificial intelligence: designing small, drug-like molecules that can stick to and break down harmful proteins in the body - even when scientists don't know what those proteins look like. The breakthrough could lead to new treatments for diseases that have long resisted traditional drug development, including certain cancers, brain disorders, and viral infections. The AI tool, called PepMLM, is based on an algorithm originally built to understand human language and used in chatbots, but was trained to understand the "language" of proteins. But many disease-related proteins, including those involved in cancer and neurodegeneration, don't have stable structures. That's where PepMLM takes a different approach – instead of relying on structure, the tool uses only the protein's sequence to design peptide drugs. This makes it possible to target a much broader range of disease proteins, including those that were previously considered "undruggable." In lab tests, the team showed that PepMLM could design peptides – short chains of amino acids – that stick to disease-related proteins and, in some cases, help destroy them. These included proteins involved in cancer, reproductive disorders, Huntington's disease, and even live viral infections. This is one of the first tools that can design these kinds of molecules directly from the protein's sequence. "It's exciting to see how these AI-designed peptides can actually work inside cells to break down toxic proteins," said Peng. "This could be a powerful new approach for diseases like Huntington's, where traditional drugs haven't been effective." The study also included contributions from Ray Truant at McMaster. "This work shows we can now bind any protein to any other protein," said Truant, a professor in the Department of Biochemistry & Biomedical Sciences. The team is already working on next-generation AI algorithms, like PepTune and MOG-DFM, to improve how these peptides behave in the body – making them more stable, more targeted, and easier to deliver. Chatterjee and first author Tianlai Chen are co-inventors on U.S. patent applications related to PepMLM.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A UK university's clever menu shuffle shows how small, invisible changes to dining options can drive big gains for both health and the planet, no new recipes required. Study: Dish swap across a weekly menu can deliver health and sustainability gains. A weekly menu with 15 dishes across five days can be tweaked to produce hundreds of combinations that could yield healthier meals without excessively repeating foods or restricting customer preferences. The concept was tested in a UK university residence over two separate optimized weekly menus in four weeks, including about 5,000 meals. Dietary health changes are notoriously difficult to sustain. Approaches to achieving long-term food choice shifts include educating and informing the target group, providing different food choices related to each food event, regulating some foods, like alcohol, by age of consumption, or providing positive or negative incentives for specific foods. Education and regulation have proved more successful with habits like smoking and drinking than dietary changes, which require a more nuanced approach. Firstly, since food is key to maintaining life, interventions cannot emphasize cessation, such as smoking; instead, the goal must be to eat more healthy foods. Secondly, competition between different foods on the menu means that people choose one meal option and cannot eat alternative meals at that time. The researchers note that this “competition structure” creates opportunities for strategic menu design to shift choices toward healthier and more sustainable options, while ensuring that everyone's most preferred dish remains available. These principles were important in the current study. Investigators aimed to observe the benefits of shuffling foods on a limited menu so that different (healthier) choices are available and chosen more often. This could potentially benefit about 42% of workers in the UK who have their meals at a canteen and over nine million schoolchildren who can eat at school canteens. The current study was held in a UK university residence and covered about 5,000 meals for 300 students over four weeks. The aim was to see how changing the food-choice architecture impacted dietary health and sustainability regarding saturated fat intake and carbon footprint. If successful, it could also be extended to other environmental indicators and dietary health markers. Simply swapping around the 15 dishes would yield over 1.4 million menu combinations. One vegan meal was included daily to meet most residents' dietary requirements. This constraint removed 1,288,000 combinations from consideration, resulting in 113,400 feasible menu options. Differences in individual preferences were considered using data from 70 students, who ranked dishes in a computer-based two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task before the intervention. Two weekly menus were optimized from the feasible set of combinations according to the preferences of a representative consumer sample. Data on meal selection were collected from the whole population of consumers. Since only population-level data were gathered, an inferential statistical test could not be performed. This allowed researchers to calculate the total weekly carbon footprint (projected) and saturated fat intake. The current study analyzed ~5,000 meal selections, allowing for robust inferences. The approach was tested for generalizability by applying the optimization procedure to assess the change in four markers of environmental performance: carbon footprint, eutrophication potential, water use, and land use, concerning the dietary content of fiber, salt, sugar, and saturated fatty acids. For example, the authors report a 69.2% increase in fiber intake while reducing eutrophication potential by 31.7%. Overall consumer satisfaction did not change significantly after dish swapping, but the method used to assess this requires further work. Most importantly, the dishes themselves do not change. Meal swapping led to a 30.7% reduction in the carbon footprint and a 6.3% reduction in saturated fat intake. Scalability is a concern before this tool can be widely adopted. This would require software that allows catering staff to use it easily; training for these personnel to collect meal preference data from canteen users, and user-led quantification of their food's nutritional and environmental effects. Alternatively, future versions might integrate with existing catering sales data to bypass separate preference surveys. The outcome could help population groups to eat healthier diets and promote agricultural sustainability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients are still more likely to trust doctors and consider them more professional when they wear white coats, although women doctors in this attire are often misidentified as nurses or medical assistants, finds a review of the available research on the topic, published in the open access journal BMJ Open. But patient preferences for doctors' attire seem to be strongly influenced by clinical context and medical specialty, with a growing acceptance of scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings, the findings indicate. In the 19th century, doctors primarily wore black, because medical encounters were viewed as serious and formal occasions. The researchers therefore wanted to update those findings, broadening the scope to include diverse clinical contexts, in a bid to gain a deeper understanding of how doctors' attire might influence interactions with patients and treatment outcomes. They scoured research databases for relevant studies published between January 2015 and August 2024. From an initial haul of 724 studies, 32 were eligible for inclusion in the review. Most of the studies were carried out in the USA (17); two each came from Japan, China, and Pakistan; and the rest were carried out in Indonesia, India, Ethiopia, Korea, Germany, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Switzerland. For example, palliative care doctors' attire didn't affect patients' trust, or assessments of the practitioner's capabilities, but patients preferred emergency care doctors to wear white coats or scrubs. Specialty also seemed to influence perceptions, with patient preferences for doctors to wear white coats observed in orthopaedics, surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology, and obstetrics and gynaecology, for example. The included studies indicated a distinct preference among patients for male doctors to wear suits. One study indicated that accessories, such as watches and glasses worn by male doctors significantly enhanced perceived professionalism and trustworthiness, which aligns with the findings of previously published studies, note the researchers. The UK, however, has implemented a 'bare below the elbows' policy, which bans doctors from wearing white coats, watches, ties and long sleeves to minimise infection risks. And even when male and female doctors wore identical attire, female doctors were still more likely to be misidentified as nurses or medical assistants-a misidentification that was consistently observed across different cultural settings. But patients preferred white coats over business or casual attire for both male and female doctors, and irrespective of gender, they favoured doctors wearing white coats, perceiving these practitioners to be trustworthy, respectful, skilled, communicative and empathetic. "This preference aligns with recent evidence indicating that female physicians are often judged more on appearance than their male counterparts. "These gender-specific preferences for surgical attire were each supported by a single study and warrant further validation… None the less, gender-related perceptions of physician attire were consistently reported across studies with a low risk of bias, supporting the robustness of this theme," they add. A few studies explored doctors' attire during the COVID-19 pandemic, when numerous doctors reported a preference for wearing scrubs to prioritise hygiene and ease of movement. These studies consistently reported a shift in patient preference towards practical and hygienic attire, such as scrubs and face masks, reflecting heightened sensitivity to infection control, say the researchers. Many of the studies also relied on self-reported data, and none included children or patients with mental health issues. "While the traditional white coat is seen as a symbol of professionalism and trust, patients have increasingly accepted scrubs, especially in emergency or high-risk settings," they write.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Arizona State University have developed a breakthrough diagnostic tool that could transform how quickly and reliably we detect illnesses like COVID-19, Ebola, AIDS or Lyme disease. The new diagnostic device, called NasRED (Nanoparticle-Supported Rapid Electronic Detection), is simple and portable enough to be used almost anywhere - from remote rural clinics to busy urban hospitals. The tool provides lab-quality accuracy without expensive equipment and does not require specialized training, giving it the potential to become a public health game changer. Chao Wang, Study Lead Author, Associate Professor, School of Electrical, Computer and Energy Engineering, Arizona State University Wang is an associate professor with the Biodesign Center for Molecular Design and Biomimetics. He is joined by ASU researchers Yeji Choi, Seyedsina Mirjalili, Ashif Ikbal, Sean McClure, Maziyar Kalateh Mohammadi, Scott Clemens, Jose Solano, John Heggland, Tingting Zhang and Jiawei Zuo. Infectious diseases are one of humanity's deadliest threats, causing immense suffering and economic damage worldwide. Collectively, infectious diseases cause over 10 million deaths around the world each year, and they are the leading cause of death in low-income countries. Many of these cases involve infections or vascular events that might have been treatable if caught early. In many low- and middle-income countries, access to reliable diagnostic testing is limited or nonexistent. Expensive equipment, shortages of trained personnel and long turnaround times all contribute to delayed or missed diagnoses - often with deadly consequences. A fast, affordable and portable test like NasRED would enable frontline health workers globally to detect infections early and respond before outbreaks spiral out of control. "In many parts of the world, including the U.S., diseases are spreading, but people often don't get tested - even for something like HIV. "For example, people who use injection drugs are at higher risk for HIV or HCV, but they may be living in the streets and hard to reach. If we don't test them consistently over time, we may miss the chance to intervene - until they develop serious complications like cancer or liver disease, when it's much harder to treat." Researchers coat these nanoparticles with special molecules designed to detect specific diseases. Some nanoparticles carry antibodies, tiny molecules that act like magnets. Antibodies stick to proteins released by viruses or bacteria when they infect the body. Other nanoparticles carry antigens, fragments of proteins taken directly from viruses or bacteria themselves. These naturally attract antibodies produced by the body to fight infections. Once coated, these nanoparticles are combined with a tiny sample of bodily fluid, such as a drop of blood, saliva or nasal fluid. If there is no disease, they will remain suspended throughout the liquid. This is a concentration nearly 100,000 times lower than what standard laboratory tests require. Adding to its promise is NasRED's portability and affordability. The current gold standards for testing, like PCR or ELISA, require expensive equipment and trained technicians. The researchers estimate each test costs $2, making it ideal for use in low-resource or remote locations. NasRED has the potential to fill a critical diagnostic gap, especially for diseases that are difficult to detect early, such as hepatitis C, HIV, or Lyme disease. It is also promising for emerging outbreaks with low prevalence but high risk. Such diseases often go undiagnosed because running a lab test for just one or two patients isn't cost-effective. While NasRED currently requires small, benchtop machines for spinning and mixing samples, the researchers are working to further miniaturize and automate the process. With continued development, the technology might one day become a convenient home test, similar to existing rapid COVID-19 tests. However, it would have vastly superior sensitivity and broader applications. That's like detecting a single drop of ink in 20 Olympic swimming pools. In preliminary tests with actual coronavirus particles, NasRED achieved sensitivities comparable to Abbott ID NOW, a popular molecular test for many diseases such as COVID-19. "The nanoparticles are designed so that we can easily swap in different proteins, allowing the same platform to be adapted for many different diseases. We've already demonstrated this approach in our research on Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, as well as cancer biomarkers, Alzheimer's-related proteins, Lyme disease and African swine fever." Wang recently received the Bay Area Lyme Foundation Emerging Leader Award and will make use of the high sensitivity and portability of this new technology to detect early Lyme infection. As the technology evolves, its range of applications may extend beyond infectious diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Never mind that it's also associated with aggression; the hormone is commonly referred to as the "cuddle" or "happy" hormone, and people are encouraged to boost their oxytocin levels for better well-being by touching friends and loved ones, listening to music and exercising. But recent studies involving the prairie vole have called this love association into question. They've shown that oxytocin, which in the brain acts as a neuromodulator, is not essential for long-term mate bonding, or "social monogamy," or for parenting behavior, though without it, voles take longer to form such bonds. Scientists focus on prairie voles because, like humans, they form stable and selective relationships. While most studies focus on mate bonds, the Beery lab at UC Berkeley is particularly interested in selective peer relationships, analogous to human friendships. Such studies could shed light on human psychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia, that interfere with a person's ability to form or maintain social bonds. Prairie voles are special because they allow us to get at the neurobiology of friendship and how it's similar to and different from other types of relationships." Beery and integrative biology graduate student Alexis Black, one of two first authors of the study, found that prairie voles that lack oxytocin receptors take longer than normal voles to form peer relationships. "Oxytocin seems to be particularly important in the early formation phase of relationships and especially in the selectivity of those relationships: 'I prefer you to this stranger,' for example," Beery said. "The animals that didn't have intact oxytocin signaling took longer to form relationships. And then when we challenged those relationships by making new groups, they lost track of their original partners right away." The voles, genetically modified in the UC San Francisco laboratory of collaborator and co-author Dr. Devanand Manoli, also lacked the social rewards that normally come from selective attachments - they didn't work very hard to snuggle up with their friends and were less avoidant of and less aggressive towards strangers. Lacking oxytocin receptors also changed the regulation of oxytocin availability and release in the brain, which the group documented using a novel oxytocin nanosensor in collaboration with postdoctoral fellow Natsumi Komatsu and Markita Landry, a UC Berkeley professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. "That helped us understand the feedback consequences of lacking this receptor, and how oxytocin signaling was altered in the brain," said Beery. While voles are her main focus, she believes studying similar behaviors across multiple species is key to determining what's species-specific versus generalizable across species. To complement her laboratory research, she has conducted field studies comparing social behavior and oxytocin receptor distribution in the brain within and across species in a group of South American rodents and North American Belding's ground squirrels, which vary in whether or not they live in groups. She also recently began field tests of multiple vole species - there are about 50 worldwide - to compare their social behavior. She suspects that in rodents such as voles, and perhaps in other mammals, the formation of peer relationships may have preceded the evolution of monogamous mating relationships. "While most rodents prefer to interact with unfamiliar individuals, it turns out that the majority of vole species we've tested in our early trials form peer-partner preferences, which is what we call these selective friendships. "But only a couple of those species are also monogamous. Is that why monogamy has evolved so many times in this genus?' Beery was a co-author of a 2023 study led by Manoli that threw into question the association of oxytocin with sex and parenting. That study showed that prairie voles unable to respond to oxytocin exhibit the same monogamous mating, attachment and parenting behaviors as regular voles. Those voles had been genetically engineered to have no cellular receptors for oxytocin, and were the same voles used in the current study. But while oxytocin isn't essential for eventual bond formation, additional studies by the same group published in 2024 showed that these receptor-deficient (or "null mutant") prairie voles took about twice as long as normal voles to establish a relationship with a potential mate. Interested in how the lack of an oxytocin receptor affects voles' friendship bonds, as opposed to mating bonds, Beery and Black conducted three sets of experiments. "Wild-type animals form this incredibly robust preference within one day of co-housing, but the null mutants have no sign of a relationship after 24 hours. After a week, they mostly get there, and the lifetime partners look no different from each other," Beery said. "Our conclusion from that experiment is that oxytocin isn't required to have a relationship, but it's really important in those early phases of a relationship to facilitate it happening quickly and efficiently." They then put long-term pair-bonded voles in a party-like, mixed-group situation: an enclosure with other voles and many rooms connected by tubes. "The wild-type animals keep track of who they know. It was as if they didn't even have a partner in there with them." "Female wild-type voles typically press more to get their partner than to get a stranger, in both peer and mate relationships. The oxytocin receptor deficient mutants also press more to get to their mating partner, but not for peer relationships," Beery said. "That makes sense at some level because we think mate relationships are more rewarding than peer relationships, or at least they depend more on reward-signaling pathways." Lack of oxytocin signaling thus not only delays the formation of relationships, but also creates deficits in long-term peer relationships. "On the prosocial side, it's involved in wanting to be with a known friend or peer, while on the antisocial side, it's aiding in rejecting an unfamiliar animal. If oxytocin release increased in these voles, it could potentially interact with a receptor for a similar neuropeptide that is also involved in formation of social relationships, compensating for the absence of oxytocin receptors. Komatsu and Landry found no excess of oxytocin in the voles' brains. Komatsu is now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois. Oxytocin receptors mediate social selectivity in prairie vole peer relationships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Western Finland, the longest-lived region thrives without following classic Blue Zone habits, while another community shows promising lifestyle patterns, challenging the idea that there's only one path to a long and healthy life. Since their description in 1999 by Poulain and colleagues, "Blue Zones", geographical regions characterized by the unusual longevity of their inhabitants, have been identified worldwide. In a recent study published in the Journal of Aging Research, researchers evaluated four regions within Western Finland to see if any have the lifestyle principles typically associated with Blue Zones. Conversely, areas demonstrating stronger adherence to these principles did not have uniformly high longevity. Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia deviated most significantly from Blue Zone principles. The findings suggest that in a Nordic welfare state context, factors beyond the classic Blue Zone lifestyle,  like environmental agreeableness, genetics, and socioeconomic resources, may be critical drivers of healthy aging, guiding public health policy in these regions that are gradually aging. "Blue Zones" are geographical areas where people live significantly longer (measured through rigorous demographic validation like extreme longevity indexes) and healthier lives. First identified in Ogliastra, Italy (1999), these longevity hotspots, which now also include Nicoya, Costa Rica, and Okinawa, Japan, famously share common lifestyle traits, popularly distilled into principles like "move naturally," "eat wisely," and "avoid stress and get plenty of sleep" (combined as one principle). The Blue Zone framework's social and public health benefits cannot be understated, as the concept has inspired several global public health initiatives to leverage its principles to promote healthy aging. Critics, however, question whether the Blue Zone framework, derived from specific cultural contexts, can be universally applied, especially in regions such as Nordic welfare states with unique social and environmental landscapes that radically differ from those of validated Blue Zones. The present study addresses this knowledge gap by searching for a potential Blue Zone in Western Finland, a region known for its linguistic diversity with previously reported notable differences in health and longevity between its Swedish-speaking and Finnish-speaking populations. The study leveraged data from four distinct populations in Western Finland that differ in language (ethnolinguistically) and longevity: 1. However, these statistics could not differentiate between language groups within Ostrobothnia. Regions' health and lifestyle data were obtained from surveys collected from older adults (aged 66-91) in these regions as part of the Gerontological Regional Database (GERDA) in 2021-2022. However, the GERDA survey's self-response format may overrepresent healthier individuals, especially in Finnish-speaking regions with lower response rates. Adherence to Blue Zone principles was assessed across seven core metrics plus an environmental supplement: 1. Environmental features (added as a supplementary principle). Health variables with known longevity associations (e.g., medical conditions and instrumental activities of daily living [IADL]) were used to measure healthy aging. Scoring was composite, with each principle awarded fractional points based on multiple sub-variables. Participants' sociodemographic data (age, sex, education status, etc.) were accounted for in statistical models (Analysis of Variance [ANOVAs]). Longevity data confirmed that the Åland Islands were the most long-lived region, with a life expectancy at birth of 83.47 years (2020-2022), closely followed by Ostrobothnia (83.10 years), while South Ostrobothnia had the lowest (81.83 years). Åland also showed the highest rates of nonagenarians and centenarians. Unexpectedly, however, health and lifestyle data analysis revealed that while Åland demonstrated the best overall health scores (e.g., lowest medication use, best dental health, and least pain), its inhabitants did not follow the core Blue Zone lifestyle closely, scoring only 1.23 out of a possible 7+ principles. Its main strength was "environmental agreeableness" (0.8/1), a measure of living in a pleasant, activity-promoting natural environment linked to its archipelago setting. Researchers attribute Åland's longevity to potential genetic advantages and higher socioeconomic status (education/income) alongside environmental factors. In contrast, Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia and South Ostrobothnia showed the strongest adherence to the core Blue Zone lifestyle principles, both scoring 1.73. They demonstrated the highest adherence in principles related to "strong family ties," "community support," and "purpose in life." Both regions are part of Finland's religious "Bible Belt," with high rates of religious activity potentially contributing to purpose-driven living. South Ostrobothnia additionally showed notable strength in "respect for the planet." Critically, Finnish-speaking Ostrobothnia scored 0, showing the weakest alignment with Blue Zone principles, yet had better health than South Ostrobothnia. In Nordic welfare states, longevity may stem from context-specific factors like environmental assets (Åland) or social-religious cohesion (Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia) rather than universal lifestyle principles. The researchers suggest Swedish-speaking Ostrobothnia warrants further investigation as a potential Blue Zone candidate due to its balance of longevity, health, and lifestyle adherence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a recently published study, researchers at Fox Chase Cancer Center revealed for the first time that cancer cells can evade anti-cancer drugs by entering and surviving within bone marrow fibroblasts, a phenomenon they describe as "cell-in-cell." The results of this five-year study, led by Y. Lynn Wang, MD, PhD, FCAP, a Professor and physician-scientist in the Department of Pathology and the Cell Signaling and Microenvironment Research Program at Fox Chase, could mark a major change in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and related diseases. CLL is the most common hematological cancer in western countries. Our discovery that tumor cells can actually get inside bone marrow fibroblast cells, which support the tumor cells in their microenvironment, has never been reported before as a live phenomenon." "This finding helps to explain why, even when CLL patients initially respond to treatment, many of them carry residual disease and later relapse. We are hopeful that our discovery will lead to treatments that better eliminate residual disease and move toward a cure for cancer," added Wang, who conducted the study with researchers at Fox Chase and other institutions. Over 90% of patients who are treated with these drugs show an initial response - they feel better and their tumors shrink - but only 8% to 11% achieve complete remission in which clinically patients show no evidence of disease. Using confocal microscopy and other techniques, the researchers analyzed bone marrow samples from patients. They witnessed live CLL cells entering bone marrow fibroblasts in response to BTK exposure, and by recording continued independent movement of those subsumed cells, they were able to confirm that the cancer cells stayed alive inside the fibroblasts. Once Wang and her team understood the mechanism by which tumor cells got inside their "safe houses," they were able to demonstrate how clinicians might alter treatment to stop this from happening. By blocking CXCR4 with drugs approved for other clinical indications, the researchers prevented CLL cells from entering fibroblasts, potentially making the cancer more vulnerable to treatment. "If we can block CXCR4, it's like locking the door of the house where tumor cells wanted to retreat and hide," said Wang. "This could potentially increase complete response rates through combination therapy using both BTK inhibitors and CXCR4 blockers." The discovery may also have applications beyond CLL. The researchers found similar "cell-in-cell" hiding behavior in follicular lymphoma and suspect the mechanism could apply to many different cancer types. Wang is encouraged about the potential of her team's discovery. "We want the larger scientific community to know about this mechanism so other researchers can build on these findings.
