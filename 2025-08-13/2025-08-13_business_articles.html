                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Wednesday shrugged off a question about a new report that Russia is at least partially responsible for hacking the electronic system that manages U.S. federal court case documents. Trump said during a press event at the Kennedy Center, in Washington, D.C. Revelations of the breach came days before Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska about Russia's war against Ukraine. The New York Times reported Tuesday that evidence shows that an entity in Russia appeared to have hacked the court case document system and "recently compromised sealed records." That system, in addition to containing publicly available court documents, also has hidden records, including information on individuals charged with national security crimes. "Some of the searches included midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames," the Times reported. The hack is believed to be part of a yearslong effort, the news outlet reported. The U.S. courts system last week announced it "is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents in response to recent escalated cyberattacks of a sophisticated and persistent nature on its case management system." "The Judiciary is also further enhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants," the system said. An internal memo to Justice Department officials and staffers from the courts system, which the Times reviewed, warned that "persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records." "This remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action," the memo said. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of crypto exchange Bullish soared Wednesday after the cryptocurrency exchange raised about $1.1 billion in an initial public offering. The stock opened at $90 on the New York Stock Exchange, 143% above its IPO price of $37. At one point, it rose as high as $118 before closing at $68, a gain of more than 83%. The company priced its IPO early Wednesday far above this week's expected range of $32 to $33 and an initial range last week of between $28 and $31, valuing the company at almost $5.6 billion before trading began. By day's end, Bullish had a market value of some $10.25 billion, based on its 150.684 million shares outstanding. Bullish sold 30 million shares in the IPO, representing 19.9% of its total stock. Bullish, led by former New York Stock Exchange President Tom Farley and backed by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, focuses on institutional investors and blends decentralized finance protocols with the security of a centralized company. Based on the reception we've gotten thus far as part of our IPO, it feels like institutional investors feel like this could be the moment." Since the company's launch in 2021, total trading volume on the Bullish platform exceeded $1.25 trillion as of March 31. The Cayman Islands-headquartered company also owns the crypto news website CoinDesk, which includes crypto indexes, data and analytics. Bullish joins a host of companies looking to take advantage of the Trump administration's favorable attitude toward the crypto industry. In June, stablecoin issuer Circle made a highly successful stock market debut, raising more than $1 billion. That followed the transfer of Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital to the Nasdaq from Toronto, and stock and crypto trading app eToro's IPO that valued it at $5.4 billion. We want to hear from you.

Dundon declined to provide the terms of the proposed sale but said he's "very excited." CNBC's latest Official NBA Team Valuations listed the Trail Blazers at a value of $3.65 billion. The 53-year-old businessman is chairman of Dundon Capital Partners based in Dallas, Texas. He agreed to purchase a controlling stake in the Carolina Hurricanes in 2017, and he's the majority owner of the Pro Pickleball Association and Major League Pickleball. If his purchase of the Trail Blazers is approved, Dundon and his ownership team would take over ownership from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder. In 2022, Nike co-founder Phil Knight reportedly offered over $2 billion for the team, but Allen declined. The Trail Blazers didn't immediately return request for comment. Sportico first reported news of the sale. — CNBC's Michael Ozanian contributed to this report. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As tariffs spark worries of higher prices, Walmart is dangling more discounts for its own employees. The largest private U.S. employer said Wednesday that it will offer a 10% employee discount on nearly all groceries, including milk, meat and frozen food. That discount previously applied to fresh produce and most general merchandise items, such as clothing and toys, but only to other food during the holiday season. In a memo to employees obtained by CNBC, Walmart's chief people officer, Donna Morris, said the expanded price cut takes effect immediately. "We've heard your feedback that these savings make a real difference for you and your families," she wrote in the memo. In fact, it's one of our most requested benefits." Walmart's announcement comes as economists and companies closely watch how rising tariffs trickle through the U.S. economy and shape consumer spending. The consumer price index, a closely watched inflation metric from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, came in better than feared on Tuesday, with food prices flat. Yet the data still pointed to higher prices on some items. Walmart itself has warned that higher prices are coming. In May, the company's CFO, John David Rainey, told CNBC that the discounter was "wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb." The expanded employee discount could boost Walmart's own business, too. It could motivate its huge workforce to spend more of their money at its stores and website rather than at other grocers or retailers. Walmart announced the expanded discount at its holiday meeting in Houston, which all store managers attended. According to a video obtained by CNBC, Walmart U.S. CEO John Furner brought a Walmart store manager to the stage to read the surprise announcement that its 10% discount on food would become year-round. "All I can think is about my associates back at home," the store manager told Furner, as he thanked him. He said employees at his store "don't know how they're going to be paying their next meal and now this is going to help them." Walmart is scheduled to report its latest earnings on Aug. 21.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While last month's consumer price index showed that food prices were effectively flat month over month, tariff-sensitive items like coffee beans, specialty teas and spices are showing signs of inflation, worrying small businesses selling those products. The average retail price for a pound of ground coffee hit $8.41. Overall, food prices were unchanged from June to July but remained 2.9% higher than a year ago, the data showed. Jessica Simons, owner of Bethany's Coffee Shop in Lincoln, Nebraska, told CNBC that her shop has seen prices go up 18% to 25% since January. "We had to put a 3% fee on the coffee because we are waiting for our new menus to be printed, reflecting the new price," said Simons. "But the prices have changed so quickly that we can't reprint menus every time the price goes up." Simons said in addition to coffee, the shop is paying increased prices on avocados and tomatoes. Small businesses are struggling with the rising costs of tariffs." The Tax Foundation recently calculated that almost 74% ($163 billion) of U.S. food imports will be facing tariffs. Josh Teitelbaum, senior counsel at Akin, said that companies that import unavailable natural resources such as coffee or coconut water don't have the option of on-shoring to avoid the tariff. The Administration does have a policy to accommodate this reality in some instances, but it's still a work in progress." "Consumers will still drink tea, but they may get lower quality products from companies that can weather these costs," said Bhargava. "Small, bootstrapped brands that prioritize integrity and authenticity could be squeezed out entirely." Bhargava is concerned about the 50% tariff on tea from India, and said at the retailers where her product is sold, like Whole Foods, there is little room for major price changes. "The 50% tariff on tea, not to mention the tariffs on my spices and other necessities, will devastate my already slim margins and could force me to raise prices that customers are already balking at, given the leverage my large competitors have." Bhargava has made concessions on her packaging, which was manufactured in China, but told CNBC she refuses to compromise on ingredients. "This tariff forces a choice between maintaining quality and staying in business, and many small businesses won't survive that choice," said Bhargava. "My chai concentrate uses organic single-origin Assam CTC tea that I can only get from India; There's no alternative source. I can't afford to stockpile like my larger competitors, especially given how unlevel the playing field already is." There are concerns as well that the impact of tariffs will flow further onto grocery stores into other products. That could be further amplified by the cuts to the SNAP program by the Big Beautiful Bill, all of which is leading to lower forecasts from retailers, according to Heather Rice, who leads the consumer, retail, industrial manufacturing, energy, and life science practice at KPMG. "Almost 9% of spending comes from those recipients," said Rice. "The amount of products on the shelves, I believe, will change based on where they source their products. Between our crops and exports, we can have blueberries 12 months out of the year. But I think with tariffs, we could see a change there, where you don't have blueberries all year long. I think we could see a product shift." Bhargava said the global trade war is going to hurt everyone. When authentic, quality products become unaffordable, the entire supply chain suffers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The chances that Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos will become the next Federal Reserve chair are jumping on prediction market Kalshi as the Trump administration considers several candidates to succeed current Fed Chair Jerome Powell once his term expires next year. Users on Kalshi increased their bets that President Donald Trump will nominate Zervos to 15% on Wednesday after sources told CNBC that Trump is looking at 11 candidates for Fed chair, including Zervos as well as others such as former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey and Rick Rieder – BlackRock's chief investment officer for global fixed income. Zervos' probability of becoming Trump's pick tied that of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh's, who was once considered the front-runner for the position. Fed Governor Chris Waller still sits in the No. 1 spot on the platform, with odds at 31%, while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett's odds are now at 20%. Both Hassett and Warsh odds shot up on prediction markets after Trump talked up "the Kevins" on CNBC last week, saying they are both "very good." The two have advocated for lower interest rates. Powell, whose term ends in May 2026, has been a frequent target of Trump's criticism for refusing to cut rates. In the most recent Fed decision in July, Waller, along with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, publicly dissented with the central bank's decision to hold rates steady. Waller, who was nominated by Trump to the Fed in 2020, said its wait-and-see approach is "overly cautious." Bloomberg News reported last week, citing people familiar with the matter, that Trump's advisors like Waller's openness to adjust monetary policy based on forecasting, rather than current data. It also reported that Waller has met with Trump's team about the Fed chief role but hasn't met with the president himself. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The lawsuit, filed last week in a Georgia state court by an anonymous DeKalb County mother and her young son, accuses Roblox of negligence as well as prioritizing growth over child safety. It follows a recent wave of similar lawsuits lodged against the $90 billion company that accuse the popular gaming platform of not doing enough to safeguard children from pedophiles. The latest lawsuit alleges that these predators harassed the boy for months and ultimately "extorted" him to send sexually explicit images and videos to his friends at school. "Had Defendant implemented even the most basic system of age and identity verification, as well as effective parental controls, Plaintiff would never have engaged with this predator and never been harmed," the lawsuit says. In July, Roblox announced a new age verification system, which includes an age estimation tool based on a selfie-style video, for users who want to chat back-and-forth with so-called "trusted connections." "If the system estimates that a user is actually under 13, then we will automatically correct the user's age to under 13 and remove access to features that are not appropriate," Roblox says on its website. The Georgia mother's attorney, Matthew Dolman of the Florida-based firm Dolman Law Group, told Business Insider that he expects even more lawsuits to be filed in the near future and that his firm is currently investigating over 300 incidents on behalf of prospective claimants. "Roblox has materially misrepresented that its product is safe on multiple occasions knowing full well that law enforcement investigations resulting in arrests of sexual predators are occurring nationwide," Dolman said. Roblox, a top gaming platform among children and teens, hosts millions of user-generated games called "experiences" that range from racing to horror-themed. The Georgia lawsuit, which seeks a jury trial and an unspecified amount in monetary damages, says that Roblox hosts a "staggering number" of games centered on simulated sexual activity. The court documents also cited some games with titles like "Survive Diddy" and "Escape to Epstein Island" in reference to hip-hop mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was recently convicted of two prostitution-related federal charges, and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The latest lawsuit — which includes identical pages of allegations cited in separate, but similar lawsuits against Roblox — said the Georgia boy is just "one of countless children whose lives have been devastated" thanks to Roblox's "gross negligence and defectively designed app." The Roblox spokesperson told Business Insider: "While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, and prohibiting sexual conversations." Roblox recently deployed an open-source AI-powered system called Sentinel that it says was designed to help detect any early indicators of child endangerment interactions. Roblox has faced at least eight more lawsuits this year alleging the sexual exploitation of children. Three of those were filed by Dolman's firm, while the others were filed by the Pennsylvania-based personal injury law firm, Anapol Weiss. The lawsuits come after an October 2024 report by the prominent short-seller Hindenburg Research accused Roblox of being an "X-rated pedophile hellscape" and "exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech." The group-chatting platform Discord has been named as a codefendant in some of those other lawsuits. A Discord spokesperson told Business Insider that the company does not comment on ongoing litigation, but said, "Any content or behavior that endangers younger users is not allowed on Discord." One lawsuit filed last month in a California federal court alleges that a 14-year-old girl was groomed on Roblox by an adult predator masquerading as another teen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On August 7, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could mean big changes for the many Americans with retirement accounts. The Trump administration has prioritized crypto-friendly policies that may help spur crypto adoption. This has sparked significant momentum for crypto markets, with bitcoin leading the way. As Business Insider reports, though, the idea of opening up 401(k)s to alternative assets originally raised red flags for many people in the asset management and financial advisory spaces. In their view, this policy change could compromise the low-risk, uncomplicated nature of 401(k)s, which is considered to be part of why many people trust them. As Marcus Sturdivant Sr., managing member of The ABC Squared said, financial advisors had been discussing these issues with clients long before Trump's executive order. Many people outside the financial sector may not fully understand what private equity is. This is partially because the private equity process of gaining exposure to companies that are not publicly traded has been reserved for high-net-worth individuals. He added that the private equity industry also funds many companies that do not end up going public and, in some cases, lose a lot of money. However, there are still tradeoffs, and opening up a 401(k) to private equity may disadvantage some users due to timing, specifically the lock-up period on an investment, which can be either a pro or con. "If you are older and near retirement or leave it as an inherited account, the private credit portion may be locked in for a period that makes the ten-year period to use an inherited retirement account impossible to access the funds," he noted. It is well known that crypto is subject to volatility, which has sparked concern among some policymakers who see it as high-risk for consumers. A group of Senators recently raised it in a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) director William Pulte, highlighting concerns with his plan to have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac count crypto as an asset in some mortgage applications. Sturdivant described the prospect of adding crypto to a 401(k) as intriguing but noted that coin and token performance can depend on a multitude of factors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a tumultuous summer for markets, but investors have mostly ploughed through the volatility and pushed stocks steadily higher — but one top bank is warning not to get comfortable. Solid earnings, a still-strong economy, and more AI hype have pushed stocks ever upward. However, Morgan Stanley thinks there are a few things that could snap the winning streak. Here's what the bank is looking at: "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' JOLTs survey, job openings fell to 7.44 million at the end of June, equating to a weak openings-to-job-seeker ratio of roughly 1:1," Shalett added. The report highlighted several other economic data points that point toward slower economic growth, including a survey from the Institute for Supply Management which showed new employment contracting at levels that may indicate a coming recession. Shalett acknowledged that Q2 earnings season showed strong growth for many companies, particularly those in the tech sector. S&P 500 earnings beats have managed to remain at or above the 80% benchmark with a few weeks left to go. It added that while the members of the Magnificent 7 are growing at a rate of 26% for the year, that still leaves 493 companies that are barely up, if at all, on a year-over-year (YOY) basis. "Is the economy really robust if most of the largest-cap companies' profits are only in line with nominal GDP growth?" Shalett flagged two themes that have dominated economic conversations recently: inflation and the possibility of stagflation, which could curtail the forces pushing markets up. With President Donald Trump's trade war still raging, concerns about inflation have spiked, but the overall economy appears to be in good shape for now. However, Morgan Stanley said that this could be temporary. Other analysts and commentators have raised similar concerns, noting that tariffs could cause the state of the economy to deteriorate, even as investor optimism remains robust.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Budget airline flights could be about to get more expensive in the US. In a quarterly report filed Monday, Spirit Airlines warned that it might not survive another year. If it did go under, then competitors would, in theory, be able to raise ticket prices, analysts have said. Spirit previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last November before exiting the process in March. However, it has continued to report losses, which totalled $245.8 million in the second quarter of this year, and said there was "substantial doubt" over its "ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months." Analysts at Raymond James said that rival airlines Frontier, JetBlue, and Southwest overlap the most with Spirit, which means they could be the most likely to increase fares. "The biggest benefits to industry pricing from further pullback or exit by Spirit would be in routes where both Spirit and Frontier compete," wrote Savanthi Syth, a senior research associate at the firm. She added that fares on these journeys are typically 15% cheaper than those operated by only one of the two airlines. Spirit Airlines' share price fell by 40% to $2.10 on Tuesday. Syth said Raymond James analysts hadn't expected stocks to move as much as they have, given that Spirit's warning was "not necessarily a surprise." Economic concerns over Donald Trump's tariff plan have seen people cut back on travel, while post-pandemic fliers are more interested in paying for premium options. If it ceases operations, thousands of jobs would be at risk. Read the absurd DOJ arguments - that were wrong! Spirit Airlines, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, and the DoJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside US working hours.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo has proposed to his longtime girlfriend with a massive diamond engagement ring. The footballer's girlfriend, Argentine-Spanish model Georgina Rodriguez, announced the engagement in a Monday post on Instagram. She posted a picture of her hand with long, manicured nails — and a huge ring. The central oval-shaped diamond was flanked on either side by two smaller diamonds. Anya Walsh, a jewelry specialist at London-based retailer 77 Diamonds, told The New York Times that she estimates the ring's weight was around 35 carats and costs at least $5 million. Ronaldo and Rodriguez have been dating since 2016. They met when Ronaldo walked into a Gucci store in Madrid, where Rodriquez, now 31, worked as a retail assistant. They share two daughters and raise them with Ronaldo's three children from a previous relationship. Ronaldo, 40, is a Portuguese football player who is the captain and forward of the Portuguese national team and Saudi Arabia's Al-Nassr Football Club. Before joining Al-Nassr, he played for numerous other football clubs, including Real Madrid, Manchester United, and Juventus.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk has a bone to pick with Apple. In a series of tweets late Monday night, Musk said xAI would take legal action against Apple for what he says is its bias toward OpenAI on the App Store. "Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation," Musk wrote in an X post. In a post earlier on Monday, he asked why the App Store hadn't placed X higher in its rankings. Inquiring minds want to know," Musk wrote. xAI didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Apple's spokesperson said in an email to Business Insider on Tuesday that the App Store is "designed to be fair and free of bias." "We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations, and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria," the spokesperson said. At press time, OpenAI's ChatGPT is ranked first on the App Store. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk's threats on Monday. "This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn't like," Altman wrote on X. Altman said the ChatGPT maker would remain "focused on making great products." "Apple behaves like it's owned by OpenAI — why?" He was responding to a post containing several screenshots of banners from the App Store featuring ChatGPT. In February 2024, Musk filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing it of violating its nonprofit mission when it partnered with Microsoft. He withdrew the lawsuit in June 2024, only to refile it two months later. Musk has previously leveled criticism at Apple and the App Store. Musk said Apple's fee was a "tax on the Internet" and "literally 10 times higher than it should be." After acquiring Twitter in October 2022, Musk accused Apple of censorship and monopolistic practices. "Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. "Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why," he wrote in a follow-up post, amid concerns that Musk's loosening of Twitter's content moderation policies could run afoul of Apple's content restrictions. The dispute was resolved after Musk met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk said in an X post on November 30, 2022, that he had a "good conversation" with Cook and that they had "resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store." "Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so," Musk said. August 13, 3:30 a.m. — This story has been updated with a statement from Apple.</p>
