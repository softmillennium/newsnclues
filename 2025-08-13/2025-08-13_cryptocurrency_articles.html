                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Andreessen Horowitz and DeFi Education Fund urge SEC to create a regulatory safe harbor for DeFi/NFT apps, exempting them from broker-dealer rules. - It follows SEC Chair's directive to modernize crypto rules but does not address past enforcement actions against major exchanges like Coinbase. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the DeFi Education Fund have jointly called on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a regulatory “safe harbor” for certain decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) applications, exempting them from the agency's broker-dealer registration requirements. The proposal follows a similar request made by a16z in March for a specific NFT safe harbor, including potential exemptions for airdrops and network token activities [3]. The request also follows a directive from SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has instructed agency staff to update outdated rules affecting crypto and blockchain technologies [4]. Despite these developments, the proposal does not address past enforcement actions by the SEC, including lawsuits against major firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Cumberland DRW for operating as unregistered brokers [5]. A16z and the DeFi Education Fund argue that the proposed safe harbor would not undermine investor protection but instead enhance it by fostering a clear and balanced legal environment that encourages innovation. The initiative reflects a growing demand for regulatory certainty in the DeFi and NFT sectors, where many developers fear that inconsistent enforcement could stifle development and push projects overseas [8].

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the advocacy organization DeFi Education Fund have asked the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to set up a safe harbor program for non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications from the agency's broker-dealer registration requirements. In a Wednesday letter to SEC Commissioner and Crypto Task Force head Hester Peirce, a16z and the DeFi group said they were following up on US President Donald Trump's Working Group on Digital Assets call to “provide relief for certain DeFi service providers from the broker-dealer [...], exchange [...], and clearing agency [...] registration provisions of the Exchange Act.” In July, SEC Chair Paul Atkins also said he had directed the agency's staff to “update antiquated agency rules and regulations” concerning certain crypto and blockchain applications. A safe harbor, in terms of SEC regulations, would allow many companies offering crypto-related products and services to avoid enforcement actions. The commission and individual investors have previously filed civil lawsuits against cryptocurrency companies for operating as unregistered dealers, including Cumberland DRW, Coinbase and Kraken. Related: SEC Commissioner says ‘safe harbor' laws would've made ICO problems worse The proposed change in SEC policy followed a16z sending a letter in March to Peirce, detailing recommendations for an NFT safe harbor at the agency. However, the SEC clarified in May that the SPBD designation was not mandatory for “broker-dealers seeking to custody customer crypto assets that are securities,” adding that standard requirements would apply for both engaging in digital asset and traditional securities. How the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) handle digital assets could change once lawmakers in the US Congress address proposed legislation to establish a crypto market structure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent exchange on the social media platform X between investment account Invest In Assets and crypto commentator Jake Claver relayed this sentiment, especially when it comes to selling too soon. The discussion comes when XRP is at its greatest level of support among its supporters, with some predicting it could mirror the meteoric runs made by Bitcoin in previous market cycles. The conversation began when an account on X known as “Invest In Assets” advised investors against prematurely selling a big winner. In response, Jake Claver noted Bitcoin's runs as textbook examples of missed opportunities. Particularly, he noted that the mistake of selling too early happened to many people with Bitcoin, and it will ultimately happen again with XRP. Now, XRP is being framed as the next potential case study, and many analysts, not only Jake Claver, argue that the psychological trap of early profit-taking could strike again. Adding more weight to this argument is crypto commentator Vincent Van Code's claim that Bitcoin was only an experiment, while XRP represents the final form of money. According to Van Code, although Bitcoin revolutionized finance by introducing decentralized digital currency with a fixed supply, its slow speed, high transaction costs, and scarcity-focused design ultimately limit its global liquidity potential. XRP, which is engineered for speed, scalability, and cross-border liquidity, offers a far more practical architecture for real-world value transfer. The discussions about not selling XRP early have taken strong root among investors looking to position themselves ahead of what could be another run. This ties into a similar admonishment by investor Johnny Crypto, who once revealed his personal perspective of selling too early. Particularly, Johnny Crypto recalled how selling his Amazon stock too early in 1997 cost him $52 million in missed gains, an error he's determined not to repeat with XRP. He even warned that banks could attempt to seize control of retail crypto holdings within the next year and advised investors to think strategically about asset protection.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff John Roberts is the Finance and Crypto editor at Fortune, overseeing coverage of the blockchain and how technology is changing finance. Today, Yi He is a celebrity to millions of Chinese and a multibillionaire thanks to her reported 10% stake in the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, where she wields enormous influence as a cofounder and senior executive. Binance's other cofounder, the flamboyant Changpeng Zhao, went to prison last year in the United States as part of a $4 billion plea deal. Zhao has served his sentence, and Binance, despite incurring the sort of blow that would have crippled most companies, is still on top as the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange. Yi He has been instrumental in achieving this, and after years of wielding power behind the scenes, is taking on a more public role running Binance. In a rare interview, Yi He told Fortune about her journey from poor village girl to crypto billionaire, the tests she faced during Binance's year of crisis, and her vision for an industry that is fast transforming global finance. In the course of her life and career, Yi He has overcome many obstacles—one of which has been learning English, which she only took up four years ago in her mid-thirties. During a long Zoom interview, He acquits herself well, only falling back on her translator when she struggles to explain a Chinese idiom or proverb. The power of communication is something Yi He knows well. To this day, she prides herself on listening to Binance clients on Telegram, X, WeChat, and any other platform where they might be found, and insists everyone else do the same. She has famously required that everyone who comes to work at Binance spend a few weeks on the front lines of customer service. Yi He says she can empathize with such stories given her own experience growing up poor in Sichuan province, where she lost her father at age 9 and, when she was 16, spent long hours working to promote soft drinks outside a supermarket. Though she ultimately made her way to university—He pauses to recall the delights of being in a library for the first time—and a career as a TV host, she says her humble beginnings mean she can still relate to Binance's many customers of modest means. Yi He's tale has echoes of Jennifer Lopez's “Jenny From the Block,” a song about a beautiful woman who keeps the common touch even after she is rich and famous—the sort of story Americans lap up. But that's not how it plays in China, says Eowyn Chen, CEO of crypto firm Trust Wallet, who formerly worked for Yi He at Binance. Chen says Yi He is the regular target of articles and social media barbs that seek to demean and ridicule her, but that her response is to turn negative rhetoric against those lobbing it. When Changpeng Zhao launched Binance in 2017, he had already built an outsize public persona as CZ, by which he is universally known today. Zhao asked Yi He to join Binance in its early days but only after she had first recruited him years earlier, when she persuaded him to join her as chief technology officer at the exchange OKCoin (now OKX) in 2014. The pair shared an enthusiasm for crypto but other qualities as well. Zhao, like Yi He, spent his early years in an unheated, rural schoolhouse until his father immigrated to Canada where, in high school, Zhao worked minimum wage jobs at Chevron and McDonald's. Zhao is also inclined to clap back at those who mock his background, even retweeting memes of himself in a Golden Arches uniform. Today, the pair, who never married but remain romantically involved, work closely as parents and business partners. Yi He is co-owner with Zhao of Binance's venture capital arm turned family office, YZi Labs, and owns at least 10% of shares in the parent company, according to the Wall Street Journal. On the nature of her relationship with Zhao, Yi He asked not to be quoted on the record and instead provided a written statement: “My personal life is independent from my professional life. My achievements and capabilities as cofounder are often overlooked with my personal life in question,” she wrote, while touting a Binance user base of 280 million customers. In practice, this has meant Zhao occupying the role of Binance's larger-than-life frontman and product visionary, with Yi He fanning massive growth through aggressive promotions, including car giveaways. Her approach found favor with the Chinese community abroad and also in China, where crypto is technically banned but still hugely popular, in part because it is an easily transferable asset beyond the reach of government capital controls. A Binance employee who asked not to be named so as to discuss the firm's executives described Yi He as an exacting boss, but one who supports employees and advocates for those around her. In discussing Binance's day-to-day operations, Yi He said a core tenet at the company is “founder culture,” a phrase from the tech world that describes firms that retain the original drive of their early startup days. While that strategy helped fuel Binance's incredible growth, it has at times also been the company's biggest weakness—one that caused it to lose its most prominent founder. In September of 2023, the agency announced a sweeping settlement that would not only see Binance pay a whopping $4.3 billion fine—the largest of its kind in corporate history—but also force Zhao to step down as CEO and plead guilty to charges of failing to implement adequate anti-money-laundering measures. Despite this massive blow to both its treasury and leadership, Binance two years later remains the biggest crypto exchange by far under Zhao's successor, Richard Teng. In January, Binance also took a major step—for the first time introducing a formal board structure, featuring seven members including Teng and three independent directors. Despite all this, a former employee at the company told Fortune that the power at Binance very much resides where it always has—with Zhao, Yi He, and two other early Binance executives, Lilai “Roger” Wang and Wei “Sonny” Zhou. The person, who asked not to be identified in order to speak candidly, added that Yi He has a final say in all personnel matters and exerts the greatest authority when it comes to customer experience decisions. The founder of a venture capital firm, meanwhile, described Binance as a company run with an “iron fist” that, despite dealing with new legal constraints and the challenge of running a sprawling global operation, is in no danger of losing its place as market leader. Yi He predicts that crypto will accelerate its push into the conventional financial system through stablecoins and other blockchain technologies and that, in five to 10 years, both realms will be fully integrated with each other. On a personal level, Yi He says the mass adoption of crypto feels like yet another massive technological change she has experienced since the days of her girlhood not so long ago, when her house didn't have electricity or running water. As for the trials she's experienced along the way, she cites a Mongolian proverb: “Since you have spoken well, do not speak of pain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Blockchain is maturing for enterprise use, evolving from speculative cryptocurrency to practical applications like B2B payments, FX and treasury operations. Understanding the blockchain stack is crucial for CFOs, as blockchain's modular architecture allows CFOs to optimize for speed, cost and compliance, with each layer (0 through 3) serving specific roles. Blockchain technology is putting on a suit and tie as it tries to woo the staid halls of Fortune 500 businesses. As the sector's innovative architecture for money movement matures beyond hype cycles and speculative tokens toward cross-border B2B payments and treasury management, a clearer, more operational question now faces the enterprise C-suite. How exactly does this new digital financial infrastructure work, and how can enterprise finance leaders use it to move money better, faster and cheaper? For chief financial officers and corporate treasurers, the answer lies not just in abstract innovation but in the layered structure of blockchain networks. Also on Tuesday, Nuvei announced it is employing stablecoin rails to expand its global money movement capabilities. On Monday (Aug. 11), news broke that Stripe is reportedly developing an entirely new blockchain in partnership with cryptocurrency-focused venture capital firm Paradigm. Just as traditional finance evolved distinct but interlocking systems for messaging (SWIFT), settlement (ACH, Fedwire) and compliance (anti-money laundering and know your customer), blockchain layers map to similarly specialized functions, but with different speed, cost and composability profiles. At a high level, blockchain networks are built on four primary layers, each with distinct functions. Layer 0 operates as the network backbone of blockchain ecosystems, functioning as the foundational protocol layer that connects independent blockchains through interoperability, consensus and data transfer. Leading examples include Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin and now Circle's Arc. For finance leaders, this is where stablecoins reside, making it the digital equivalent of Fedwire or SWIFT's central ledger. In the context of USDC or EURC payments, Layer 1 systems enable the settlement of real monetary value, often in seconds, providing liquidity and certainty to corporate treasuries. This structure is designed for higher throughput, lower fees and improved efficiency. Examples include Fireblocks, Circle's APIs, Chainlink and enterprise blockchain software development kits (SDKs). From a CFO's perspective, Layer 3 is where finance and engineering teams converge. It defines how seamlessly an ERP can issue a purchase order and trace it to real-time settlement, or how treasury teams can monitor on-chain liquidity, creating operational transparency across the enterprise. Just as cloud computing abstracted servers, storage and applications into modular layers, blockchain is doing the same for value movement. CFOs who understand how each layer fits the digital asset dictionary will be best positioned to harness the benefits — lower transaction costs, faster working capital cycles and programmable compliance. To ground the abstraction, take the example of a sample enterprise payment flow of a $50,000 purchase order (PO) for IT equipment, sourced across borders, paid in stablecoins and settled on-chain. The PO issuance takes place first across Layer 3, when an ERP system like SAP triggers a PO using an integrated blockchain API (Circle or Fireblocks). A smart contract records the PO on-chain, with terms encoded such as payment conditions, counterparty wallet or invoice matching logic. Next, funds are transferred to a Layer 2 escrow contract, minimizing fees. Upon delivery confirmation, the smart contract releases funds, settled in USDC on a Layer 1 like Arc, for example. Reporting and reconciliation happen across Layers 0 and 3, with Layer 0 protocols syncing transaction records across chains if multiple chains were used (e.g., multi-geo vendors).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The token generation event (TGE) for SAPIEN will take place on Coinbase's layer-2 blockchain, Base. The tokens will power the protocol's decentralized data foundry, which connects demand for high-quality data with a global network of human experts. Sapien's system is designed to help AI teams answer two fundamental questions for every decision their models make: "Where did this data come from, and can it be trusted?" The protocol uses what it calls Proof of Quality in the form of on-chain incentives to make human data traceable and trustworthy, according to CEO Rowan Stone. PoQ employs four integrated mechanisms — staking, validation, reputation and incentives — to enforce data quality by rewarding contributors who provide reliable information and penalizing those who do not, thereby creating a self-governing model for high-integrity AI training data. A portion of the airdrop – 5% of the total supply – will be distributed to early contributors based on their confirmed points. The Sapien Squad and Discord role holders are also slated to receive a bonus allocation for their participation. The token launch is backed by a series of significant developments, including over 30 enterprise clients and a new partnership with Coinbase's Embedded Wallets feature, designed to provide a frictionless on-chain experience for the protocol's user base. It is backed by leading investors including Variant, Primitive Ventures, Yield Guild Games YGG$0.1764 and Orange DAO through its $10.5 million seed round.

We play an important role ensuring police are compliant with data protection law and that people's rights are protected, including by providing clear guidance on the use of FRT and undertaking regular audits of police forces, so that the public can have confidence in how the technology is used. An investigator for the police complaints watchdog has pleaded guilty to unlawfully obtaining sensitive personal data. We have today published new guidance to help organisations disclose documents securely. We have fined Scottish charity Birthlink £18,000 after it destroyed approximately 4,800 personal records, up to ten percent of which may be irreplaceable. This year marks a significant milestone - 20 years since the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act came into force. We are calling for views on a new enforcement approach that could unlock privacy-preserving alternatives to the dominant adtech business model. We welcome a guilty verdict in a trial related to the unlawful accessing and obtaining of people's personal information from vehicle repair garages to generate potential leads for personal injury claims.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Behind many of these changes is blockchain, a technology best known for powering cryptocurrencies, now making its way into digital play spaces. Whether it's through token-based economies or ownership of in-game items, this shift is attracting attention from those who care about fairness, security, and personal control. This same technology is also influencing the world of online gambling. In America, where gambling regulations are among the strictest globally, blockchain offers a way to enhance transparency and fairness. Many of the best crypto casinos now use provably fair systems, allowing users to independently verify every card shuffle or dice roll. These platforms often support secure, instant payments via digital currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, and some are even licensed by recognised international regulators. Traditionally, when players buy skins, weapons or upgrades, they don't own them. The items live on a server and can be taken away at any time. Games like Illuvium and Gods Unchained are already using this approach. Players in these titles can win or buy digital cards and gear that they fully control, outside of the game's system. The connection between gaming and blockchain doesn't end with digital assets. Some developers are now using smart contracts, bits of code stored on blockchain, to automate game rules and outcomes. That means every match, roll or decision is written into code and can't be changed once live. This kind of setup is particularly useful in casino-style games, where fairness and trust are often questioned. The influence of blockchain can also be seen in metaverse-style platforms, where virtual casinos are built inside persistent online worlds. These spaces aren't just for gambling; they also include chat rooms, custom avatars, and player-driven economies. In some cases, users can even buy virtual land next to a casino and rent it out. One example is Decentraland, which has hosted digital poker rooms and slot halls. These projects attract tech-savvy players who are curious about how blockchain can support large, interactive environments. Some now stream their sessions on blockchain-powered games or casino sites, bringing more visibility to the space. It's important to note that not every game with blockchain is focused on gambling. Many are adventure, card, or strategy games that use the tech in smaller ways. Still, the overlap between blockchain features and online casino formats is growing. As online play continues to evolve, so too does the technology that powers it. Blockchain is no longer just about coins or crypto speculation. Whether that's in a battle royale or at a virtual blackjack table, the rules are changing, and for many players, that's exactly the point.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former WNBA star Sophie Brunner's mother was killed in a head-on crash in Illinois with an illegal immigrant who had a disturbing history of drunk driving, according to authorities. Darcy Connolly-Brunner, 61, was struck when Rolando Ico-Choc, a 30-year-old Guatemalan national, crossed over into the wrong lane in Freeport on Saturday afternoon, the Stephenson County Sheriff's office said. The migrant, who had a hefty rap sheet including multiple prior DUIs, was also killed in the wreck, according to officials. They have already said there is no indication Connolly-Brunner — a married mom-of-four — was drunk. He was released into the US by border agents after being given a future court date of September 2026, the source added. “A woman who dedicated her life to her family and her community was killed in broad daylight by a man who never should have been in this country or on the road,” Chesney said in a statement. Ico-Choc's run-ins with authorities dates back to at least March 2022 when he was arrested on DUI charges, as well as driving without a valid license, WREX reported. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor DUI and was ordered to remain under court supervision for two years, records show. Ico-Choc pleaded guilty again and was slapped with a court supervision order, as well as a brief 80 stint in jail. After he was arrested for domestic battery in June 2023, he was sentenced to six days in prison, court records show. Sen. Chesney blasted the state's lax immigration law — known as the TRUST Act — that prevents local cops from working with ICE to nab criminal migrants. “Over the last few years, this man was shielded by systems that provide sanctuary to illegal immigrants and are more focused on allowing criminals to walk free than on protecting Illinois citizens,” Chesney said. “I am not going to sit by silently while dangerous repeat offenders who are in this country illegally are given free rein to destroy lives.” State Rep. John Cabello also piled on, blaming Illinois Gov. “I'm not directing this investigation in any way. “She had a way of making people feel welcome and valued. Her passing has left a hole in the hearts of those who knew her, including myself and members of my family.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metaplanet triples assets in Q2, launching Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares to target Japan's yield-starved fixed income market. Japan's $8–10 trillion fixed-income market, encompassing Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), corporate bonds, and municipals, offers some of the lowest returns in the developed world. The 10-year JGB yields just ~1%, and corporate bonds often struggle to clear 2%. For decades, pension funds, insurers, and banks have been locked into these low-yield allocations, constrained by a lack of compliant, high-return alternatives. This surge in financial performance strengthens Metaplanet's credibility with investors and positions it to roll out Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares at scale, using its momentum to capture a share of Japan's vast but yield-starved fixed income market. Preferred equity sits between debt and common stock in a company's capital structure. It offers dividend priority, higher liquidation claims, and predictable payouts—often without voting dilution. By matching each issuance to market demand, Strategy has raised billions and grown its Bitcoin holdings to more than 500,000 BTC—without relying solely on common equity dilution. Japan's fixed income market has faced decades of near-zero yields, leaving trillions in capital with few compliant, income-producing options. This scarcity makes it uniquely primed for higher-yield instruments like Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares. The listed preferred share market is just $2.7 billion—less than 0.02% of total financial assets. In a regulatory-compliant, familiar structure, that spread could attract both domestic institutions and retail allocators looking for yield without leaving the fixed income universe. Metaplanet plans to issue multiple classes of Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Shares, each built for a different investor segment: This isn't just a product lineup—it's the construction of an investable BTC-backed yield curve. If they succeed, Japan's first Bitcoin-Backed Preferred Share program won't be the last. It could mark the beginning of Bitcoin's fixed income era—and a case study in how corporate Bitcoin strategies evolve to fit the markets they enter.

Six-time NBA champion Scottie Pippen, known in crypto circles for his eyebrow-raising Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) price calls, says he's taking a step back from publicly sharing his dream-based conversations with the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto. What Happened: Pippen claims Satoshi has been appearing in his dreams since 1993, offering him BTC price predictions that he's posted online, with some surprisingly accurate results. Trending: The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. In September 2024, he predicted Bitcoin at $84,650 on U.S. election day (it hit two weeks late), and in December 2024 he forecast BTC would touch $81,000 before $100,000 again, which also played out. Saylor, a friend since a 2024 crypto conference, has urged Pippen not to speak too openly about these "meetings," saying Bitcoin maximalists are fiercely protective of Satoshi's identity. See Also: 2,000 High Earners Manage $6B With This AI Platform — Book Your Private Demo Why It Matters: In July 2025, Pippen shared his latest dream-inspired targets: $233,000 BTC by 2026, $1,000 SOL, and $10 XRP, asking followers which will happen first. Pippen's crypto journey began in 2022 with a digital sneaker NFT drop. Unlike other celebrities, he says his aim is to bring people into crypto, not launch a "dodgy meme coin." Pippen also told CoinTelegraph Magazine he hopes to meet pro-crypto President Donald Trump before his term ends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Data Point Decoding the headlines with facts, figures, and numbers South Korean cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon pleaded guilty on Tuesday to two fraud charges arising from the $40 billion collapse of a cryptocurrency ecosystem that had promised investors their money was safe. According to a plea agreement signed by Kwon and prosecutors, the government said it will not seek a prison term of more than 12 years as long as Kwon complies with the deal's terms, even though federal sentencing guidelines would have recommended a prison term of about 25 years. Authorities said investors worldwide lost money in the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs' $40 billion cryptocurrency crash. TerraUSD was designed as a “stablecoin,” a currency that is pegged to stable assets such as the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg. Kwon was extradited to the United States on Dec. 31 from Montenegro after his March 23, 2023, arrest while traveling on a false passport in Europe. As part of his plea to one count of conspiring to commit commodities fraud, securities fraud and wire fraud and a second count of wire fraud, Kwon also agreed to forfeit over $19 million, an amount that authorities said reflected ill-gotten proceeds. He'll also lose his interest in Terraform and its cryptocurrencies. His lawyer, Sean Hecker, said the plea meant that Kwon had accepted responsibility for making false and misleading statements to investors. In a news release, U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton said Kwon “used the technological promise and investment euphoria around cryptocurrency to commit one of the largest frauds in history.” He said investors around the world suffered billions of dollars in losses.
