                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal law enforcement agents from various agencies including Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Park Police, and FBI, question a couple who had been parked outside a legal parking zone while eating McDonald's takeout, Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025, in northwest Washington near Kennedy St. NW. The city's Democratic mayor walked a political tightrope, referring to the takeover as an “authoritarian push” at one point and later framing the infusion of officers as boost to public safety, though one with few specific barometers for success. The Republican president has said crime in the city was at emergency levels that only such federal intervention could fix — even as District of Columbia leaders pointed to statistics showing violent crime at a 30-year low after a sharp rise two years ago. A “significantly higher” presence of guard members was expected Wednesday night, and federal agents will be out during the day as well as at night, according to the White House. Hundreds of federal law enforcement and city police officers who patrolled the streets Tuesday night made 43 arrests, compared with about two dozen the night before. Agents from various agencies including Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Park Police, and FBI, question a couple who had been parked outside a legal parking zone while eating McDonald's takeout, Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025, in northwest Washington near Kennedy St. NW. Two blocks away, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers gathered in a parking lot before driving off on patrol. In other parts of the city, including those with popular nightlife hot spots, federal patrols were harder to find. At the National Mall, there was little law enforcement activity aside from Park Police cruisers pulling over a taxi driver near the Washington Monument. Unlike in other U.S. states and cities, the law gives Trump the power to take over Washington's police for up to 30 days. Extending his power over the city for longer would require approval from Congress, and that could be tough in the face of Democratic resistance. Trump suggested Wednesday that he could seek a longer period of control or decide to call on Congress to exercise authority over city laws his administration sees as lax on crime. I don't want to call a national emergency. There have now been more than 100 arrests since Trump began beefing up the federal law enforcement presence in Washington last week, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. “President Trump is delivering on his campaign promise to clean up this city and restore American Greatness to our cherished capital,” she said. The president has full command of the National Guard, but as of Tuesday evening, guard members had yet to be assigned a specific mission, according to an official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ms. Jay, of Washington, who lost her job and is living what she calls her “Girl Scout life” while saving money by urban camping and looking for work while homeless, packs up her tent and belongings in a small park by Georgetown, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington, after being warned by an aid organization that tents are being removed. The push also includes clearing out encampments for people who are homeless, Trump has said. U.S. Park Police have removed dozens of tents since March, and plan to take out two more this week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said. People are offered the chance to go to shelters and get addiction treatment, if needed, but those who refuse could be fined or jailed, she said. City officials said they are making more shelter space available and increasing their outreach. Police Chief Pamela Smith said during an interview with the local Fox affiliate that the city's Metro Police Department has been down nearly 800 officers. Mayor Muriel Bowser said city officials did not get any specific goals for the surge during a meeting with Trump's attorney general, Pam Bondi, and other top federal law enforcement officials Tuesday. But, she said, “I think they regard it as a success to have more presence and take more guns off the street, and we do too.” She had previously called Trump's moves “unsettling and unprecedented” while pointing out he was within a president's legal rights regarding the district, which is the seat of American government but is not a state. For some residents, the increased presence of law enforcement and National Guard troops is nerve-racking. “I've seen them right here at the subway ... they had my street where I live at blocked off yesterday, actually,” Washington native Sheina Taylor said. “It's more fearful now because even though you're a law-abiding citizen, here in D.C., you don't know, especially because I'm African American.” Vehicles with law enforcement agents from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as well as Metropolitan Police drive along Kennedy Street NW, in the early morning of Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Petworth neighborhood of Washington.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump waves after greeting troops at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for a refueling stop en route to Japan, May 24, 2019, in Anchorage. WASHINGTON (AP) — In an ironic twist, President Donald Trump is set to discuss the war in Ukraine with Russian leader Vladimir Putin at a military base in Alaska that was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the height of Cold War and still plays a role today. The base created by merging Elmendorf Air Force Base and Army Fort Richardson in 2010 has played a key strategic role in monitoring and deterring the Soviet Union during much of the Cold War. Throughout its long history, the base hosted large numbers of aircraft and oversaw operations of a variety of early warning radar sites that were aimed at detecting Soviet military activity and any possible nuclear launches. (Vyacheslav Prokofyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Planes from the base also still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace. The leaders' meeting at an American military base allows them to avoid any protests and provides an important level of security, said Benjamin Jensen, senior fellow for defense and security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. “For President Trump, it's a great way for him to show American military strength while also isolating the ability of the public or others to intervene with what he probably hopes is a productive dialogue,” Jensen said. The irony of Putin visiting an American military base that long has — and still does — aimed to counter Russian threats comes as Trump works to reach a ceasefire deal in a war that he promised during the 2024 campaign to end quickly. Officials from Ukraine and Europe fear that the one-on-one meeting they will not take part in could lead to an outcome that favors Russian goals. French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump was “very clear” that the United States wants to achieve a ceasefire at the summit. Macron spoke after a virtual meeting between Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders. President Donald Trump greets troops after landing at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for a refueling stop en route to Japan for a four-day state visit, May 24, 2019, in Anchorage. “There's a very good chance that we're going to have a second meeting, which will be more productive than the first, because the first is I'm going to find out where we are and what we're doing,” Trump told reporters Wednesday.

President Donald Trump said he may declare a national emergency in Washington, D.C. if Congress doesn't renew his control over the city's police department. For decades, Washington, D.C. has been synonymous with crime, murder, and more recently vagrancy, but this week, President Donald Trump is taking a page from an ancient political playbook and looking to finally clean up our nation's capital. "Salus Populi Suprema Lex Est," wrote Marcus Tullius Cicero over 2,000 years ago. Trump wants Americans to feel just as safe as they live in or visit the seat of our great democracy. Democrats' immediate reaction to Trump's common-sense plan to fight crime in D.C. by surging federal resources and approaches was to play deaf, dumb and blind to the plight of residents, citing statistics that show a recent drop in an already sky-high crime rate. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., perhaps from his Whites only beach club, took to X to claim that this use of the Home Rule act was only triggered by an assault on a DOGE team member. He conveniently left out the two Israeli embassy staff workers recently murdered in cold blood, the congressional aide killed by mistake in a drive-by, and the rise of 15-year-old carjackers. Meanwhile, Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., taking time off from his TikTok movie productions, posted several examples of crime in D.C. this week with the insane comment, "Trump owns it." One of these crimes, a murder, took place on Monday, just hours after Trump's anti-crime announcement. Setting aside the congressman's heartless glee in snarking at the president over the murder of an innocent, his ridiculous attack on Trump at least admits that, yes, crime is a big problem in Washington, D.C., one that will finally be tackled. This is yet another example of Trump's incendiary common sense, by which he does something outlandish, like taking over the D.C. police department, to outrage from opponents who a day later have to admit, OK, yeah, crime is bad. Public safety is a gut issue, and it is also the foundation of all other blessings of good government. You can't show them statistics and pretend everything is fine. Opponents of crime prevention display graphs that say the crime rate is down 30 percent this year, but from an already staggeringly high level that has been ignored for years. This is like a guy who loses his entire year's salary playing blackjack. The obvious model for Trump's anti-crime action in D.C. is the success of Rudy Giuliani in the 1990s in New York City, who slashed violent crime with almost impossible speed. He accomplished this by embracing new police tactics like Compstat crime computing, stop and frisk, and broken windows policing that focuses on smaller quality of life crimes. And the benefits of this miraculous turnaround were not limited to Gotham. Indeed, other cities across America used these innovations to lower crime nationwide. Trump and his administration have the chance to do the same thing with their D.C. efforts, by actually punishing juvenile crime, by seeking to end cashless bail, and by clearing out drug users and vagrants from D.C. parks, national trends could be set. One Democrat who has taken the high road, more or less, amid this takeover by Trump is D.C.'s Mayor Muriel Bowser, who knows exactly how bad crime in D.C. is, having put in place a juvenile curfew just this week, and she has shown an open mind to the endeavor. You can't show them statistics and pretend everything is fine. Donald Trump envisages a gleaming capital city where even at 2 am one can walk freely, admiring the moon atop the Washington monument in the big skies of D.C., and not just in D.C., but in all American cities. So, let the Democrats hoot and holler a little more if they must. Most Americans are hopeful about this move by the president. Salus Populi Suprema Lex Est, the primacy of safety is as true today as when it was coined in the days before Christ, and whether he succeeds or fails, Donald Trump is going to try to provide that safety. It should be an effort we can all get behind and support. David Marcus is a columnist living in West Virginia and the author of "Charade: The COVID Lies That Crushed A Nation."

Adversaries' fear of the U.S. military is what makes tough negotiations like the one President Donald Trump is scheduled to have with Russian President Vladimir Putin possible, Vice President JD Vance told U.S. troops stationed in England on Wednesday. Vance's comments come as he's spent the past several days meeting with multiple European leaders in preparation for Trump's meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, with Putin in an attempt to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. "You guys make that possible," Vance, a former Marine, told U.S. troops stationed at Royal Air Force Base Fairford. "You guys are the reason why we can go into a negotiation with strength. You guys are the reason why we have leverage in these conversations with world leaders. Because they know that if we cut a deal, it is backed up by the finest fighting force anywhere in the world. And that is what makes your job so important." Vice President JD Vance shakes hands with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy during a meeting at Chevening House Aug. 8, 2025, in Sevenoaks, England. "The fact that people are impressed by you, the fact that so many people are frankly afraid of you is why we're able to do what we do as an administration," Vance said. Royal Air Force Base Fairford is home to the U.S. Air Force's 501st Combat Support Wing and the 99th Expeditionary Reconnaissance Squadron. It is also paramount for U.S. Air Force operations and serves as Air Force Global Strike Command's preferred bomber forward operating base in Europe. The Air Force routinely sends bomber aircraft to the military base as part of Bomber Task Force Europe 25-2 to train with NATO allies. For example, multiple Air Force B-52H Stratofortress bombers from Fairford participated in an exercise with Germany and Romania over NATO's eastern flank in March 2022 — just after Putin launched his invasion into Ukraine. Vance told troops that he had just wrapped up a call with approximately 30 European leaders, coming on the heels of various meetings with other European allies about Ukraine talks in recent days. A Saturday meeting with representatives of Ukraine and other European allies led to "significant progress" on ending the conflict in Ukraine, a U.S. official told Fox News Digital. More details on the discussions were not available. "What we said to Europeans is simply, ‘First of all, this is in your neck of the woods. You guys have got to step up and take a bigger role in this thing, and if you care so much about this conflict, you should be willing to play a more direct and a more substantial way in funding this war yourself,'" Vance told Fox News Sunday. Trump told reporters Monday that he'd be able to tell almost instantly if Putin is serious about negotiating a deal or not, and that he'd keep European leaders like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the loop after the meeting. "If it's a fair deal, I will reveal it to the European Union leaders and the NATO leaders and also to President Zelenskyy," Trump said. "I may say, ‘Lots of luck, keep fighting,' or I may say we can make a deal." President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he'd be able to tell almost instantly if Putin is serious about negotiating a deal or not.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The driver was clocked going 27 kilometers per hour (17 mph) over the speed limit on a street in the Swiss city of Lausanne, and now he's facing up to 90,000 Swiss francs (over $110,000) in fines as a result. Because the speedster, a repeat offender, is one of Switzerland's wealthiest people, and the Vaud canton, or region, serves up fines based on factors like income, fortune or general family financial situation. Germany, France, Austria and the Nordic countries all issue punishments based on a person's wealth. The recent fine isn't even a record in Switzerland. In 2010, a millionaire Ferrari driver got a ticket equal to about $290,000 for speeding in the eastern canton of St. Gallen. Back then, the Swiss safety group Road Cross said rich drivers had been lightly punished until voters approved a penal law overhaul three years earlier that let judges hand down fines based on personal income and wealth for misdemeanors like speeding and drunk driving. Under today's rules, an indigent person might spend a night in jail instead of a fine, while the wealthiest in the rich Alpine country could be on the hook for tens of thousands. A court in the Swiss canton of Vaud recently ruled that the tycoon must pay 10,000 Swiss francs ($12,300) up front and could be forced to pay the rest – 80,000 more – if he's caught for a similar roadway infraction over the next three years. Emma Watson banned from driving in the UK for six months Switzerland's “24 Heures” newspaper first reported the case and said the man, who was not identified, was a French citizen listed by Swiss economic weekly Bilan among the 300 richest people in Switzerland – with a fortune in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The daily reported that an automated police radar photographed the offender driving at 77 kilometers per hour (48 mph) in a 50 kph (31 mph) zone on a Lausanne street. Bride caught in speeding car late to her own wedding The newspaper reported that he had already been caught for a similar speeding infraction eight years ago, and also paid 10,000 Swiss francs in penalty and faced another 60,000 if another infraction had taken place within the following two years. In Switzerland, penalties for speeding can even catch up with the cops: One officer was fined for racing at nearly twice the speed limit through Geneva streets back in 2016 while chasing thieves who had blown up a bank teller machine.</p>

North America's herds will likely be hit the hardest. It's bad enough that climate change is ruining the dream of a white Christmas for many people, as warming makes snow in some regions less likely. Reindeer aren't just creatures of Christmas myth; they're real animals — a kind of deer that live in the Arctic, from northern Europe and Russia to North America, where they're commonly known as caribou. These animals are remarkably adapted to cold weather, sporting thick fur, a snout that warms the air they take in, and uniquely structured hooves that help them shovel snow to find food, such as lichen. These adaptations are, however, no match for modern climate change. Rising temperatures can affect reindeer health directly — causing the animals to overheat and get sick — and indirectly by limiting their supply of food. Now, it's clear those declines will likely continue. Those declines will be far more severe in North America, where they could exceed 80 percent, according to the study's models, which reconstructed 21,000 years of reindeer population data using fossil records, DNA, and other data sources. That's because North America is expected to lose more habitat that can support reindeer to warming than elsewhere, said Damien Fordham, a study author and researcher at the University of Adelaide. Even under a more modest emissions scenario — in which countries cut back what they spew into the atmosphere — the study projects steep population declines. You can see these results in the chart below, which shows projected declines based on a high and moderate emissions scenario, respectively. “These results are absolutely concerning,” said Jennifer Watts — Arctic program director at the Woodwell Climate Research Center, a nonprofit research organization — who was not involved in the new study. “Given how quickly and severely the Arctic is warming at present, the results from this study are not overly surprising, and should serve as yet another wake-up call for humans to curtail anthropogenic drivers of climate warming.” The study offers yet another example of how climate change is threatening biodiversity and how those threats in turn affect humans. Reindeer are not only a critical food source for some Arctic Indigenous communities — like Alaskan Natives and the Inuit people of North America — but also a cornerstone of their culture, similar to salmon or wolves for some tribal nations in other parts of the US. If major polluting nations, like the US, China, and India don't curtail their emissions, it could further endanger the food sovereignty of those communities. Beyond their direct impact on human well-being, reindeer also shape the tundra ecosystems — quite literally making them what they are — by limiting the growth of trees and shrubs, spreading seeds, and fertilizing the soil. It probably has nothing to do with saving birds. Inside the years-long quest to catch a sea star killer. These (literal) thirst traps are helping wild animals beat the heat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BALTIMORE (AP) — A judge on Wednesday questioned why it was necessary for the Trump administration to sue Maryland's entire federal bench over an order that paused the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen didn't issue a ruling following a hearing in federal court in Baltimore, but he expressed skepticism about the administration's extraordinary legal maneuver, which attorneys for the Maryland judges called completely unprecedented. Cullen serves in the Western District of Virginia, but he was tapped to oversee the Baltimore case because all of Maryland's 15 federal judges are named as defendants, a highly unusual circumstance that reflects the Republican administration's aggressive response to courts that slow or stop its policies. At issue in the lawsuit is an order signed by Chief Maryland District Judge George L. Russell III that prevents the administration from immediately deporting any immigrants seeking review of their detention in a Maryland federal court. The order blocks their removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after their habeas corpus petition is filed. “The executive branch seeks to bring suit in the name of the United States against a co-equal branch of government,” said Paul Clement, a prominent conservative lawyer who served as Republican President George W. Bush's solicitor general. “There really is no precursor for this suit” Clement listed several other avenues the administration could have taken to challenge the order, such as filing an appeal in an individual habeas case. Cullen also asked the government's lawyers whether they had considered that alternative, which he said could have been more expeditious than suing all the judges. He also questioned what would happen if the administration accelerated its current approach and sued a federal appellate bench, or even the Supreme Court. “I think you probably picked up on the fact that I have some skepticism,” Cullen told Justice Department attorney Elizabeth Themins Hedges when she stood to present the Trump administration's case. She said the government is simply seeking relief from a legal roadblock preventing effective immigration enforcement. Cullen, who was nominated to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, said he would issue a ruling by Labor Day on whether to dismiss the lawsuit. The automatic pause in deportation proceedings sought to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government “fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense,” according to the order. Russell also said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after hours that “resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.” Habeas petitions allow people to challenge their detention by the government. The administration accused Maryland judges of prioritizing a regular schedule, saying in court documents that “a sense of frustration and a desire for greater convenience do not give Defendants license to flout the law.” Among the judges named in the lawsuit is Paula Xinis, who found the administration illegally deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador in March — a case that quickly became a flashpoint in Trump's immigration crackdown. Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran megaprison, where he claims to have been beaten and tortured. Xinis recently prohibited the administration from taking Abrego Garcia into immediate immigration custody if he's released from jail pending trial.</p>

Ms. Jay, of Washington, who lost her job and is living what she calls her “Girl Scout life” while saving money by urban camping and looking for work while homeless, packs up her tent and belongings in a small park by Georgetown, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington, after being warned by an aid organization that tents are being removed. Caroline McIntyre, left, who is homeless, carries her belongings past the Kennedy Center, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in northwest Washington, as President Donald Trump makes an appearance there. Stephanie W., 28, who is homeless, rests on a foam mattress as Andrew S., 61, walks to find somewhere else to be after being told by a Department of Homeland Security agent to leave where he was resting outside along President Donald Trump's route to the Kennedy Center, that “If the President sees you, he doesn't want you here. I didn't really take it serious until today,” says Andrew S., Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025, in Washington near the Kennedy Center. With his exact plans unclear, there is concern among advocates and others who say there are better ways to address the issue of homelessness than clearing encampments, as the Republican administration has pledged to do. Washington's status as a congressionally established federal district gives Trump the opportunity to push his tough-on-crime agenda, though he has not proposed solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime. It is difficult to obtain accurate counts of homeless populations. On one day at the end of each January, municipal agencies across the United States perform what is called a “point-in-time” count aimed at capturing the total number of people in emergency shelters, transitional housing or without any housing. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” Asked during a media briefing at the White House on Tuesday where homeless people would be relocated, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said local police and federal agencies would “enforce the laws that are already on the books,” which, she said, “have been completely ignored.” As of Tuesday, Leavitt said only two homeless encampments remained in district parks maintained by the National Park Service and would be removed this week. Kevin Donahue, the city administrator, said outreach workers were visiting homeless encampments and that the city has a building available that could house as many as 200 people, if needed. Donahue made the comments during a conversation with community advocates and Bowser. Bowser said that when Trump sees homeless encampments in the city it “triggers something in him that has him believing our very beautiful city is dirty, which it is not.” Jeraod Tyre, who has lived in the city for 15 years, said “crime has been slowing down lately” and argued that federal troops would only escalate tensions because they do not have “relationships with the people in the community” like local police do. Sheiena Taylor, 36, said she is more fearful as a result of the presence of federal forces in the city where she was born and raised. “Being homeless isn't a crime,” she said, emphasizing the need for solutions to the root causes of homelessness or crime rather than policing. In several spots across the city, AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up tents and belongings from parks and other public spaces before more formal removal measures. Some expressed fear and anxiety about what might be coming. It's not exactly clear what agents specifically will be tasked with moving homeless people to areas outside the city. There also hasn't been detailed information about how the people will be housed or provided for in new locations.

Jay Black, a witness who captured footage of the viral Cincinnati brawl that left six injured, tells Fox News Digital what he saw as the fight broke out last week in Ohio. The Cincinnati police union is firing back as local leaders are calling for the prosecution of several White individuals involved in the viral downtown assault that led to six people being injured in late-July. The city's Fraternal Order of Police released a statement defending the department's investigation of the violent beatdown, while condemning city leaders' demands that additional arrests be made. "Cincinnati Police investigators have worked tirelessly to gather all of the facts, meet with prosecutors and sign appropriate charges to ensure those involved will be brought to justice," Ken Kober, president of Queen City Lodge #69, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "Efforts have been made by politicians to influence the outcome of the investigation for their own gain. There's no place for political games in law enforcement." Top row, rom left to right, Dominique Kittle, DeKyra Vernon, Patrick Rosemond, Jermaine Matthews, and bottom row, from left to right, Aisha Devaughn, Gregory Wright and Montianez Merriweather are facing various charges for their alleged roles in the viral beatdown in Cincinnati, on July 26, 2025. "The method by which this situation has been handled raises serious questions as to whether there is bias involved in this investigation. It also brings into question the lack of integrity and whether there is something else to hide." The Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office declined Fox News Digital's request for comment. The comments are in response to a July 26 beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets that quickly went viral, sparking national outrage and putting pressure on Cincinnati's leadership to address safety concerns. A separate video obtained by Fox News Digital revealed another angle of the moments before the fight, in which a White man can be heard repeatedly using a racial slur toward the group before the physical altercation began. The viral incident has sparked racial tensions within the city as all seven arrested individuals are African American. Last week, a grand jury indicted Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, on three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital. If convicted, they would each face the possibility of up to 29 years in prison. A seventh individual, 32-year-old Gregory Wright, was arrested Monday afternoon and is facing charges of alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery, according to the Hamilton County Jail. The corner of Fourth and Elm Street outside LoVe, a local nightclub, where the beating took place, as seen on July 28, 2025, in Cincinnati. "It's a powder keg, it's a powder keg," Carl Lewis, the attorney for Wright, said during his client's arraignment on Monday, according to WKRC 12. "If, in fact, you start out with the narrative that they're 'victims' just based upon what you've seen in a video, that's a problem," Lewis said. Lewis did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. WATCH: Viral Cincinnati attack victim speaks out amid recovery from violent beating The potentially explosive situation forced Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Tyrone Yates to request additional security during Wright's arraignment, WKRC 12 reported. Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Kearney also reportedly weighed in on the criticism. "We should push for justice and not turn against each other." Kearney did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. You can follow her at @juliabonavita13 on all platforms and send story tips to julia.bonavita@fox.com.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Tuesday to restore about a third of research grants to the University of California, Los Angeles by next week. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled the federal government's funding cuts late last month violated her June preliminary injunction that ordered the return of federal funding to UCLA. The government argued it treated the funding cuts as “suspensions,” allowing universities such as Harvard University and Columbia University to take “corrective actions” or enter settlement agreements. “Though there may be situations where a ‘termination' and ‘suspension' are not the same thing, there is no principled difference between a ‘termination' and the immediate, indefinite, and ‘final' ‘suspension' of funding in this context,” the San Francisco-based judge wrote. Harvard is reportedly nearing a $500 million settlement with the Trump administration to begin restoring the school's $2.2 billion in funding that was frozen over antisemitism allegations on campus. The deal would come after Columbia reached a similar settlement, totaling $221 million, to resolve a number of investigations into violations of federal antidiscrimination laws, particularly those related to antisemitism. The Trump administration is actively pursuing a $1 billion settlement with UCLA, substantially more than Columbia's. UCLA has yet to make a decision on this development. “This administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the First Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Tuesday. “UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples I will forward to Gavin Newsom's press office if he hasn't seen them himself.” The Trump administration is ordered to comply with Lin's order regarding UCLA by Aug. 19. Otherwise, it will have to explain why the funding was not restored. Washington Examiner is proudly powered by WordPress</p>

A permit to climb the world's tallest mountain costs an eye-popping $15,000 — and that's before you add in the price of airfare, gear and a guide. But Nepal, which has long sought to diversify its tourism offerings beyond showpiece Mount Everest, has come up with a new plan to attract travelers to less expensive, less visited regions of the country. The government announced it's opening up 97 peaks in Karnali and Sudurpaschim, two states in far western Nepal, to international climbers for free. “There are so many mountains (in Nepal),” Himal Gautam, a director in the Nepal Tourism Department, told CNN. “Until now the government of Nepal has opened 462 mountains for commercial expedition. Gautam added that due to the region's remoteness and poverty, “those mountains have not been marketed properly.” Karnali and Sudurpaschim border the Indian state of Uttarakhand on one side and China's Tibet region on the other. Gautam said that permits to climb these Himalayan peaks will be free for the next two climbing seasons. “The government of Nepal wants to disseminate to the global mountaineering community that so many alluring and worth-climbing mountains are located in those two provinces. Getting travelers to these areas isn't easy. Both require three-hour flights from the capital. Mount Everest: Nepal to remove trash and dead bodies from world's tallest mountain The country welcomed 1.15 million international tourists in 2024, and the tourism industry employs more than one million Nepalis. Overcrowding at the world's tallest mountain has caused increasing problems in recent decades. As a result, Nepal — which is home to eight of the world's 14 highest peaks — has made efforts to crack down on the number of unprepared climbers on Everest while redirecting tourists to other parts of the country. And now, would-be Everest climbers must show proof that they have previously scaled at least one 7,000-meter-plus mountain in Nepal. EDITOR'S NOTE:  CNN's Esha Mitra contributed reporting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said Wednesday that his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu has “lost the plot” and that Israel's planned occupation of Gaza City is “utterly unacceptable.” Luxon's comments come as his conservative coalition government weighs whether to join other members of the Five-Eyes security alliance, Australia, Britain and Canada, in moving to recognize a Palestinian state; and as international condemnation and anger builds over Israel's recent decision to expand its war to take control of Gaza City, the throttling of aid and mass starvation in the enclave. And I think what we are seeing overnight with the attack on Gaza City is utterly, utterly unacceptable,” Luxon said, in some of his strongest comments against Israel's actions in Gaza to date. Netanhayu's office has not yet responded to Luxon's comment. Israel has continued its intense aerial attacks on Gaza this week and Netanyahu's planned military takeover of Gaza City, expected to force up to a million people to leave the city, has been widely condemned. Here are the countries that have recognized a Palestinian state Foreign ministers from dozens of countries on Tuesday jointly said that suffering has reached “unimaginable levels” and “famine is unfolding before our eyes” as they demand that Israel allow more aid into Gaza and permit humanitarian organizations to operate there. Luxon is not the only western leader to openly criticize Israel's Prime Minister in recent days. On Tuesday, Australia's leader Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to Netanyahu but found him to be “in denial” about the human cost of the war in Gaza. “He (Netanyahu) again reiterated to me what he has said publicly as well, which is to be in denial about the consequences that are occurring for innocent people,” Albanese told Australia's public broadcaster ABC. French President Emmanuel Macron has also said France will recognize a Palestinian state in an announcement to the United Nations General Assembly in September. Washington has found itself increasingly at odds with key western allies over Israel and how the war in Gaza is being conducted. Both Israel and the US have condemned moves to recognize a Palestinian state. Luxon announced Monday that New Zealand would consider its position on recognizing a Palestinian state over the next month, prompting fierce criticism at home for what is considered by some to be a lack of action on Israel. Former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, who went on to lead the United Nation's Development Program after exiting domestic politics, lambasted Luxon's coalition government on Tuesday for not moving quickly enough. “We now really seem to stand for nothing except you know, somehow wanting to save our own skin in a tariff war,” she told New Zealand's public broadcaster RNZ on Tuesday. “I think it's really quite a humiliating position for New Zealand to be in.” On Wednesday, Green Party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick was kicked out of Parliament for refusing to apologize for comments she made suggesting coalition lawmakers grow a spine and support a bill to sanction Israel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ron DeSantis (R-FL) accused former President Barack Obama and former Attorney General Eric Holder of “brutally” gerrymandering the country in the most recent U.S. census. The topic of redistricting has been at the national forefront since Texas unveiled an aggressive plan to strip the Democrats of five congressional seats, threatening a nationwide gerrymandering arms race. In an appearance on Fox News's Hannity, DeSantis blamed the state of affairs on the Obama administration, alleging wrongdoing in its alleged influence on the 2020 census. “Well, Obama and Holder gerrymandered brutally across the country in this decade's census. They actually even got into Florida, and I had to veto the legislature's map, and I ended up proposing one which was a much fairer map and much better,” he said. DeSantis then turned his ire toward the government of California. And so their map now is gerrymandered, and Gavin wants to do it even more,” he said. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has threatened to retaliate against Texas with an aggressive redistricting plan to rid the Golden State of many Republican seats if the plan goes through. We're responding to this action, and this is how we choose to respond.” Washington Examiner is proudly powered by WordPress</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Director Kash Patel said the bureau has made 10 arrests as part of President Donald Trump's effort to crack down on crime in the capital. “Federal partners joined local police and arrested 23 in total. On the first big push of FBI supporting @POTUS @realDonaldTrump initiative to make DC safe again, FBI reported 10 arrests with partners. The FBI was one of several agencies assisting Trump's crackdown. White House officials said Trump will mobilize roughly 800 National Guard troops to assist the MPD with logistics, transportation, and guarding federal and law enforcement facilities. “This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,” Trump told reporters in the White House press briefing room. I'm officially invoking Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act — you know what that is — and placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control.” He added that the National Guard troops would be “allowed to do their job properly.” Defenders have accused city officials of manipulating the numbers. A Washington police commander was suspended last month after accusing MPD Chief Pamela Smith and other top department brass of falsely manipulating crime statistics. The first seven months of his second term went by without much focus on the issue until earlier this month, when a Department of Government Efficiency staffer was assailed by several juveniles.</p>
