                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the last few days, the heat has impacted several ATP and WTA stars, with a few forced to withdraw from the Cincinnati Open. 31 seed Magda Linette thanked fans for braving the heat Aug. 13 after defeating 2024 Cincinnati Open runner-up Jessica Pegula on Center Court in three sets. Fans hoping for another deep Cincinnati run by American Frances Tiafoe were denied Aug. 13 when the Maryland native retired during the second set of his fourth-round match on Center Court against No. Tiafoe seemed uncomfortable with the heat, frequently sporting a wet towel across his neck and face before retiring officially with a lower back injury that tightened up at the end of the first set. Felix Auger-Aliassime advanced to the Round of 16 via a walkover Aug. 11 when his opponent, Arthur Rinderknech of France, fell to the court due to the intense heat and eventually retired. One day later on Center Court, Francisco Comesana was preparing to serve against Reilly Opelka before taking a timeout near his courtside bench. Comesana eventually returned to the match and beat Opelka in three sets. 16 seed Jakub Mensik retired after just 43 minutes of his Round of 32 match against Luca Nardi Aug. 12. Alejandro Davidovich Fokina retired from his first-round match in the sweltering heat Aug. 9, though he later cited a need to preserve his energy ahead of the U.S. Open. "It's always hot here," said former Cincinnati Open champion Coco Gauff, who needed just 70 minutes to win her Center Court match Aug. 10 against Xinyu Wang. It was Gauff's former coach, Brad Gilbert, who won the Cincinnati Open in 1989, who spoke out on social media about the need for a heat rule on the ATP Tour. According to the WTA official rule book for 2025, there is a 10-minute heat-rule break between the second and third set. Daniil Medvedev plunged his head into a Gatorade cooler during the third set of his second-round match. Two years ago, Medvedev bluntly stated "one player is going to die" into an on-court camera during a steamy U.S. Open match. According to the Weather Channel, the temperature Aug. 13 in Mason is 85 degrees and it feels like 93 with 66% humidity. And that's not calculating how much hotter it is for players on the court. Studies show that the on-court temperature can be anywhere from 10 to 20 degrees hotter than off the court. Yeah, it's really tough to play with that conditions, to be honest," ATP star Carlos Alcaraz said in London. I always say, we have to get used to these conditions as soon as possible.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Karen Khachanov's big hitting has brought him to the brink of a Top 10 return this North American summer. Should Khachanov triumph, he will take another major step towards returning to the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since June 2023, something he told ATPTour.com has been one of his biggest goals. A seven-time tour-level titlist, Khachanov also broke down his favourite tennis rivalry in history and revealed how he pushed through adversity early in his career. What is your favourite ATP Tour tournament to play and why? I would say Monte-Carlo is one of my favourites. The only thing is sometimes we miss good weather there. What is your favourite tennis rivalry? Definitely Rafa [Nadal] and Roger [Federer]. Then Novak [Djokovic] stepped inside this duo and started to have crazy rivalries with both of them, but I think everything started from [Roger and Rafa]. I remember those matches in Rome and Madrid on clay, at Wimbledon and Roland Garros. With Novak I've played quite a few matches and managed to beat him one time in this match in Paris when he was No. We played this year a couple of times already and had good matches in the past. What is the biggest thing you've been chasing? My biggest goal is to try and be back in the Top 10, where I was able to break through two years ago before getting injured. Just right at the moment I got injured, and that affected me after I couldn't go out and compete for three and a half months. I still want to win a Masters 1000 one more time. But at the end of the day, if you put it in perspective, if you are in the Top 10 or even higher, you have definitely had good results in the bigger tournaments, so that is all connected. It All Adds Up: Every moment means everything: What is the greatest difficult or adversity you have overcome? I would say having a little bit of success early. Even though I'm mentally strong in a way, I felt like the following year at the beginning of the year was not what I was hoping or thinking it would be. That pushed me away a little bit and showed me that I needed to settle, to keep working towards my goals and that not everything would just come from the sky. Even after that, it took me a few more years to get really good results in Grand Slams and at the Olympics. What is the coolest thing you've been able to do off the court purely because you're a tennis player? The Tour forces us to travel, which I'm not complaining about. Tournaments in different cities and countries around the world. What is the greatest difficult or adversity you have overcome? I would say having a little bit of success early.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Listen, I saw this and immediately thought that there's just no possible way that this has ever happened before. Surely a professional athlete knows the rules defined in their sport, especially regarding one that lets you take toilet breaks if you need to. For some context, this fella Mats Rosenkranz, who is ranked 358th in the world, went and took a quick shower that he says was only 10 seconds in between sets. Generally players do this to throw off some momentum, actually need to go to the bathroom, or just need a second to recollect their thoughts that isn't in the eye of the actual court surrounded by fans. Well apparently showers are not allowed due to doping regulations, which my best guess is that they aren't following you into the shower so they can't see if you just start injecting some steroids into your butt or whatever would make you perform better? I know they send a supervisor with you and he probably heard the water turn on and was like "welp, you're disqualified buddy" which adds an even funnier twist to this. And not to mention the crazier part is that you're allowed to shower if you're at a best of 5 sets match at one of the Grand Slams but not one of these lowly tournaments that are still counting towards professional rank. I'm no meteorologist but the real feel air temperature in Hersonissos, Greece, where this match was played, was 102 degrees today. It's hard to argue that he was doing anything else other than getting a cool breeze of water splashed on his body, especially when you consider the fact that he already won the first set and was firmly in the driver's seat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is also giving priority to singles players, something that the US Open has been heavily criticised for. Despite attracting star-studded teams including Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, the US Open may pay for the Cincinnati Open's scheduling this year. Due to the Canadian Open taking place over 12 days, the finals took place on a Thursday, something Frances Tiafoe called ‘garbage'. As a result, the ATP and WTA singles finals will both take place on Monday, August 18, and are set to impact the US Open mixed doubles event. While there has been a lot of hype around the US Open mixed doubles event, it seems as though it will probably not be the spectacle they hoped it would be, something they will not thank the Cincinnati Open for. The final two wild cards will be announced at a later date. With less than a week to go until the US Open mixed doubles event begins, there are still 13 of the 26 announced participants remaining in Cincinnati. This includes three full mixed doubles teams, as well as defending US Open mixed doubles champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori. The only announced teams that have no players still competing in Cincinnati are Mirra Andreeva, who is nursing an injury, and Daniil Medvedev, Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic, as well as Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka. One thing the US Open may be thankful for is that Djokovic withdrew from the Cincinnati Open, as he now appears more likely to compete in their mixed doubles event. The US Open mixed doubles tournament will take place next week on August 19-20, and it remains to be seen who will actually be there at the start line.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Here's this week's Served podcast with special guest Hall of Famer Maria Sharapova. Note we will be doing a U.S. Open draw show from the grounds, a show from the Hall of Fame induction ceremony and at least one other live show during the tournament. • Congrats to Bill Simons and Inside Tennis (paper version) on a hell of a run. • Kalamazoo happened, Darwin Blanch is back to winning and Zoo Tennis, as the name suggests, is on the case. For a pair of 1000 point events pockmarked by the absence of a few big stars, Canada served up real drama and a couple of stellar finals, along with some new spin on storylines heading into the U.S. Open. The biggest question in my mind: is [Victoria] Mboko a contender to win in New York this year? We had a few Mboko questions last week—and one heartwarming story I'll share at another time—but it seemed foolish to answer at the semifinal round when it remained to be seen whether Mboko had a fine tournament or an absolutely smashing one. She then, of course, beat Elena Rybakina in a third-set tiebreak and Naomi Osaka in a wild final, and this marked an absolute claw-out-of-the-egg breakthrough. There is so much to like about Mboko. Her ample but not overwhelming power (she had fewer than 10 total winners in her win against Gauff). But above all—the great source of long-term optimism—there was her poise. Here was a wild card who projected such a sense of self-possession of I deserve to be here. There was no panic in pivotal moments. But there wasn't a sense of dumbfounded awe either. Then there was the fact that she was doing this all in front of a “home crowd,” having grown up one province over. But ask British players about this dynamic at Wimbledon or French players at Roland Garros, and they will tell you that in an individual sport, especially, playing at “home” brings as many pressures as advantages. Whether it was precocious poise or teenage blissful ignorance, Mboko handled it all so well. Having pulled out of Cincinnati (wisely, but another item in the bill of particulars against this summer schedule), Mboko now enters the U.S. Open as a seed, a player on a win streak and, above all, a burgeoning star. Naomi Osaka had long checked out by this point, but that get by Victoria Mboko was electrifying 🔥 pic.twitter.com/FV8xthtqqH Up until the finals of the WTA 1000 event in Montreal, Naomi Osaka was a consistent crowd favourite. Her story of rise, fall due to mental health and resurrection is a natural drama that people who don't even follow tennis can connect with. That all changes when your opponent in the finals is a Canadian with a great story of her own. So when the home, partisan crowd goes crazy for every point won by the local hero and somehow, Osaka seems to think that she is being vilified, my sympathy for her is diminished. But worse is that she actively tanked the last few games of the third set. Did she not remember how she felt when Serena's outburst at the U.S. Open made Naomi's moment feel compromised. Her lack of grace in the trophy presentation also betrayed a lack of sensitivity from someone who is such a proponent of kindness and positivity in a sport often not known for either of those attributes. Jon, in your typical even handedness, I suspect you'll chalk this up to disappointment at missing an opportunity after not winning a tournament in 4 1/2 years, or just having a brain cramp in an emotional moment. Maybe she's a victim of the high bar she has set for herself, but I thought the 18-year-old across the net from her might want to sit down with Naomi and remind her what class and sportsmanship are all about. Canada could not be prouder of Vicky. • The headline is Mboko and it's a pity that so much of the discussion has been Osaka's absence of grace under pressure. But here's a quick take: As a rule, we give grace to tennis players forced to self-assess after a disappointing day at the office. It's not something we ask of others: Warren, rough day with the PowerPoint. I know the presentation didn't go as you had hoped. A couple of loose points—trying to modify the word unique; mispronouncing nuclear—may have worked against you. Good week overall, but a bittersweet way to conclude. Want to say a few words? Failing to congratulate the player who just beat you—a day after learning she idolized you as a kid; knowing what the moment meant to her; knowing she had captivated the crowd; knowing from firsthand experience that a dour, older losing opponent can suck the joy from a younger winner—is a really bad unforced error. Props to Osaka for the damage control the next day, but said damage was, largely, already done. If someone were new to tennis with only thumbnails of the two finalists, and judged the players based on their professionalism, how many would have guessed Osaka to be the teenaged newbie and assumed Mboko was four-time major champion in her late 20s? Here's my larger issue with Osaka: does this not do a terrible disservice to her tennis? We all know that to be true, starting with other players. If I am on the other side of the net and know my opponent is capable of melting down in tight moments—losing her head, by her own admission, to the point she forgets to do something as basic as acknowledging the victorious player in front of her home crowd—this fires me with confidence. It's such a tell, and it sends the wrong message Osaka would want to convey to the field. The flip side: her tennis in Montreal was often sufficient to win a major. Which would add a fifth to her haul of four. She could lose drearily in Week 1. Once again I enjoy your mailbag offerings and comments. re: the mention of Olga Danilović and her $2.5 million career earnings. However, that is income/winnings and not her earnings, if we consider as typical business income. She has expenses as a professional tennis player not to mention (though I will) investment by parents or early benefactors on her development prior to becoming a professional. The winnings are a useful comparison relative to other players including Novak Djokovic, but to the general public even $2.5 millions sounds like a nice income for a relatively young person. Whereas it may be reasonably above the breakeven point, it is not retire in the lap of luxury money … necessarily. Related topic: What is the general range of outside sponsorship earnings for a player such as Olga? Generous racquet, shoes and wardrobe swag is nice, but … Thanks for hanging in there on your many platforms. Btw, I enjoy the Quick Served pods. And your thesis is correct: “income/winnings” only paints part of the financial picture. B) There is huge variance with regards to coaching expenses. Other times players pay out of pocket. I know of one instance when a coach actually paid a top player for the opportunity to coach her, reckoning that the publicity and branding was worth the outlay. D) In addition to the prize money, there are abundant additional income streams. The top players, of course, make multiples more in endorsements than they do in prize money. Assorted other players (young, ascendant, usually from countries with a high GNP) even outside the top 20—Leylah Fernandez is a name that vaults to mind—can make more in endorsements than prize money. E) There are “sneaky” endorsements as well. I was in Target the other day and, behold, Alycia Parks! A few active players have “once you're eliminated stay and work for us” broadcast deals. Often the player will make more from the media work than from first- or even second-round prize money G) Again, to your point: “Prize money” is an accessible metric, but doesn't tell the entire financial story. I have no data but if feelings still count … It feels like we don't see as many aces as we did a few years ago. Or maybe we're just less enthralled with counting them. Serves seem faster and more players (ATP and WTA) are hitting big bombs, but returners look like they're getting rackets on them more often. It's dirty but supports your thesis. “Total aces” is crass, taking into account neither the number of games played nor the quality of opponent. Tennis Abstract does a nice job refining, though we still wish the quality of opponent were given more weight. Twenty aces against a ponderous opponent is different from 20 aces against, say Alex de Minaur, to pick a name. It's not dramatic but there seems to be a drop-off in aces compared to, say, 20 or 30 years ago when Rusedskis and Krajiceks and even Beckers and Samprases roamed the tennis earth. First, I would caution that a drop in aces doesn't necessarily mean the serve is less critical. More rounded players means that even a guy like Ben Shelton can mix up kickers and cutters with pure fastballs? Also, as a tennis rule of thumb, the best servers have ranked among the worst returners. So as players like Ivo Karlović and John Isner have moved on, not only are their ace counts no longer tallied but they are not around to be the victim of aces. (If anyone with more bandwidth and quant skills than I wants to dive deeper here, I'd be happy to publish.) How is it that the Canadian Open runs through August 7, while the Cincinnati Open starts on August 5? At some point there has to be a “New Coke moment” when an adult in the room says, It was an experiment. Let's cut bait and go back to one-week Masters 1000 events that don't overlap. I know you're not a fan of the 12-day Masters1000 event—neither am I—but if there's anything crazier than that, it's a Masters 1000 event that ends on a Thursday. • These events are the equivalent of best-of-seven matches. I think it was Ted Robinson who said to McEnroe during a broadcast : John, do you favor the better server in the tiebreak? I favor the better player, John replies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz bounced back from a scare against Damir Dzumhur to comfortably beat his third-round opponent in Cincinnati. Alcaraz was simply too good when it mattered against Hamad Međedović, winning the contest 6-4 6-4. Alcaraz had struggled in his opening Cincinnati Open match, dropping the second set against Damir Dzumhur 2-6 before eventually winning the contest in three sets. Carlos Alcaraz's victory was not only a moment for the present; it transcended generations. Alcaraz's defeat of Međedović put the Spaniard in rarefied air alongside two greats of the game: Rafael Nadal and Pete Sampras. As per OptaScore, since the ATP Tour's inaugural season in 1990, Carlos Alcaraz has become the third-youngest player to achieve four consecutive 50-win seasons, older than only Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal. 50 – Since the ATP Tour's inaugural season in 1990, Carlos Alcaraz (22 years 94 days) has become the third-youngest player to achieve four consecutive 50-win seasons, older than only Pete Sampras and Rafael Nadal. Alcaraz achieved the feat while aged 22 years and 94 days. Alcaraz's feature in this conversation encapsulates his bottomless pool of talent and his remarkable maturity on and off the tennis court. Alcaraz faces a tough opponent in the Cincinnati Open round of 16: Luca Nardi. The 22-year-old Italian star has impressed so far this week, winning two rounds of qualifying before defeating Denis Shapovalov and Jakub Mensik on his way to the last 16. Alcaraz and Nardi have played each other once before on the ATP Tour. Alcaraz will need to be wary of the young Italian star, who has also beaten compatriot Flavio Cobolli in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emerging Australian talents Tristan Schoolkate and Talia Gibson have been awarded main draw wildcards into the 2025 US Open, recognising their breakout seasons and rising international profiles. Ranked No.173 when he competed at Australian Open 2025, Schoolkate's impressive rise into the top 100 in just over six months came a fraction too late for direct entry in New York. Now ranked No.97, Schoolkate has also reached three Challenger finals this season – claiming titles in Brisbane and Ilkley, UK – to showcase his consistency and growth on the professional circuit. “It's such an amazing experience to play in the main draws of the Grand Slams – it's what we as players work towards, week in, week out. I'm excited and ready for the challenge in New York.” Gibson, 21, has also enjoyed a breakthrough year, peaking at world No.107 last month. Her Northern Hemisphere summer campaign has included quarterfinal appearances at WTA 125 events in Ilkley, UK and Newport, US, either side of a maiden Wimbledon main-draw appearance – which she achieved by winning three rounds of qualifying, saving match point in the final round. Earlier this year, Gibson secured her first Grand Slam main draw win at the Australian Open, coming from a set down in a memorable debut at Melbourne Park. “This is an incredibly rewarding acknowledgment for all the hard work my team and I have been putting in and for the results I've had this year. Schoolkate and Gibson will join 12 other Australians – eight men and four women – in the US Open main draw, where the action kicks off on Sunday 24 August. A further seven men and 10 women will represent Australia in qualifying, commencing Monday 18 August.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frances Tiafoe seems to love this part of the tennis calendar. Tiafoe's 2025 campaign has been a mixed bag overall, but he had a similar output the last couple of years before peaking during the late summer. Tiafoe has turned into one of the most watchable players on the ATP Tour thanks to his aggressive style and athletic ability. He's got plenty of power, but the Maryland native also has a deft touch at the net and is a creative shot-maker. It shouldn't be a surprise that Tiafoe has figured out how to get his game working at this time of year, since he's from the Mid-Atlantic and will not be a stranger to the hot, humid conditions in the States in August. There is no doubt about the Dane's immense talent, but he tends to flail when things get a bit uncomfortable. Tiafoe witnessed this firsthand at this event last year, defeating the Dane in three sets in a memorable semifinal. This should be a dramatic match, and the player who is more likely to unravel in this environment is the favorite. Michael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry. He loves using game theory to help punters win bracket pools, find long shots, and learn how to beat the market in mainstream and niche sports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She could've selected the first of her seven Grand Slam singles titles at Wimbledon in 2000 or opted to memorialize her first of four Olympic gold medals at the Sydney Games that same year. Williams could've even took it back to the 1999 French Open, where she won the first of her 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her little sister Serena Williams in their iconic braids and colorful beads. It was the first year the women's and men's singles champions earned equal prize money at Wimbledon, a cause that Williams championed long before her win. "Wimbledon 2007 was a huge moment in my career — not just because I won, but because of what was happening off the court," Williams told USA TODAY Sports ahead of her Barbie's release on Aug. 15. To see that moment honored with a Barbie doll is incredibly special. I hope it inspires young girls to speak up, believe in themselves, and know they have the power to change the game too." Williams said seeing her own Barbie marked a "full-circle moment." It's about inspiring young girls they can dream big and break barriers too." Two years before she triumphantly hoisted Wimbledon's Rosewater Dish for the fourth time in 2007, Williams met with officials from Wimbledon and the French Open. Both tournaments announced equal prize money for all competitors, beginning in 2007. Williams went on to win her sixth major singles title at Wimbledon that year and was the first woman to win the same purse as male champion Roger Federer. "My advice to any woman, not just advocating for equal pay but also advocating for themselves, is this: always bet on yourself and keep pushing, no matter how tough it gets," Williams told USA TODAY Sports. When you use your voice, you create space for others to speak up too and that can create real change." Williams' Barbie is wearing a two-piece white set identical to what she wore to defeat France's Marion Bartoli, 6–4, 6–1, in the 2007 Wimbledon final. Her "Inspiring Women Series" doll also features Williams' accessories from the match, including her green gem necklace, dangly earrings, wristbands and visors, in addition to Reebok tennis shoes. (Williams signed a multi-million dollar deal with Reebok in 1995 at age 14 after walking away from Nike because she believed she could earn more, as depicted in the 2021 biopic, "King Richard.") Don't forget about her racket and tennis ball. "Venus chose that outfit herself actually, so she collaborated really closely with our talented Barbie design team," Krista Berger, senior vice president of Barbie and global head of dolls at Mattel, told USA TODAY Sports. "They (worked) closely throughout the entire process of designing the doll to ensure it accurately reflected her appearance and her personal style." Berger said Williams' involvement with creating her own Barbie "added that personal touch to capture her impact as an athlete and an advocate. The release of Williams' Barbie doll comes days ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open, where Williams is teaming up with fellow American Reilly Opelka in mixed doubles. "Coming back to D.C. reminded me how much I truly love this game," Williams said. "I've always stayed true to myself and played on my own terms. Williams, 45, earned a straight sets victory over World No. Williams fell short in the second round against Magdalena Frech and made a quick, first-round exit at the Cincinnati Open, but she nonetheless celebrated being able to play "healthier than ever." "Reconnecting with that feeling, along with the energy and support of the fans, was truly something special," Williams added.

Footage from a broadcast of the moment shows Raducanu, 22, facing off against Belarusian tennis player Aryna Sabalenka, when a baby lets out a cry in the stadium. The crowd responded with an emphatic yes, to which the 2021 U.S. Open Champ raised her tennis racket and smiled. French tennis player Arthur Rinderknech collapsed on Monday due to high temperatures on the courts, regularly exceeding 86º Fahrenheit, per BBC. The match ended with an eventual 7-6 (6), 4-6, 7-6 (7) loss for Raducanu, with the title and third-round prize money of $60,400 going to Sabalenka. Sabalenka, 27 will next face Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in the Round of 16 on Wednesday, Aug. 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Spaniard moved through hours before an evening rainstorms and lightning spoiled the night-time scenario, leaving men's and women's third seeds stranded in third round matches. It was a similar situation for American Jessica Pegula, fighting back against Pole Magda Linette who won the first set 7-6 (5), before last year's finalist claimed the second 6-3. Toronto champion Ben Shelton never got on court against Roberto Bautista Agut due to rainstorm conditions that forced officials to call it a night early. Second seed Alcaraz kept his exposure to a minimum in 32 Celsius conditions, taking an efficient 95 minutes to dispatch Serb Hamad Medjedovic 6-4, 6-4, for his 50th match win of the year. Alcaraz has been on a tear in 2025 as he chases Jannik Sinner in the ATP rankings, and now owns 13 straight victories at the Masters 1000 level. Five-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz, who is preparing for the approaching US Open start, added: "I was really happy to get the win in a very difficult match. "The season is very long and in at least half of your matches you don't feel that good (physically). "But you have to stay positive and play your best tennis on the day. Francisco Comesano and Reilly Opelka both felt the heat of their mid-day match, which was interrupted for 45 minutes by rain, as the Argentine limped to a 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-5 win while saving three match points. Comesano needed a medical time out midway through the second set, but came back out to continue what turned into a fight of nearly three hours against the American. Opelka called for the doctor just moments from his eventual loss, complaining of dizziness and high blood pressure after being broken for 5-6 in the final set. After a quick consultation at his chair, Opelka was back on court to weakly scoop a return into the net on his opponent's second match point. The 71st-ranked South American will face ninth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Australian Alexei Popyrin 6-7 (5), 7-6 (5), 7-5. Opelka, noted for his big serve, fired 27 aces but also committed nearly 60 unforced errors. The American, who won the 2023 Cincinnati title and followed up with a US Open crown, will face Italian Lucia Bronzetti, who took out Jelena Ostapenko 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Seventh seed Jasmine Paolini, last season's Roland Garros and Wimbledon finalist, defeated American Ashlyn Krueger 7-6, (2), 6-1 while German qualifier Ella Seidel continued her strong showing with a 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (6) defeat of McCartney Kessler. Two-time Grand Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova outlasted American Iva Jovic 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.</p>
