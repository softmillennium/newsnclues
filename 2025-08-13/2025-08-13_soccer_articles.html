                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Then, he suffered a foot problem that limited him to just two appearances for Wolfsburg last campaign. “It's hard to go through this again,” he wrote in a statement on Instagram. “Unfortunately, I had to undergo another operation on the same foot that put me out of action last season.” Paredes featured twice in April for Wolfsburg after missing eight months of action. He then  participated in two preseason friendlies ahead of the 2025–26 season, logging a total of 73 minutes this summer before once again experiencing pain in his foot. The Athletic report Paredes is aiming for a November return. The forward is optimistic he will be fully fit and recovered with enough time to play for both club and country ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. “I remain focused on my recovery and am determined to come back stronger,” Paredes wrote. “I'll be back soon, ready to give everything for my team!” Still, Paredes will miss months worth of action for Wolfsburg and at least four USMNT fixtures. The winger will miss valuable time to impress new manager Mauricio Pochettino. Paredes only has three senior international caps to his name, and those came in 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Weah, Christian Pulisic, and Mark Pulisic (Christian's father) all delivered searing takes on ex-US men's national team players who criticized the team during their recent run of bad form, with Weah deeming the pundits to be “evil.” Following that tournament, Pulisic kicked off a media firestorm when he announced that he would skip the 2025 Gold Cup, the team's last competitive tournament before next year's World Cup on home soil, due to fatigue after a second-straight 50-game season with Milan. Pulisic's decision elicited strong critiques from ex-US players like Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Charlie Davies, Jimmy Conrad, Herculez Gomez and others. “In my opinion (they) disrespected me in a lot of ways, and completely forgot about what I've done for this national team for 10 years,” Pulisic said in the widely promoted docuseries covering nearly every aspect of his still-ongoing career, including extensive time spent on his breakthrough with the US national team. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking shit,” he said. But Christian doesn't give a shit what anyone says.” Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Christian also repeated a retort he used earlier this year, in an appearance on CBS Sports' Call it What You Want podcast, which had been heavily critical of his decision to withdraw from the Gold Cup “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all pundits say ‘they didn't want it,' ‘they didn't have the heart,' ‘back in our day we would fight and we would die on the field,' he said, insisting again that national team results affect him deeply. The most scathing retort, though, came from winger Tim Weah. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either … Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys that speak negative on us.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic and Timothy Weah have now responded directly to the criticism from figures like Landon Donovan — doing so with a pointed, eight-word reality check that's impossible to ignore. What began as post-match analysis and punditry has escalated into a public back-and-forth across interviews, podcasts, and even Instagram posts. Following a demanding season at Milan — 57 matches in all competitions — Christian Pulisic requested to sit out the Gold Cup. The decision, mutually agreed upon with U.S. Soccer and the coaching staff, was made to allow him to recover physically and mentally in preparation for next year's World Cup. However, the choice didn't sit well with Landon Donovan. While on broadcast duty, Donovan stopped short of naming Pulisic but clearly aimed his remarks at him and other absent stars. Comparing them to Cristiano Ronaldo, the 43-year-old remarked that great players still “grind” and “represent their country” despite fatigue, adding: “It's pissing me off.” Pulisic himself later addressed the controversy during a CBS Sports podcast appearance. Inside the USMNT setup, teammates rallied behind Pulisic. Tyler Adams stated plainly that Pulisic didn't need to prove anything. Weston McKennie emphasized that player well-being comes first: avoiding unnecessary risk now means greater contributions later. Clint Dempsey, another national team legend, noted from experience the punishing toll of European soccer and long-haul travel, backing the decision to rest. Recent episodes of PULSIC see Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah discussing the criticism they received from some USMNT luminaries, suggesting that their feud is far from finished. A brief excerpt posted by CBS Sports Golazo on X (previously Twitter) has him stating: “I would say the most annoying thing and for me the biggest cop-out of all time is when, especially, you know all pundits want to say, ‘You know, they didn't want it. “I think those guys are chasing checks,” Marseille's latest arrival said, adding that such negativity from former heroes felt “really evil” considering they knew the pressures of being in the spotlight. Then came the eight-word reality check aimed squarely at the critics: “The guys before us didn't win anything either.” It was a blunt reminder that while the current squad is under intense scrutiny and higher expectations, past generations also fell short of major tournament glory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Pulisic, his father Mark and his U.S. teammate Tim Weah re-ignited the public spat between current and former U.S. men's national team players in an episode of the “Pulisic” docuseries released on Paramount+ Wednesday. Pulisic, in an interview filmed earlier this summer, called criticism of the team's effort and heart “the biggest cop-out of all time.” Weah, speaking about former players-turned-pundits, said: “I think those guys are chasing checks. And for me, I just feel like they're really evil. Mark Pulisic, Christian's dad, agreed: “These guys want clicks. The comments rekindle a war of words between generations that picked up steam following the USMNT's losses to Panama and Canada in March. Landon Donovan (now a podcaster and Fox Sports pundit) and Clint Dempsey (now a CBS Sports and Men In Blazers pundit), the top two goalscorers in program history, were among the vocal critics. “If you aren't going to show up and actually give a s!%* about playing for your national team, decline the invite. Weah, in an interview for the docuseries, said of the former players: “Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were the players that I looked up to. But quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either.” Weah added: “Christian himself has had a better career than every single one of the guys who speak negative on us.” Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah open up about the criticism from some U.S. Soccer legends in the latest episodes of PULSIC 📺👀 @paramountplus pic.twitter.com/zqy2TujRQj Mark Pulisic, who previously inflamed the friction with an Instagram post implicitly responding to criticism from Donovan, said of former players: “I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking s***. But Christian doesn't give a s*** about what anyone says.” The criticism of Pulisic crescendoed when he opted to skip this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. Donovan, in the studio for a Fox Sports broadcast of Portugal's UEFA Nations League win over Spain, said during Portugal's emotional celebrations: “I can't help but think about our guys on vacation, not wanting to play in the Gold Cup. Pulisic, in an interview the following week with CBS Sports' “Call It What You Want” podcast, defended his decision and addressed the criticism. Back in our day we would fight and die on that field.' I think we have had some really incredible moments. With several former USMNT stars now prominent in American soccer media, the clash between them and active players could be an ongoing source of noise between now and the 2026 World Cup. “I'm not a social-media guy, so I don't follow anything, but when people bring up some of the things that are being said and some of the stories that are being created, it feels weird, because it feels like not long ago that every single one of those people were on board with, like, the direction that the federation was going and how well the players were doing. My goal is to try to create an environment, especially within our team, where guys feel like they can go out, be themselves, be comfortable. His comments triggered former defender and Fox Sports pundit Alexi Lalas. Lalas, speaking on his podcast this week, said of Adams: “I thought that this was a strangely immature, and naive, and weak kind of take. Not that he's defending Christian Pulisic, because we're all going to do that, but the way he seemed to think that there should be no criticism and we should all be kumbaya.” But with European seasons commencing — Pulisic, who missed recent friendlies as a precaution, is preparing for AC Milan's first competitive match this weekend — and the USMNT set to reconvene early next month, it could heat up once again. Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan will be released in two weeks. Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a rocky year for the U.S. Men's National Team, with back-to-back losses at the CONCACAF Nations League Finals and controversial team omissions prior to a moderately successful Gold Cup run, creating a rift between the past and present generations. None have been more critical of the current stars than some of the USMNT's most high-profile former stars, including Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, Clint Dempsey, and Alexi Lalas. This was never more evident than when it came to recapping Mauricio Pochettino's side's dismal Nations League title defense, which saw them lose to Panama and Canada. Now, USMNT stars Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah have fired back in no uncertain terms, via the former's Paramount+ docuseries, Pulisic. “I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me the biggest cop-out of all time, is when, especially, all pundits want to say, ‘They didn't want it. Back in our day, we would fight and we would die on that field,'” AC Milan star Pulisic said. This was played prior to a clip from Donovan and Howard's Unfiltered Soccer podcast, during which the longtime LA Galaxy star commented, “When we were on the field, there were guys on the field all over the field, who if they didn't perform well, their club team probably lost. But there's not a lot of guys who fall into that [now].” As for Weah, who recently completed a move from Juventus to Olympique Marseille, he was unreserved in his criticism of such commentators. “I think those guys are chasing checks and for me I just feel like they're really evil honestly because they've been players and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed and those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day,” he said. The 25-year-old went on to note that while he respected the former players in question, adding many having been “players that I looked up to,” this didn't alter his stance. “Quite frankly, the guys before us didn't win anything either,” Weah commented. Arguably, no other USMNT player has faced as much criticism in recent months as Pulisic, not only for his performances at the Nations League, but especially for his decision to opt out of a summer call-up, citing a desire to rest after another busy season in Italy. Pulisic's decision to take a step back may have infuriated some, but as far as USMNT teammate and AFC Bournemouth star Tyler Adams is concerned, it could pay off down the line. “It's a topic that everyone wants to have an opinion on, of course, but what Christian did is what he had to do for himself,” he told The Athletic. Everyone knows who Christian is as a person, and how good of a player he is as well. But everyone needs time in certain moments of their career or life to just say: ‘Let me take a step back, focus on myself for a second and then move forward.

Chelsea will pay their players more than £10million in bonuses for winning the Club World Cup.

The west London club were crowned champions of FIFA's newly-expanded tournament in July, defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Their success in the tournament earned the club an estimated $114.6million (£84.4m).

Chelsea have subsequently allocated a $15.5m (£11.4m) fund to be distributed equally between the players who represented Enzo Maresca's side during the tournament.

The overall value of each payment tallies more than $500k before it's subjected to currency conversion costs from US dollars into UK pound sterling, alongside relevant employer costs, taxes and social security costs.

Chelsea took home more than $100m in prize money for their participation in the four-week tournament in the United States with runners-up PSG winning $106.9m and Real Madrid $82.5m.

The added income has helped fund another busy summer in the transfer market with Joao Pedro, Jamie Gittens, Jorrel Hato and Liam Delap among a number of new arrivals at Stamford Bridge.

Maresca's team kick off their 2025-26 Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace on Sunday.

As the 2026 FIFA World Cup draws closer, the conditions in Atlanta “seem ripe for the Trump administration to clash with the city on its homeless policy” following President Trump's “federal takeover” of the Washington, D.C., police force earlier this week, according to Matt Reynolds of the ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION. Atlanta city officials said that their goal was to “house people, not throw them in jail” when they unveiled plans to clear homeless camps downtown before the World Cup. That housing-first approach “appears at odds” with Trump, who on Monday ordered 800 National Guard troops to the capital while stating that he “wanted to crack down on violent crime and homelessness.” The president also “threatened to send federal forces to other cities.” Trump in July signed an executive order “calling homelessness a public safety crisis.” The order directed the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to “end support for housing-first models.” Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens has “taken a housing-first approach” to homelessness but also stated that “people who illegally camp on city streets and refuse to leave could be taken to a pre-arrest detention center and offered treatment or other services.” Atlanta-based homeless advocate Nolan English said, “Don't use the World Cup as a broom. Use that as a deadline to do the right thing” (ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION, 8/13).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two designers from different eras reflect on the changing look of soccer through logo design Lance Wyman is among America's greatest-ever graphic designers, and his fingerprints are all over any number of American cities. Wyman's style is instantly recognizable – simple, bold and clever. He dived into archives, visited archaeological sites and spoke to locals. In 1970, when the country hosted its first-ever World Cup, they went right back to Wyman's logotype, and Wyman himself created a handful of other designs for the tournament. It feels fair to say that the visual identity of that tournament may well be the most instantly-recognizable design work of any World Cup in history. I reached Wyman a couple of years ago, at his office in New York City. “I did see it, yes,” Wyman said back then. This … I'm just not so sure there's a lot you can do with it.” The logo felt phoned-in back then, as it does now. It's less a logo and more of a logo system, they explained, allowing them to adapt the image to different devices and even alter it to suit different host cities in the tournament's host countries. It's the same thing Wyman did expertly in 68, just worse. My view, of course, is purely subjective – as are most things related to art and design. But looking at the logo got me thinking more broadly about the direction of crests and design as a whole in American soccer. More recently, the crest for Denver Summit FC – the NWSL's latest expansion club, which will debut in 2026 – only intensified what I'd already been thinking: why do these things all look the same in recent years? His work spans the entirety of the men's and women's game, having handled some of MLS' most well-received crests, elegant designs for LAFC and NYC FC among them. In the NWSL, Wolff was most recently tapped to craft a new logo for the club now known as Boston Legacy (after that club rolled out maybe the most roundly criticized name and brand in American soccer history. His work dots the lower leagues as well, where several of his crests have felt like instant classics – Union Omaha, and even recent USL League 2 champions Vermont Green, a club Wolff helped co-found. “I think about the trajectory of American soccer in parallel to where I was in my education and my early career. So I think I somewhat intentionally positioned myself to be ready, willing and able to create football crests in the United States.” Wolff's works sometimes feels a little bit like Lyman's: uncluttered, bold, simple. Like Wyman did in ‘68, Wolff operates in a space where his work often ends up being representative of the community that commissioned it and he often incorporates elements of those places into his final design. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer That's easy enough to see in NYC FC's crest, which looks like an old subway token, or the crest that Wolff designed for the NWSL's Gotham FC, which prominently features the Statue of Liberty. Others feel a lot more esoteric, like the crest Wolff crafted for USL's One Knox FC. That one, which features a color palette inspired by a handful of Knoxville's local monuments, feels distinctly more generic, as does Denver's. It's an aesthetic summed up on a podcast I heard recently. In it, the host was raving about Denver's new crest, saying it would feel right at home on the side of a reusable metal water bottle. Wolff himself acknowledges the reality of design work as a whole. His job is done for the client, to meet the needs of their brief, not necessarily his own tastes or preferences. “My ideal vision is kind of irrelevant to these crests,” says Wolff. “I'm trying to answer a brief, some parameters that have been set by a club or by me and the club together. I don't really think about my own tastes in the crests as much as ‘is this answering the brief.” “[The process] has been pulled away from graphic designers - specialists - and pulled into this nebulous room of other people who make design decisions by committee,” said Ben Mahler, a former creative director at MLS club DC United. “Marketing directors, focus groups, analytics driven shit, it all ends up pushing things into safer territory. Wolff, and any other designer in this space, is also subject to the mercy of the audience, so to speak. Bos Nation is far from the only club to have course corrected after an initial misstep – when the Chicago Fire rolled out an absolutely atrocious rebrand in 2019, their fans were enraged. The Fire turned to Wolff to solve that problem, and he did so with a much cleaner, easier-to look at design. For his part, Wyman, who grew up in Kearny, New Jersey (an American soccer holy land in and of itself) told me he's never been asked to do a soccer crest. Outside that, Wyman's work has largely been done for companies and local municipalities. Looking at his designs, it's hard to imagine why some club out there wouldn't bring him into the fold. Wolff's work is often fantastic, but some variety might be nice, too. Maybe some club out there could take a chance on the person whose designs have been thrown on nearly every logo-related mood board in existence, over the years. “Every once in a while something will come along with sports, but for the most part, my work has been focused elsewhere,” Wyman said a couple of years back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April, soccer's FIFA unveiled its official host city posters for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup, set to take place in Mexico, the United States and Canada. The posters for the three Mexican host cities — Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey — were created by Mexican designer Mario Cortés, 30, also known by his artistic name, Cuemanche. Now available for sale, the posters have been well received by both football fans and international media. A look at the posters for all three host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterey. “I feel so proud knowing my posters had that kind of reception in an international media outlet,” Cortés said. Yet, being from Mexico City and naturally biased toward his hometown, one of Cortés's biggest challenges was illustrating each city equally. “I didn't want to make one city stand out more than the other, because all three cities are equally important,” he said. “It was essential to address them with the same level of respect and depth, as they all have so much to offer.” Cortés had previously visited Monterrey while collaborating with FIFA in the Juego de Leyendas project — a soccer event that brought together former international and Mexican soccer players in a friendly match in Monterrey last year, as part of the preparations for the 2026 World Cup — but had never been to Guadalajara. “So I said to myself, ‘Well, I'm going to approach the city I know and that represents me the most, which is Mexico City, and build a structure that would allow me to address the same narrative elements in each of the other cities.” All three posters tell a unified narrative story, using similar elements and graphics without being repetitive and without highlighting one city more than the other. “As Mexicans, we have a vast visual richness,” he said. I mean, just walking into a market, you find colors everywhere — piñatas, colorful fruits, vegetables. All that explosion of color was an element I was very interested in capturing, and that also gives personality to a poster,” he said. “Some might ask, ‘What does a mariachi have to do with football? Well, these elements precisely accompany and give personality to the passion of inhabiting a city and being a fan of their local team,” he said. For Cortés, these posters are a “welcome letter to the world” and a way to show Mexico's diverse and rich culture, which he says deeply inspired his creative process. “Our culture has an immense complexity that I also wanted to capture.” Among the many artistic influences that shaped Cortés' work were iconic Mexican artists like Juan O'Gorman and Jorge González Camarena, both part of Mexico's muralism period. “I would find myself walking in Mexico City's Juárez [neighborhood], for example, and I would look at the house structures and think, ‘Well, the poster is here, isn't it? “I would look at the Art Deco friezes and see how they would integrate a human figure, flowers or fruits in a very small square,” he said. Mexico's 1968 Olympics logo, which has had a lasting impact on graphic design and is probably one of the most iconic Olympic Games logos ever, also influenced Cortés' work. Designed by Mexican architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez and designer Lance Wyman, Cortés said it's impossible to escape the influence of such a logo. “It is basically embedded in the DNA of any Mexican designer,” Cortés jokes. For him, designing official World Cup posters is the opportunity of a lifetime. Something that will probably never be repeated in my life,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By keeping up with some of the world's top sides in what will be an action-packed European club season. In other countries, domestic league action is already underway. So what if the defending European champions lost decisively to Chelsea in last month's FIFA Club World Cup final? Luis Enrique's PSG is still the team to beat in 2025-26. Luis Enrique returns close to his entire squad from last season's long-awaited triumph, though keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma could leave this month. If he does, the Parisians already have Donnarumma's replacement in French international Lucas Chevalier, who arrived from Lille for $47 million. Despite the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, Liverpool has only gotten better this summer. Arne Slot's side has been the big winner of this transfer window, dropping north of $350 million on backup keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, defenders Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez, and forwards Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz. Baca was just seconds away from reaching the UEFA Champions League final last season under first-year manager Hansi Flick. This season, the Blaugrana are looking to go at least one step further. Robert Lewandowski, who turns 37 on Aug. 21, remains an elite striker. Chelsea already have an emerging superstar in winger Cole Palmer — this season he'll be supported by new recruits like strikers Liam Delap and João Pedro, Pedro's fellow Brazilian attacker Estêvão, and English forward Jamie Gittens. The Premier League runner-up in each of the last three seasons, what Mikel Arteta's team is missing at this point are trophies. The Gunners knocked then-Champions League holders Real Madrid out of Europe's top club tournament last April, snaring a convincing 5-1 aggregate win. The record 15-time European champs are coming off what, by their standards, was a dreadful 2024-25, with no major titles secured. But Los Blancos still boast one of the deepest, most expensive squads on Planet Fútbol. And Kylian Mbappé & Co. are now led by one of the sport's great up-and-coming coaches in former Real Madrid captain Xabi Alonso, who replaced the legendary Carlo Ancelotti in June. City's unprecedented run of four consecutive Premier League titles came to a halt last season, when Pep Guardiola's side finished third, lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace, and were eliminated from European play before the Champions League's round of 16 even began. This team is too good not to bounce back in a big way this year, though — even without club legend Kevin de Bruyne, whose contract wasn't extended. Inter added Croatian midfielder Petar Sučić, Brazilian winger Luis Henrique and French striker Ange-Yoan Bonny this summer. Besides veteran forward Joaquín Correa, their most significant departure is manager Simone Inzaghi, who was replaced by former Inter defender Cristian Chivu in June. Things will be different this year without club legend (and new Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder) Thomas Müller, with Leroy Sané leaving, too. But the $81 million arrival of Colombian winger Luis Díaz from Liverpool will help. Occasionally, Madrid's other team outlasts Spain's double-headed monster. Longtime manager Diego Simeone will be hoping his team is due after a strong summer transfer window which saw $185 million-worth of new talent arrive — including former Villarreal attacker Álex Baena, USMNT midfielder Johnny Cardoso and Argentine World Cup-winner (and Atlanta United alum) Thiago Almada. Scudetto winners in 2023 and 2025, the Neapolitans are no doubt aiming for similar success in European play this season to celebrate the club's centennial. The arrival of Champions League winner Kevin de Bruyne on a free transfer from Manchester City can't hurt. The Magpies eked into the Champions League places last term only because UEFA granted England's top flight one additional spot. Newcastle fans aren't complaining though, though they will be if and when star forward Alexander Isak leaves for Liverpool on the eve of the new season. David replaces Randal Kolo Muani, who returned to PSG upon the completion of his loan, in manager Igor Tudor's lineup. The club that helped develop the all-world likes of Jude Bellingham and Erling Haaland in recent years has a new batch coming through — one led by midfielder Jobe Bellingham, Jude's younger brother. It's hard to believe that the 20-time English champions finished 15th last season, when they also lost the Europa League final to Premier League rivals Tottenham. But the Red Devils added forwards Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Šeško this window, and they should fare better in Ruben Amorim's first full season at the Old Trafford helm. AS Monaco added a few more this summer in former France World Cup winner Paul Pogba and Barcelona loanee Ansu Fati. The loss of star attractions Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong (both to Liverpool) and manager Xabi Alonso (to Real Madrid) hurts. Same for Odilon Kossounou and Granit Xhaka, who also left this summer. They lost Tillman, Lang and others this summer, but having USMNT pair Sergiño Dest and Ricardo Pepi back healthy this season could be a coup for coach Peter Bosz. The Champions League-bound Turkish giants made waves this summer by signing prolific 26-year-old Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli for $87 million on a permanent deal, as well as bringing in German winger Leroy Sané for free from Bayern Munich. The Ligue 1 runner-up to PSG last year and three times overall this decade, Marseille is chasing its first domestic title since 2010. The ambition is there, with L'OM dropping almost $90 million on transfers this summer. Yet two potentially huge contributors came for free: former Arsenal captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and USMNT veteran Tim Weah, who previously won a French title with Lille in 2020-21.
